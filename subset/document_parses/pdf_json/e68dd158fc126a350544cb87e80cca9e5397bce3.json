Recent Findings The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable global impact with over 2.0 million deaths worldwide so far. There has been considerable evidence suggesting that COVID-19 increases the risk of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Summary We propose characterizing ACS patients into 3 distinct categories to better assist in appropriate triage and management: critically ill patients, non-critically ill ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, and non-critically ill non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/unstable angina (UA) patients. We thoroughly review treatments strategies, management considerations, and current consensus statements for the care of COVID-19 patients with ACS. As we continue to gain more experience with management of COVID-19 in ACS patients and as health-care workers and patients continue to get vaccinated, we must continue to adapt our strategies to treat this high-risk group of patients.",

Although primarily causing respiratory distress, our continued understanding of the disease has underscored the significant impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Indeed, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 increases the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Data from a nationwide Danish registry suggested that COVID-19 was associated with a fivefold increase in ACS events in the 14-day period following COVID-19 infection [2] . As cases continue to rise, cardiovascular care presents a challenge in COVID-19 positive patients.",

The SARS-CoV2 infection is caused by the binding of the viral envelope spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While ACE2 receptors are seen in abundance in the alveolar tissue, thus resulting in respiratory symptoms, they are also highly expressed in myocardial tissue and likely play a significant role in COVID-19-related cardiovascular disease. Similar to SARS and MERS, there is an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities [4, 5] . In a meta-analysis of 8 studies from Wuhan, China, comprised of 46,248 patients, the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension and diabetes [6] . When further examining patients with non-severe versus severe COVID-19, cardiovascular disease was significantly more prevalent in patients with severe COVID-19 (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22) [6] . Additionally, many studies have shown that there is a significantly higher mortality in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant cardiovascular disease [7, 8] , with one study of 416 patients from Wuhan, China, reporting as high as 51% mortality in patients with cardiac injury [9] .",

            "text": "The exact incidence of ACS in patients with COVID-19 is not yet fully known. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 era, statistics from Italy and the USA showed up to a 48% decline in the rates of hospitalization of patients with ACS [18, 19] . Despite this, the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests increased during the same time period in Italy [20] and in New York City [21] . Other studies showed that outcomes of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 outbreak were worse than those in pre-COVID-19 times [22] . Using the Universal definition of MI, three types of myocardial infarctions (MI) have been postulated to occur in COVID-19 patients: types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 MI, defined as myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture or erosion, in the setting of COVID-19 is postulated to occur by several mechanisms. At the molecular level, the binding of viral pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) leads to a downstream signaling cascade that ultimately causes destabilization of preexisting atherosclerotic plaques and consequent plaque disruption [23] . Systemic infection and inflammation can contribute to ACS by causing endothelial dysfunction and an imbalance in the neurohormonal milieu in favor of thrombosis, vasospasm, and an increase in coagulation factors such as fibrinogen [24] . Type 2 MI, defined as a myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch [25] , has also been noted in COVID-19 patients. Mechanisms for this type of MI include endothelial dysfunction, ACE2 signaling disruption leading to increased angiotensin II levels and subsequent arteriolar vasoconstriction, and hypoxemia secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [13] . Type 3 MI, in which sudden death occurs with suspicion for MI but without available cardiac biomarkers [25] , is also postulated to occur in COVID-19 patients who had sudden death and known coronary artery disease [13] .",

            "text": "Major cardiovascular societies and experts across the globe have developed treatment recommendations related to COVID-19 and ACS (Table 1) . A common consensus among experts is that in PCI-capable centers, primary PCI remains the ultimate preferred standard of care for acute STEMI in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases when clinical symptoms correlate with classic ECG findings [27] [28] [29] [30] . The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) suggest that in COVID-19 positive patients with STEMI that demonstrate atypical features in either their clinical presentation or ECG, it is reasonable to pursue further investigations (e.g., echocardiogram, serial troponins, and ECGs) prior to deciding on whether to proceed with urgent coronary angiography. Similarly, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus document suggests that primary PCI may be delayed up to 60 min (<120-min goal) in a COVID-19 positive patient presenting with STEMI before considering alternative strategies (i.e., fibrinolysis). All major societies emphasize a robust COVID-19 triaging system that allows for appropriate resource allocation and choice treatment strategy. Herein, we discuss important management considerations in COVID-19 positive patients presenting with ACS.",

All patients, including emergency department, hospitalized, and transferred patients, should undergo a universal screening protocol for COVID-19. Ideally, every patient presenting with ACS should undergo testing for COVID-19; however, this may not always be achievable depending on hospital resources. Notwithstanding, all patients with concerning symptoms should be tested for COVID-19 per the hospital's testing capabilities. Thus, obtaining a thorough history and physical examination to adequately triage patients that may be infected with COVID-19 becomes the critical first step in evaluation. Furthermore, any initial assessment must include a thorough hemodynamic evaluation and electrocardiogram (ECG) review. The extent of myocardial injury can be assessed with serum troponin I levels; however, any plans for emergent reperfusion therapy should not be delayed awaiting troponin levels. Elevated troponin levels have been observed in COVID-19 positive patients, and it is important to differentiate true ACS from other mimickers of myocardial injury [31, 32] .",

[37\u2022\u2022] found that the majority (76%) of these patients received fibrinolytic therapy. Patients' median age was 65 years, and the majority had at least 4 comorbidities with all of them having at least 1 comorbidity. In those that received primary PCI, hypotension requiring vasopressors was noted in over 30% of patients. Additionally, both cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation were needed in over 40% of patients who received primary PCI. These events were observed less frequently in those who received fibrinolytic therapy, which may be due to treatment selection bias with preferential allocation of non-critically ill patients to a fibrinolytic therapy strategy. Most notably, the authors observed a markedly high rate of stent thrombosis (21%) in those treated with PCI. This finding is consistent with the observed increased rate of thrombotic events in patients with severe COVID-19 [38] . However, it is important to note that these retrospective observational data are hardly conclusive, and the actual rates of stent thrombosis need to be confirmed in larger datasets from multiple PCI capable centers [39] . To date, there are no data from randomized controlled trials to support the routine administration of therapeutic anticoagulation to patients with COVID-19 infection; however, observational data suggesting improved clinical outcomes with empiric anticoagulation exist in patients with severe COVID-19 [40] . Additionally, the early administration of the newer generation more potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors (e.g., prasugrel, ticagrelor) as well prolonged infusions of cangrelor or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered after PCI to mitigate the high rates of thrombotic events observed. As we await data from robust clinical trials, it is reasonable to consider extended therapeutic anticoagulation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, especially in those undergoing primary PCI for critically ill STEMI or NSTEMI/UA [41] .",

[42\u2022] analyzed the large ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry in Europe which includes 77 centers in 18 different countries (n = 6 609). When compared to pre-pandemic data, there was a significant reduction in primary PCI observed during the COVID-19 pandemic (incidence rate ratio: 0.811; 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.84; p < 0.0001). The investigators also reported increased total ischemic time and door-to-balloon times in STEMI patients during the pandemic timeframe after adjusting for baseline characteristics (adjusted OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.58; p = 0.001 and 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.29; p = 0.003, respectively). This highlights a potential gap Depending on the hospital infrastructure, it may be reasonable to designate a specific catheterization laboratory specifically for COVID-19 patients to help limit HCWs exposure and expedite delivery of invasive care [43] . Evaluation of a patient's respiratory status, via physical examination and if possible, imaging (i.e., chest Xray or CT scan), should be performed prior to transferring the patient into the catheterization laboratory. If there is concern regarding the patient's respiratory status, intubation should be performed prior to the arrival of the patient to the catheterization laboratory [44] . Patients who are not intubated should be outfitted with a mask to limit exposure of airborne particles. All HCWs present for the case must have appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including facemasks (N95 respirators, or preferably powered air purifying respirators (PAPR)), face-shield or googles for eye protection, and contact isolation gowns [43, 45] . The time limitation for appropriately donning PPE by all HCWs involved in the procedure should be taken into consideration when deciding to proceed with an invasive approach for ACS. Following completion of the procedure, patients should be transferred to postprocedure isolation rooms and a terminal cleaning of the catheterization laboratory should be performed. As such, it may be prudent to perform cases in COVID-19 suspected or positive cases towards the end of the working day, if feasible [43] . A summary of these recommendations can be found in Table 2 .",

In these non-critically ill patients with STEMI, the overall clinical status of the patient must be carefully balanced against the potential exposure risk to HCWs and predicted clinical benefit to the patient [43, 46] . In patients who are hemodynamically stable with suspected or positive test for COVID-19 and in patients in whom the risks of proceeding with an invasive approach outweigh its benefits or when primary PCI is not expected to be delivered in a timely manner (<120 min door-to-balloon time), it is appropriate to consider fibrinolytic therapy, in isolation or possibly as part of a pharmaco-invasive approach [32, 43, 47, 48] . A pharmaco-invasive approach would entail referral to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for PCI within 3-24 h after successful reperfusion (at which time testing for COVID-19 and appropriate precautionary measures to minimize HCW exposure are undertaken). A pharmacoinvasive strategy usually reduces recurrent ischemia and myocardial infarction in high-risk STEMI patients compared to a strategy of fibrinolytic therapy alone.",

Fibrinolytic therapy can be a viable alternative in patients who present early (within 2-3 h of symptom onset), are hemodynamically stable, and are suspected to have COVID-19. When choosing fibrinolytic therapy, it is preferred that the newer generation tenecteplase (TNK) is utilized, as it has been shown to have lower non-cerebral bleeding rates when compared to alteplase and is easier to administer (a weight-based bolus injection) [50] . Given the time sensitive nature of myocardial ischemia, [33] . Most importantly, the use of fibrinolytics has the potential to limit HCW exposure to COVID-19 and allow time to better evaluate the patient for COVID-19 with significantly reduced risks. Absolute and relative contradictions to fibrinolytics should be reviewed prior to their administrations (Table 3 ) [51] . Notably, there is a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy versus PCI [52] . In certain patients with ACS mimickers (e.g., myocarditis, coronary spasm, cardiomyopathy) but not true ACS, the administration of fibrinolytics results in increased bleeding risk without benefit. Fibrinolytic therapy should therefore be used judiciously.",

In general, all patients should be presumed to be COVID-19 positive prior to any testing, given that a significant number of individuals with COVID-19 are asymptomatic [53] . Previous studies have shown that in high-and moderate-risk patients with non-STelevation ACS, an invasive strategy is superior to an ischemiaguided approach, and reduces the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction [54] . In low-risk patients, an ischemia-guided approach is acceptable, and patients may cross over to an invasive strategy in case of significant spontaneous or inducible ischemia. Risk stratification can be performed using validated objective risk scores such as the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) or TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) risks score. Further evaluation of patients with noninvasive testing such as echocardiography may help delineate high-risk (e.g., large myocardium in jeopardy, severe LV dysfunction, severe diastolic dysfunction) from low-risk patients [43, 47] . In patients with high-risk features (e.g., dynamic ECG changes, rising troponin biomarkers) and those with elevated risk scores (e.g., GRACE score > 140, or TIMI score \u2265 5), an early invasive strategy within 12-24 h is recommended [34] (Fig. 3) . In patients who develops signs of critical illness (e.g., refractory ischemic symptoms, hemodynamic or electrical instability), an immediate invasive strategy (within \u2264 2 h) should be pursued. In the COVID-19 era, it may be reasonable to employ an ischemia-guided strategy to patients determined to be at lowor moderate-risk, in whom aggressive implementation of guideline-directed medical therapies is advocated. Coronary angiography with intent to revascularize may be reserved, in the COVID-19 era, to patients at high-risk and to those who cannot be clinically stabilized [34] . Optimal medical therapy in non-PCI-treated patient may include the use of dual antiplatelet therapy-aspirin, a P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor)-and a single anticoagulant (e.g., unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux) [34] .",

In patients with STEMI or NSTEMI with very high-risk features (e.g., shock, ongoing ischemia, malignant arrhythmias), emergent PCI remains the treatment of choice. However, it is reasonable to consider fibrinolytic therapy in early presenters (within 2-3 h of symptom onset) with STEMI who are clinically stable. In low-and moderate-risk patients with NSTEMI or UA, an upfront ischemia-guided approach with guideline-directed medical therapies is reasonable, with the option for pursuing PCI based on patient stability and recurrence of ischemia. As the health-care community continues to gain more experience managing ACS in COVID-19 patients and HCWs become vaccinated, we must evolve our practices to improve survival and quality of care for our patients while maintaining protocols to limit resource utilization and protect our HCWs.",
