However, the patients we describe in this paper showed evidence of intestinal ischemia that did not correspond to the typical presentation of either of these entities intra-operatively. During operation, one patient had a single short segment of ischemia in the mid-ileum while her sister had two short segments in the proximal as well as the mid-ileum. This finding would be quite unusual for either NEC or SIP in ischemia length and location. Our intra-operative findings lead us to wonder whether maternal COVID19 infection during pregnancy might lead to unique patterns of intestinal ischemia and necrosis.",

In addition to hypercoagulability, SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to affect the vascular system, probably due to the role the spike protein plays in damaging the vascular endothelial cells, which can lead to vasculitis with possible resulting intestinal complications [20] .",

Therefore, it is certainly possible that these cases might actually be similar to the perforation pattern demonstrated in our patients.
