            "text": "Many countries are using digital contact tracing to help contain COVID-19's spread. Among various available techniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal strength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered a smaller privacy risk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS, cellular tower history, or QR-code scanning. Approximately half a year after WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, there have been millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contact-tracing apps as more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of these apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical research that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to fill that gap by empirically investigating the effectiveness of Bluetooth-based decentralized contact tracing (BDCT) in crowd environments with a total of 80 participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in especially crowded environments. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most needed, and it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover, technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users' willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events; for example, proximity of up to 20m lasting one hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that existing BDCT apps can be repurposed to focus on coarse-grained proximity detection, and future apps may calibrate distance estimates and adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.",

In Phase 1, we will examine whether Bluetooth RSSI can reliably predict distance in a controlled experimental setting. In Phase 2, based on estimated distances between pairs of participants' phones over time, we compare detected proximity and contact events in a semi-controlled event: a real-world academic gathering, the ground truth of which will be carefully recorded. We recruited a total of 80 participants to use one Bluetooth-based contact-tracing app, which we modified from Covid-Watch- TCN [8] , in our controlled and semi-controlled settings. Our modifications allowed us to collect ground-truth data and the phones' usage logs. After both experimental phases were completed, we also conducted a follow-up survey with participants to enrich the data we had already obtained. This paper will address the following questions:",

This implies that this technique may be least useful when it is most needed, and fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Specifically, the app failed to capture the majority of proximity events: only 16 out of 67 (24%) proximity events were detected by the app when setting a 2-meter distance threshold; only 19 out of 67 (28%) were detected even when no distance threshold was set. In terms of user experience and perceptions, technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused by the app were found to negatively influence users' willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, the app captured 63% of contacts lasting one hour in a room containing 50 participants and more than 150 other people. Divided by operating system, 80% of Android devices were able to be discovered by both nearby Android and iOS devices in about an hour. This implies that this technique may still be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events; for example, contacts within 20m that last for at least an hour. The sampled phone users said they were more willing to use the similar apps 1) when in crowded environments and 2) while contact tracers from health departments were also using them.",

When this happens, the exported dataset is first redacted to ensure privacy, and then is broadcast to other users to allow them to self-determine their likelihood of having been exposed. Rather than capturing and storing route information, DP3T and Covid-Watch continuously broadcast anonymized tokens, which will only be published in the event of a positive diagnosis.

TraceSecure, on the other hand, incorporates a public-key-based security protocol for message exchange and storage. An optional homomorphic encryption scheme can be used to further enhance data protection. While this cryptographic-based approach guarantees better privacy than the decentralized one, it is less deployable on consumer devices and existing infrastructure.",

Early implementations such as the DP3T project and Covid-Watch had to confront Bluetooth interoperability issues between the two major mobile platforms, iOS and Android. In April 2020, the two major smartphone OS providers, Apple and Google, announced that they had formed a coalition to release APIs that would help contact-tracing apps work across iOS and Android devices, with the first such APIs appearing the following month [13] . Android version 6.0 and iOS 13.7 and higher have supported the fundamental functions of Bluetooth contact tracing, including broadcasting and listening to tokens, at the OS level. To prevent abuse of these APIs, the companies restricted each country to one official app. An increasing number of national projects have adopted the GAEN APIs, including Switzerland's SwissCOVID, Italy's Immuni, and Germany's Corona-Warn-App. Since our use of it in our experiments, Covid-Watch has also now switched to using the GAEN APIs. We plan to use our proposed methodology to evaluate GAEN-API-based apps once the GAEN APIs are enabled in Taiwan.",

BlindSignedIDs reduce storage requirements by more than 90% and are demonstrated effective in mitigating gigabyte-level DoS attacks. Privacy concerns Tracing contacts by accessing devices' relative locations (e.g., using Bluetooth signal reception) is considered more protective of user privacy than capturing absolute locations (e.g., via GPS) [21, 22] . Several prior studies have investigated privacy threats such as replay attacks and de-anonymization attacks by state-level or resourceful adversaries [23, 24] , or have proposed advanced cryptographic solutions to enhance privacy [25] . While detailed privacy concerns are beyond the scope of our empirical study, we feel it should be noted that privacy enhancement beyond a certain level is likely to degrade the detection accuracy and other aspects of the performance of contact-tracing apps. Our methodology and protocols used in this study will be useful in assessing whether the negative performance impacts of future privacy-enhancement efforts outweigh their benefits.",

Indoor positioning applications have improved estimation accuracy through trilateration (using multiple referenced sending devices at known positions), incorporating floor maps, or training position-dependent signal attenuation models. Some have proposed augmenting Bluetooth with other sensors to improve accuracy [27] . However, these improvements may be difficult to apply to BDCT because they will require national-scale referenced device deployment, indoor mapping, or modeling. Moreover, BDCT and other Bluetooth-based applications consider different settings. For example, in BDCT, every user's phone is both sending and receiving, thus more likely to saturate wireless channels than indoor positioning (which requires only one or a few sending devices present in a room). Therefore, a thorough evaluation is required to understand BDCT's limitations and possibilities.",

The UK, for instance, planned to launch a coronavirus app that enables users to report symptoms and book tests, but does not allow contact tracing [43] . In Canada, Manitoba's chief public health officer declared that the contact-tracing app \"will not replace public health's ability to contact trace\", although the other four provinces have adopted such an app [44] . Several large-scale questionnaire surveys have been conducted to capture phone users' general perceptions toward contact-tracing mobile apps. A multi-country survey of Europe and North America has shown high user acceptance of downloading such apps (74.8%) [45] . However, the results of another survey, conducted in the U.S., suggest that support for the policy of encouraging use of these apps is relatively weak (42%), as compared to traditional measures; but also that the implementation of decentralized data storage helps increase acceptance [46] . According to a UK survey, 67.2% of those who are unwilling to participate in app-based contact tracing considered privacy concerns the main reason [47] . A team in Jordan, meanwhile, reported that 71.6% of their respondents accepted the use of contact-tracing technology, but only 37.8% actually used it [48] . Additionally, a German team found that factors such as age, gender, education, and income could influence the download and use of contact-tracing apps [49] . It is noteworthy, therefore, that all of the respondents to our post-study survey had actually experienced using such an app, and were thus able to provide meaningful, app-specific answers about their usage experience and privacy perceptions.",

The other two sessions in the indoor scenario required the participants to stand still in a jammed environment characterized by continuous sending of useless data by Bluetooth beacons (Session 2), and near a wall that divided the participants into two groups (Session 5). To set up the jammed environment, we placed six RaspberryPi 3 model b devices in the same room. Each of these devices emitted unique, useless data via Bluetooth every 20 ms, i.e., five times faster than a normal device.

Therefore, they rely on Android devices as a relay to broadcast Bluetooth packets when running in the background. On the other hand, iOS devices running the app in the foreground exchange Bluetooth packets with one another directly. Due to the iOS Bluetooth platform's reliance on relays from other devices, its RSSI and estimated-distance information cannot represent actual values. Therefore, we chose to focus only on directly transmitted tokens, i.e., Android-to-Android or Android-to-iOS, in our further analysis. Figure 4 illustrates the relationships of the estimated and true distances between each sender-receiver pair of Android devices in Session 1. In that session, the participants stood still in an indoor environment, and within each task were 0.5d, 1d, or 1.5d apart. The standard deviation of the estimated distance increased as the true distance increased, suggesting that Bluetooth signals attenuate during transmission and become more easily influenced by radio noise. The correlation coefficient between true distance and estimated distance is 0.68. Figure 5 also indicates that the app tended to underestimate the distance between devices when the receiver was an Android one, potentially leading to high numbers of false-positive results. When the receiver was an iOS device, in contrast, the app tended to overestimate the distance, potentially leading to high numbers of false negatives.",

By applying a Wilcoxon Rank Test with \u03b1 = 0.05, we confirm that the estimation errors across these two types of settings were drawn from two non-distinguishable distributions, implying that jamming did affect the app's ability to estimate distance. Even the app itself became a source of noise when a large number of app users were gathered in the same place. Tasks 7-9 can be seen as more \"noisy\" conditions than Tasks 1-3, i.e., with 16 iOS devices placed between each pair of Android devices.
