In these circumstances, healthcare rationing is unavoidable. It is important in any healthcare rationing process that the interests of the community are recognised, and that decision-making upholds these interests through a fair and consistent process of decision-making. Responding to recent calls (1) to safeguard individuals' legal rights in decision-making in intensive care, and (2) for new authoritative national guidance for decision-making, this paper seeks to clarify what consistency and fairness demand in healthcare rationing during the COVID-19 pandemic, from both a legal and ethical standpoint. The paper begins with a brief review of UK law concerning healthcare resource allocation, considering how community interests and individual rights have been marshalled in judicial deliberation about the use of limited health resources within the National Health Service (NHS). It is then argued that an important distinction needs to be drawn between procedural and outcome consistency, and that a procedurally consistent decision-making process ought to be favoured. Congruent with the position that UK courts have adopted for resource allocation decision-making in the NHS more generally, specific requirements for a procedural framework and substantive triage criteria to be applied within that framework during the COVID-19 pandemic are considered in detail.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has made these questions pressing, and across the world much attention has been paid to the actual decisions that doctors are expected to make. As of May 2020, professional bodies have invested much effort in generating guidance of various forms on how these decisions should be made-in almost all cases the guidance seems to permit unpalatable decisions about who gets treatment. 1 2 As we write, the UK is coping with the additional demands placed on it without extensive rationing of ventilators or intensive care beds. However, the experience clearly highlights the need for more systematic responses associated with the need to prioritise and deprioritise a wide range of interventions during the pandemic.",

            "text": "COVID-19 has provoked two main responses from ethicists and lawyers concerned with medical decision-making. For some, emerging and broad ethical guidance produced by professional bodies does not go far enough. What is needed, so the claim goes, is overarching, national guidance from government that commands authority and ensures consistent, fair decision-making. 3 4 For others, the response to the guidance produced has been the assertion of individual rights against rationing, warning that any compromise of normal treatment is vulnerable to legal challenge, and should be undertaken with caution for fear of overlooking patients' rights. 5 We take issue with both these views. Rationing decisions should certainly not be ad hoc, but an individual's 'right to treatment' has meaning only in the context of the community in which rights are valued. Indeed, an overly 'individualistic' approach to rights damages health. Healthcare rights may be imprecise and come into conflict, but they never contradict community interests. This is because rights always belong within the scope of things that are of value for the community that recognises them. In this sense, because the protection of individual rights matters for the community, it is in the interests of the community to safeguard them in a way that is consistent with other things that are of value. 6 7 This pandemic provides an opportunity to rebalance the debate about healthcare rationing generally, as well as how notions of authority and fairness in decision-making concerning the use of resources in the National Health Service (NHS) ought to be configured. 8 Our starting point, therefore, is 'community', properly understood. We reject the notion that individual rights have some special status independent of the community in which they are recognised. [9] [10] [11] We argue that in law and ethics the fundamental objective of any decision to ration health resources is to serve the best interests of the community as a whole by responding to patients fairly, equally and consistently. In order to do this, group interests need to be balanced against the interests of specific individuals. Rights are not overlooked by balancing the needs of those already in intensive care with those awaiting admission because of capacity constraints, but it is crucial to be clear about how this process of balancing is achieved.",

It demands that public authorities consider all the relevant factors, including the resources available. This explains why a procedural framework is so crucial to this process (see ref 14).

In N v ACCG, 19 the applicant family sought the resources necessary to be trained as carers providing round-theclock care for their disabled son at home. It might have been in his best interests (or not), but the clinical commissioning group (CCG) could not afford to adopt such a policy for everyone and refused the request. The parents' application was refused. Such a decision involves issues of affordability and the interests of other patients unknown to the court. For this reason, this was not a decision for judges. Resource allocation is for the CCG. At paras 35- These principles bear on the crisis produced by COVID-19 in the UK. In this national context, individual rights can be understood only within the constraints on public resources. In extreme cases, resources may be withdrawn from one patient to divert treatment to others. This decision rests with the public authority, not the court. The attraction of consistency should not encourage triage criteria to undervalue (say) elderly patients as a group, or patients with disabilities. Our individual needs and circumstances must be balanced with those of others without prejudgement by 'group-stereotyping'. Nevertheless, provided the process balances the relevant circumstances fairly and proportionately and with proper regard for equality and human rights, the decision will be upheld. 20 The challenge, therefore, is to understand how to guarantee that these difficult and unenviable decisions respond fairly, equally and consistently to patients. This is the purpose of the procedural framework which we outline below.",

Yet others may favour the first in the queue, or some over others (eg, clinicians, care workers or delivery drivers), or disfavour patients over a certain age. Still others may adopt a provisional Hippocratic approach unless and until they are given clear instructions to the contrary by their hospital employer. Importantly each of these variations represents distinctive but nevertheless reasonable interpretations of what it means to be a clinician and perform the professional role of the doctor. These different views may represent what individual clinicians take to lie at the very heart of what it is to be a doctor.",

Until that time, however, we note that priority setting decisions within CCGs have never had the benefit of overarching national guidance because the government has taken the view that local decision-makers are best able to respond to local needs. Instead, judicial review has clarified how local decisionmakers should introduce fair and consistent procedures to be legally defensible. What is essential is for a framework to spell out which values are to be considered in funding decisions and how they are to be considered in ways that are fair, rational and consistent. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] It is helpful, in this context, to distinguish procedural and outcome consistency. 26 Understandably, both patients and clinicians find appeal in the idea of outcome consistency: guidance that operated in this way would enable people to know where they stand, in advance of the decision being made. An algorithmic or formula-based decision-making process that sought to crunch the relevant values and facts would likely lie at the heart of guidance of this kind. One reason that people find this appealing might lie in the fact that providing a kind of metric or formula makes hugely difficult problems seem more manageable. But of course, such an approach disguises the difficulty and hides it behind the algorithm so that we may be encouraged to expect outcome consistency in circumstances where it is impossible to achieve.",

Procedural consistency means accepting that a consistent process can give rise to different and so seemingly inconsistent outcomes: we might reasonably differ about whether a person should be allocated an intensive care bed or a ventilator when we have balanced all the relevant factors in this judgement.

This will promote procedural consistency in the decision-making process. Further, as hospitals seek to coordinate their activities with one another at regional level, this internal hospital system should be reviewed regionally, to ensure that the requirements of consistency are met. Admittedly, this process diverts senior doctors from treating patients. It will be time consuming and emotionally draining. There is a difficult balance between providing reasonable procedural overview and letting doctors do their job.

            "text": "How generic or patient specific then should the criteria be? The Belgian Society of Intensive Care recommended that elderly residents in retirement homes should not normally be admitted to intensive care because it would be 'disproportionate'. 32 This seems a very broad criterion. Many dependent residents retain significant independence and require limited care. It might be criticised for failing to consider the circumstances of individuals. An analogous concern was raised in March 2020, when NICE recommended use of the Clinical Frailty Score (of 1-9). The recommendation was criticised by MENCAP and other non-governmental bodies for being too generic. Shortly afterwards, NICE acknowledged it had failed to indicate that not all patients on the same point of the frailty scale were the same. For example, those with stable mental illness should not be considered the same as dependent adults whose conditions were deteriorating. 33 So, should clinical triage criteria be more patient specific? The Pittsburgh Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scoring system attempts to achieve this by putting numbers against particular conditions (on a scale of 1-8, with the most severely ill patients scoring the highest number). 34 The express aim is to exclude some patients in order to admit others and promote the survival of the greatest number. Those with comorbidity likely to end their lives within 1 year are scored more highly than those likely to live for a further 10 years. This scoring system is helpful as a general guide to distinguish classes of patients, but how far can it take us towards distinguishing at the level of individual patients? Bear in mind a number of variables, for example, patients often present with a mixture of comorbidities, some more severe, others less. Say we suffer a combination of diabetes, hypertension, obesity and heart disease. Comparing one patient to another on a standard scale is unlikely to capture the subtle differences of clinical condition between us. Second, different doctors may assess the prognosis and diagnosis of the same patient differently. Third, the availability of intensive care beds may vary from time to time so that even patients with identical scores may not receive identical care at different points in time. Finally, getting clear guidance from patients themselves about their own wishes may be extremely difficult. Thus, the unique nature of individual circumstances limits the reach of scoring systems in any defensible procedural framework. Indeed, it is misleading to suggest they provide an 'objective' decision-making tool or algorithm at the level of individual patients. Uncertainty and disagreement between doctors are inevitable and reasonable discretion within the familiar Bolam 35 test is always likely to play a role. i Where is the balance between systems which are too generic and those so precise as to camouflage reality? There are compromises to be made all along the spectrum. An alternative approach is not to use numbers but, instead, to place patients into broad categories, perhaps based around high, medium and low priority. ii At highest priority would be those with the highest probability of making a rapid recovery. Low priority is given to patients with the lowest probability of doing so. Priority is given to patients according to their capacity to recover and the speed with which they are likely to do so. On this view, patients are not assigned a 'score'-this is not an algorithm. Instead, doctors are responsible for applying flexible criteria within their own reasonable clinical discretion, together with their triage teams and coordinators, in the light of each patient's individual circumstances and the resources available. The advantage of such a system is that it does not promise more 'objectivity' in the selection criteria than can be delivered; it does not promise, in advance of the actual context, more determination than is possible or ethically justifiable. It goes without saying that proper records of every such decision must be maintained so that we can understand how and why each decision was made. 36 Opinions will differ as to which model is most helpful. On the one hand, too much flexibility may compromise the possibility of invoking a consistent process; and on the other, highly detailed scoring systems may disguise the reality of the need to make judgements in context which interweave ethical value and clinical experience. Whichever is preferred, it must be based on candour and trust between clinicians and their patients and this merits further discussion.",
