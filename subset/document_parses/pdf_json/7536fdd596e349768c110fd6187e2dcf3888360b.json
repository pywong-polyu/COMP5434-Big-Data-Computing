Receptors with binding specificity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on AT2 cells and hepatocytes were identified. Methods: The specific binding of biotinylated spike and spike 1 proteins to undifferentiated human E12 MLPC (E12), E12 differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and E12 human hepatocyte-like hybrid cells (HLC) was studied by confocal microscopy. We investigated the expression of ACE-2, binding of biotinylated spike protein, biotinylated spike 1 and inhibition of binding by unlabeled spike protein, two neutralizing antibodies and an antibody directed against the hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGr1). Results: E12 MLPC did not express ACE-2 and did not bind either of spike or spike 1 proteins. AT2-like cells expressed ACE-2 and bound both spike and spike 1. Both PHH and HLC did not express ACE-2 and did not bind spike 1 protein. However, both PHH and HLC actively bound the spike protein. Biotinylated spike protein binding was inhibited by unlabeled spike but not spike 1 protein on PHH and HLC. Two commercial neutralizing antibodies blocked the binding of the spike to PHH and HLC but only one blocked binding to AT2. An antibody to the hepatocyte ASGr1 blocked the binding of the spike protein to PHH and HLC. Conclusion: The absence of ACE-2 receptors and inhibition of spike binding by an antibody to the ASGr1 on both PHH and HLC suggested that the spike protein interacts with the ASGr1. The differential antibody blocking of spike binding to AT2, PHH and HLC indicated that neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 binding might involve additional mechanisms beyond RBD binding to ACE-2.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic and its damaging effects on both health and economics worldwide. Transmission and pathology of the virus appears to be mediated through the respiratory system via interaction of the viral spike protein with the ACE-2 receptor 1-3 differentially presented on various cells within the respiratory system. 4, 5 Expression of ACE-2 has been reported on lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, circulatory endothelial cells, arterial smooth muscle cells, 6 adipose tissue, bone marrow, duodenum, endometrium, heart, kidney, testis, and thyroid 7 suggesting a potential direct effect of COVID-19 on those tissues. Additionally, infection with COVID-19 has been associated with significant liver injuries and altered liver function tests. 8 Alterations in liver function have been attributed to secondary effects of cytokine cascade, hypoxia, underlying liver disease, [9] [10] [11] or infection of ACE-2 positive cholangiocytes. 12 There have also been reports of coronavirus particles in hepatocytes without a defined mechanism for infection. 13 In a recent report studying the receptome of spike binding, ACE-2 was confirmed as the primary receptor for the spike protein via the binding domain (RBD) on the spike 1 portion of the molecule and the N-terminaldomain as the sites critical for virus-host interaction. 14 Additionally, the report described binding of the spike protein with ectopically expressed ASGR1 and KREMEN1 in transfected non-liver cells. The results strongly suggested the existence of additional entry points into cells for the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the spike protein.",

The E12/PHH fusion cells (HLC) expressed the characteristics of fully mature and highly differentiated hepatocytes. 15 This report studied the interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with potential receptors on human cord blood-derived MLPC differentiated AT2, HLC and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) by confocal analysis. The characteristics of spike protein binding were examined using biotinylated spike proteins and blockade of binding by un-labeled spike proteins, spike protein-directed neutralizing antibodies and an antibody directed against the hepatocyte surface membrane asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGr1). The results suggested that binding and inhibition analyses can be used to assess the potential mechanisms of viral host cell interactions with a myriad of different target cells in the body, but also to assess therapeutics designed to inhibit that binding.",

Cells were cultured in MSCGM until 80-90% of cells had a fibroblastic morphology. These cells were transfected with the gene for TERT, as previously described 15 and were cloned by limited dilution. The E12 clone was selected for both immortality and differentiating potential. The E12 MLPC, expanded and cryopreserved for over 14 years, were used as undifferentiated control cells and as the source of cells for the development of the AT2-like cells and the fusion partner in the development of MLPC/hepatocyte hybrid cells. 15 For confocal analysis, E12 cells (10 6 /mL in MSCGM, 200 \u03bcL per well) were plated in non-coated 16 well chamber slides (Nalge, Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and allowed to attach overnight before use in the analysis. AT2-like cells were developed from the differentiation of E12 MLPC. Briefly, E12 cells (3 x 10 5 cells/mL) in MSCGM were added to non-coated tissue culture vessels and allowed to attach overnight.

These results were identical to primary small airway epithelial cells. The binding of biotinylated spike proteins and specific blocking by unlabeled protein and neutralizing antibodies confirmed that the primary interaction of spike protein with AT2-like cells and primary small airway epithelial cells was via the S1 portion of the protein with the ACE-2 receptor. We repeated those studies in support of our findings with the HLC and PHH. The differential inhibition of spike protein binding with two different antibodies suggested that viral neutralization could result from mechanisms other than direct inhibition of S1 (RBD) binding to ACE-2. Figures (A and E) confocals show the inability of a 5 molar excess of unlabeled spike 1 protein to block the binding of biotinylated spike protein. Figures (B and F) show inhibition of binding of biotinylated spike protein by neutralizing antibody from ACROBiosystems. Figures (C and G) show binding inhibition of biotinylated spike protein by neutralizing antibody from Novatein Bio. Figures (D and H) The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with hepatocytes were studied by observing the binding of biotinylated spike (RBD) and spike 1 proteins to HLC and PHH using the undifferentiated E12 as a known negative control. It was observed that HLC and PHH were both negative for ACE-2, precluding that as a potential site of viral binding. This was confirmed by the inability of the cells to bind S1 protein. The binding of biotinylated spike protein and blockade by unlabeled spike protein on HLC and PHH suggested that the binding was specific, and via a mechanism distinct from ACE-2. The complete inhibition of spike binding by an antibody directed against the ASGr1 is strongly suggestive that ASGr1 is a binding site for the spike protein on hepatocytes. Interestingly, blockade of spike binding by both neutralizing antibodies on HLC and PHH was distinct from AT2 cells where inhibition occurred solely with the antibody that was directed against the RBD. This is suggestive of neutralizing activity that can occur outside the RBD.",

The availability of immortalized cells with the stable characteristics of human alveolar type 2 cells and mature welldifferentiated hepatocytes could provide an accurate and reproducible tool to effectively study the various virus-host interactions via spike proteins by providing potential viral receptors that are segregated according to cell type.
