Such treatments will take time to develop and become available for widespread use. In the interim, there has been increasing interest in the use of existing medications to treat COVID-19, including CQ and HCQ. CQ was first used as prophylaxis and treatment for malaria. HCQ is a more soluble and less toxic metabolite of CQ. It causes fewer side effects and is therefore considered safer than CQ. [2] [3] [4] The antiviral properties of both medications have been researched in recent years. CQ and HCQ have been used in the treatment of HIV with mixed results. 5 The ability of these drugs to inhibit other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, has been explored with promising results. 6, 7 There are a number of theories to explain the potential mechanism of action of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. The virus is believed to upregulate cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 8 binding to this enzyme in order to facilitate host cell entry. 9 CQ may reduce glycosylation of ACE2, thus preventing this attachment process. 10 Another potential mechanism involves the inhibition of viral release into the intracellular space. Within the host cell, the virus is surrounded by a cell-membrane derived vesicle -the endosome -within which the virus replicates. 11 CQ is believed to accumulate in lysosomes, which may interrupt the usual process of lysosome-endosome fusion, thereby inhibiting release of the viral contents. 11, 12 Moreover, CQ may also block the production of interleukin-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines, which are key mediators of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 11 Both drugs are affordable, widely available internationally, and are generally considered safe for their present US Food and Drug (FDA)-approved indications. However, these drugs have been incorporated into some national guidelines to treat COVID-19 in certain situations, despite a lack of rigorous clinical trial evidence of effectiveness. 13, 14 Furthermore, while generally considered safe, there are potential risks associated with taking these medications. Across the world there have been several reports of overdoses in people self-medicating with CQ during the current pandemic. 15, 16 There is therefore an urgent need to determine the safety and efficacy of these drugs for treating COVID-19, in order to guide international efforts to contain the pandemic. The aim of this rapid review is therefore to provide a timely summary of the evidence to date for the safety and effectiveness of CQ/HCQ as COVID-19 treatments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 94, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 608, "end": 611, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 612, "end": 615, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 616, "end": 619, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 773, "end": 774, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 896, "end": 898, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 899, "end": 900, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1097, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1162, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1243, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1640, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1643, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1814, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2160, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2163, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2403, "end": 2406, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2409, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar on 21 March 2020 using the search terms *chloroquine, coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, 2019-NCov, and COVID-19.

They reported a positive signal from the results of treating more than 100 patients with CQ in China, reportedly reducing the duration of illness, and improving COVID pneumonia and appearances on chest imaging. 20 No adverse events were reported. These findings seem to be the combination of results from a number of ongoing clinical trials in different sites in China, using a variety of study protocols. No empirical data supporting these findings have been published thus far, and the evidence has therefore not been peer reviewed. The first empirical data from a clinical trial was published on the 6 March 2020 by Chen and colleagues from Shanghai, China. 21 They conducted a randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of HCQ in 30 adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19.
