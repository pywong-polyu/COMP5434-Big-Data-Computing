            "text": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is one of the most common forms of violence against women and includes physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and controlling behaviours by an intimate partner [1] [2] [3] . Globally, it is estimated that at least 30% of women who have had an intimate relationship have been victims of physical and/or sexual violence by their partner or former partner, psychological abuse being the most frequent type of violence [3] [4] [5] . Due to its magnitude, and because of the severe consequences for women's and their children's health, it is deemed a first-order public health issue [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, although there are few data, reports from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain, indicate that the number of IPV cases reported, the number of victims requesting help, and the severity of injuries have increased since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 10, 11] . The public health, economic, and social crisis derived from the current pandemic has led to women not resorting to health services until the final stages in the cycle of abuse, exposing them to a higher risk of IPV [10, 12, 13] . This reality has raised concern in several organisations, civil society representatives, and researchers, who have reasserted the need for effective intervention to prevent and fight such a phenomenon [14] . This is why identifying practices related to IPV screening and associated factors in different contexts is essential in order to develop practical and useful guidelines and principles applicable in the healthcare environment [15, 16] .",

Moreover, those who screen positive for IPV tests are more likely to experience some episode in the following months [15] . However, although healthcare professionals are acknowledged as essential pillars when addressing this serious problem [4, 14] , available evidence as to whether they should perform a universal screening for IPV applied to all women is controversial. O'Doherty et al., after a systematic review and a meta-analysis, concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend it, since, although the identification of cases has moderately increased, with respect to actual prevalence, it does not improve referrals to support services or women's health results [21, 22] . Nevertheless, other authors are in favour of such screening since they understand that women who are victims/survivors are provided with more benefits than disadvantages, especially in the emergency department [15, [23] [24] [25] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that healthcare services should not apply a universal screening method or a routing enquiry method in order to identify women who have been abused. However, it does encourage healthcare providers to talk about this issue with every woman showing injuries or disorders that may be related to it [26] .",

It has even been reported that many women who are murdered by their partners/former partners had resorted to emergency services [31] . That is why they constitute a privileged attention unit, not only to treat any possible injuries, but also to actually help victims minimise their exposure to abuse, or even to get out of such situation [15, 35] . However, the efficacy of emergency services in the detection of IPV cases, particularly during the current health crisis, and of the factors associated with detection by healthcare professionals, including opinions on sexist myths, requires further research [53, 54] . Our hypothesis is that professionals showing favourable opinions on certain false beliefs or sexist myths perform a lower detection of IPV cases in emergency services. The purposes of this study were to analyse the capacity to detect IPV of healthcare professionals working in the emergency department in the capital city of Granada (Spain), and to identify the associated factors, and the mediating effect of opinions on certain sexist myths, in the detection of cases.",

The original instrument was created with the aim of assessing the education level, knowledge, opinions, and perceptions of the quality of performance of physicians with respect to IPV cases [60] . Opinions on IPV were configured through individual questions regarding attitudes and beliefs [60] . The Spanish version has shown appropriate internal validity, high reliability, and predictive capacity to assess the level of implication and participation in IPV cases by primary healthcare professionals [61] , and which is now applied in the emergency environment. It is formed by 64 items divided into four sections: respondent profile, knowledge, opinions, and practices. There are eight factors in the opinion scale: opinion on team training, opinion on legal requirements, opinion on self-efficacy, opinion on alcohol and drug use, opinion on victims' autonomy/understanding, opinion on the capacity to deal with IPV, opinion on barriers to IPV management, and opinion on the easiness related to the facilities in order to deal with IPV [55] . From the whole questionnaire, we selected 20 items from the following sections to reach the goals of this study, and whose 12 final variables are summarised in Table 1: (a) Respondent profile: Gathers demographic and employment information and the type of training received on IPV of each participant (five items). Age and years of experience in the emergency department (quantitative) were later dichotomised, taking the median score as the cut-off point. (b) Knowledge: Enquires about the knowledge stated by healthcare professionals on IPV causes related to victims and batterers (two items). Later, a new variable was generated, real knowledge, by adding the correct answers to previous questions (gender/female + they use violence as a means of controlling their partners). (c) Opinions: We selected three opinion scales from the survey regarding women who experience IPV that are related to sexist myths: victim understanding (six items), alcohol/drug abuse (three items), and constraints perceived by healthcare professionals (two items) (Cronbach's alpha = 0.72). The victim understanding scale was mainly constructed based on the opinions regarding women being responsible for not leaving a violent relationship and feeling offended if asked about IPV. In the case of the alcohol and drugs scale, it is focused on the idea that the use of such substances is the main cause of IPV. Eventually, the constraint scale considers that professionals do not have enough time to treat IPV, thus deriving responsibility to the institution. The items forming these scales are scored according to a Likert scale from 1 to 7, with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = totally agree. Since some items are written in negative terms on purpose, they were inversely codified for their analysis, following the directions of the original survey's creators [60] . Later, the scale scores were cut off, generating new dichotomous variables: unfavourable opinions (scores from 1 to 3) and favourable opinions (scores from 4 to 7) (three variables). (d) Practices: Assesses the detection of IPV cases by healthcare staff in the past six months and the screening type (two items). A pilot test of the survey used in this study was carried out with 30 emergency department professionals (11 physicians and 19 nurses) who were requested to complete the survey (included in the final study) and to make voluntary qualitative comments on it. All participants indicated that the items were easily readable and understandable, although some questions were too specific to be applied in emergency services, but all of them considered them relevant. Exclusion criteria for participation in the research were not applied, since the intent was that it could reach everyone. The data were entered into an Excel database specifically designed for this study, and it was later exported to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) programme, version 2, for Mac (IBM, New York, NY, USA).",

Later, three multivariate logistic regression models were designed for the detection of IPV cases in the past six months, considering sociodemographic (sex, age, and professional category), employment, training, and real knowledge variables, and each dichotomised opinion scale (unfavourable opinions/favourable opinions). Thus, model 1 takes the victim understanding scale opinions into account; model 2, the alcohol/drug abuse scale; model 3, the constraint scale, together with the remaining variables under consideration. The adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals are calculated at 95%, taking those who showed favourable opinions about said myths as a reference group. ",

Finally, 16 surveys were dismissed for including over 20% incomplete items, so 164 were analysed. Sociodemographic and employment features, and those related to the training received by participants, are shown in Table 2 . A total of 75% of the sample were women, most of them nurses (66.5%) with a median age of 41.48 years old (SD = 10.8) and with seven years of experience in the department (SD = 8.3). Out of them, 39.6% stated that they had read the healthcare protocol and 25% did not receive any kind of training on the topic at all. As regards current knowledge, 42.1% of the professionals correctly identified that the main risk factor for becoming an IPV victim is the female gender, and 73.4% stated that it is generally true that batterers use violence as a means of controlling their partners. Both questions were answered correctly by 35.4% (real knowledge). When considering the implication in IPV cases, 65.2% of healthcare professionals stated that they did not detect any cases in the past six months. Among those who did detect some cases (n = 63), 54.9% stated that they enquired about patients who showed visible bodily injuries or indicators in their medical records, and only 1.2% asked every woman (Table 3) . Table 4 shows the quantitative scores for each opinion scale analysed by category and sex, and the percentages of professionals showing favourable opinions about sexist myths. The highest score was observed in the victim understanding and constraint scales (more in line with favourable opinions), both in physicians and in nurses, especially in male physicians (5.27, SD = 0.78) and female nurses (5.15, SD = 1.06). On the contrary, the lowest was found in alcohol and drugs as the cause of IPV, mainly in female physicians (3.76, SD = 0.82; p < 0.05). A smaller number of professionals agreed somehow with thinking that professionals do not have enough time to treat IPV victims (76.8%). The results of the three multiple regression models for the detection of IPV cases are presented in Table 5 . It is noted that those who show no favourable opinions to victims/survivors or with respect to alcohol/drugs abuse as causes of IPV, and the other variables remaining the same, are more likely to detect IPV cases at emergency services, although it does not reach statistical significance (aOR = 1.26 and aOR = 1.65, respectively). On the other hand, those who show more unfavourable opinions to time availability, reduce the identification (aOR = 0.78, NS). In every model, medicine professionals got more involved in IPV than nursery professionals. Very close to reaching significance, it is observed that having read the protocol increased detection of cases. In general, the fact of being a man, older than 40 years old, and having basic training, improved the result, while having real knowledge on IPV causes did not seem to do so (NS). ",

            "text": "The percentage of healthcare professionals who stated that they had detected IPV cases in the past six months (34.8%) is similar to the prevalence reported in our context. The last macrosurvey published in Spain recently, performed in a sample of 9568 women older than 16 years, reported that, among those who had or had had an intimate relationship with a man throughout their lives, 32.4% had experienced some type of violence [62] . Such a finding shows that the rates of implication by healthcare professionals seem to increase progressively, getting closer and closer to the actual prevalence [54] . However, although said figure is higher than the one reported in emergency departments by other researchers [15, 24, 29] , it is still far from the estimated 54% of women who suffer IPV and attend an emergency department [15] . Therefore, there is a need to continue improving detection rates, although in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should take into consideration the influence of other related factors. It is reported that this pandemic has had a great psychological impact on Spanish healthcare professionals working in emergency departments, particularly in nursery staff [63] . The emotional consequences may reflect the uncertainty felt in the workplace in the presence of a possible outbreak of the infection, since they are on the front line of care [64] . Together with medical care pressure, it is very likely that changes in the priorities of healthcare provision have impacted problems other than COVID-19, such as IPV, which may have been relegated to second place, as it occurs with other severe pathologies [65] . On the contrary, this situation could offer some advantages to healthcare providers. For instance, the strong limitations on access to health centres could lead to overcoming one of the main constraints on the appropriate treatment of IPV victims/survivors, such as the fact that the person cannot visit the centre accompanied by their partner [24, 66, 67] . Professionals may take advantage of such a circumstance and achieve a closer approach, in a context in which the room for manoeuvre is quite reduced.",

In Spain, emergency healthcare protocols in these cases encourage professionals to ask women showing specific signs or symptoms, in order to confirm violence [68] . Therefore, this practice follows the WHO's recommendations [26] , although it is widely documented that such actions do not contribute to identification [15, 22] . In the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, it is also the usual practice [24, 29, 32] , although in the United States, the recommendation is to perform IPV detection tests on every woman in their reproductive years, especially in emergency departments [69, 70] . Hence, there is controversy over the guidelines to be followed, perhaps until evidence contributes more consistent results on the benefits for women, from whatever intervention.",

Likewise, our indicia are consistent with the results from previous studies reporting said relationships [31, 71] .

Nevertheless, in our study, it was men who seemed to achieve higher detection rates. Such discrepancy between our and previous studies coincides with Ahmad et al., who stated the need for more solid and systematic research evaluating the impact of this variable on the implication towards IPV [15] . When considering age and years of experience, it is reasonable to think that professionals with maturity and expertise have a better understanding of IPV and greater skills to respond to victims/survivors of this type of violence [17, 56] . Our indicia support these hypotheses, while there are studies that show contradictory results in this respect [58, 75, 76] .",

However, although in every professional category a certain lack of training on the topic is detected [15, 24, 58, 75, 76] , nurses generally believe that treating IPV is not part of their responsibilities [16, 78] , which may also be the opinion of those participating in this study.",

For generalisation of the results, participation of a higher number of health centres would be required, which should also be independent of the coverage area of our city. Regarding the design of the study, it was prepared on the basis of the constraints shown in other investigations with similar objectives, but which were not adjusted by relevant factors or did not consider detection as the result variable [56, 58] . We proposed different explanatory models by introducing a series of independent variables supported by bibliography, and plausible mediating variables of detection such as opinions towards certain sexist myths. However, although the data were analysed as if it were an analytical study, the cross-sectional design only allowed us to suggest such associations among variables, and not a causality among them, so that results must be interpreted with caution.",

However, dependence on self-reports may introduce different types of biases in the results. On the one hand, the social desirability bias cannot be ignored, since we were dealing with a particularly sensitive topic in our context, namely, IPV. In order to minimise this bias, the anonymity of every participant was guaranteed. On the other hand, the unconscious bias of the provider to recognise abuse indicators and the memory bias may have influenced participants' answers. In spite of this, our indicia agree with previous investigations reporting the influence of negative/sexist attitudes of healthcare professionals towards IPV on case detection, which supports the theoretical consistency of the study. In future investigations, the use of online surveys via e-mail should be proposed, both to attract a larger sample size in order to define clearly any possible associations observed and to improve results on sensitive topics [79] .",
