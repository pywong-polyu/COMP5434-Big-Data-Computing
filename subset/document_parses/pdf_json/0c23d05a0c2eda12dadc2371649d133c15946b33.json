            "text": "Background: The project \"ARMIHN\" (Adaptive Resiliency Management in Port) focuses on strengthening the capability to act in a mass casualty incident (MCI) due to an outbreak of infectious diseases (MCI-ID). In addition to the current threat from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated outbreaks on cruise ships, previous MCI-ID were especially caused by pathogens such as Influenza virus or Norovirus. The first step was, to get an overview of processes and resources using the example of the Port of Hamburg, and to show the associated interaction of involved parties. This will serve as a basis for developing an operational strategy and offers the opportunity to optimize current work processes. Methods: A selective literature research using specified key words was performed and existing MCI concepts were received from local authorities. Identified structures and processes were analyzed in a multiple step process and also brought together through discussions in workshops with involved organizations and other experts. Additionally, the distances between the nearest rescue stations and selected hospitals from the Port of Hamburg were analyzed. Results: The current available concepts are proven, but an adaptation to an MCI-ID shows opportunities for a further cross-organizational development. The organizational structure of an MCI-ID in the Port of Hamburg was described, including a large number of involved organizations (n = 18). There are 17 involved fire and rescue stations and the port can be reached from these locations within 6 to 35 min. Based on their specialist expertise, 14 of the 31 listed clinics were selected.",

The continuous growth of the cruise ship sector, gives reason to be concerned about further outbreaks on ships and also shows the need to implement emergency plans [3] . Outbreaks do not have to be caused by novel pathogens, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A mass outbreak of already known pathogens such as Influenza or Norovirus can also quickly push the medical care on ship and the subsequent rescue chain to their limits, due to a simultaneous high number of sick people [4, 5] . An analysis of existing structures and basic conditions on ships and in the port is the first step in creating an operational strategy for mass casualty incidents due to an outbreak of infectious diseases (MCI-ID). It forms the foundation and offers the possibility to identify areas for improvement.",

In addition, the external conditions were listed by means of recommendations, laws and guidelines that have an influence on coping with an MCI-ID. The sub-chapters \"Process of reporting infectious diseases in the Port of Hamburg\" and \"MCI Infrastructure of Hamburg\" should give an impression of how an MCI is reported and which resources of the city of Hamburg are available, for example through hospitals and the fire brigade. The special processes of the existing emergency concepts were not described in detail in order to protect important and vulnerable data from misuse. After extensive discussion with the residential committee for safetyrelevant research in a separate meeting and as part of the approval of the local ethics committee we were only able to reproduce the relevant data in a general context in order to avoid a dual use risk. This represents a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, it was important to show that concepts exist and serve as the basis for developing a publishable, common concept in further project work. Fig. 3 Selected hospitals in Hamburg with appropriate specialist departments for the treatment of infectious patients with an intensive care unit and a department for internal medicine [26] European projects such as SHIPSAN ACT, SHIPSAN Trainet, and the Healthy Gateways Joint Action, provide initial approaches on the preparation and prevention, as well as the occupational health practices, of possible outbreaks of infectious diseases [4, 40, 47] . This year the EU Healthy Gateways working group published a guideline that is intended to support the development of public health concepts for ports and describe the procedure. According to recommendation, international and national laws and regulations should be known, existing operational plans should be integrated, communication should be regulated and the concept should then be tested and trained [48] . In this respect, the presentation of the organizational structures, existing concepts and resources is not only useful and necessary for current events of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also confirm the work of the ARMIHN project, which is currently developing such a concept for Hamburg. The Port of Hamburg can be approached in any emergency due to its special function as one of five designated ports in Germany and must therefore be prepared for it.",

A cross-organizational task force that can be alerted in medical emergencies, such as the \"Fachstab Seuchenschutz\" (Disease Control Unit) in Hamburg, has various advantages [32, 40] . Through quick identification and assessment of the situation, decisions can be made quickly, which would serve to better deal with such a situation. In this way, the city of Hamburg aims at clarify competencies in advance and guarantee security of action in infectious emergencies. The selection criteria made by an intensive care unit and internal specialist department is possible in a big city like Hamburg with at least 14 available clinics and their 8601 fully inpatient beds. In the event of resource shortages, it can be extended to surgical clinics to admit and treat patients [18, 25, 26, [37] [38] [39] . However, such a selection cannot be made everywhere, especially with regard to smaller municipalities and cities. Additionally, the distribution of patients could be optimized via a central (or regional) register of available beds for infectious patients, whereas in Germany IVENA (IVENA by mainis IT-Service GmbH, Offenbach am Main, Germany) is a potential system that is already used in a similar way and is the most widespread. By expanding this system, existing resources for COVID-19 patients can be displayed [51] . This can be linked and used analogously to the national register for intensive care capacities, which was implemented in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and has gained in importance in Germany [52, 53] .",

Most organizations have their own concept for MCI without focusing infectious diseases, but there is still potential to uniform and practice the procedure. The external conditions such as the multitude of legal bases and laws, different medical standards and lacking crossorganizational concepts even complicate the situation. By identifying the existing structures, processes and resources, an emergency concept for an MCI-ID in the port can be improved and be tested for practical suitability. It can contribute to an improved resilience dealing with an MCI-ID. ",
