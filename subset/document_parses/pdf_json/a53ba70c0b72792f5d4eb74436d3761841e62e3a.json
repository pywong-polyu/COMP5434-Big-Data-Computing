INTRODUCTION 57 As of December 2020, and after one year of the initial outbreak of the severe acute respiratory 58 syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this viral outbreak was associated with more than 80 59 million Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) victims and more than 1.8 million deaths worldwide 60 (World Health Organization, 2020a). The accelerated worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has 61 stressed the urgent needs for the initiation of preventive measures in an attempt to suppress its 62 terrifying spread, which included among others a complete lockdown of several countries for 63 several weeks (Cauchemez et al., 2020; Mitj\u00e0 et al., 2020), the execution of quarantine and 64 isolation (Nussbaumer-Streit et al., 2020), the use of protective equipment like face masks (Lyu 65 and Wehby, 2020), as well as the execution of social distancing (Qian and Jiang, 2020",

However, 12.5% of 175 participants (n = 366) reported that they were not interested in knowing about COVID-19 vaccines.176 177 3.5 Predictors of public willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines 178 Multinomial logistic regression analysis (Table 4) has identified eight factors that were found to 179 be protective against COVID-19 refusing the vaccine (i.e., participants were less likely to refuse 180 the vaccine, P \u2264 0.05 with odds ratio (OR) < 1). These included holding a medical related degree 181 (OR = 0.768), monthly income > $1,000 (OR = 0.719), being unmarried (OR = 0.686), living in 182 Saudi Arabia (OR = 0.454) or Iraq (OR = 0.328), having received influenza vaccine previously 183 (OR = 0.449), having high fear score from COVID-19 (OR = 0.745), and feeling of being at risk 184 of getting infected with COVID-19 (OR = 0.656).

            "text": "study is the first to measure the extent to which Middle Eastern Arab societies accept COVID-198 19 vaccines and to identify significant predictors of rejection by them. Studies from other parts of 199 the world have revealed different rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. For example, the 200 acceptance rate was 90% in China (Lazarus et al., 2021), 76.5% in Canada (Frank and Arim, 2020), 201 58% to 69% in the United States of America (Fisher et al., 2020; Malik et al., 2020; Reiter et al., 202 2020), and 55% in Russia (Lazarus et al., 2021). Interestingly the current study has shown that 203 Arab countries were the least in acceptance rates compared with those reports. Overall, only 24.9% 204 of our participants were willing to receive a vaccine when available while 32.6% were hesitant 205 and 42.5% were against it. This variation among countries could be due to different factors such as the local COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates, the countries' economic, social and political 207 statuses, education and national awareness, and most importantly the public trust in their 208 government and the national health agencies (Frank and Arim, 2020; Guidry et al., 2021). 209 Approximately 65% of our participants reported that their primary sources of information 210 about COVID-19 and its vaccines were the social networking platforms and television. Since this 211 finding goes in line with the results of other studies in other countries (Ali et al., 2020; Mohamad 212 et al., 2020; Basheti et al., 2021), it may be justified by the fact that the internet and traditional 213 media are the most popular and accessible sources of information, especially during the quarantine 214 and the lockdown times. However, sources that are not related to official health authorities may 215 spread exaggerated, flawed, and misleading information that can negatively affect mental health 216 of the public causing fear, anxiety, and depression (Garfin et al., 2020). This fear may, in turn, 217 negatively influence the willingness to receive a potentially effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine 218that may bring the pandemic to an end. Therefore, people must be advised to follow and connect 219 with local health authorities for the most geographically-relevant information. On the other hand,220    and especially in times of crises, local authorities must set official channels within the available 221 media to communicate with the public and deliver reliable information.222In this study, several predictors were identified to be significantly influencing the public 223 willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. Females were significantly more likely to refuse 224 to take the vaccine than males (OR = 1.84, P \u2264 0.001). This finding is consistent with two recent225 cross-sectional studies conducted in the USA, China and Jordan (Kreps et al., 2020; Qunaibi et 226 al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). The reason for women being more skeptical might be that they are 227 more influenced by the online-based conspiracy theories, especially after the anti-vaccination 228 sentiment on social media that is led mainly by females. 11 229 The public of Iraq and Saudi Arabia were significantly more likely to accept taking the 230 vaccine compared with the other countries in this study. The higher acceptance rate in Iraq could 231 be justified by the high COVID-19 prevalence (599,965) and mortality rate (12,865) (World Health 232 Organization, 2020a), while in Saudi Arabia the political and economic stability and trust of the 233 public in the government may have increased the acceptance rate especially that the government 234 efforts, services and guidelines during the outbreak have led to minimizing the number of daily 235 cases and deaths of the disease (World Health Organization, 2020a; World Health Organization, 236 2020e). On the other hand, almost half of the Jordanians and Lebanese citizens were against 237 receiving the vaccine. The economic, social, and political instability in Lebanon may have loosen 238 the trust of the public in their government regarding the fair provision of safe and effective vaccines 239 that are held and stored under optimal conditions (Le Borgne and Jacobs 2016; Malaeb, 2018).",

In contrast, being previously infected with COVID-19 was found 249 to increase the level of refusal to receive the vaccines. This finding might be explained by the 250 common misconception that previously COVID-19 infected people have lifelong immunity and 251 do not need to get vaccinated.252 Finally, although this study was proactive in revealing the feelings of the Arab publics 253 towards the COVID-19 vaccines and that it contributed to defining some predictors of acceptance 254 or rejection of the vaccines, there were some limitations that must be pointed out. We have 255 included only four Arab countries because a number of researchers in other countries were unable 256 to participate in distributing the questionnaire. We believe that our four countries are representative 257 of the Arab world because they include countries with diverse economic and political conditions, 258 but at the same time they share the prevailing culture in the Arab world. Also, some Arab 259 governments have announced during the study period that they would soon provide the vaccines 260 to their people. This prompted us to shorten the time for collecting responses to the questionnaire 261 in order to complete the survey before the vaccines become available, which led to a smaller 262 number of participants than planned. In addition, in this study we have recruited a convenience 263 sample of participants via social media which introduced selection bias; as most of the respondents 264 were young, and around 46% of them reported holding a biomedical degree. This may limit the 265 generalizability of results to the general population. Therefore, we strongly recommend further 266 studies that would shed more light on the perception of Middle Eastern communities about 267 COVID-19 and its related developments, emphasizing the role of governments in spreading 268 adequate awareness and providing vaccines to people in a safe and fare way.",

Since there is no officially effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19 so far, the world pins its hopes on vaccines to counter COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) has authorized for general use after being rigorously evaluated by the regulatory authorities for their increased individuals' hesitancy to receive it(Dror et al., 2020). Thus, it is essential for health officials worldwide to estimate the public willingness to take the available COVID-19 vaccines and define the predictors of acceptance or rejection. Recognizing such predictors could assist decision makers in setting policies dealing with any worrisome regarding these vaccines.Thus, the main aim of the current study was to evaluate public perception and willingness Arabic, and two experts cross compared the translated version with the original one for validation.",
