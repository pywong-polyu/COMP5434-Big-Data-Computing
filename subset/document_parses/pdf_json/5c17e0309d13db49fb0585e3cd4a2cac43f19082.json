The present multistep screening and structural binding analysis with CHIKV proteome exploration can be crucial in the development phase of CHIKV epitope based vaccine. The approach employed in two phases (i) Sequence based screening of peptides through propred and IEDB Server (ii) Structure based study through autodocking and NAMD VMD simulation analysis. Among all 29 extracted peptides, only two peptides 2 LLANTTFPC 10 of protein E3 and 98 VNSVAIPLL 106 of protein nsP3 were observed most prominent over all consider parameters such as peptide conserve nature, supertype population coverage, TAP binding, docking and simulation study. During docking interaction study, the best peptide and allele docked complexes such as 2 LLANTTFPC 10 -B*0702 allele and 98 VNSVAIPLL 106 -A*0301 allele exhibited best binding energy of \u2212 3.13 kcal/mol and \u2212 3.19 kcal/mol, respectively, with stable bonding patterns and their motion during NAMD simulation which confirm conserve peptide and allele stable interaction. The current study also exhibited the good docking interaction of both peptides 2 LLANTTFPC 10 and 98 VNS-VAIPLL 106 with c TAP1 protein (1jj7 -PDB ID) cavity which confirm as a channel passageway to peptide transport through the cytoplasm to lumen of ER during antigen processing and presentation. Overall, this multistep screening and crosscheck structural binding analysis with an exploration of the complete proteome of CHIKV can be a novel step in the development of CHIKV epitope based vaccine as well as diagnostic development with aspect of time, cost and side effects.",

As arbovirus, CHIKV transmission in humans occurs through mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. CHIKV infection cause generally chikungunya fever but its infection severity result morbidity with chronic stages such as poly-arthralgia and prolong myalgia (Cunha et al. 2020 ). In the acute-infected individuals other severe complication like gastrointestinal upset, encephalitis, depression, lung, kidney, heart dysfunction, loss of vision, sleep disorder and memory loss being perceived (Sanyaolu et al. 2016; Qamar et al. 2018) . The risk of Chikungunya may increase in the older patient more than 65 years and younger ones, posses more severe symptoms like neurological, cardiac and mortality also (Horwood and Buchy 2015) . The present time, WHO also recorded high rate of CHIKV infections in India as well as rest of the developing countries due to urbanization activities, poor santization and weak mosquito vector control. Along with this, same vector and similar infection of CHIKV and Dengue virus which misleads treatment plans of both infections, causing major problems for health workers (Dutta et al. 2017; Saxena and Mishra 2021) . On other side, the available therapeutic drugs and conventional vaccines lack the potential to address this global problem of CHIKV infection (WHO 2020; Weaver et al 2012) still advance therapeutic treatment and effective vaccines are in progress. CHIKV is a single positive-strand RNA virus with genome size 11.8 kb which translated in to structural capsid protein, envelope protein (E1, E2, 6 K and E3) and enzymatic non structural nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins (Lee & Chu 2015; Qamar et al. 2018) .",

Therefore, the only option to verify the extent of CHIKV is quarantine and vector control with symptomatic therapeutic treatment at this time. In some way, this is effective only in the developed countries because of well develop techniques, but in the developing countries, these methods not working properly because of the large population and lacking of resources (Silva and Dermody 2017) . So that's why persistency of this disease has remained very high because of insufficient therapeutic and control of this disease. Consequently, all facts demands specific therapeutic treatment as well as effective and advance vaccines to control the severe CHIKV infections globally. The traditional vaccines, likes-heat-killed and live attenuated vaccines having some safety issues because of whole microorganism administration as well as time and cost are also major issues. (De Groot et al. 2002; Sharma et al. 2018) . In current scenario, the advent of immunoinformatics tools and databases are helping in the development of multi epitope vaccines, which rising as a new hope to resolve all above limitations of conventional vaccines for human pathogenic viruses, bacteria (Joshi and Kaushik 2020) , fungi ) as well as veterinary pathogens also (Jain et al. 2021) .",

In the development of epitope based vaccines requires complete knowledge of immunology to initiate immune response. The epitope peptides cannot generate immunity alone; epitopes should attach to Major Histocompatibilty Complex (MHC) membrane proteins of host cell. Generally MHC molecules in human are called Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) which show high diversification in human population which raises the issue of population coverage during development of vaccines (Gupta and Kumar 2020a,b) . To initiate an immune response towards an antigen; it has to undergo antigen processing and presentation process under which range of epitopes were generated to bind with HLA membrane molecules. Different ethnic population shows variations in binding pattern between HLA alleles and epitope. Therefore, each ethnic populations can be represent by a group of HLA alleles called as Supertypes and those epitopes bind with these supertype alleles group known as superantigens. The idea of supetypes which is representing a particular population has lower the chance of antigen escape from immune response as well as population coverage issues.

Therefore, this study started with the finding of the range of epitopes from each protein of virus which will be conserved and superantigenic through a sequence based epitope-alleles binder algorithms. After that, these conserved peptides and HLA alleles were generated in their structural models by PEPstrMODE and Swiss-prot for further structural binding analysis by docking. The binding of conserve superantigen epitopes with HLA molecule as well as cTAP substantiate that the epitopes generated during antigen processing were well transported with cTAP through cytosol and presented with HLA molecules over the membrane. The superantigenic epitopes peptides which showed best binding with HLA molecules were further docked with cTAP to confirm whether these peptides are really processed and presented during cytosolic pathway. Finally, the most potential candidates were undergone for molecular simulation study to confirm stable binding between Epitope and HLA molecule by NAMD-VMD. Overall, this multistep screening and crosscheck structural binding analysis with an exploration of the complete proteome of CHIKV can be a novel step in the development of CHIKV epitope based vaccine.",

After retrivation of all required sequences of proteins, this study will be divided in two phases such as sequences based study and structure based study. Sequences based study involve the screening of epitopes from study strain, conservancy analysis, supertype analysis pI analysis and finally cross check with other algorithms to validate them. The structure based study was done to confirm the potential of epitopes to bind with HLA molecule by docking and simulation study, to generate an immune response. Prepared and Propred I was employed to retrieve HLA class II and Class I binding epitopes with recommended parameters. Therefore, the epitopes comparative analysis with all geographical regions strains were done to observe variations and conserve nature of propred screened epitopes with the help of IEDB platform. Along with, mutated or varied all epitopes were tested for their pI value.
