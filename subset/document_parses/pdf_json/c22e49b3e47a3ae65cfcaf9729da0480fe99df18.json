We also have endured social isolation and travel restrictions [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Finally, we have dealt with racial and social unrest that started in the United States and spread throughout the world [9] .

We decided to look at ourselves and use the pandemic to better define the Association. What spoke to the core of IAMSE? What were the things that were important to the Association and its membership that we needed to continue, improve, or initiate? To help with the process, we established a Strategic Leadership Group (consisting of the current President, President-Elect, and three Past-Presidents) to help navigate the Association through the early and most chaotic stages of the pandemic.",

We determined that in a worst case, even with a loss of annual meeting (and potentially other) revenues for 1 or 2 years, the Association would remain solvent. The strong financial reserves of IAMSE were crucial to our overall strategy. They allowed us to take chances and provide additional services to our members. As far as leadership was concerned, retreat was not an option. We never considered cutting member services to conserve funds or enacting strategies that were designed to merely survive COVID-19. In contrast, our focus was always on how to move forward and expand services and engagement in a meaningful, safe, and responsible manner (and it remains so). We felt that the best way to accomplish our objectives was to be bold, take chances (when appropriate), and embrace innovation. Our goal was to position IAMSE to come out stronger on the other side of COVID-19. As a result, IAMSE is in better shape today than it was at the beginning of the pandemic and the future of the Association is very bright. As one measure of success, our membership has grown dramatically since the beginning of COVID-19. In contrast to many organizations who lost members over the course of the pandemic, IAMSE has added nearly 500 members since February 2020. We now stand at nearly 1,900 members (an historic high) who represent 43 countries around the world. (Note that in the two months following the 2021 Virtual Conference, IAMSE membership rose to more than 2,100 members from 53 countries).",
