            "text": "Background: Although several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been identified, the role of physical health and, particularly, mental health, is poorly understood. Methods: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused investigation (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within the UK Understanding Society (Main Survey) project. In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (Oxford University/AstraZeneca, November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 12,035 individuals aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic, study members had responded to enquiries about diagnoses of mental and physical health, including the completion of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire for symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety and depression). Peri-pandemic, individuals indicated whether they or someone in their household was shielding; that is, people judged by the UK National Health Service as being particularly clinically vulnerable who were therefore requested to remain at home. Intention to take up vaccination for COVID-19 was also self-reported. Results: In an analytical sample of 11,955 people (6741 women), 15.4% indicated that they were vaccine-hesitant. Relative to their disease-free counterparts, shielding was associated with a 24% lower risk of being hesitant (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.76; 0.59, 0.96), after adjustment for a range of covariates which included age, education, and ethnicity. Corresponding results for cardiometabolic disease were 22% (0.78; 0.64, 0.95), and for respiratory disease were 26% (0.74; 0.59, 0.93). Having a pre-pandemic diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or a high score on the distress symptom scale, were all unrelated to the willingness to vaccinehesitancy. Conclusions: People with a physical condition were more likely to take up the potential offer of a COVID-19 vaccination. These effects were not apparent for indices of mental health.",

There have therefore been calls to test the link between mental health and vaccine hesitancy [8] , the concern being that any elevated burden of the disease in individuals with poor psychological health would be compounded if they were also reluctant to take up the vaccine.",

First, individuals with psychiatric morbidity and symptoms of distress generally tend to have a lower prevalence of health-protecting behaviours. Relative to their unaffected counterparts, for instance, they are more likely to smoke, take less exercise, have an imprudent diet, and be obese [9] [10] [11] . Second, people with mental health issues also appear to be less likely to take up the offer of health screening [12] , although this is not a universal observation [13] . Lastly, of perhaps most relevance, in a study of influenza inoculation, users of an outpatient psychiatry clinic had markedly lower take-up than the general population [14] .",

Given a modest evidence base revealing inconsistent findings [15, 16] , in a large, general-population-based UK sample we examined the relationships of mental health diagnosis and symptoms of mental distress with vaccine hesitancy. For the purposes of comparison, we also present the association between somatic illness and vaccine hesitancy; in the few relevant studies, somatic illness has been associated with lower levels of hesitancy [17, 18] . Importantly, collection of data on vaccine intention in the present study took place following the announcement of successful testing of the Oxford University/ AstraZeneca vaccine, which was widely and prominently publicised. Therefore, the present survey concerning vaccination hesitancy was taken at a time when the future offer of vaccination was no longer merely hypothetical.",

There was, however, little evidence of a difference in the prevalence of specific mental health diagnoses across the hesitant groups; only 'other' mental health conditions were more common in study members expressing hesitancy, but the absolute difference was marginal with statistical significance generated from the large numbers.

That we also recapitulated known associations with hesitancy such as being female [37] [38] [39] , being younger [37, 39] , and from an ethnic minority group [21, 39, 40] , gives us some confidence in our novel results for mental health. To the best of our knowledge, there have been two prior examinations of the relationship between mental health and vaccine hesitancy. Comprising two small cross-sectional studies from Ireland and the UK where data collection took place prior to the announcement of the successful testing of the first efficacious vaccination, study members were administered a very brief and unvalidated enquiry as to whether they had an experience of mental health problems. In that study, there was no clear evidence of a link [15] . In a Danish study in which vaccine takeup or the intention to do so in a group of individuals experiencing psychiatric care was compared with the general population, willingness was somewhat lower in the patient group [16] . Studies using data based on other vaccination programmes offer some insights into the present relationships. For instance, in a crosssectional study of patients with schizophrenia which took place during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Australia, three-quarters indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated [41] ; however, in keeping with similar studies [42] , the absence of a general population comparison group renders interpretation problematic. In a small cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, those with mental health problems were seemingly less likely to have children with up-to-date vaccine coverage, although the association was weak and the study underpowered [43] .",

First, we used vaccine intentionality as an indicator of vaccine uptake but the correlation between the two is imperfect. In a small-scale longitudinal study conducted during the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong, less than 10% of people who expressed a commitment to being inoculated reported that they had actually received a vaccination two months later [44] . Elsewhere, in a US adult population at high risk of seasonal influenza, around half of those intending to be vaccinated had received it within the following 5 months [45] . Second, there was inevitably some loss to follow-up ( Figure 1 ). Whereas this attrition might have impacted upon the estimation of the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy, which is likely to be lower in our select sample relative to the general population [46] , it is unlikely to have influenced our estimation of its relationship with mental and physical health. Thus, in other contexts, we have shown that highly-selected cohorts reveal very similar risk factor-outcome associations to those seen in studies with conventionally high responses [47] In conclusion, we found that some somatic conditions but not mental health problems were related to a lower likelihood of being vaccine-hesitant against COVID-19.
