            "text": "There is a perception that traditional masculine ideals, usually thought deleterious for men's health outcomes, are no longer as relevant for younger social generations such as Millennials as they are for older social generations such as Baby Boomers. Yet, in Australia, there remains a disparity between younger men's and women's health outcomes and use of health services. Conformity to traditional masculinity is often cited as a barrier to men's positive health behaviours but conceptualisation of the construct is contested. We analysed a selected secondary dataset (n = 14,917) of Australian males aged between 15 and 55 years from Ten to Men: The Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health. We examined the role of conformity to traditional masculine norms in predicting likelihood of regular primary and preventative health services use for different social generations. Analyses included mediated regression and adjusted logistic regression. Conformity to ten of the eleven specific traditional masculine norms predicted likelihood of increased or decreased regular health service use depending on the generation and health service type. Specific traditional masculine norms play a complex role in men's use of distinct health service types for different generations of Australian males. Practitioners wishing to increase men's engagement with health services should consider gender-sensitive approaches that leverage specific masculine norms relevant to the age cohort to drive positive outcomes in men's health.",

In the younger age-groups between 15 and 45 years, males are dying at a greater rate, usually from preventable causes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2019a, 2019c; World Health Organization, 2018a) . Despite availability of often subsidised health services, males in Australia, the United Kingdom, and around the World have lower life expectancy than females (World Health Organization, 2018b) . In the study Ten to Men: The Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health, 61% of surveyed Australian males aged 18-55 years said they did not visit their GP for a general health check-up at least once a year (Schlichthorst et al., 2016) .",

Indeed, for men, health behaviours can be seen as enactments of masculine identity and rejecting positive health behaviours such as seeking help for a physical or mental health problem, or even using sunscreen when outside, contribute to a 'manly' masculine identity construct (Courtenay, 2000 (Courtenay, , 2011 Ricciardelli & Williams, 2011) . The damaging implications of traditional masculine ideals on men's health and wellbeing is being highlighted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with calls for health messages targeting men's health behaviours White, 2020) . However, while adherence to traditional masculine ideals is considered mostly incongruent with positive health behaviours, reimaging of some traditionally masculine traits such as being fit and muscular or a good role model or father-figure indicate a reconfigured masculinity construct may have some positive implications for men's health (Lewington, Sebar, & Lee, 2018; Mahalik, Di Bianca, & Sepulveda, 2020; Oliffe et al., 2019) . Some argue, however, these modern takes on traditional masculinity could still be harmful to men's wellbeing, promoting unrealistic body images, for instance (Lewington et al., 2018) .",

Connell (1995) challenged unidimensional thinking on the masculinity concept, proposing it be conceptualised as a multidimensional social construct. However, despite its variances, most iterations of masculinity have been drawn from hegemonic masculinity ideology that subordinates women and other masculinities, endorsing traditional dominant masculine norms often through risky, and unhealthy behaviours (Connell, 1995) . Traditional masculinity is considered the idealised masculinity, yet the most damaging masculinity for men's health (Courtenay, 2011) . For younger men, high-risk-behaviours such as drinking alcohol at dangerous levels, using illicit drugs, and engaging in unprotected sex have been associated with endorsing traditional masculinity ideals such as risk-taking and promiscuity (Courtenay, 2000; Courtenay & McCreary, 2011; Ricciardelli & Williams, 2011) . For some older men, when such risky behaviours are less relevant, avoiding help-seeking and accessing preventative health services such as cancer screening services has also been associated with strong endorsement of traditional masculine norms like being tough and self-reliant (McGraw, Russell-Bennett, & White, 2019; Springer & Mouzon, 2011) .",

The CMNI, including the CMNI-22, has been widely used to measure traditional masculinity ideologies in Westernised societies (Mahalik, Walker, & Levi-Minzi, 2007; Thompson & Bennett, 2015) The CMNI is designed to explore men's conformity to various dominant masculine norms (Mahalik, Talmadge, Locke, & Scott, 2005; Pirkis, Spittal, Keogh, Mousaferiadis, & Currier, 2017) . The CMNI-22 Total score is the total of the 11 subscales scores and is used in this study as an indicator of overall conformity to traditional masculine norms (Mahalik et al., 2005) . Each subscale represents a traditional masculine norm: importance of emotional control (Emotional control), endorsement of risk-taking (Risk-taking), importance of social status (Status), importance of being dominant (Dominance), salience of 'playboy' status (Playboy), salience of power over women (Power over women), primacy of work/school (Work/school), importance of self-reliance (Self-reliance), endorsement of violence as a resolution (Violence), importance of winning (Winning), and salience of heterosexual presentation (Heterosexual presentation) (Mahalik et al., , 2005 . The derived total scores for the CMNI-22 were provided in the original Ten to Men dataset. The subscales have demonstrated excellent concurrent validity and correlated well with the original 96-item scale (Hamilton & Mahalik, 2009; Pirkis, Spittal, Keogh, Mousaferiadis, & Currier, 2017; Thompson & Bennett, 2015) . Reliability of the CMNI-22 scale in the current study was slightly low (Cronbach's alpha \u03b1 = 0.66), which is considered within the generally acceptable range (Owen et al., 2010, p. 125 ) and consistent with other research using the abbreviated scale (Hamilton & Mahalik, 2009; Morrison, 2012; Owen et al., 2010) . Pearson's correlations for each of the 2-item subscales ranged from low scores of r = 0.28 for Work/school to higher scores of r = 0.75 for Emotional control. The maximum overall raw score on the CMNI 22-question instrument is 66 and the maximum score for each subscale, or masculine norm, is 6. The total scores were converted to transformed scores (T-scores) for the analyses as recommended by the scale authors (Mahalik et al., 2005) . T-scores can range from 0 to 100 where 50 indicates average confomrity, 50.01 to 60 reflects moderate conformity, 60.01 and above reflects extreme conformity, scores of 49.99 to 40 reflect moderate non-conformity, and scores 39.99 and below reflect extreme non-conformity to traditional masculine norms (Mahalik et al., 2005) .",

However, our decision to use the ABS parameters enables future comparisons with Australian population data.

Hazardous alcohol consumption measured self-reported consumption at hazardous or harmful levels in the past 12 months and was derived from the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (Babor et al., 2001; Bandara, Howell, Silbert, et al., 2019) . Demographic characteristics included remoteness of the area in which a participant lives (Australian Statistical Geography Standard Remoteness Area) such as 'major city', 'inner regional', and 'outer regional'. Socio-economic status was controlled for using the Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA) Index of relative socio-economic disadvantage percentiles (Australian Bureau of Aus-tralianBureau of Statistics, 2016). A low percentile indicated an area of high proportion of relatively disadvantaged people and a high percentile indicated an area of high proportion of relatively advantaged people (Australian Bureau of AustralianBureau of Statistics, 2016). The variable was recoded where a score ranging between 1 and 49.99 percent was recoded as 'higher disadvantage' and a score ranging between 50 and 100 percent was recoded as 'lower disadvantage'.

Masculinity is no longer seen as a unidimensional construct (Connell, 1995) , nor is it fixed or static (Courtenay, 2000) . Men's constructions of varying masculinities through the endorsement of traditional masculine norms, are not uniform (Connell, 1995; Courtenay, 2000) . Previous masculinity research contends that global measures of masculinity do not adequately reveal the varied nuances of the construct, particularly in health contexts (Mahalik et al., 2005; Owen, 2011; Wong et al., 2017) . Wong et al.'s (2017) meta-analyses examining relationships between conformity to masculine norms and mental health outcomes found the generic construct of masculine norms, which they operationalised through various versions of the CMNI, was unhelpful in explaining outcomes compared to specific dimensions of masculinity.",

Examination of conformity to specific masculine norms for different generations' health service use, however, results in a richer depiction of likely influences. This study found conformity to specific traditional masculine norms will predict different outcomes in health service use that are unique to social generation and the type of service. Each generation had a different predictive model for both regular primary health service use and regular preventative health service use, and none of the generations' models were replicated with the 'all generations' combined samples. As Tables 3  and 4 show, specific traditional masculine norms that were highly significant (p < 0.001) for predicting different generations' health service use included Emotional control, Work/school, Self-reliance, Status, and Violence. Previous studies using the CMNI instrument have also found the same specific masculine norms to be associated with men's health behaviours (Mahalik et al., 2007; Levant & Wimer, 2014; Salgado et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Additionally, this study found some specific traditional masculine norms predict increased likelihood of regular health service use. Millennial and Generation X models for primary and preventative health service use included seven specific traditional masculine norms positively associated with regular health services use. Traditional masculinity is mostly associated with negative health behaviours (Addis & Mahalik, 2003; Courtenay, 2000 Courtenay, , 2011 Springer & Mouzon, 2011) . However, emerging studies have explored the potential for the endorsement of some masculine norms to predict positive health behaviours such as increased use of mental health services and preventative self-care (Levant et al., 2011; Salgado et al., 2019; Sileo & Kershaw, 2020) . When exploring whether theoretical positive masculinity constructs are more broadly socially accepted and enacted, McDermott et al. (2019) found some traditional masculine ideals usually captured as negative traits can to a degree be associated with socially acceptable responses or positive behaviours, such as being successful in one's job. The present study adds to this avenue of men's health research from the perspective of primary and preventative health service use, suggesting conformity to some traditional masculine norms could lead to regular use of certain health services. For instance, findings suggest Generation X males with higher conformity to traditional norms Work/school (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17) and Winning (AOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16), masculine norms associated with competitiveness and achievement, are likely to keep their health in check by regularly accessing preventative health services such as going to the GP for a check-up. This finding suggests a link between traditional masculine ideals of male competitiveness with positive preventative health behaviours. Increased conformity to Work/school (AOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.20) was also likely to predict regular preventative health service use for Millennial males, as was Power over women (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). In a report comparing important issues for Australia's Millennials (referred to as Generation Y) and Generation X cohorts, Chester et al. (2018) found that Table 3 Conformity to specific traditional masculine norms predicting likelihood of regular primary health service use for social generations. next to the environment, job security was the most important issue for the younger generation, more so for the males in the cohort. Generation Y participants reported job insecurity and housing affordability threatened to inhibit their progress through life stages such as marriage and starting a family (Chester, 2018). One Generation Y male expressed concerns on fulfilling expectations to be the sole provider for his partner and family (Chester, 2018) . Some U.S. social researchers suggest there is a 'stalling' of the gender revolution since the mid-1990s, with a return to more conventional attitudes to women in the workforce from younger generations, particularly among young men (Fate-Dixon, 2017; Pepin & Cotter, 2018) . This phenomenon might explain the findings in the current study, where Australian Millennial males with higher conformity to Work/school and Power over women are more likely to regularly use a preventative health service, possibly to ensure they remain fit for work and fulfil 'breadwinner' expectations in an uncertain job market (Coontz, 2017; Fate-Dixon, 2017) . Of note in this study is some specific traditional masculine norms change directional roles in predicting health service use for different generations. For instance, conformity to specific norm Work/school changes from a positive to negative influence depending on the health service context. This finding suggests that, for some males accessing a primary health service when one might be sick or injured has very different implications to one's masculine identity than when accessing a preventative health service for a check-up when one is not sick. Men with traditional masculine ideals have been found to overestimate their health status and downplay illness or injury, avoiding accessing care even when sick (Courtenay, 2011; Leone, Rovito, Mullin, Mohammed, & Lee, 2017; Springer & Mouzon, 2011) . Additionally, higher conformity to Power over women (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21) predicted increased likelihood of preventative health service use for Millennial males but reduced regular primary health service use for Generation X males (AOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96). The already suggested association with 'breadwinner' expectations might explain this positive influence for Millennial men (Fate-Dixon, 2017), whereas Generation X males who endorse traditional masculine ideals of male dominance and strength over women, including in the workplace, may be more likely to avoid going to the doctor even when sick or injured to avoid appearing weak or not fit for work (Courtenay, 2011) . While conformity to Power over women is a problematic norm for men's health (Courtenay, 2000 (Courtenay, , 2011 , and gender relations (Jewkes, Flood, & Lang, 2015) , its significance in this research serves to highlight polarised shifts in attitudes occurring within younger generations of males (Fate-Dixon, 2017; Pepin & Cotter, 2018) . The duality of some specific norms for either positive or negative influences on health services use highlights the complexity of each dimension of masculinity. In their replicated study of Levant et al. (2011) , investigating associations between specific traditional masculine norms and health behaviours, Levant and Wimer (2014) found that some aspects of masculinity can be positively associated with certain health behaviours, and negatively associated with others. However, the associations are highly contextual to the behaviour, the sample, and the particular masculine trait (Levant and Wimer, 2014) . The present study also finds that associations between conformity to some dimensions of masculinity and health services use are sensitive to service type and generation.",

Findings could inform tailored, gendered approaches to influence men's use of services fundamental to improved health outcomes. However, findings also serve to caution practitioners when targeting males that, depending on the health service or behaviour promoted, specific traditional masculine norms can serve either as a motivator or barrier to positive health behaviours for some generations and health service contexts. While some theorists warn health practitioners of the risks that come with messaging that endorses traditional masculine norms (Fleming, Lee, & Dworkin, 2014) , there are also proponents for a gendered approach to men's health (Courtenay, 2011; Oliffe et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2017) . This study supports scrutinised and focussed gender-sensitive approaches that explore the potential to reconfigure some specific masculine norms to drive positive outcomes in men's health. For instance, public health messaging targeting Millennial males could associate regular preventative skin cancer screening with workplace comradery.",

The present study has limitations, however, to consider when assessing the findings. The CMNI-22 instrument had slightly low reliability for its global scale and had some low reliability scores with some subscales. A longer version like the CMNI-46 may have increased reliability. In public health contexts, however, and in particular given the large scope of the original Ten to Men research project, the abbreviated instrument was more efficient (McDermott et al., 2019) . The CMNI-22 uses the two highest loading items for each subscale taken from the original CMNI-94 . The absence of a preventative health service use variable in the Young Men's survey reduced representation of Generation Z in the preventative health service use analyses to males aged 18 years. However, the Ten to Men Generation Z cohort was aged between 10 and 18 years at the data collection time point and accessing preventative health services may not have been as applicable for the younger males compared to adult males.",

However, specific traditional masculine norms influential in health services use differ for each social generation, and higher conformity to some specific norms predicts increased use of health services for some generations. The predictive role of some specific norms also changes from a positive influence to a negative influence in regular health service use depending on the generation and service type. Findings provide insights into the multidimensional role of specific traditional masculine norms for men's health service use, which potentially reflects differing attitudes of social generations. Such insights will be useful for practitioners in public health and other disciplines wishing to engage males, particularly Millennial and Generation X males.",
