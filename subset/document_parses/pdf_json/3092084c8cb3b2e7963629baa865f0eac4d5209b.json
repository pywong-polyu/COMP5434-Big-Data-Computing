The reliability of obtaining 3-lead ECG with smartwatches is yet to be confirmed in a large study. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and reliability of smartwatch to obtain 3-lead ECG recordings, the classical Einthoven ECG leads I-III compared to standard ECG. To record lead I, the watch was worn on the left wrist and the right index finger was placed on the digital crown for 30 s. For lead II, the watch was placed on the lower abdomen and the right index finger was placed on the digital crown for 30 s. For lead III, the same process was repeated with the left index finger. Spearman correlation and Bland-Altman tests were used for data analysis. A total of 300 smartwatch ECG tracings were successfully obtained. ECG waves' characteristics of all three leads obtained from the smartwatch had a similar duration, amplitude, and polarity compared to standard ECG. The results of this study suggested that the examined smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 4) could obtain 3-lead ECG tracings, including Einthoven leads I, II, and III by placing the smartwatch on the described positions.",

One of the products of these advances is handheld/wearable single-lead ECG recorders [6] . The latest development in this area is the inclusion of single-lead ECG in smartwatches, which are getting more popular every day [7] . One of the smartwatch products with this capability is the Apple Watch Series 4, which can record single-lead ECG in 30 s using two positive and negative electrodes. The Apple Watch Series 4 was the first smartwatch with the capability of single-lead ECG recording that received a de novo Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in August 2018 [8] . However, doubts about the quality of ECG signals generated by smartwatches and the fact that they are limited to one lead (similar to lead I) have largely limited their clinical Sensors 2020, 20, 5074 2 of 11 application [9] [10] [11] . Considering the short time since the production of the Apple Watch Series 4, not many studies have been conducted regarding the quality assessment of the ECGs generated by this device. Our systematic search of the Pubmed database with the following search terms \"Apple Watch\", \"Smartwatch\", \"Electrocardiogram\", and \"ECG\" in August 2020 result in 79 records. However, the feasibility of recording a 3-lead ECG with the Apple Watch Series 4 was reported in only one case report of two patients with myocardial infarction [7] , a technical report [12] , and three observational studies from a same group of investigators [13] [14] [15] . The other available studies were related to the other capabilities of smart wearables, ranging from screening and diagnostic to treatment functions, using other technologies, namely photoplethysmography (PPG) [4, 5, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Additionally, the possibility of generating 3-lead ECGs with smartwatches is yet to be confirmed in a large study with other study groups.

However, it should be noted that the quality of ECG signals can be affected not only by the settings of the ECG recorder, but also by other factors including skin preparation prior to the placement of electrodes. The present study was conducted without any specific skin preparation protocol and without considering skin greasiness and hair growth, which make the measurement process more akin to the real-world experience.

In this case report, physicians decided to omit further diagnostic procedures in the chest pain unit and to perform the angiography in an 80-year patient presented with angina symptoms based on her smartwatch recordings showing ST-segment depression, although the initial 12-channel ECG and the highsensitive troponin I test result were not suggestive of myocardial ischemia. During the angiography, a significant stenosis in the left main stem and a lesion in the left anterior descending/diagonal bifurcation were diagnosed [29] . In another example, the feasibility of Apple Watch ECG recordings for the detection of cardiac ischemia in two patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction was approved [7] . In this study, a 3-lead ECG was obtained by using a similar method, which is used in our current study. In both of the patients, the real-time, 3-lead Apple Watch ECG recordings were compatible with the standard ECG waveforms, indicating an inferior myocardial infarction [7] . It has been shown that the late arrival of patients at diagnostic centers is one of the most common causes of late diagnosis and treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction [31] . Indeed, a rapid ECG, followed by timely transfer to specialized centers can, in many cases, lead to the rapid diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and reduce the door-to-needle or door-to-balloon time [32] .

Indeed, a rapid ECG, followed by timely transfer to specialized centers can, in many cases, lead to the rapid diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and reduce the door-to-needle or door-to-balloon time [32] . Hence, improving access to ECG can be an effective measure for early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Therefore, smartwatch ECG recordings might be the solution.",

In these situations, patients can take a 3-lead ECG and share it with a health-care provider, in order to receive further instructions. However, it is also important to educated patients about the fact that the current smartwatches cannot replace standard ECG or provide an accurate interpretation of ECG records like a physician. We believe that what is happening to smartwatch ECG is somewhat similar to what has already happened to other personal health monitoring devices, such as home glucose and blood pressure monitors, as there were some concerns about their utility and reliability when they were introduced to the market, but, gradually, it became clear how much these tools can help reduce medical costs and improve the outcomes of medical interventions [2] . Therefore, a more sensible reaction to the advent of smart devices with medical functions is to contribute to improving their utility and performance, instead of resisting technological progress.",

(2) The process of recording ECG with the smartwatch was supervised by the researchers. Therefore, ECG tracings obtained from smartwatch without such supervision may not have the same degree of feasibility or quality. (3) One of the factors that may affect the morphology of ECG signals is the frequency filtering parameter of the recorder system [34] . Although our study showed a strong correlation in terms of morphology between standard ECGs and those of the smartwatch, their slight differences can be due to possible differences in these parameters; an issue that could not be further investigated, because the filtering parameters of the Apple Watch were not available to us.
