At a critical developmental stage, the well-being of the youth is more vulnerable to adverse environments. This study constructed a moderated mediation model to explore the buffering factors between insecurity and subjective well-being of the youth during the pandemic. Methods: During the COVID-19 outbreak in June 2020, data of 5,503 Chinese youth (15-29 years old) were collected via an online questionnaire. Subjective well-being, insecurity, self-control, and hope were measured, and the moderated mediation model was analyzed. Results: Findings from this study showed that with the mediating effect of self-control, insecurity negatively predicted subjective well-being, and hope moderated the association between insecurity and self-control. Specifically, the link between insecurity and self-control was stronger when hope was low but weaker when hope was high. Limitations: Since this study was mainly conducted in China, and considering the continuous change of the pandemic on a global scale, it is of great significance to conduct cross-cultural and cross-time studies in the future.",

Moreover, lockdowns imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in the sudden interruption of routine educational and leisure activities, which are indispensable for the youths' development (de Abreu et al., 2021; Cattelino et al., 2021) . These radical and unpredictable changes have contributed to a significant rise in perceived insecurity Wen et al., 2021) , which in turn induce long-term negative consequences on the well-being of adolescents and young adults (Morelli et al., 2020; Inanc, 2018; Nica et al., 2016) .",

According to Bandura's social cognitive theory, individuals' self-control levels in the course of self-regulation highly depend on their inner beliefs, in which hope is a noteworthy member (Bandura, 1991; Xin et al., 2020) . However, limited attention has been paid to the buffering effects and associations between these protective factors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the younger population. Therefore, the current study conducted a cross-sectional investigation targeting adolescents and young adults during the pandemic lockdown in China. In this research, a moderated mediating model was constructed to examine the mediating role of self-control in the link between perceived insecurity and subjective well-being of the youth. Further, we examined the moderating effect of hope on the association between insecurity and self-control.",

Abundant evidence has indicated the negative association between insecurity and subjective well-being in various contexts (Inanc, 2018; Nica et al., 2016; Barrech et al., 2016) ; this demonstrates that feelings of insecurity adversely affect an individual's sense of control, increase negative affections, and decrease life satisfaction, subsequently leading to a lower level of subjective well-being (Barrech et al., 2016; Wills-Herrera et al., 2011) .",

Hence, investigating the association between pandemic-caused insecurity and subjective well-being can be meaningful and thought-provoking. Explorations targeting the youth during the pandemic have demonstrated that higher levels of perceived insecurity were correlated with stronger negative affections and higher risk of mental illness and suicide, indicating the negative consequences of pandemic-related insecurity on the youths' well-being Ganson et al., 2021; Gen\u00e7 and Arslan, 2021; Fitzpatrick et al., 2020) . However, there is limited evidence about the influencing mechanism and buffering factors in the association between insecurity and the subjective well-being of the youth, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic . Therefore, the current study adopts the perspective of positive psychology to examine how perceived insecurity affects youths' subjective well-being and identify the mediating and moderating factors that might mitigate the harmful consequences of insecurity. With reference to previous findings, we proposed the hypothesis that insecurity will negatively predict the subjective well-being of youth during the COVID-19 pandemic (H 1 ).",

Drawing on the Self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 2012) , it can be inferred that individuals' inherent growth tendencies are dependent on the environment; when the environment fails to provide sufficient nutrients, this positive internal process will be impaired. Previous research on children's developmental perspective has found that both short and long-term food insecurity will have impacts on children's self-control. For instance, children who grow up in environments with high food insecurity tend to develop low self-control (Jackson et al., 2018; Grineski et al., 2018) . Therefore, based on the empirical and theoretical evidence, we proposed the hypothesis that insecurity and subjective well-being are associated with self-control in negative and positive directions, respectively. In other words, self-control plays a mediating role between perceived insecurity and subjective well-being of youths during the pandemic (H 2 ).",

Hope is defined as the ability to set goals, finding the path to reach those goals, and maintaining the motivation to achieve them (Snyder et al., 2000) . Hope comprises two fundamental aspects: pathway thinking, which refers to the process of goal-directed planning, and agency thinking, which refers to goal-directed determination (Jiang et al., 2018; Snyder et al., 2000) . Hope has been proved to be an important predictor and source of self-agency factors represented by self-control (Li et al., 2022; Schnell and Krampe, 2020) . According to Bandura's social cognitive theory, an individuals' self-control level in the process of self-regulation is largely influenced by their beliefs and motivations (Bandura, 1989; Yue and Ji, 2007) . Hopeful adolescents are found to be more persistent in pursuing their goals and taking effective actions even amid difficulties. Whereas adolescents with lesser hope tend to have lower psychological resilience and a higher possibility to exhibit weak self-control and negative behaviors when encountering hardships (Jiang et al., 2018; Chai et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Beyond being a predictor of self-control, the hope theory indicates that hope is also a strong buffer to protect youths from adverse environments (Chai et al., 2018) . Based on the model of individual-environment interaction, contextual factors usually influence adolescents' mental state through the interaction with individual factors (Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017) ; thus, providing theoretical support for the interaction between pandemic-related insecurity and hope. Inferred from empirical evidence, hopeful adolescents can better generate adaptive strategies or coping mechanisms to overcome difficulties in the face of the pandemic. In addition, hopeful adolescents might also have stronger motivation to advance towards developmental goals (Jiang et al., 2018; Chai et al., 2018) , which is beneficial in mitigating the negative impacts of insecurity. Moreover, hopeful adolescents are more inclined to regard the insecurity brought by the pandemic as a worthwhile challenge or a learning opportunity for future growth; thus, they employ more active self-control measures to cope with difficulties (Schnell and Krampe, 2020). Conversely, a low level of hope is typically accompanied by a sense of hopelessness and depression, which makes the youths more vulnerable to the insecure environment, and succumb to addictive and excessive behaviors that are detrimental to their well-being (Jiang et al., 2018; Schnell and Krampe, 2020) . Therefore, our model mainly concerns the moderating role of hope in the link between insecurity and self-control. Based on the positive nature of hope, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between hope and self-control, and the association between insecurity and selfcontrol will be weaker in adolescents with a higher level of hope than those with a lower level (H 3 ).",

In addition to self-control which concerns the control of current behaviors, the important role of hope as a representation of the attitudes and motivations towards the future also cannot be ignored, especially in the unpredictable and adverse situation of the pandemic. Also, it is indicated in the social cognitive model that the internal beliefs of individuals have a significant effect on the processes of self-control (Bandura, 1989) . However, there are few investigations about the moderating role of hope between environment-related insecurity and individuals' self-control, which is a critical self-agency factor. Therefore, it is very meaningful to explore the mediating effect of hope in this study, which fills the gap of previous studies.",

Youths with higher levels of hope are likely to develop more problem-solving methods, change coping strategies more flexibly when encountering difficulties, and can also maintain a stronger belief in their own abilities to realize goals (Jiang et al., 2018; Schnell and Krampe, 2020) . According to Bandura's social cognitive theory, the self-control level of individuals is also influenced by inner beliefs, including hope. Therefore, when responding to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the youths with higher hope were more likely to perceive difficulties as opportunities for growth or development and were more willing to facilitate self-regulatory methods to deal with the hardship. In contrast, individuals with lower levels of hope were less likely to develop effective solutions and have higher tendencies to give up. Additionally, their unsuccessful coping experiences can further affect how the youth perceives their own self-control; thus, decreasing their subjective well-being (Bryce et al., 2020; Crane, 2014) . As such, the important role of hope can never be overlooked, and helping youths to increase their hope levels during the pandemic is beneficial to protect their self-control from being damaged, which in turn will have positive effects on their mental health.",

First, this study aimed to examine adolescents and emerging adults, who are at a critical stage of psychological development, and expanded research on insecurity to wider populations. Previous studies have mainly focused on insecurity within the context of work (Selenko et al., 2017; Witte et al., 2016) , such as the impact of job insecurity on employee well-being, turnover rates, organizational performance, with little attention given to youth. Second, to our knowledge, the present study was the first to investigate the role of self-control in the relationship between insecurity and subjective well-being, along with the protective role of self-control and hope. The results indicate that self-control and hope can effectively buffer the negative impact of insecurity on subjective well-being in youth, thus enriching and expanding relevant research on subjective well-being. Third, the present study constructed a moderated mediation model, focusing on the mediating effect of self-control and moderating effect of hope. This model can provide important empirical evidence for understanding the mechanism underlying the impact of increased insecurity on subjective well-being in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

With the pandemic progressing, experts and laypersons pay attention not only to physical health but also to mental health. Increases in negative affections such as anxiety, stress, depression, and insecurity during the pandemic have been closely related to mental health problems in the general population. The present study provides important implications for developing intervention strategies to improve subjective well-being in youth from the perspective of positive psychology, especially proposing the new viewpoint to alleviate the negative consequence of insecurity by increasing self-control and hope. When determining how to protect youth from the pandemic's negative impact on their mental health, this study's findings are expected to have significant implications for future practice.",

            "text": "Although the present study has important theoretical and practical significance, there are also some limitations that suggest directions for further exploration in the future. First, this research mainly examines the moderated mediation model based on the data collected from youths in China during the pandemic. Therefore, the generalizability of the findings in other areas remains to be explored. According to the data from WHO Health Emergency Dashboard, during our investigation, China has overcome the most critical stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nationwide outbreak has been initially controlled. However, other countries in Asia (Japan, South Korea, India, etc.) were still experiencing an increase in cases. It has been proven in cross-area studies that both the severity of the outbreak and cultural contexts have important impacts on individuals' risk and insecurity perception (Van Bavel et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2020; Germani et al., 2020) . Therefore, due to the different developing trends of COVID-19 worldwide, people in different areas may have experienced varying levels of insecurity due to the differences in confirmed cases, control measures, and cultural orientation. As such, considering the factors above, the applicability of this model in other areas in Asia still requires further verification. Second, the present study mainly examined the moderating role of hope between insecurity and self-control among youth, which has been supported by existing evidence and data analysis. However, the findings of previous studies also suggest that hope can moderate the association between negative factors and the subjective well-being of individuals. Therefore, it is meaningful to further examine the role of hope in future studies under different groups and cultural backgrounds. Additionally, as this study primarily used a cross-sectional design, it is difficult to determine causal effects. In future research, a longitudinal survey may help increase understanding of mental health changes among youth in different pandemic periods and provide better reference values for applying theoretical research into practical applications.",

The negative correlation between insecurity and subjective well-being is mediated by self-control, and hope moderates the first half path of the mediation model. The less hope youth have for the future, the stronger the association between insecurity and self-control, and the more vulnerable their subjective well-being. The results demonstrate self-control and hope play important roles in buffering the negative effects of insecurity on the subjective well-being of adolescents and emerging adults. ",
