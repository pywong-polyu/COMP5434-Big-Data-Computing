In this framework, we present the evaluation of a home-care service which was experimentally implemented by Fondazione Sacra Famiglia and Casa di Cura Ambrosiana in the 2017-2018 biennium. The service consisted of a twice-weekly nursing visit intended to monitor patient health conditions and to gather data constantly supervised by a geriatrician. The eligible population consisted of the users of San Carlo Hospital Emergency Department (91 individuals). Twenty of these individuals had access to the experimental home-care service. The results show the smaller probability of mortality for the treatment group compared to the control group, but similar probabilities in admissions to ER and in hospitalizations. These findings suggest that health home-care policies could reduce mortality by lessening the negative effects of relational isolation.",

Similarly to other well-documented clinical risk factors, this relational isolation of the older adults emerges as one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality (Tarugu et al., 2019) .

This mostly applies when care needs are moderate (Lehnert et al., 2019) , while it becomes challenging when care needs are more intense. In addition, such home-care services are intended as means to reduce the adverse effects of potentially inappropriate medications and hospitalization, following model based on the IHI Triple Aim: better care, better health, and lower costs (Burgos-Diez et al., 2020) . A topic of debate is the inappropriate use of medications (and their sub-use in particular) by older adults at home (Wauters et al., 2016) .

The doctor and the case manager were responsible for coordinating the monitoring activity of the patients, and the possible interventions. Based on the evaluation carried out by the doctor, the patients were visited at home by nurses or socio-health personnel (\"OSS\" in Italy) 2 or 3 times per week. The nurses (or the OSSs) were equipped with a backpack containing the instruments necessary to measure blood glucose, saturation, body weight circumference, temperature and pressure, spirometry, and to conduct electrocardiogram examinations (further details on this equipment can be found in Appendix A). The data collected by means of the equipment were transmitted via tablet to a web platform that recorded information and fed the personal file of each patient. Professional health workers constantly read and interpreted such data during their working days. When necessary, these data were also used to modify the pharmacological therapy in order to reduce risks of exacerbation, deterioration or improper use of the emergency department. As regards the experimental phase described in this study, the home care service was free of charge.",

This subgroup was determined by the hospital staff according to the following characteristics: being aged 70 + , social-health frailty (need of extra-hospitalized care, presence of at least two morbidities and a therapy with five or more active principles), and residential proximity to the hospital. Twenty patients had access to the experimental home-care service between July and November 2017. Although there were no selection biases in sampling these 20 users, no pure randomized sampling was performed. This resulted in a quasi-experimental design because the assignment of the medical intervention was not at the discretion of the investigators. All patients authorized the treatment, scheduling a domiciliary visit to receive the study documents (the Patient Information Sheet). The informed consent was signed by the patients themselves or, in case of cognitive impairment, by their caregivers.",

The main aim of PSM models is to reduce the bias due to confounding variables which is likely to be found when trying to estimate the treatment effect by simply comparing outcomes. This technique works by \"pairing\" subjects with similar characteristics coming from the treated and the control group, in order to estimate the average effect of the treatment (ATE-Average Treatment Effect). The ATE estimates represent the difference of treatment, on average, on the outcomes Y 1 and Y 0 , where Y 1 represents the state of health taken as reference and Y 0 the alternative state. More precisely, the ATE can be defined as the average effect that would be observed if everyone, treated or not, had received treatment, compared to the situation in which no one had received treatment. This procedure represents a step further toward a more robust causal explanation (Li, 2013) .",

On the contrary, the choice was taken to introduce into the PSM models the results of the tests for which significant differences between the treated and the control group were observed. In fact, what emerge are the best average performances of the users involved in the Virgilio 2.0 program as regards the 4AT, MORSE and Barthel tests. The Barthel test measures the functional autonomy of the subjects, the MORSE test evaluates the mobility and the 4AT the potential cognitive deficit and delirium.
