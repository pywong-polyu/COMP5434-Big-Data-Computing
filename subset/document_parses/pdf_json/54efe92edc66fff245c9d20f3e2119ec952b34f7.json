Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes modelling attempts difficult and unreliable. Hence, we need to re-look at the situation with reliable data sources and innovative forecasting models. Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, we apply recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM models for multi-step (short-term) COVID-19 infection forecasting. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first (2020) and second (2021) wave of infections and provide two months ahead forecast. Our model predicts that the likelihood of another wave of infections in October and November 2021 is low; however, the authorities need to be vigilant given emerging variants of the virus. The accuracy of the predictions motivate the application of the method in other countries and regions. Nevertheless, the challenges in modelling remain due to the reliability of data and difficulties in capturing factors such as population density, logistics, and social aspects such as culture and lifestyle.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to close their borders and enforced a partial or full lockdown which had a devastating impact on the world economy [6] [7] [8] . Other major impact has been on agriculture [9, 10] which is a major source of income for the population in rural areas, especially in the developing world. The sudden lockdown in some countries created a number of problems, especially for low income communities [11, 12] , and migrant workers [13] .

Given lack of data, it is challenging to develop a model while taking into consideration population density, effect of lock-downs, effect of viral mutations and variants such as the delta variant [23], logistics and travel, and qualitative social aspects such culture and lifestyle [24] . However, culture and lifestyle are examples of variable of interest that cannot be measured quantitatively. Due to qualitative nature of certain variables of interest such as lifestyle, and lack of data collection, modelling attempts have been mostly unreliable [25] . We need to re-look at the situation with latest data sources and most comprehensive forecasting models [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, a number of other limitations exists, such as noisy or unreliable data of active cases [29] , changing mortality rate given different variants, and asymptotic carriers [30, 31] . There have been reports that the models lack a number of limitations and failed in several situations [25] . Despite these challenges, it has been shown that country based mitigation factors in terms of lockdown level and monitoring has a major impact on the rate of infection [32] . We note that limited work has been done using deep learning-based forecasting models for COVID-19 in India, although the country has one of world's largest population with highly populated and highly dense cities. There is a need to evaluate latest deep learning models for forecasting COVID-19 in India, that takes into account both the first (2020) and the second wave (2021) In this paper, we employ LSTM models in order to forecast the spread of COVID-infections among selected states in India. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first and second wave of infections in order to later provide two months ahead forecast. We first employ univariate and multivariate time series forecasting approaches and compare their performance for short-term (4 days ahead) forecasting. We also present visualisation and analysis of the COVID-19 infections and provide open source software framework that can provide robust predictions as more data gets available. The software framework can also be applied to different countries and regions.",

Chakraborty and Ghosh [27] used hybrid ARIMA and wavelet-based forecasting model for short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.

[61] focused on forecasting of COVID-19 cases in India using RNNs such as LSTM and gated-recurrent units (GRU) with the dataset from 30th January 2020 to 21st July 2020. Bhimala et al. [62] incorporated the weather conditions of different states to make improve forecasting of the COVID-19 cases in different states of India. The authors made assumption that different humidity levels in different states will lead to varying transmission of infection within the population. They demonstrated that LSTM model performed better in the medium and long range forecasting scale when integrated with the weather data. Shetty [63] presented real-time forecasting using a simple neural network for the COVID-19 cases in the state of Karnataka in India where parameter selection for the model was based on cuckoo search algorithm. The study reported that the mean-absolute percentage error (MAPE) was reduced from 20.73% to 7.03% and the proposed model was further tested on the Hungary COVID-19 dataset and reported promising results. Tomar and Gupta [64] developed LSTM model for 30-day ahead prediction of COVID-19 positive cases in India where they also studied the effect of preventive measures on the spread of COVID-19. They showed that with preventive measures and lower transmission rate, the spread can be reduced significantly. Gupta et al.

BPTT features gradient-descent where the error is backpropagated for a deeper network architecture that features states defined by time. The RNN unfolded in time is similar to a multilayer perceptron that features multiple hidden layers. A major limitation of BPTT for simple RNNs has been the problem of learning long-term dependencies given vanishing and exploding gradients [41] . The LSTM network addressed this limitation with better capabilities in remembering the long-term dependencies using memory cells in the hidden layer [35] . The memory cells help in remembering the long-term dependencies in data as shown in Fig 1. The LSTM network model calculates a hidden state output h t by where, i t , f t and o t refer to the input, forget and output gates, at time t, respectively. c refers to the memory cell. x t and h t refer to the number of input features and number of hidden units, respectively. W and U are the weight matrices adjusted during learning along with b, which is the bias. Note that all the gates have the same dimensions d h , which is given by the size of hidden state.C t is the intermediate cell state, and C t is the current cell memory.

We note that state of Uttar Pradesh has estimate population of 238 million has managed better. Delhi has a relatively smaller population (estimated 19 million [82] ), but high population density and hence been one of the leading states with COVID-19 infections (in top 6 throughout 2020). Tables 3 and 4 show that in 2021, Maharashtra continued leading; however, the second position was overtaken by Kerala from February which maintained the position since then. We note that from February to June 2021, India experienced the second-wave of infections from the delta-variant of the virus, with Maharashtra and Kerala leading most of the time in terms of monthly infections. The first peak for novel cases in India was reached on September 16th 2020 with 97,894 daily and 93,199 weekly average novel cases [15] .

The dataset is based on daily novel cases which is normalised taking the maximum number of daily cases over the entire data into account. We start our analysis from 15th April 2020 and use rolling mean of 3 days to smoothen the original data. We reconstruct the univariate and multivariate time series into a state-space vector using Taken's theorem [72] with selected values for embedding dimension window (D = 6) and time-lag (T = 2) for multi-step ahead (MSA) prediction. We consider four prediction horizons; i.e. MSA = 4, where each step is a prediction horizon. The Adam optimizer is used for training the respective LSTM models. Tables 5 and 6 describe the topology for the respective LSTM models for univariate and multivariate cases, respectively. In case of multivariate model, the input contains four features which represents the adjacent states in relation to the state taken into account; i.e. the case of Maharashtra (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh) and the case of Delhi (Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana). In multivariate model of India, we take all the states as input features to the multivariate model. We note that similar to univariate model, the multivariate We review the performance of the respective methods in terms of scalability and robustness which refers to the ability of maintaining consistent prediction performance as the prediction horizon increases.

The second wave struck due to multiple factors and highly-infectious variant-of-concern, also known as SARS-CoV-2 delta variant [23] .

Nevertheless, despite the challenges and given limited dataset, we have been successful in developing LSTM models for forecasting trend of daily new cases. Our long-term forecasts for two months (October and November 2021) show a steady decline in new cases in India in the respective states. We find that Delhi's two monthly forecasts provide (Fig 11) more uncertainty when compared to Maharashtra and India datasets. We also notice that there is similar level of uncertainty by LSTM and BD-LSTM models for India and Delhi datasets. The major reason the uncertainties are different when you compare Delhi and Maharashtra with rest of India is due to the difference in the trend of cases. In Delhi [15] , multiple peaks were observed since the first wave of infections in 2020, whereas in the India dataset, there were only two major peaks. In Maharashtra, a minor peak was observed in November 2021 (Fig 4, Panel a) after the first wave of infections. Hence, the tends captured in the training dataset were relatively different from the states (Maharashtra and Delhi), when compared to India dataset. This suggests that the predictions for [88, 89] which has been the state that held one of the most number of COVID-19 cases and novel daily infections (Tables 1-4) [15] .",

Our framework has been limited in capturing social-cultural aspects, population density, and level of lockdowns due to missing information and data. Moreover, inter-state travels and the chaotic nature of spread of COVID-19 infections makes it increasingly harder to provide reliable long-term forecasts. In order to improve forecasting results, the models need to incorporate more features in the data. The model needs to capture features such as travel behaviour, level of lockdowns, compliance in masks and other restrictions, social and cultural lifestyle, local area population density, work and income thresholds, state-wise vaccination rate, and accessibility to information.",

The impact of COVID-19 on Indian gross domestic product (GDP) is significant, but not as bad when compared to some of the developed western nations [91, 92] . One of the most crucial aspect of management of spread of COVID-19 infections is the role the government played in timely closing their international borders and enforcing lock-downs to various degrees. We need to note that different countries have different geographical and population dynamics, such as population density and culture. It is not a good idea to compare cities given difference in population density although the overall population may be similar. Overall, it is also important to look at cultural factors such as rituals [93] , and role of nuclear and extended families [94] . In countries such as India, there is large portion of inter-state migrant workers [95] and also a large portion of the population is in rural areas [96] that also have extended families. These factors made further challenges in containing the spread of COVID-19 infections and are hard to be captured by computational and mathematical models.",

We evaluated univariate and multivariate LSTM-based models with different ways of creating training and test data. The LSTM model variants showed certain strengths and limitations in different scenarios that made it difficult to choose a single model. Generally, we found that the univariate random-split ED-LSTM model provides the best test performance in comparison to rest of the models. Therefore, the data from the adjacent states did not have much effect in the multivariate model since it could not outperform the univariate model. The two months ahead forecast showed a general decline in new cases; however, the authorities need to be vigilant.",

Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences [33-37] and modeling dynamical systems, when compared to simple neural networks [38-40]. The limitation in training RNNs for long-term dependencies in sequences where data sequences span hundreds or thousands of time-steps [41, 42] have been addressed by long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) [35]. LSTMs have been used for COVID-19 forecasting in China [43] with good performance results when compared to epidemic models. LSTMs have also been used for COVID-19 forecasting in Canada [44]. Other deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently shown promising performance for time series forecasting [45, 46].
