Based on winning coalitions, the PHI \u03b8 index was introduced by Bertini et al. in (2008). The goal of this article is to reformulate the PHI \u03b8 index using null player free winning coalitions. The set of these coalitions unequivocally defines a simple game. Expressing the PHI \u03b8 index by the winning coalitions that do not contain null players allows us in a transparent way to show the parts of the power assigned to null and non-null players in a simple game. Moreover, this new representation may imply a reduction of computational cost (in the sense of space complexity) in algorithms to compute the PHI \u03b8 index if at least one of the players is a null player. We also discuss some relationships among the Holler index, the PHI \u03b8 index, and the g np index (based on null player free winning coalitions) proposed by \u00c1lvarez-Mozos et al. in (2015) .",

The PHI \u03b8 index was born as a modification of the Public Good Index (briefly, PGI) based on minimal winning coalitions. The PGI index was introduced by Holler (1982) ; for this reason, it is also known as the Holler index. Even though the structure of the two indices mentioned above are very similar, their characterizations differ (see Sect. 5, for example, where a comparison of two indices can be found). The PHI \u03b8 index takes part of the so-called public power indices (see Bertini and Stach (2015) and Stach (2016) as \u03b8 is well-defined in the social context where goods are public. The PHI \u03b8 index considers all winning coalitions, not only minimal winning coalitions (as in the PGI index). Hence, as Bertini and Stach (2015) remarked, \"\u03b8 rather describes power relationships in the consumption of public goods, whereas the PGI analyzes the production of public goods. In production, one must take care to exclude freeriding; this is why the PGI considers minimal winning coalitions; in the consumption of public goods, you cannot avoid free-riding.\"",

Both indices (KB and Z) are not only based on winning coalitions and closely related to the Banzhaf (1965) index but are also proportional to each other and to the \u03b8 index. In particular, the quotient of each of these indices and the sum of its values taken over of all players is equal to the \u03b8 index, which is not difficult to show (see Bertini et al. (2013) and Stach (2016) , for example). Moreover, if we consider voting rules to make yes/no choices (acceptance and rejection) by a voting body and assume that all vote configurations are equally probable, then the KB index for particular voter i is interpreted as the conditional probability that \"i is successful\" given \"the proposal is accepted\" (see Valenciano et al. (2004) , for example). The Z index was defined by Nevison (1979) as an absolute measure of satisfaction. So, from this point of view, the PHI \u03b8 index can be seen as the relative measure of being successful (having the result for which one voted).",

Both indices can be seen as modifications of the PGI index (Holler 1982) . The PGI index is based on the minimal winning coalitions, whereas \u03b8 is based on the winning coalitions and g np indices on null player free winning coalitions. The important contribution of this paper is the novel approach to calculate and express the PHI \u03b8 index. The new formula proposed in Sect. 3 for calculating the PHI \u03b8 uses only null player free winning coalitions. It should be note that the set of these coalitions unequivocally defines a simple game. In a transparent way, the new formula shows the power assigned to null and non-null players. The set of null player free winning coalitions has a non-greater cardinality than the set of all winning coalitions. Therefore, Formula (1) given in Sect. 3 can facilitate the calculations of PHI \u03b8 for a large number of players with the presence of null players in a simple game (see Sect. 4 in particular) . This means that eliminating the null players from a game gives the advantage in reducing the space complexity of an algorithm that is used. Furthermore, if the representation of the weighted game is transformed into a minimal weighted representation in integers, then the null players are exactly those who have a weight equal to zero (see Freixas and Kurz (2014) , for example), if there are some of them then it makes sense to apply the new formula proposed in this paper. An alternative easy way to identify null players is by means of classical indices, as the Banzhaf or Shapley-Shubik ones. Then, the null players are exactly ones who are assigned 0 as a payoff. Moreover, when a simple game is defined by the set of null player free winning coalitions, the calculation of the \u03b8 index by Formula (1) is immediate.",

            "text": "Proof. Consider weighted game v = [q;w 1 , w 2 , ..., w n ] , n \u2265 2 , and two non-null players i, j \u2208 N such that i \u2260 j and w i \u2265 w j . Let us denote a set of all null player free winning coalitions containing both players i and j by W n\u2212 i\u222aj = {S \u2208 W n\u2212 \u2236 i \u2208 S \u2227 j \u2208 S} . Of course, W n\u2212 i\u222aj is non-empty, as players i and j are not null and W n\u2212 i\u222aj belongs to both W n\u2212 i and W n\u2212 j . Next, w i \u2265 w j implies that, for each non-empty coalition S \u2208 W n\u2212 j \ufffdW n\u2212 i\u222aj , the following holds:Informally, the donation property states that a player who donates votes to another player (recipient) should not increase his voting power. Bertini et al. (2013) presented an example of a failure of the donation property for the PHI \u03b8 and Holler indices. The same example can be used to also show that the g np index presents a failure of the donation property. Namely, let us consider two games v 1 = [9; 6, 4, 1, 1, 1] and v 2 = [9; 5, 5, 1, 1, 1]. Game v 2 arises from v 1 after the donation of one vote by Player 1 to Player 2. As game v 1 is free of null players, both the \u03b8 and g np indices give the same distribution of power. In particular, 1 (v 1 ) = g np 1 (v 1 ) = 9 32 and h 1 (v 1 ) = 1 3 . After the donation from Player 1 to Player 2, the distribution of player weights change so that Players 3, 4, and 5 become null players. In game v 2 , Players 3, 4, and 5 (with one vote each) are not critical in any coalition. Moreover, in game v 2 , we have only one null player free winning coalition: {1, 2}, which is also a unique minimal winning coalition. Thus. g np 1 (v 2 ) = h 1 (v 2 ) = 1 2 , and 1 (v 2 ) = 2 7 . Therefore, Player 1 increases his/her power after the donation according to the h, \u03b8, and g np indices. So, all of these indices violate the donation property. Felsenthal and Machover (1998, p. 232 ) also considered a stronger version of the donation property-the redistribution property (i.e., when more than one donor or one recipient could appear). The h, \u03b8, and g np indices present a failure of the donation property, so they will also present a failure of the redistribution property. Moreover, Felsenthal and Machover (1998, p. 253 ) considered the so-called fattening property. Informally, this property states that a player who puts on extra weight should not lose power. If we consider two weighted games v 1 = [9; 5, 4, 1, 1, 1] and v 2 = [9; 6, 4, 1, 1, 1], we can observe the failure of the fattening property for h, \u03b8, and g np . Namely, 1 (v 1 ) = 2 7 , h 1 (v 1 ) = g np 1 (v 1 ) = 1 2 and g np 1 (v 2 ) = 1 (v 2 ) = 9 32 , h 1 (v 2 ) = 1 3 . To paraphrase Felsenthal and Machover (1998) ",
