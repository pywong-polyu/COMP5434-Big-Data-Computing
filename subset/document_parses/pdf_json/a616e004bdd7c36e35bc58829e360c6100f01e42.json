The psychological pressure and uncertainty caused by the current changing workplace environment have led to negative consequences for workers. Considering the predictive relationship between employee engagement and wellbeing and in light of this unprecedented situation that affects workers of all the industries worldwide, this study aims to identify the key main drivers of employee engagement that can lead to employee wellbeing in the current context. Through a literature review, a theoretical model to strengthen engagement in times of COVID-19 is proposed. The main factors are conciliation, cultivation, confidence, compensation, and communication. Whereas prior to the pandemic, firms had already understood the need to achieve this, it is now considered a vital tool for staff health and wellbeing. This article makes two main contributions. First, it provides a model for boosting employee engagement, and therefore, wellbeing. Second, managerial suggestions are made to apply the theoretical model.",

Another issue to address is understanding employee's expectations and future plans and involvement in decision making and organizational practices, in other words, empowerment. Inhouse training is also viewed as an opportunity to improve employee attitudes, expectations, and motivation. In addition, employees will be more engaged when they are confident that efforts are being made to safeguard their health. In this regard, companies should ensure that workplaces comply with all hygienic-sanitary measures, consider reassigning tasks and/or working remotely, and pay special attention to the mental health of their employees. Managers should also realize that a good way to improve engagement is to plan and implement a compensation policy that responds to the new labor scenario, not only with monetary payments but also with non-monetary benefits, which are more financially viable due to the company's economic circumstances as a result of the pandemic. Finally, firms should facilitate communication, information sharing, and informal relationships among colleagues and supervisors.",
