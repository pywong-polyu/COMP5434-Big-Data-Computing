Consumers were offered access to an enticing comprehensive genetic report that included information pertaining to not only relatively insignificant traits such as the ear lobe shape but also those as significant as cancer risk. A decade-long battle then ensued between 23andme and governmental organizations that sought to curtail DTC testing on the grounds of public protection from ''abusive marketing'' and ''exaggerated claims'' regarding genetic health risk and lack of clinical validity (1) . This culminated in the US Food and Drug Administration's authorization of 23andme's DTC test in April 2017, which approved genotyping for a limited set of genetic diseases and liberal inclusion of testing for genetic health risks (2) . This landmark decision paved the way for the rapid expansion of DTC testing that has occurred over the past 5 years.",

These tests are often only intended to identify risk for a particular condition or subset of conditions and are not typically for diagnostic purposes, which is often difficult for the average consumer to understand without appropriate counseling (4). Results may not be actionable; for example, a person may be identified to be at-risk for a disease, but there is no strategy available for them to mitigate or reduce that risk. Moreover, even when the results are actionable, there is little integration with the traditional health care system for follow-up or further intervention or treatment. Direct-to-consumer laboratories typically recommend that consumers consult with health care providers before and after testing, but this is often not done; consumers typically select tests and interpret the results on their own.",

Their timely arrival on the market parallels increasing social pressures on women to complete education and career goals and achieve financial stability before reproduction. They are also convenient, negating the need to wait at a physician's office, relatively noninvasive, and low-cost compared with a formal evaluation at a fertility or gynecology clinic.

Many diagnostic laboratories use a direct immunoassay on an automated platform to quantify steroid hormones. However, it is now well-recognized that direct immunoassay methods, that is, without one or more preceding purification steps, lack the specificity and sensitivity to measure estradiol accurately. Estradiol is converted rapidly to estrone, and these 2 estrogens are then metabolized via sulfation and glucuronidation reactions to produce approximately 100 circulating conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. One or more of these metabolites are likely to cross-react with the estradiol antibody in the immunoassay and falsely elevate the levels (7). In addition to poor specificity, direct immunoassays generally lack the sensitivity to quantify accurate estradiol levels below 30 pg/ mL (8) . Similarly, it is well known that direct immunoassays should not be used to measure serum testosterone levels in female samples (8) .",

The average consumer of DTC testing is highly unlikely to be aware of the limitations of assay methodology, as many clinicians are not even aware of these limitations.

Values from different assays are highly correlated but vary with regard to the numeric value, depending on the test used.

First, AMH is initially produced as a larger precursor protein that undergoes posttranslational cleavages to its active form. The AMH precursor protein has no binding ability to the AMH receptor in vivo but is detectable in the serum, and reported values are typically a composite of the different circulating forms of the AMH. Different immunoassays also may use different antibodies, which may have variable binding affinities or specificity for the isoforms of the AMH. There may also be additional proteolytic cleavages of AMH that may lead to unknown isoforms of AMH that may affect results (14) . Second, interference by the complement system in blood, particularly C1q, has also been shown to interfere in the measurement of AMH in some assays, and premixture with a buffer to reduce the interference may be required (12, 15) . Finally, AMH tests may also vary in terms of protocol, sample preparation and stability, assay time, and detection system. Laboratories seldom determine their own reference range, and there is also no international reference material to calibrate or compare different assays, despite recent attempts by the World Health Organization to generate a reference reagent for AMH (12, 16, 17) .",

However, in the general population and those without infertility, AMH does not predict future fertility potential, the likelihood of unassisted pregnancy, the time to pregnancy, or the timing of menopause (18) (19) (20) (21) .",

This may involve unnecessary procedures, therapies, medications, and/or lifestyle changes. Most commonly, those identified to have results indicating low ovarian reserve on DTC testing may be urged to seek elective oocyte cryopreservation or modify life choices regarding childbearing (22) . Elective oocyte cryopreservation may offer patients the ability to defy the ovarian ''biologic clock'' and have greater autonomy regarding the timing of reproductive decisions. Yet, oocyte cryopreservation is costly and invasive, and evidence shows that few women actually use their cryopreserved oocytes for pregnancy (23) . Additionally, elective oocyte preservation does not guarantee a live birth, as oocyte survivability and viability after thaw and embryo culture is unknown. Although small studies report optimistic results with pregnancy rates similar to conventional IVF without oocyte cryopreservation, data regarding pregnancy outcomes after elective oocyte cryopreservation are lacking (23) . Hence, if not counseled appropriately regarding the chances of a live birth on the basis of the number of oocytes frozen, there is the potential that women may over rely on cryopreserved oocytes as an ''insurance policy'' for future childbearing.",

Among markers used to estimate ovarian reserve, age alone remains the most important factor in predicting oocyte quality and reproductive success (24, 25) .

Even if the hormonal analysis is reassuring, counseling regarding the other components of a typical infertility evaluation that could be abnormal or affect a woman's ability to conceive should be performed in those women actively trying to conceive.

At-home collection offers men the opportunity to produce semen samples in the privacy and comfort of their own home, which offers significant benefit for those who are uncomfortable with or have difficulty producing a sample in the office. Depending on the test, patients can then either mail in the sample for analysis or platforms have even been developed to allow an at-home analysis of sperm concentration. Previously, the World Health Organization recommended that semen be analyzed within 1 hour of collection due to decreases in motility and morphology (27) . Recent studies, however, suggest that sperm motility and morphology appear to be largely stable, and results are highly correlated over a 1-to 2-day delay from the time of collection to allow for expedited shipping of a sample (26) .",

            "text": "Despite the clear advantages of improved access to testing and reduced patient anxiety or stress, there are several unique concerns with the at-home semen collection kits in particular. First, consumers need to be aware that the technique with which the sample is collected may have a significant impact on the results. For example, the presence of saliva or certain lubricants or failure to collect the entire ejaculate may falsely lower the parameters. Second, consumers may be responsible for key processing steps before mailing the sample, and failure to perform these correctly may also deleteriously impact results. Subtle decreases in parameters because of these factors may be very significant for men with low-normal values and may cause alarm in men who may indeed have normal results in a clinical setting. Third, routine semen analysis is subject to considerable interobserver variability and has been difficult to standardize, particularly with regard to the quantification of concentration and morphology. Thus, results may be highly dependent on the quality of the laboratory, andrologist, or the automated testing platform that analyzes the sample (27) . Finally, the results of semen analysis are also often nuanced, making self-interpretation of results difficult without the guidance of a reproductive physician. Individual semen analysis parameters, even if abnormal, may be weak indicators of a man's fertility potential. Therefore, tests that market analysis of only 1 or a couple parameters, such as only sperm concentration, may be misleading. Rather, a composite of the parameters together has the greatest clinical significance (28) .",

Direct-to-consumer tests are here to stay, particularly with the current COVID-19 pandemic, when many patients may think twice about entering a physician's office and prefer an at-home option to initiate an evaluation. We are now increasingly seeing patients in the clinical setting who already bear results or diagnoses from DTC testing. Some patients may even have already decided to pursue particular treatments such as oocyte or embryo cryopreservation or IVF on the basis of self-interpretation of results. It is remarkable to see more and more patients empowered to make reproductive decisions and seek care to try to ensure their family-building goals as a result of DTC testing. But, as the demand for reproductive medicine increases and we continue to battle a sea of misinformation from media and internet outlets regarding fertility and reproductive health, we need to ensure that assisted reproductive technologies are practiced both ethically and judiciously. It is, therefore, imperative that we are educated regarding the pitfalls of DTC testing so that we can best counsel and serve our patients along their reproductive paths.",
