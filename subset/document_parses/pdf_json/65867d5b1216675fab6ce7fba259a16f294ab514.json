Nurses completed the Individual Workload Perceptions Scale-Revised, which is a selfadministered questionnaire consisting of 29 items on a five-point Likert-type scale. For the translation, the scale was first translated into the Greek language (forward translation) and then into the English language (backward translation) and culturally adapted. For the study of the construct validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed, while the criterion of the convergent validity was between the five factors of the scale. To study the reliability, the method of test-retest was performed while Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to study the internal consistency of the scale. Data analysis was performed via the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).",

The test-retest method showed that there are no significant differences between the first and the second measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.990, p < 0.001).

            "text": "A major factor that negatively affects the nursing work environment is the workload. The workload can be categorized as physical or mental. The mental workload is related to the processing of information in a short period. Nurses use their mental abilities to communicate with patients and their families, assess the disease, perceive any changes in the health status of patients, and intervene and prevent any deterioration [3] . Many nurses work in rotating shifts, which is a combination of day and night shifts and includes eight-hour or 12hour shifts that alternate between the morning and night [4] . Nurses adapt to cyclical working hours, communicate, and discuss with colleagues about patients. The variety of problems that arise during the shift, the constant changes of thinking about the various tasks of the department, and the differences from patient to patient exceed the requirement for simple nursing care [5] . Unfortunately, all these mental and physical requirements that are necessary for the practice of nursing are ignored by the managers [6] . Therefore, nurses, as healthcare professionals, need a supportive work environment, which maximizes the effectiveness in treating diseases, the quality of care, nurses' well-being, and job satisfaction [7] . Many characteristics of the work environment affect nurses' job satisfaction. Organizational factors include organizational structure, policies and procedures, management systems, and working conditions [8] . Social factors include peer relationships, workgroups, and opportunities for interaction [9] . In the context of social interaction, the phenomenon of role conflict is very common, in which other individuals or groups with whom nurses interact have conflicting views or expectations. A common type of role conflict is role overload, in which many expectations are addressed to a nurse at a time. The conflict of roles is a result of the fact that nurses are forced to engage in activities other than nursing due to the lack of nursing staff and secretarial support. The performance of non-nursing duties in combination with the negatively charged work environment leads to increased levels of work-related stress and disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome and burnout. As a result, nurses' satisfaction and intent to stay at work are affected [10, 11] .",

Based on the above, the focus of nursing research is on an effort to understand the perceived nursing work environment. Psychometric tools are used to measure the perceived nursing work environment, especially in magnet hospitals. The most commonly used questionnaires to measure the perceived nursing work environment is the original Individual Workload Perception Scale (IWPS) [12] consisting of 46 items, the Individual Workload Perceptions Scale-Revised (IWPS-R) [13] consisting of 29 items, the Nursing Work Index [14] , and the Perceived Nursing Work Environment instrument [15] . The above instruments emphasize the nursing work environment and its dimensions such as the workload, management style, support from peers and managers, perceived productivity, and positive scheduling climate. In Greece, the Nursing Activity Score has been validated as a first attempt to measure the nursing workload [16] . It refers to categories of duties performed by nurses, but it does not emphasize the support by managers or peers, workload, and job satisfaction. For this reason, the researchers chose the IWPS-R as it is short in comparison to the original version and studies the above domains of the nursing work environment.",

The IWPS-R is a self-completed questionnaire rated on a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree) and five dimensions of nurses' perceptions of work environment: (i) Manager Support (support by their supervisor, eight items), (ii) Peer Support (support of nurses among themselves, six items), (iii) Unit Support (support from the supplies, resources, and services they need, six items) (iv) Workload (perceptions on workload, six items), and (v) Intent to Stay (it reflexes the outcome of nurses' workload perception and measures the tendency to stay at work, five items). The total score range between 29 and 145. Four states (11, 13, 22 , and 23) are scored inversely. The higher the score, the more positive the perceptions. The sum of the states provides the overall nursing satisfaction score. It has been used in several studies [19, 20] among nurses and has been translated into the Taiwanese language [21] with very good reliability.

To study the structural validity of the scale, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. Regarding confirmatory factors analysis (CFA), the model tested was equivalent to the original factorial structure of the IWPS-R as proposed by the authors. As suggested in Table 3 , this model presented a reasonably good fit to the data. Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) was higher than 0.8 and lower than 0.9; comparative fit index (CFI) was close to 0.9, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.064 and lower than 0.10. Overall, our CFA confirmed the five-dimensional structure of IWPS-R. As far as convergent validity is concerned, a correlation was conducted between the factors of the IWPS-R through the coefficient r. There is a positive correlation between all the domains of the scale (p < 0.001). The highest value of r is 0.794, while the lowest value is 0.320 ( ",
