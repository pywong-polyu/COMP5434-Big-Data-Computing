Plasmids coding a codon-optimized spike lacking the last 19 amino acids of the C-terminal end (S\u039419) known to avoid retention at the endoplasmic reticulum 12 were obtained by gene synthesis or customized site-directed mutagenesis (GeneScript) and contained the following mutations: lineage A (reference sequence), lineage B (D614G), lineage B.1.1.7 (\u039469-70, \u0394144, N501Y, A570D, D614G,   P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H), lineage P.1 (L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T,   E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I) and lineage C.37 (G75V, T76I, \u0394246-252, L452Q, F490S, D614G, T859N). Each pseudotype preparation was cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at room temperature, quantified using the HIV-1 Gag p24 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems), aliquoted in 50% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at -80 \u00baC until use. Different amounts of pseudotyped viruses (as determined by the levels of the HIV-1 p24 protein) were used to infect HEK-ACE2 cells and 48 hours later, firefly luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) in a Glomax 96 Microplate luminometer (Promega).",

The L452R mutation has been shown to confer immune escape to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as convalescent plasma [13] [14] [15] [16] . Moreover, the L452R mutation has also been shown to increase viral infectivity 16 and our data suggest that the L452Q mutation present in the Lambda variant might confer similar properties to those described for L452R. Interestingly, the 246-252 deletion in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Lambda Spike is located in an antigenic supersite 17-20 and therefore, this deletion might also contribute to immune escape. Moreover, the F490S mutation has also been associated with an escape to convalescent sera 13 . Consistent with these antecedents, our results indicate that the spike protein of the Lambda variant confers immune escape to neutralizing antibodies elicited by the CoronaVac vaccine. Whether the Lambda variant also escapes to the cellular response shown to be elicited by CoronaVac 9 is still unknown. We also observed that the spike protein of the Lambda variant presented increased infectivity when compared with the spike protein of the Alpha and Gamma variants, both of them with reported increased infectivity and transmissibility 21,22 . Together, our data show for the first time that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant confer escape to neutralizing antibodies and increased infectivity. The evidence presented here reinforces the idea that massive vaccination campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation rates must be accompanied by strict genomic surveillance aimed to rapidly identify new viral isolates carrying spike mutations as .

Given that 78.2% of the people inoculated with a complete scheme received the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac from Sinovac Biotech (Appendix Figure 1), we sought to investigate the impact of the spike mutations present in the Lambda variant on the neutralizing capacity of antibodies elicited by this vaccine. For this, we generated HIV-1-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses carrying the spike protein from the Wuhan-1 reference lineage (Wild type; lineage A), the D614G mutation (lineage B), and the Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7), Gamma (lineage P.1) and Lambda (lineage C.37) variants. During virus preparation, we consistently observed that cells infected with the pseudotyped virus carrying the Lambda spike produced significant higher bioluminescence values when compared to the D614G mutant or the Alpha and Gamma variants indicating an increased infectivity driven by the Lambda spike protein (Figure 1 and Appendix,",
