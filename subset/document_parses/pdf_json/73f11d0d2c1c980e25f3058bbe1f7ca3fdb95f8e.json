            "text": "Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has been a global public health crisis in 2020 (Getty et al., 2020) . To isolate the COVID-19 transmission, many countries have required citizens who may have been exposed to the virus to self-isolate either at home or in professional quarantine facilities. To control community spread of the pandemic, China promulgated restrictive \"unprecedented public health\" nationwide home quarantine measures Wang et al., 2020) . As of April, China's home quarantine initiative had received positive feedback and had been successful in curbing the COVID-19 transmission, which was consequently praised by the World Health Organization. Three months after the initial outbreak, many people in many countries were still unable to work or exercise as normal, and the pandemic had not only resulted in significant global deaths, but had given rise to mental health problems such as stress and anxiety in both COVID-19 patients and unaffected healthy citizens (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Roy and Tripathy, 2020) . In particular, when in a long-term quarantine situation, many people developed negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, frustration, and the psychological panic caused by negative news. Therefore, from a policy point of view, understanding the impact of this pandemic on public mental health and life satisfaction (Brooks et al., 2020) and elucidating the public's mental health concerns under mass quarantine measures could provide a valuable reference for the best ways to prevent infections in countries in which the COVID-19 situation is serious.",

The traditional medical reason for isolation was to limit the activities of groups that may have been exposed to an infectious disease by separating those with the disease from those who did not have the disease to reduce the risk of infecting others (CDC 2017) . To control the spread during the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented home quarantine and/or social distancing. Different from traditional medical quarantine, home quarantine and social distancing required all people to self-quarantine and observe social distancing rules in specified places for a certain period of time. While medical quarantine isolates the infected from the uninfected, self-quarantine and social distancing measures seek to block the spread of disease in the community (Gensini et al., 2004) . Quarantine has been used for centuries as an effective preventative measure to deal with infectious disease outbreaks such as cholera and plague (Brooks et al., 2020; TWU et al., 2003; Mandavilli, 2003; Barbera, 2001) .",

The pandemic required all cities in China to enforce large-scale quarantine, with the thousands of people returning to or leaving China also being forced to isolate themselves in domestic or state-owned facilities. There were some precedents for these types of measures; for example, during SARS in 2003, some metropolitan areas in China and Canada were isolated, and during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, whole villages in many West African countries were isolated. The use of quarantine has been proven to prevent the virus spread to varying degrees and allowed time for measures to be developed to prevent and treat the virus. However, studies on isolated people who experienced SARS or other public health crises found that the mental health impacts after quarantine varied significantly (Blendon et al., 2004; Caleo et al., 2018; Desclaux et al., 2017) .",

Studies have found that anxiety and depression were significantly related to the occurrence of viral diseases (Coughlin, 2012) , and that large scale social quarantine can aggravate anxiety, fear of claustrophobia, feeling of a loss of control, and unfounded rumor propagation . In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, people reported many mental health issues, such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks and even self-harm (Liu et al., 2003) . Therefore, it is necessary to carefully weigh up the advantages and psychological costs of mandatory mass quarantines. While successful quarantine as a public health measure minimizes the negative impacts associated with the disease, because quarantine measures restrict and disrupt people's work and life, it impacts their mental health and life satisfaction (De Lima et al., 2020) . In a study that compared the symptoms of post-traumatic stress in parents and children, it was found that the post-traumatic stress in isolated children was four times greater than in non-isolated children and 28% of the isolated parents reported mental health disorders related to psychological trauma compared to only 6% of the non-isolated parents (Sprang and Silman, 2013) . The COVID-19 global family isolation situation of an unknown duration has resulted in increased stress, anxiety and depression and disrupted sleep (Altena et al., 2020) . Limited evidence found that in a Hong Kong study the long-term social quarantine and home quarantine at the beginning of the pandemic caused the anxiety level of local people to gradually increase (Cheung et al., 2020) . Previous studies have shown that when large-scale quarantines are imposed, the mental health of people experiencing the quarantine can be affected to varying degrees, with recent studies having examined the mental health differences between individuals experiencing quarantine and those not in quarantine, and the mental health of whole groups experiencing quarantine (Sprang and Silman, 2013; Bai et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2008; Brooks et al., 2020) . Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is proposed;",

During the pandemic, because different groups had different attitudes towards the quarantine, the impact also varied. For example, because of the long-term unemployment resulting from the pandemic, many people had little to no income coming into the household, which meant that economic pressure became of the main daily sources of pressure. Recent studies have also found that workers whose incomes had been affected by the quarantine were more likely to have high levels of anxiety and depression than those whose incomes had not been affected (Taylor et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2016) . However, the mental health issues experienced by college students may have lessened because the pandemic reduced academic and competitive stress. Erickson (1994) found that with age, people's cognition and emotional experiences were more rational and less likely to be affected by the external environment. Therefore, as age assists in psychological development, in the face of a major crisis, children and adolescents are possibly not as resilient as adults. In addition, when the sample object is a mixed group, the intra-group difference can be larger. However, although the influence of irrelevant variables on demographic statistics can be controlled to a certain extent, it also has a certain influence on the research results. From this discussion, Hypothesis 2 is proposed;",

Table 2 shows that the Fail-safe N for quarantine and anxiety, depression and stress were respectively 3259, 2064 and 1407, that is, additional studies were needed to negate the important relationships between quarantine and mental health and its indicators. The corresponding ratios for the four insecurity factors were all much greater than one, which indicated that the sample was representative and there were no publication deviations. The p values for the Egger's Intercept in the three result variables were respectively, 0.24, 0.39, and 0.19, which were not significantly different from zero (p > 0.05), which also indicated that there were no publication biases in the quarantine and mental health associations. Table 3 shows the results of the heterogeneity tests between the quarantine, mental health and subgroup relationships. The Q-test for the effect values between the studies was significant (p < 0.001), that is, the meta-analysis effect values were heterogeneous. The I-squared value was between 86.01 and 87.70%, which indicated that the true variation for the effective quantity accounted for 86.01 and 87.70% of the total variation, and that random error accounted for only a small proportion. Form Higgins et al. (2003) to judge heterogeneity, it indicated that there is heterogeneity, which showed that it was appropriate to choose random effect model for the next analysis; An H-squared > 1.5 also indicated heterogeneity between studies, the formula for which was H-squared=Q/(K-1). The results also suggest that the difference of estimated values between different studies may be interfered by some research characteristics, and a reasonable discussion can be made on the moderating variables that affect the relationship between isolation and mental health. The Tau-squared value was found to be between 8 and 12%, that is, 8%~12% of the effect quantity variation between the different studies could be used to calculate the weights.",

From Cohen (1988) reference criteria for the interpretation of correlation coefficient sizes, r\u22640.1 was considered a small effect size, r=0.25 was considered a medium effect size, and r\u22650.4 was considered a large effect size. As the correlation coefficient between quarantine and mental health was found to be between 0.1 and 0.25 in this study, a moderately weak positive correlation was found. However, because the Cohen coefficient was based on qualitative analyses, it can be highly subjective. Therefore, after consulting Gignac and Szodorai (2016) , which systematically and quantitatively analyzed the correlation sizes in 708 meta-analysis reports on individual differences, the low, medium, and strong correlations were set at r = 0.1, r = 0.2 and r = 0.3. Based on these criteria, the correlation coefficients between quarantine and mental health ranged from 0.1 to 0.2, which indicated a moderate positive correlation, that is, quarantine was positively correlated with anxiety, depression and stress.",

The relationship between quarantine and anxiety was identified in many studies Jeong et al., 2016; Baiano et al., 2020; Casagrande et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) and the meta-analysis found that compared with other mental health factor measurements, quarantine had the highest correlation with the anxiety factors (r=0.152, p < 0.001, see Fig. 2 ), with the longer the quarantine time, the higher the anxiety level. Studies from SARS to COVID-19 found that home isolators' anxiety increased because the reports on the daily increases in the number of confirmed cases and deaths, their lack of knowledge about the disease, and the effects of anxiety in other people close to them made them believe that they or their family members were at risk of contracting the disease or even dying at any time (Cheng et al., 2004; Maunder et al., 2003; . People living alone were found to have an increased risk of anxiety symptoms, possibly due to reduced social interactions during quarantine , at which time they could also experience fear, depression, and boredom, which could be further exacerbated by interruptions in information flows (Thienkrua and Warunee, 2006; Cheng et al., 2004) . However, some studies also commented that while social media was able to provide up-to-date information during the quarantine/isolation period, social media's \"always online\" situation could exhaust people and damage mental health, with high-risk negative social media information possibly contributing to heightened anxiety (Xiang et al., 2020; Purohit et al., 2018) . The results of this study did not support Al Sulais, 2020; , who all found that anxiety levels decreased with quarantine time.",

After some time in quarantine, changes in a person's physiological activities such as diet, sleep quality and physical exercise could increase depression levels Chew et al., 2020) . Previous studies also identified a correlation between a perception of physical health and depression (Hossain et al., 2019) . Another explanation could be that because social quarantine reduces interpersonal communication, people may feel lonelier, which could lead to heightened feelings of depression (Ge et al., 2017; Weiss, 1973) . During the SARS pandemic, studies also found that people who isolated had higher depression levels (Chih-Hung et al., 2010) . found that ordinary people without formal education were more likely to suffer from depression in a study on the immediate psychological responses of the general population in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Lei et al. (2020) found that high depression levels were associated with a lack of psychological support or counseling from the community or government agencies. However, several studies found that people with depressive symptoms tended not to ask for help (Lienemann and Siegel, 2019; Rickwood et al., 2005) because of shame or embarrassment, with their determination to look after themselves being a barrier to seeking help (Gulliver et al., 2010) . Therefore, raising public awareness about these types of mental disorders could greatly assist in encouraging people to seek help (Suka et al., 2020) .

A significant relationship between quarantine and mental stress was found (r=0.125, p<0.001, see Fig. 4) , which was consistent with many of the examined studies Mullen and Smyth, 2004) . It was also found that people who were forcibly isolated were more likely to suffer from discrimination and exclusion by neighbors and other groups, with quarantine stigma being found to be very common (Karamouzian and Hategekimana, 2015) , which in turn could aggravate an isolated person's stress and result in mental health deterioration (Robertson et al., 2004) . The social marginalization and exclusion associated with this stigma was also observed to damage both emotional and physical health (Goffman, 1963; Mullen and Smyth, 2004; Twenge and Crocker, 2002) . Long-term quarantine was found to lead to an increase in the frequency of family conflicts, with these family conflicts being one of the key stressors for consequent mental health problems (McCloskey et al., 1995) . Some studies also found that although there was some evidence that the quarantine experience was negatively related to mental health, quarantine could also have beneficial psychological effects as it reduced the risk of infection and the fear of being infected (Locke et al., 2019; Al Sulais et al., 2020) .",

However, a small number of articles found no significant or negative correlations between quarantine and mental health. For example, Wang et al. (2020) focused on the relationship between length of stay at home and anxiety, depression and stress in the initial and peak outbreak periods, and found that the length of time spent at home was not related to anxiety, depression, stress or PTSD symptoms four weeks after the initial outbreak; Guo et al. (2020) , and reported similar results. This could possibly be explained by the \"psychological typhoon eye effect\", which describes the psychological response to disasters using the meteorological typhoon eye phenomenon, that is, the air around the typhoon rotates violently, while the air inside the typhoon is relatively weak. Similarly, the closer the time period was to the high-risk stage, the calmer the individuals appeared to be (Li et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2008; Lindell and Earle, 1983; Maderthaner et al., 1978) . This phenomenon was verified by many of the pandemic studies Liu et al., 2020) . A similar phenomenon was observed during the SARS pandemic in Hong Kong, when it was found that the anxiety of the residents in the pandemic areas was lower than the residents in the non-pandemic areas (Xie et al., 2003) .",

When the sample was a mixed group, the quarantine had the highest regulatory effect on anxiety, depression and stress; when the result variable was anxiety, the regulatory effect on children and adolescents was second only to the mixed group and the regulatory effect on adults and college students was equal; when the result variable was depression, the adjustment effect on college students as a sample group was the weakest; and when the result variable was stress, the adjustment effect on adults was higher than on college students. The main reason for these differences was that when the sample population was a mixed population, the study population was more extensive and complex, and the organization more dispersed. Because of the heterogeneity and sample object differences, the research results varied (Li, 2003; Rao, 2005) . Children were found to have a stronger moderating effect on anxiety than the adults or college students, which was related to the age and psychological development. Erikson (1994) noted that with an increase in age, as individual cognition and emotional experience are more rational, people are less likely to be influenced by the external environment. Previous studies have found that crisis events can cause more serious psychological trauma in children than in adults (Alisic et al., 2011; North et al., 2018) . The moderating effect of being an adult on the three outcome variables was found to be generally higher than for college students because the different adult ages and types impacted the research results. Previous studies have shown that different ages, genders, occupations, etc. have different effects on psychological statuses . For example, it has been found that the higher the education level of college students, the greater the degree of negative emotions . Due to the influence of the quarantine, normal education and teaching activities were hindered, which may have been one of the reasons the college students felt under greater pressure, that is, the uncertainty regarding their academic progress may have been a significant stressor for young people (Roy et al., 2020) .",

This may have been because the COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis and the mental health issues resulting from the anti-pandemic quarantine measures were common to all countries (Banerjee and Rai, 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Most of the reviewed articles reported depression, anxiety, emotional disorders, psychological stress, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, fear, stigmas, low self-esteem, lack of self-control and other adverse mental health consequences during the social quarantine period (Giallonardo et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al., 2020; R\u00f6hr et al., 2020) . Because the virus appeared in China first, the Chinese government were the first to adopt rapid and effective quarantine measures to ensure citizen security, and after the quarantine ensured that the public were aware of the COVID-19 situation. Psychological assistance systems were also established as soon as possible to alleviate the negative emotions in the public as much as possible (de Lima, 2020; Song, 2020) . In other countries, during and after the quarantine period, many measures were rapidly adopted to alleviate any continuing mental health problems (Ng, 2020; Kang et al., 2020; Pieh et al., 2020) .",
