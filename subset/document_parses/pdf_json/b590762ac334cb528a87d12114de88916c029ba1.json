Unfortunately, the transformation of old to new manufacturing technologies is a slow process. Therefore, the manufacturing industry is currently in a situation that the legacy and modern manufacturing systems share the same factory environment. This heterogeneous ecosystem leads to challenges in systems scalability, interoperability, information security, and data quality domains. Our former research effort concluded that blockchain technology has promising features to address these challenges. Moreover, our systematic assessment revealed that most of the ISA95 enterprise functions are suitable for applying blockchain technology. However, no blockchain reference architecture explicitly focuses on the ISA95 compliant traditional and smart manufacturing systems available in the literature. This research aims to fill the gap by first methodically specifying the design requirements and then meticulously elaborating on how the reference architecture components fulfill the design requirements.",

Similarly, most enterprise tier applications are proprietary systems that are not customizable to accommodate a chain structure. Therefore, the heterogeneous nature of ISA95-CTS and SMMS ecosystem leads to an isolated system design where the blockchain content is not replicated outside the ledger tier. In other words, the ledger tier does not distribute the ledger content nor share the blockchain transaction verification operations with the remaining tiers. The ledger isolation might be perceived to conflict with the blockchain distributed system design philosophy. However, this restriction only concerns tier abstraction. The containerized design approach allows the reference architecture to allocate blockchain node instances wherever needed. In fact, in order to ensure high availability and low latency, each tier should contain multiple full-nodes within the same network zones where the respective ISA95 actors are segmented.",

            "text": "Use-case 1, node-to-ledger communications: As per the design requirement, the proposed blockchain reference architecture should enable M2M communications and autonomous decision mechanisms. The ISA95-CTS is built upon a classical server-client application architecture, and the actors described in the automation pyramid ( Figure 2 ) can generally only talk to one layer above or below. Given the ISA95 standard's hierarchical structure, achieving M2M communications within the ISA95-CTS boundaries is not a straightforward integration pattern. Nevertheless, a ledger-based data communication pattern can overcome the hierarchy problem. This is because the ledger acts as a data integration layer that enables any ISA95 actor to directly communicate with any other actor within (or even beyond) the ISA95 ecosystem. For instance, a level 4 enterprise resource planning (ERP) application can directly talk to a level 0 sensor. Likewise, an IIoT device, such as a sensor, can communicate with another IIoT device on the same automation level without requiring to cascade the data through upper layers. Also, a smart-contract can initiate autonomous M2M actions by coupling sensors and actuators located on level 0. In fact, Afanasev et al. (2018) [21] studied M2M communication in the SMMS context and explored the smart-contract features with a proof of concept (POC) implementation. Their research article also focused on the M2M micropayments concept through blockchain. applications and blockchain smart-contracts. The data outside the blockchain system are made available to the blockchain environment through data Oracles. Rest interfaces, SQL database connectors, file parsers are just a few data sources that blockchain oracles can read and fetch data. Likewise, off-chain applications might also need to get data from the distributed ledger. Reverse oracles become handy to emit (write) the blockchain state data to the external world [25] . Figure 5 visualizes \"Use-case 4\" as follows. Figure 2 demonstrates \"Use-case 1,\" enabling all ISA95 actors to directly read and write to the blockchain. Because all designated actors can talk to each other through the blockchain, device interoperability becomes a key enabler to realize the proposed architecture. The following sections address interoperability requirements.",

Ledger-to-ledger communication use-case typically occurs when two or more entities happen to utilize separate blockchain installations that are expected to operate or execute a cross-chain smart-contract. Although there are many challenges to realize the ledger-to-ledger use-case, the most prominent issue is maintaining internal data state consistency when the data is modified or created across multiple ledgers.

In the second dimension, off-chain data integrity and signing operations are elaborated. Gaetani et al. (2017) [29] identified and categorized major threat actors against the corporates' data integrity. These actors can be in two orders: Externals such as hackers, and internals, such as employees, contractors, and federated business partners. Hashing and signing are powerful cryptographic operations to ensure data integrity with the condition that the hash and signature values are kept in a tamper-proof environment. Traditional blockchain applications store the data on the blockchain along with the hash and signature values, which ensures immutability and integrity through the linked data structure. The drawback of this approach is that the ledger grows too fast. Especially considering a large corporation with many workstations and servers with billions of files in various sizes, replicating all off-chain data to a ledger is not scalable.",

Instead of fully onboarding and replicating individual data elements (files, documents, etc.) to the ledger, the reference architecture proposes only to protect the data hash and signature values. This concept can be exemplified as follows. According to the ISA95 functional model, the \"Quality Assurance 6.0\" function feeds the production standards to the \"Production Control 3.0\" function. The production standards constitute detailed information on all aspects of production processes. Hence, the file containing the standards might allocate significant space on disk and cannot be feasible to distribute over the ledger. The reference architecture realizes this scenario by distributing big files over alternative ways (e.g., P2P, network share, etc.) and protecting the integrity digests (hashes) to the files on the blockchain (similar to \"use case 3\"). Once the data file is received, the \"Production Control 3.0\" function generates the file hash and compares it with the hash value protected on the ledger. In case more security is demanded with source authentication and non-repudiation, file signature values signature can be secured on the blockchain. Besides the foundational security features, sharing the signature values via the ledger also mitigates man-in-the-middle attack risks. D. Automation: Because automation and autonomous decision mechanisms are qualified as the most distinctive characteristic of SMMS, the reference architecture is required to embody strong automation capabilities, which can be realized with the help of the smart-contracts as follows. First and foremost, the smart-contracts execute the pre-implemented application logic in a tamper-proof environment. With this given property, deterministic process automation is ensured. Second, not all business flows and processes are expected to operate inside the blockchain ecosystems. In fact, corporates adopting the ISA95 standard are large enterprises composed of a broad range of systems. In such cases, the smart-contracts can emit event messages via reverse oracles, contributing to the autonomous decision mechanisms outside the blockchain ecosystem.",

It is possible to enable TEE with either hardware-based (e.g., Intel software guard extension-SGX) or software-based (e.g., Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization-based security-VBS) providers. Both alternatives segment the data run time from the rest of the operating system with isolated containers (i.e., enclaves). Furthermore, all data outside the enclave is fully encrypted, and a third party formally verifies the code segment that processes the data inside the enclave.

The reference architecture embodies four distinct security controls to protect the transactional data as follows. 1. Permissioned blockchain: The first layer of data protection is ensured with the permissioned blockchain deployment topology that allows only authorized actors to access the environment. Besides, the file system encryption is enabled for all peers and nodes per default. 2. Channels: The data is replicated among all peers and nodes, even with the permissioned installation. The blockchain distributed design approach leads to data confidentiality and privacy concerns. The reference architecture addresses these challenges through virtual segmentation techniques. For instance, IHF can establish multiple virtually segmented ledger instances (i.e., channels) to isolate data among ledgers. The channels are also protected with robust access control mechanisms. Thus, only authorized and explicitly privileged actors can access the data residing on the blockchain [9] . According to Chowdhury et al. (2019) [33] , IHF with channel capability significantly stands out from the rest of the blockchain platforms from the privacy standpoint. The ISA95 functional model defines 12 core enterprise functions to organize the manufacturing process [15] . Hence, an enterprise applying the reference architecture for all core ISA95 functions should establish at least 12 channels. 3. On-chain transaction encryption: There are several ISA95 business flows (e.g., \"Product Cost Account 8.0\" function) that process sensitive data such as trade secrets and financial transactions. For scenarios when sensitive material is processed or transported over the ledger, the reference architecture protects the data at rest with robust symmetric encryption algorithms. Figure 9 illustrates the data encryption schema for the reference architecture. The design assumption is that the ISA95 actors at level 4 and 5 can encrypt the data on the application side, whereas the rest may need an intermediary agent software for encryption.",

In their proof of concept work, the sensitive data is distributed through a network-attached file share without applying encryption, similar to the \"Use-case 3\" described in previous sections. The reference architecture attempts to address location restrictions by preserving the sensitive data on an IPFS based network storage that is geographically situated as per regulatory requirement. However, in order to add an extra layer of protection, individual data elements are encrypted, and hash to the files are distributed through the ledger. Figure 9 depicts the architectural components of the proposed off-chain encryption solution.

            "text": "(b) Smart-contract and smart-contract state protection: An ordinary blockchain system saves and replicates smart-contract logic (source code) and state data (an outcome of an execution) across the blockchain by default. In other words, the execution results, state data, and smart-contracts are visible to all peers and nodes. However, some business engagements and contractual terms are trade secrets, and unauthorized access is not acceptable. The reference architecture addresses these challenges with a two-folded approach adopted from IHF [9] . Firstly, any sensitive state data can be selectively encrypted, as shown in Figure 9 . The encryption restricts access to the actors who have the decryption key. Secondly, sensitive smart-contracts can be deployed to an isolated containerized node where replication is prohibited. This deployment strategy decreases the availability of particular smart-contract in favor of increasing security. (c) User data protection: Traditional blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin, are infamous for preserving user privacy and transactional anonymity. In other words, the transactions are traceable and linkable to a user profile. The reason is that traditional blockchain technologies rely on certificate-based authentication standards, such as X.509, and the certificate-based schemas are not able to hide nonessential attributes from the certificates. Hence, user privacy is profoundly disrupted [40] . Furthermore, actors always sign transactions with the same private key, and, even if the identities are secret, all the transactions signed by the same actor are still linkable to each other. Besides, in the case of identity theft, all the transactions committed by the stolen key become fully traceable and available to the public. Camenisch et al. (2013) [40] proposed a novel privacy-preserving attribute-based authentication (PPABA) schema to overcome the anonymity and transaction likability shortcomings. The strength of PPABA is that the issuer can generate separate tokens for each user attribute, and a user can produce (derive) unique transactional tokens (without requiring issuer interaction) that are verifiable with the issuer's public key. Because the user forges a new token for each transaction, it is not feasible to trace back and associate the transactions with an individual even after a private key compromise. Besides, the PPABA schema ensures higher anonymity by excluding unnecessary user attributes from the transactional data. Commercially available IBM Identity Mixer (IIM) and Microsoft U-Prove provide pluggable PPABA libraries that can constitute a basis to ensure user data protection for the reference architecture. Figure 10 illustrates the reference architecture components adopted from IIM [38] to support the PPABA schema. Each ISA95 actor in Figure 10 is assigned a membership service provider (MSP) that secures certificates and private keys. According to the example shown in Figure 10 , the CA issues a certificate to an ISA95 actor with three attributes, Attr_1, Attr_2, and Enr_ID. However, because the particular transaction in question does not require all identity attributes, the actor derives an entirely new certificate token only with Attr_2 to be able to sign the transaction with minimum identity information. The most significant advantage of the PPABA schema is that the signed transaction is still verifiable with the CA's public key, even if the signature is based on a key that is not issued by the CA.",

Each ISA95 actor in Figure 10 is assigned a membership service provider (MSP) that secures certificates and private keys. According to the example shown in Figure 10 , the CA issues a certificate to an ISA95 actor with three attributes, Attr_1, Attr_2, and Enr_ID. However, because the particular transaction in question does not require all identity attributes, the actor derives an entirely new certificate token only with Attr_2 to be able to sign the transaction with minimum identity information. The most significant advantage of the PPABA schema is that the signed transaction is still verifiable with the CA's public key, even if the signature is based on a key that is not issued by the CA. On the permissioned blockchain platform side, Monero anonymizes the transactional origin and destination to protect privacy. The anonymization process produces a group signature that obfuscates the signer's identity with the CryptoNote algorithm. Furthermore, a one-time generated stealth address hides transactional sources [41] . b. Logging, traceability, and auditability:",

The ABAC model features context-aware, dynamic, flexible, and centrally auditable fine-grained access control capabilities. A traditional ABAC infrastructure is composed of several components. However, the policy decision point (PDP) and policy enforcement point (PEP) are crucial components of the blockchain reference architecture. The fine-grained access control policies are implemented with the XACML language and executed on PDP. PEP sends and receives access requests and responses from/to PDP. Smart-contracts interface the external environment through Oracles. Thus, a smart-contract developed to perform access control functionalities can interact with the external ABAC infrastructure through PEP, which merely acts as a data Oracle for the blockchain environment. An example access request could be \"Sensor XYZ would like to write temperature information to the ledger on channel ABC on Sunday at 03:28.\" Depending upon the access policy, PDP can respond with either a \"permit\" or \"deny\" message.

            "text": "\u2022 Sustainability: The importance of sustainability has become significant in recent years, especially since UN member states' SDG adaptation. Leng et al. (2020) [4] studied SDGs and correlated \"Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production\" and \"Goal 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure\" with sustainable manufacturing practices. They also identified that distributed manufacturing, including crowd and clustered manufacturing, are the primary driver for these goals and surveyed different BCTs available in the literature from the manufacturing sustainability perspective. The survey conducted by Leng et al. highlighted that the BCT could enhance efficiency, reduce the system complexity with high interoperability, increase the manufacturing system security, boost operational transparency with traceability and ensure end-product authenticity. Jabbour et al. (2020) [48] surveyed the sustainability aspects of various supply chain networks. They concluded that BCT and big data analysis methods could improve the agriculture industry's efficiency by shortening the supply-chain networks. Likewise, BCT could enhance the accuracy of procurement forecasts in the agriculture industry. Wamba et al. (2020) [49] empirically explored dynamics between blockchain determinants and supply chain performance. Their research justifies the positive relationship between blockchain adaptation and supply chain performance through increased transparency. In a nutshell, the reference architecture's design specifications are compliant with the BCT empowered sustainability outcomes presented by multiple researchers. Thereby, the reference architecture constitutes a crucial blueprint to enable the manufacturing industry to meet UN SDGs.",

Due to insufficient economic opportunities, the gap between developed and underdeveloped regions is getting wider. Thereby, social and economic inequality has become prevalent in developing countries. Schuetz and Venkatesh (2020) [5] studied India and financial inclusion from this perspective. Their research highlights that rural India can gain momentum on economic and social development by expanding global supply chain networks to the remote villages. Schuetz and Venkatesh also proposed to adopt blockchain-based technologies to extend the global supply chain coverage towards the rural areas. Thereby, blockchain-enabled ISA95 enterprise functions focusing on supply chain use cases can support resolving the social and economic inclusion issues in developing countries.",

Furthermore, we analyzed BCT's proposition and proposed to empower the ISA95-CTS and SMMS with BCT to address the identified challenges.We also meticulously assessed BCT's suitability for the manufacturing processes defined by the ISA95 standard as part of another research work [2] . We identified that 49 out of the 85 sub-functions and 7 out of the 12 core functions defined by the ISA95 standard are suitable for applying BCT.Besides technical prospects, we also justified how the reference architecture can foster supply chain viability, sustainable development in manufacturing, and social and economic inclusion in rural areas.Despite the BCT proposition to empower the manufacturing industry, our literature survey could not identify a reference architecture focusing on ISA95-CTS and SMMS. The mentioned scientific gap constitutes the foundation of this research effort.The reference architecture in this research is developed by following the IEEE 1471 software architecture standard principles. Firstly, the outcomes of previously committed studies formed the basis for defining the functional and non-functional system requirements. Secondly, the reference architecture logical view and corresponding components are specified. Lastly, each system requirement is methodically analyzed, and thorough literature research is conducted to identify building blocks of the reference architecture to realize the requirements, as shown in Table 1 . Our study concludes that the proposed reference architecture is equipped with all necessary technologies and system components to meet or even exceed the ISA95-CTS and SMMS requirements.",

Thus, a prospect research paper(s) may focus on other enterprise architecture views. Therefore, the blockchain reference architecture for the ISA95-CTS and SMMS will evolve towards an enterprise blockchain architecture model for the ISA95-CTS and SMMS. In this context, the implementation view is specifically essential to produce and collect quantitative scientific results, which will be the basis to confirm the reference architecture's applicability.Moreover, this research paper proposes to leverage various cutting-edge technologies that have not been researched in the BCT context. For instance, extending the access control capabilities of BCT to support ABAC through an off-chain PDP is an entirely new proposition that has not been studied before.Lastly, this research paper briefly listed three main categories of soft dimensions of adopting the reference architecture, which can be explored further as individual research topics.
