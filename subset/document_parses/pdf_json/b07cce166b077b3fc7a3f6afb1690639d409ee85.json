None of the current published studies, which focus on diagnosis of COVID-19, have taken this seasonality into account. Objective: To develop predictive algorithm, which estimates the probability of having COVID-19 based on symptoms, and which incorporates the seasonality and prevalence of influenza and influenza-like illness data. Methods: Differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and influenza relies on demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender), and respiratory (eg, fever, cough, and runny nose), gastrointestinal (eg, diarrhea, nausea, and loss of appetite), and neurological (eg, anosmia and headache) signs and symptoms. The analysis was based on the symptoms reported by COVID-19 patients, 774 patients in China and 273 patients in the United States. The analysis also included 2885 influenza and 884 influenza-like illnesses in US patients. Accuracy of the predictions was calculated using the average area under the receiver operating characteristic (AROC) curves. Results: The likelihood ratio for symptoms, such as cough, depended on the flu season-sometimes indicating COVID-19 and other times indicating the reverse. In 30-fold cross-validated data, the symptoms accurately predicted COVID-19 (AROC of 0.79), showing that symptoms can be used to screen patients in the community and prior to testing. Conclusion: Community-based health care providers should follow different signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID-19 during, and outside of, influenza season.",

Table 1 shows the prevalence of various signs and symptoms in (1) Table 1 also shows that cough and fever were the most common features of COVID-19. They occurred, respectively, in 45% and 75% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Differential diagnosis is also based on the relative frequency of occurrence of these 2 symptoms in influenza and influenza-like illnesses. A symptom that is common to all 3 diseases would be a poor diagnostic indicator. For example, fever is common in COVID-19 but fever also occurred among 70% of patients with influenza and 33% of patients with influenza-like illnesses. Table 1 shows that fever increased the odds of COVID-19 by a factor of 1.30 during the widespread flu season and a factor of 2.26 during sporadic flu occurrence, or outside the flu season. Thus, while fever is a predictor of COVID-19 during the flu season, it is an even stronger predictor outside of the flu season. This is not the case for cough. Table 1 shows that cough is common among COVID-19 but not as common as in influenza patients. Surprisingly, during the widespread flu season, cough reduced the odds of COVID-19 (likelihood ratio of 0.63). A patient that presents with cough during the flu season is more likely to have influenza than COVID-19. Outside of the flu season, when flu only occurs sporadically, the situation changes. Then, presence of cough is nearly uninformative, with a likelihood ratio close to 1.",

It is instructive to see the accuracy of simple rules based on common features reported by the CDC.

To calculate the odds ratio for COVID-19, one would multiply the likelihood ratios (LR) associated with the individual's features to estimate the odds ratio of COVID-19, and then use the derived odds ratio to calculate the probability of COVID-19. Suppose during the flu season a Black (LR = 2.189), male (LR = 1.322) patient presents with no respiratory or no gastrointestinal symptoms. This Black, male patient reports a loss of sense of smell/taste (LR = 28.6) and headache (LR = 0.109). Since only neurological symptoms are mentioned, then only those symptoms are used and respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms that are absent are omitted. Then, the odds of COVID-19 increase by 2.189 \u00d7 1.322 \u00d7 28.6 \u00d7 0.109 = 9.02 folds. The probability of COVID-19 can then be estimated by dividing the odds ratio by the sum of 1 and that odds ratio (ie, 9.02/(1 + 9.02) = 0.90), which is a relatively high probability of COVID-19.",

As this article was prepared, the United States was experiencing a shortage of diagnostic tests and a delay in reporting of laboratory tests, often in excess of 1 week to provide the results. Furthermore, there is a limited availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests globally. Differential screening and diagnosis are urgently needed, particularly as the epidemic emerges in lowerincome settings that traditionally have limited access to diagnostics tests. During the H1N1 pandemic, reporting of cases shifted early in the epidemic from laboratory-confirmed to symptom-based diagnosis. In the case of COVID-19, this may also happen. This article provides a novel method for screening and diagnosing COVID-19 based on patients' reported signs and symptoms and, thus, may assist clinicians make better triage decisions, especially when tests are not available.",

Clearly, these simple rules, while focused on common features of COVID-19, are problematic. In this article, we provide a statistical model that has an average AROC of 0.79. In comparison, laboratory parameters such as neutrophil, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea levels in serum white blood cells, and serum albumin levels accurately predict COVID-19 with AROCs ranging from 0.835 to 0.839. 23 Laboratory tests are more accurate than symptom screening. In the absence of laboratory test results, review of signs and symptoms using our algorithm provides reasonable fallback methodology.",

A community diagnosis can be used to make appropriate triage decisions, for example, to decide which health care facility to transfer or refer a probable COVID-19 patient to, which entrance of the facility, and what personal protective equipment health care workers should use during the patient's visit. Differential screening and diagnosis can also be used to inform clinical management of the patient while test results are pending or unavailable. Finally, the algorithm can inform who should be prioritized for testing during times of test shortages. In a climate in which there is shortage of reliable diagnostic tests or inconsistency in test result turnaround times, patients whose symptoms suggest high probability of having COVID-19 can be presumed to have COVID-19. Those patients whose symptoms suggest low probability of COVID-19 or individuals with inconsistent clinical presentations can be prioritized for testing.",

Symptoms during the first week, second week, on hospital admission, and posthospital admission may be different. 24 For example, fever may not be a common symptom diagnosed in the community-based settings but is more prevalent in hospitalized patients; estimates of fever among COVID-19 patients grows from as low as 40% on hospital admission to as high as 95% during hospitalization. 25 Some studies show that in 20% of test-positive COVID-19 patients, fever was absent during the first 2 weeks but emerged later in the infectious period. 26 The temporal variations in the occurrence of symptoms during the course of the disease make diagnoses in community settings more difficult. Our study has not differentiated between the first and second weeks of onset of symptoms in the community. Future research needs to clarify the timing of the symptoms. In the meantime, until more data become available, the proposed differential diagnosis method can help clinicians in the community-based settings respond to the currently unfolding public health emergency.",
