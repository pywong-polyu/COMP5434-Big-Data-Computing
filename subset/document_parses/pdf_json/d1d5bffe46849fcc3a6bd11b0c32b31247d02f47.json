The statistical analysis was performed with MedCalc Statistical Software (MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend, Belgium) and MetaXL software (Epi-Gear International Pty Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia).

The risk of developing headache/migraine episodes was hence the highest for recipients of AstraZeneca vaccine (odds ratio, 3.50; 95% CI, 3.12-3.93; P < 0.001), followed by those receiving Pfizer vaccine (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.47-3.13; P < 0.001), whilst the number of voluntary reports for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was even lower than the daily frequency of headache disorders in Italy (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.68; P < 0.001) (Fig. 1) . The cumulative rate of headache/migraine episodes after receiving all COVID-19 vaccines was 2.25-fold higher than the daily frequency of headache disorders (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.83-6.11).",
