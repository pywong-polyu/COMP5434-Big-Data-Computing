The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective social skills interventions that can be delivered directly via telehealth. The Cool Versus Not Cool procedure has continually been documented as effective within the literature. However, its reported use has been limited to in-person delivery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure conducted via telehealth to teach three children diagnosed with ASD to change the conversation when someone is bored. The results of a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline across-participants design demonstrated that all three participants reached the mastery criterion in four to eight sessions. Responding generalized to another adult for two of the three participants, and all three participants maintained correct responding. Social validity measures indicated the skill was important to teach, the intervention was acceptable and effective, and the telehealth format was an acceptable replacement for in-person intervention for these three participants.",

All sessions occurred via VSee, with the two adults participating from their apartments while the experimenter was located in a separate apartment within the same complex. Targeted skills were those that the participants expressed interest in learning (e.g., light cooking, money management). The results of a multipleprobe across-behaviors design indicated the intervention was effective for teaching both participants three self-selected skills. Furthermore, each of the skills maintained, and both participants indicated satisfaction with the procedures and outcomes. In another recent example, Ferguson et al. (2020) evaluated the effectiveness of discrete-trial teaching with instructive feedback delivered via telehealth to teach tact relations to six children diagnosed with ASD. The participants were divided into dyads, and each participant had their own primary (i.e., targeted tact) and secondary (i.e., instructive feedback) targets. All sessions occurred via Zoom, with the interventionist and participants located in different physical locations. The results indicated that all participants acquired primary and secondary responses, and five of six acquired primary and secondary observational responses (i.e., the targets for the other participant in the dyad).",

One intervention approach that may transfer with little effort to a telehealth model is the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure. The Cool Versus Not Cool procedure is an approach to developing social discriminations through what is commonly referred to as discrimination training via instructor demonstration. Role-plays are then used to increase the likelihood the learner will engage in the desired social skill in the terminal environment. More specifically, the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure consists of five components: (a) labeling the targeted social skill (e.g., the \"cool\" skill), (b) the interventionist modeling the cool (i.e., the desired topography of the behavior) and not cool ways (i.e., the undesired topography of the behavior) to display the social skill, (c) providing the learner with the opportunity to label the model as cool or not cool and why the model was cool or not cool, (d) the learner role-playing the cool way, and (e) providing reinforcement or feedback based on learner responding throughout. It should also be noted the terms \"cool\" and \"not cool\" were selected based on the learners with whom the procedure was originally developed. Those learners were using those words already, and it was thought that using those same words to describe desired and undesired social behaviors would increase the likelihood of generalization and maintenance in the terminal environment . As such, interventionists should determine the labels that will be most appropriate based on the learners with whom they provide intervention (e.g., \"dope\" and \"weak,\" \"good choice\" and \"bad choice,\" or \"appropriate\" and \"inappropriate\" may be more appropriate and effective than \"cool\" and \"not cool\" for some learners).",

Each of the supervisors noted the participants' challenges with changing the conversation when someone is bored (i.e., identifying possible boredom cues and changing their behavior as a result). Therefore, the main dependent variable for all three participants was changing the conversation when someone is bored. Changing the conversation when someone is bored was divided into seven component steps (see Table 2 ). Participant engagement in each of the steps was assessed during probe sessions (described later). The mastery criterion was defined as the participant engaging in each of the steps in the outlined order across three consecutive probe sessions.

This design was selected for its flexibility when conducting research in applied settings, which a concurrent multiple-baseline design does not allow. This flexibility was even more necessary for conducting research during an ongoing pandemic. Traditionally, within a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design, baseline phases are predetermined, and participants are randomly assigned to each baseline length as they become available (Watson & Workman, 1981) . Similar to previous studies (e.g., Cihon et al., 2019) , an additional criterion common within multiple-baseline logic was used in this study in an attempt to improve the strength of the design. Participants progressed from baseline to intervention once a stable level of responding was observed during baseline. That is, we extended baseline sessions for the next participant until intervention effects were observed with the previous participant if necessary. Therefore, predetermined baseline phases and assignment were not used within this study. Experimental control was demonstrated when the intervention resulted in changes in a participant's behavior without changes in the remaining participants' behavior during baseline sessions (Baer et al., 1968; Carr, 2005) . Furthermore, although the nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design permits participant removal if stable responding is not obtained, no participants were removed from this study for this or any other reason.",

Interrater agreement was collected on the primary dependent variable on 37.5% of all sessions across participants and conditions. Agreements were defined as both raters scoring the same response on a step for changing the conversation when someone is bored. Disagreements were defined as one rater scoring one response and the other rater scoring a different response on a step for changing the conversation when someone is bored. Interrater agreement was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of disagreements plus agreements and dividing by 100. Interrater agreement across all three participants was 100% during baseline, generalization, intervention, and maintenance conditions. The fidelity of the interventionist's implementation of probes and the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure was also assessed. Matthew Lee (previously described) independently observed 35.7% of probe sessions and 37.8% of intervention sessions across all participants and conditions to score the interventionist's behavior. Correct interventionist behavior during probes consisted of (a) engaging the participant in a conversation about a preferred topic, (b) engaging in nonvocal boredom cues following 2 min or a minimum of four exchanges, (c) responding in accordance with the task analysis if the participant engaged in the steps of the targeted skill, and (d) ending the probe by saying \"thanks\" if the participant did not engage in the steps of the targeted skill.

Winston's responding within the teaching context did not generalize to a very similar context. It may be the case that a social skills intervention delivered via telehealth poses limitations that are absent in an in-person intervention. The social context involved in the delivery of interventions via telehealth differs greatly from the social context of in-person delivery. This difference could make developing the desired stimulus controls for social behavior difficult. For example, there may be subtleties within in-person interactions that become part of the contingencies that are not present or possible in a telehealth context. This difference may vary based on the social skill that is targeted, and future research may more efficiently evaluate this by targeting multiple skills within a study.",

These results provide more support for clinicians to use the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure when delivering social skills intervention via telehealth. This may be a welcomed result with respect to the numerous considerations required when making the move to telehealth (Cox et al., 2020) . It should be noted, however, that there was a low response rate to the survey from the parent respondents, which may affect the interpretation of the social validity data. Furthermore, clinicians should remain cautious and take into consideration individual differences, given the limited number of participants, skills, and social validity respondents within this study.",

First, although the interventionist conducted all sessions via Zoom, each of the participants had a staff member present at their location during all sessions who also assisted during the demonstration portion of the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure. This might not be possible in all situations. However, it is common for a parent or caregiver to be present during telehealth sessions. In these cases, a parent could fill the position of the staff member. Second, only one skill was Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure to teach a variety of social skills, and it is possible those results would extend to a telehealth context. Future research will be necessary to evaluate whether that is the case. Third, all the participants in this study had a previous history of receiving in-person social skills interventions including the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure, had some experience with direct intervention delivered via telehealth, and had rather well-developed repertoires (see Table 1 ). As such, the results may not generalize to other autistics/individuals diagnosed with ASD with less experience with the Cool Versus Not Cool procedure and intervention delivered via telehealth or with less developed repertoires. Fourth, due to the setting in which the study occurred, a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used. Although nonconcurrent multiple-baseline designs control for threats to internal validity (Harvey et al., 2004; Watson & Workman, 1981) and are common within applied research, a concurrent multiple-baseline design may be desired by future researchers. Finally, no measures of generalization were collected for inperson settings. These measures were not included for two primary reasons. First, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the number of people the participants contacted in person was deemed potentially harmful. Second, given the increase in the use of virtual environments, targeting social skills potentially useful in those environments may be useful in its own right given the increased use of communication technologies among young persons (Manago et al., 2020) . Nonetheless, the results should be taken with caution with respect to the generalization of effects to in-person settings.",
