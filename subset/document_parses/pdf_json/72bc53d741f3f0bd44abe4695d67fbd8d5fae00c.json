            "text": "Since the appearance of the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic has emerged affecting millions of people worldwide. Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on comorbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a \u00df The Author(s) (characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parietooccipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas. Brain biopsies performed showed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial injury, with no evidence of vasculitis or necrotizing encephalitis. The functional prognosis during the hospital period was unfavourable in 73.9% (17/23 modified Rankin scale 4-6), and age was the main predictive variable (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.012-2.225; P = 0.043). Our series shows cerebrovascular disease incidence of 1.4% in patients with COVID-19 with high morbidity and mortality. We describe pathological and radiological data consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy caused by endotheliopathy with a haemorrhagic predisposition.

Taking into account the high incidence of COVID-19 transmission in our area during this period, for those patients undergoing studies of other anatomical regions a supplementary chest CT was routinely performed. In addition, all patients admitted to the hospital during this period had a chest X-ray. In cases with pulmonary involvement, typical patterns of COVID-19 were sought (Simpson et al., 2020) , and severity was evaluated using the established severity criteria . In those patients with an intraparenchymal haemorrhagic component, the volume of the haematoma was calculated using the ABC/2 method (Curtze et al., 2014) . The CHARTS classification (Charidimou et al., 2017) was used to categorize intracerebral haemorrhages (superficial, deep and infratentorial, uncertain or multiple). Macrohaemorrhages were identified and defined as \u22654 mm in size (Radmanesh et al., 2020) . Patients treated by means of revascularization procedures or surgery received another control CT at 24 h to rule out haemorrhagic transformation or re-bleeding. MRIs were performed based on medical judgement, using a Philips Ingenia CX/Achieva dStrem 1.5 T machine. Endovascular procedures for mechanical thrombectomy were performed on a Philips Azurion 7 B 20/15 biplane angiograph by a single neurointerventionist and an anaesthetist under light sedation. Data on procedure times, number of passes and the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) recanalization scale were collected. Surgically treated patients were managed in the intensive care unit. Those patients who did not require invasive treatment were admitted to the stroke unit if they had low suspicion of COVID-19 infection (negative tests and chest CT). The rest were admitted to conventional beds. The clinical prognosis during hospital admission was determined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scale, a favourable prognosis considered to be mRS \u2264 2, intermediate mRS = 3, and unfavourable mRS 4-6.",

Proportions were compared using \u03c7\u00b2 square tests or Fisher's exact test, when the sample was too small. The comparison between quantitative variables was conducted by means of the Student t-test, or the Mann-Whitney U-test when the data did not follow a normal distribution. For continuous numeric variables, box-and-whisker plots were plotted, indicating mean, median, IQ range, maximum, minimum and outlier values. The independent effect of the variables on prognosis was evaluated with a binary logistic regression model, considering poor prognosis during hospital admission as a dependent variable (mRS 4-6 = bad outcome). Predictors that were found to be related to poor prognosis (P \u2264 0.05) or with proven prognostic relevance were entered into the model, using stepwise backward selection. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each variable. The Cox and Snell R square and Nagelkerke R square values were used to provide information about the amount of variation in the dependent variable. Sensitivity analysis with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was conducted to evaluate the overall fit of the data and the influence of the main independent variables. To identify the cut-off point with the best discriminative value of the continuous variable, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out. A value of P \u2264 0.05 was considered significant throughout the study.",

There are several explanations for this delay: the population may have avoided attending hospitals because of confinement measures, neurological symptoms may have been masked by the infection itself, or a delay in access to neuroimaging or revascularization techniques could be responsible (Oxley et al. 2020) . We have also detected a reduction in the number of admissions for lacunar-type stroke (5.3% in the global series), which contrasts with previous figures (13%) in our published database (S\u00e1nchez-Larsen et al., 2016) . In contrast to what has been reported by other groups in Spain (Montaner et al., 2020; Rudilosso et al., 2020; Tejada Meza et al., 2020) , the number of admissions, mechanical thrombectomies, and stroke code activations was similar during the study period and our historical cohort. However, it should be noted that our work reflects what happened over a longer period of time and in a more advanced phase of the pandemic than those mentioned above. Although our observed incidence of CVD in COVID-19 patients is slightly lower than reported (Mao et al., 2020) , deferred medical care, and the lower number of patients admitted with lacunar infarctions could have underestimated the actual incidence of CVD.",

Interestingly, our findings are consistent with the recently described phenotype in a small series, which shows a high incidence of large vessel occlusions, posterior territory predisposition, and multi-territory involvement (Beyrouti et al., 2020) . Massive cytokine release and thrombogenesis may contribute to this, as they stimulate the accumulation of coagulation factors in plasma and on the surface of endothelial cells, inducing platelet aggregation in the endothelium. In particular, it is believed that IL-8 and TNF\u03b1 may stimulate the release of hyperreactive Von Willebrand factor (VWF), and IL-6 inhibits its division (Bernardo et al., 2004) . Levels of all these molecules (VWF, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1) are elevated in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Huang et al., 2020) , and recently VWF has been identified as a marker of endothelial damage in this disease (Escher et al., 2020) . Furthermore, other authors have argued that the mechanisms of endothelial activation and vascular damage may be the main underpinning of lung damage seen in SARS-CoV-2 (Ciceri et al., 2020) .",

This patient, like most patients in the haemorrhagic subgroup (Figs 3C, 4D and 5E ), was intubated, developed characteristic vasogenic white matter oedema and had risk factors (Hefzy et al., 2009; Orhun et al., 2019) that could have contributed to this oedema (sepsis and immunoregulatory drugs, among others). There is no certainty that this leukoencephalopathy is related to the infection, however, we cannot rule out a direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2, taking into account that ACE2 is the functional receptor of the virus (Hamming et al., 2004) , and which has been previously identified in the endothelial cells of brain arteries and veins (Baig et al., 2020) . In fact, selective blocking of ACE2 receptors causes the development of neurogenic hypertension as a result of increased parasympathetic tone and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (Fen et al., 2010) , a process leading to loss of self-regulation, alteration of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral hypoperfusion and vasogenic oedema (Bartynski, 2008) .",

These findings have been described as endotheliitis in a postmortem analysis of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Varga et al., 2020) , and associated with cellular apoptosis via the expression of caspase 3. Conversely, increased endothelial activation at the microcirculation level in response to the release of cytokines and poor cleavage of VWF can induce bleeding (Crawley et al., 2011) . In our cases, very few foci of inflammation were found, so we propose that the root cause of the lesion is not an endotheliitis, but an endotheliopathy with extended neuropyl impairment. Notwithstanding, exposure of the basement membrane of brain vessels due to this endotheliopathy may well lead to secondary inflammation albeit of somewhat limited extent.",

The classification of Patient 23 on an individual basis (PRES-type leukoencephalopathy) may be somewhat confusing, however, he did not meet clinical-radiological criteria for inclusion in the ischaemic or haemorrhagic groups. Moreover, a patient with high angiographic suspicion of vasculitis ultimately was not subjected to histological study due to his good clinical evolution. The confirmatory microbiological analyses performed on the patients (PCR, serology) were variable. Although the specificity of these tests is high (Li et al., 2020b) , it is not clear that the reliability is superior to chest CT Rubin et al., 2020) , therefore, considering the epidemiological context, in cases of high radiological suspicion, we continued the investigation as with any other SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the same therapeutic protocol was applied.
