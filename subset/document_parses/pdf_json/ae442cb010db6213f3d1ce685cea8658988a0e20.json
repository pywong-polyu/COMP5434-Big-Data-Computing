None of the patients were of sub-Saharan African descent or had Fitzpatrick's skin phototype of 5 or 6. These findings contrast with the usual visits to our institution -30% of our outpatient population are of sub-Saharan African descent, with phototype 5 or 6.",

            "text": "Two recruitment biases may be cited as reasons for the 'ethnic' differences in relation to COVID-19-chilblain-like lesions, but none of them seems plausible. Poor visibility of erythema and inadequate training in recognizing skin manifestations in richly pigmented skin is unlikely to be pertinent in this setting, given that chilblain-like lesions are usually symptomatic and hence unlikely to be missed/neglected by either patients or doctors. Socio-economic factors precluding access to dermatological care cannot explain the virtual absence of chilblain-like lesions in African-American and Hispanic patients in New York. 4 Finally, data from all the published studies support ethnic differences in relation to the incidence of COVID-19-related chilblain-like lesions. Vascular skin reactions of poor prognosis, such as ecchymosis or necrosis, were not reported in the study by Lester et al. 1 nor in a short case series of COVID toes in people of Fitzpatrick skin types III to V. 5 In most of the published series, chilblains appeared to affect young patients with discrete to mild symptoms of COVID-19 and no microbiological or serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has led Hebert et al. to refute any link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and such lesions. 6 According to these authors, several biases could contribute to the concomitance of COVID-19 and chilblains outbreaks; however, such biases could hardly account for the aforementioned differences between patients of diverse ethnic backgrounds.",

According to this hypothesis, the restriction of chilblain outbreaks primarily to people of European ancestry may be due to genetic factors (e.g. those impacting immune response) that predispose to the development of both chilblains and milder forms of COVID-19.",
