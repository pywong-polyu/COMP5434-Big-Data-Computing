The first of these vaccines were made available to the public in the month of December 2020. 2 As of July 22, 2021, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in the United States (US), 162,174,165 (48.8%) were fully vaccinated and 187,216,168 (56.4%) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 3 Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic surges on with recent the latest variant, Omicron, proving to be more quickly transmissible than their predecessors. 4 With new COVID-19 strains predominating in unvaccinated and immunocompromised populations, prevention of disease transmission by promotion of vaccination and boosters is imperative. 5 The CDC affirms vaccination as the best public health protection measure to decrease COVID-19 transmission and possibility of new variant emergence. 6 As medical students represent a significant part of the health-care community and are active members of the COVID-19 response, we aim to explore the factors influencing international medical students' intention of receiving COVID-19 vaccination.",

            "text": "Currently, no studies exist that investigate Caribbean, international medical student COVID-19 vaccine intention; however, recent studies analyzed the influence of factors on the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in other populations university and medical students. A recent survey of 168 US medical students found that only 53% indicated willingness to participate in a clinical trial, and 23% of the students were unwilling to receive the vaccine immediately upon Food and Drug Administration approval. The researchers attributed these findings to a lack of trust in information from public health experts, politicization of the vaccine, and concerns about side effects. 7 Another study surveyed 10,843 Iranians and applied the Theory of Planned Behavior to evaluate specific constructs such as attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention related to COVID-19 vaccination. Fear of COVID-19 was significantly positively associated with behavioral control, subjective norm, attitude, and perceived COVID-19 infectability to explain COVID-19 vaccination uptake. 8 A study among Chinese university students used Protection Motivation Theory assessed the role that various information places on the perception of COVID-19 vaccination. Receiving information regarding COVID-19 from a medical professional had a greater association with vaccination acceptance than information received from colleagues or online. Additionally, the perceived severity of COVID-19 positively correlated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. 9 A recent cross-sectional survey on Chinese university students found that increased students' knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccination and risk perception were positively associated with their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Additionally, positive student attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccine uptake and the presence of past influenza vaccination uptake are positively associated with the intention to be vaccinated for Collectively, these studies suggest that successful vaccination campaigns must evaluate distinct factors, such as demographics, beliefs, past vaccinations, and behaviors, in order to increase vaccination among future medical professionals. The current study utilizes the longstanding behavioral theories, the Theory of Planned Behavior and Protection Motivation Theory, to explore the constructs of attitude, subjective norms, intention, and perceived severity, to assess their relation to COVID-19 vaccination among international, Caribbean medical students, respectively. Our objective is to explore and identify behavioral theoretical constructs and potential factors impacting COVID-19 vaccination intention among international medical students, a population previously unstudied. With the survey findings, we aim to aid in recommendations and development of vaccination policy and programs that may increase COVID-19 vaccination in international medical students and future health-care professionals.",

We created original questions based on the Theory of Planned Behavior constructs including attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention. 18 Additionally, we selected constructs from the Protection Motivation Theory to develop questions related to threat appraisal and perceived risk. 19 Ethical approval was granted by the medical school's Institutional Review Board (IRB) before the survey was administered (IRB approval: IRB study #: 2021-2).",

Beliefs such as the COVID-19 vaccination trials were rushed, or that the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with adverse side effects were significantly associated with no intention to receive the vaccine within 6 months.

Specifically, Qiao et al. 26 assessed general participant demographics, COVID-19 exposure, attitude toward general vaccination, and perceived risk such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity of COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19 of college students. Lucia et al. 7 surveyed 168 medical students to assess previous immunization behavior, attitudes and perception of vaccination, current knowledge and interest regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and personal experience with COVID-19. Our research presented a more comprehensive survey than the past two studies as we included the impact of social norms, comparative risk, perception that vaccine trials were rushed, perception of vaccine adverse effects, and impact on completion of medical school tasks. Additionally, our study had double the sample size of Lucia et al. 7 . This study went beyond previous studies in examining medical student attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination trials, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine price, vaccination convenience, herd immunity, comparative risk, and possible aid of vaccination in completion of medical school.",

            "text": "As a result of this study, we have identified several strategies that could increase the vaccination intention among international medical students. For example, recognition of beliefs regarding adverse effects and rushed vaccination trials within vaccine campaigns may better address the concerns of medical students and target immunization strategies to increase intention to vaccinate among future medical health professionals. Furthermore, increasing male participation in vaccine uptake by a targeted communication campaign, or social media marketing campaign, 31, 32 encouraging practice of COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and encouraging vaccination for influenza may lead to increased COVID-19 vaccination intention among medical students. Specifically, these targeted social media marketing campaigns could incorporate messages to heighten risk appraisal, such as risk perceptions and perceived severity, and have been found to increase behavioral intention and activation. 33 Moreover, mandates or strong institutional encouragement may increase the belief that being vaccinated would aid in completion of tasks during their international medical education and increase intent to vaccinate. Additionally, increased education and curriculum development regarding COVID-19 vaccination trials, mRNA vaccine science and adverse effects may alter perception that the trials were rushed, or that adverse effect rates are high. Finally, educational and marketing strategies that impress upon international medical students the increased risk for contracting COVID-19 may increase intention. Lastly, medical students possess the knowledge and expertise to learn and disseminate such knowledge to their peers, families, patients and the general public that may increase overall COVID-19 vaccination.",
