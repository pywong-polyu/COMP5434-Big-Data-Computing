            "text": "Access to general dental care is essential for preventing and treating oral diseases. To ensure adequate spatial accessibility for the most vulnerable populations, New York State mandates a ratio of one general dentist to 2000 Medicaid recipients within 30 min of public transportation. This study employed geospatial methods to determine whether the requirement is met in Manhattan by verifying the online directories of ten New York managed care organizations (MCOs), which collectively presented 868 available dentists from 259 facilities. Our survey of 118 dental facilities representing 509 dentists revealed that significantly fewer dentists are available to treat Medicaid recipients compared to MCO directories. The average dentist-to-patient ratio derived from the MCO listings by the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method was 1:315, while the average verified ratio was only 1:1927. \"Phantom networks\", or inaccurate provider listings, substantially overstated Medicaid dental accessibility. Surprisingly, our study also discovered additional Medicaid providers unlisted in any MCO directory, which we coined \"hidden networks\". However, their inclusion was inconsequential to the overall dental supply. We further scrutinized dental care access by uniquely applying six \"patient-centered characteristics\", and these criteria vastly reduced accessibility to an average ratio of merely 1:4587. Our novel evaluation of the spatial association between poverty, dental care access, and phantom networks suggests that Medicaid dental providers wish to be located in wealthier census tracts that are in proximity to impoverished areas for maximum profitability. Additionally, we discovered that poverty and phantom networks were positively correlated, and phantom providers masked a lack of dental care access for Medicaid recipients.",

Unlike the non-spatial global correlation tests, this spatial test considers the correlation of poverty and Medicaid dental access between census tracts and their neighbors instead of within the same tracts. Specifically, for this study, non-respondents were excluded to determine the greatest accuracy of actual phantom network clustering. Although some dental facilities were located in the excluded census tracts, all of them were within 700 feet of at least another tract boundary. Therefore, a spatial join was performed between the facilities containing phantom providers and the census tracts, encompassing all the facilities within 700 feet of each census tract to account for facilities within those excluded tracts. The optimized hot spot analysis was conducted using the poverty data and the number of phantom dentists and phantom facilities to discover any clustering or \"hot spots\" for these phenomena at a 90% confidence level or higher. We then identified locations where both poverty and phantom network hot spots occurred simultaneously. Global Moran's I Spatial Autocorrelation reports were generated to discover the overall clustering or dispersion patterns of poverty numbers, count of phantom facilities, and sum of phantom dentists.",

There were 118 facilities that responded to the survey, which represented 509 dentists as listed in MCO directories. The facility response rate was 45.6%, encompassing 58.6% of the listed providers. Quite often, survey phone calls were transferred to authorized staff having the best knowledge about the services provided. Each facility had its own organizational structure, and receptionists, assistants, or administrative personnel mainly responded to survey questions. At 37 facilities or approximately 30% of responding offices, dentists directly answered the questions, and this was primarily true for solo practices or those with less than three providers. Most individual dentists were designated as phantom providers, constituting 351 dentists or 69% of the providers, while 17.3% of dentists were eliminated, comprising 88 dentists. Merely 70 dentists were verified as Medicaid providers, which is 13.8% of the MCO-listed dentists. The primary reason for elimination was due to dentists serving only children, comprising 49 providers (9.6%), while 39 dentists worked less than half-time (7.7%), as shown in Table 3 . \"Dentists do not work at listed facilities\" was the primary reason that dental providers were deemed to be phantom networks, totaling 113 dentists (22.2%), as seen in Table 4 . Dentists serving a limited population, consisting either of children enrolled at a specific school or nursing home residents, were the second-greatest cause of phantom status, comprising 92 dentists (18.1%). The third reason for phantom classification was that licensed dentists customarily did not treat any patients at the facility, consisting of 82 dentists (16.1%). Many of these providers merely supervised unlicensed dental school students treating patients, while a few dentists simply owned the practice, without providing patient care. As an aside, it was common for respondents to state that listed dentists had either left the practice or quit accepting Medicaid payments several years prior, while a small number of dentists never worked at the listed MCO facility, to the knowledge of office staff. Interestingly, a fourth category of dental providers emerged over the course of this research. The phenomenon of a \"hidden network\" is a term coined by this study to describe the opposite of a \"phantom network\" ( Table 2 ). It was found that six dentists did in fact accept MCO insurance plans, even though these data were unlisted in the plan directories. Notably, three directory dentists that refused the listed insurances, and were counted as phantom providers, did in fact accept at least one of the other nine Medicaid MCO plans, making the percent increase in verified dentists 12.9%. However, the addition of nine dentists as verified providers failed to significantly increase the Medicaid dental supply. Further information on breakdowns at the insurance plan level concerning dentist response rates and provider classification is included as Supplementary Materials online in Tables S1-S3.",

The breakdown of these characteristics is computed in the aggregate using facility-level data for 50 offices (Table 6 ). Only one facility placed caps on the number of Medicaid patients treated (2%), and three facilities limited treatment to adults (6%). The great majority, or 46 facilities, accepted new patients and provided a full range of services, or 92% of the verified offices contacted. It should be noted that six facilities indicated that they periodically, for short intervals, stopped and then restarted accepting new patients. These facilities were still counted if they were accepting new patients when surveyed. Additionally, a significant portion of verified dentists worked 40 h or more per week at 35 facilities (70%), and 35 facilities offered extended office hours (70%). Of the facilities offering extended hours, 21 offices (60%) did not remain open more than one hour past 5pm on weekdays, while 20 offices (57%) were open at least one day during the weekend. While a high percentage of dental facilities met at least one of the patient-centered characteristics, a mere 20 practices (40%) fully met all the applied conditions. The 2SFCA method established that the supply of patient-centered Medicaid dentists was substantially less than the verified dental supply, as confirmed by the one-sample t-test (Figure 1 and Table 5 ). As a result, the NYS-mandated ratio was no longer met. The resulting supply constituted a shortage of dentists in some census tracts according to the standard set by the U.S. Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA), in which a ratio of one dentist to 5000 people is designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) [40, 92] .",

However, this association was found at the county level rather than at the finer census tract level. This grid clustering fell over the neighborhoods of Central and East Harlem (Figure 3) .

When adding these numbers to the previous figures, 90 respondent dental facilities had 351 total phantom providers. An interesting pattern occurred when all facilities with phantom providers were analyzed: the spatial association spread to another neighborhood and the previous relationship was preserved (Figure 3 ). Optimized hot spot analysis found a significant clustering of facilities with phantom dentists and area poverty on the Lower East Side, in addition to Central and East Harlem. The clustering of poverty was strongest in East Harlem and Washington Heights, with some tracts having a confidence interval of 99%. The clustering of facilities with phantom providers was strongest in one tract within the neighborhood of East Harlem South and one tract on the Lower East Side, having a confidence interval of 95%. However, even though the clustering spread into another neighborhood, the confidence interval was 90% for all other census tracts compared to the grid of 95% for purely phantom facilities at the county level. Nevertheless, when these facilities were weighted by the number of phantom dentists, the confidence interval increased from 95% to 99% in Washington Heights, strengthening the association. The Global Moran's I Spatial Autocorrelation results indicated a strongly clustered pattern for numbers of people in poverty and all facilities with phantom networks (Table 7) . Since the z-score between poverty and the count of facilities was 16.58, and the z-score between poverty and phantom dentists at these offices was 12.34, there is a less than a 1% chance that these patterns are a random occurrence. The addition of any facility with phantom dentists strengthened the z-score of the spatial autocorrelation test for the clustering of facilities and poverty, while the z-score for the numbers of phantom dentists and poverty remained stable. Additionally, evaluating the raw numbers of phantom networks compared to the percentage of people having an income-to-poverty ratio under one [93] by neighborhood hotspot further supported the positive intersection of phantom networks and poverty (Table 8 ). There was a weak positive relationship between the numbers of impoverished people and phantom networks according to both the non-spatial Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho rank non-parametric correlation tests (Table 9 ). When analyzing exclusively phantom facilities, the tau score was 0.1141 while the Spearman's rho was 0.1485. When weighting these offices by the number of phantom dentists, the scores slightly increased to 0.1313 and 0.1768, respectively. When considering any facility with phantom providers, and then weighting these facilities by phantom dentists, the tau and rho scores modestly increased by over 10%, while the p-values remained significant. Thus, both spatially and non-spatially, there appears to be a significant correlation between phantom networks and poverty. ",

We began by analyzing the accuracy of listed dentists in ten managed care organization (MCO) online directories since this is the starting point for the publicly insured to find available dental care. Our hypothesis that MCO directories would present better access to dental care than the New York State (NYS) mandated ratio of one dentist to 2000 Medicaid enrollees within 30 min of public transportation time [66, 67] was affirmed. Nevertheless, after applying our exclusion criteria, we were astonished to find the NYS-mandated ratio was still met for verified dentists given that the 2SFCA supply was reduced by nearly 85%, with merely 15-17% of MCO directory providers remaining throughout the census tracts. Since the state's ratio simply represents the physical count of listed Medicaid dentists who are geographically accessible, it is arguably a limited standard for gauging dental care access and runs the risk of overestimating availability when considering public policy planning.",

The phenomenon of phantom networks, inaccurate provider listings, has been observed in both private and public insurance directories, traversing various health disciplines for over two decades [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . We were astonished to find that over two thirds of the dentists surveyed were classified as phantom networks. The leading cause was that dentists were absent from the listed facilities for either months or years prior, and, in some cases, they never worked at the facility at all. This suggests that MCO directories are failing to be updated on a regular basis, as required by law [94] . Further, MCO directories inaccurately list the level of care afforded to the low-income publicly insured, which creates inequities to accessing care from licensed general dentists, and policy efforts may want to provide transparency in online classifications (i.e., student dentists) describing available care. Our research aligns with the available literature scrutinizing inaccurate provider listings that limit accessibility or prevent availability of healthcare [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

NYS law requires insurance plans to update online directory provider changes or terminations within 15 days of notification [94] . Therefore, while more research is needed to address the persistence of phantom networks, we believe that the most effective solution would be a real-time database, in which dentists, rather than MCOs, would be required to update accepted insurances and participation status as necessary. Information would then flow firsthand from the dental provider and would provide an audit trail to ensure timely updates.",

NYS also pays MCOs a monthly capitation rate for each Medicaid recipient irrespective of dental services rendered, thus allowing them to retain any portion of publicly funded monies that are not consumed to meet the insured's covered services [96] . This may motivate MCOs to undertreat Medicaid recipients [97] [98] [99] [100] , as well as endeavor to dissuade enrollees with high maintenance needs from joining [101, 102] , or offer narrow network plans to limit accessibility. Additionally, MCOs are allowed to set provider payment rates within state contract boundaries, and this may result in low rates and less provider participation [98] . Policymakers may want to institute a refund requirement per insured for unused funds paid to MCOs when no services are rendered during a 12-month period.",

The spatial Multivariate Local Geary test revealed a positive relationship between dental care access and poverty numbers for most Manhattan census tracts. The test is based on the relationship between a census tract and its neighboring tracts. For a tract with a high poverty rate, if Medicaid dental access is also high in the surrounding neighborhood encompassing the six closest tracts, relative to randomly chosen tracts from the borough, the test will be positive. In contrast, the non-spatial Kendall's and Spearman's rank correlation tests found a weak negative relationship, without referring to any neighboring tracts. While these results may seem contradictory, they exactly reflect the notion that dental facilities are less likely to be located within high-poverty tracts, and instead are spatially scattered within their nearest neighbors. Dental providers, therefore, can offer services to Medicaid recipients in nearby impoverished census tracts, while being located in the more affluent tracts to maximize profits.",

Location decisions may be financially motivated rather than needs-based, thus leading to an inequitable distribution of health providers. In fact, economic segregation between people of low and high incomes has been increasing in American urban areas for over 30 years, and the New York metropolitan area is among the most economically segregated in the nation [113, 114] .

Both spatial and non-spatial tests revealed a significant correlation between people in poverty and the presence of phantom networks. The fact that both tests became more significant with a greater sample size between exclusively phantom facilities and facilities with any number of phantom providers suggests that the correlation is robust [115] . The presence of phantom networks in impoverished urban areas warrants further research to uncover the root causes of these phenomena and discover if they occur in other disadvantaged intraurban areas. Additional demographic variables, such as race or immigration status, may also be associated with phantom networks, and future research is needed to expand the knowledge about these topics.",

The 2SFCA method measured spatial accessibility from the perspective of general Medicaid acceptance as opposed to each individual MCO plan, which likely overestimated accessibility when narrow networks were present. When estimating the percent increase in the Medicaid population between 2017 and 2019, the increase was quantified as uniform instead of tangible across the census tracts.",

Measuring the availability of multiple patient-centered characteristics diminished the dental supply further due to dental provider restrictions, and this topic is relevant to understanding the service utilization of the publicly insured. Our analysis to measure the spatial association between poverty and dental care access is unique and revealed a complex relationship affecting the location decisions of dentists. Dental providers tend to be located in affluent communities near to impoverished neighborhoods to allow for a mixture of both private and publicly funded patients, serving both communities, thus ensuring profitability. This is further supported by the original finding of a positive correlation between phantom networks and areas of greater poverty. The combination of measuring dental availability and accessibility utilizing geographical methods to assess dental care access for the underserved offers new insights and data regarding an under-researched topic.",
