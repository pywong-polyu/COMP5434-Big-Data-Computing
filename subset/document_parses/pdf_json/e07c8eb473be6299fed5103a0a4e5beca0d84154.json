The purpose of this prospective, observational, single institution study is to evaluate surgeon and caregiver perspectives of TMEs during the pandemic. Methods Surveys were distributed to surgical faculty regarding perceptions of TME early during the pandemic and 2 months later. Caregivers (or patients > 18 years old) were asked after each TME to complete a survey regarding perceptions of TMEs. Results Surveys were distributed to 73 surgeons. Response rates were 71% initially and 63% at follow-up. Sixty-eight percent reported no prior TME experience. No significant differences were noted in the overall satisfaction. An inverse relationship between surgeon age and satisfaction at the follow-up survey was identified (p = 0.007). Additional surveys were distributed to 616 caregivers or patients (response rate 13%). Seventy-two percent reported no prior experience with TME and 79% described TME as similar to an in-person visit. Audiovisual satisfaction of the TME was higher in greater income households (p = 0.02). Conclusions Pre-pandemic experience with TME was low in both groups; however, experiences were perceived as satisfactory. Positive experiences with TME may encourage increased utilization in the future, although demographic variations may impact satisfaction with TME.

Application of this technology in surgical specialties has been met with mixed reviews due to the importance Jose Diaz-Miron and Sarah Ogle have contributed equally to this manuscript. of physical examination (PE) to accurately diagnose surgical conditions.

Seven days before the TEM, patients and caregivers received a communication through the MyChart platform prompting them to update their health and medication information. This was then confirmed by clinic medical assistants or nurses and updated in the chart prior to the TME, similar to an in-person visit. The VidyoConnect (Vidyo Inc, Hackensack, NJ, USA) software-based teleconference application, a HIPAA compliant platform, was used to connect providers and patients in a secure fashion. Prior to TME, technology support staff contacted participants and ensured proper functioning of the TME platform.

Caregivers and patients without email addresses were excluded. Familiarity with computer usage by caregivers and adult-aged patients was assumed for those participating in a successful TME due to the technology literacy required for these encounters.

Satisfaction for caregivers and patients was not associated with driving distance from clinic or income, however, audiovisual satisfaction during the TME was higher among caregivers and patients who reported higher household income suggesting a second \"digital divide\". Caregivers, patients, and surgeons would consider using TME in the future for certain visits. Barriers to implementations identified by surgeons included the need to perform an in-person PE, concerns over reimbursement in the long-term, and multi-state licensing requirements. To the authors knowledge there were no issues for reimbursement during the pandemic, however, faculty expressed this as a concern after cessation of emergency protocols. Additional concerns expressed by both groups included the need for interpreter services, issues with internet connectivity, and need for user-friendliness TME platforms. Caregivers, patients, and surgeons expressed similar views that TMEs would be optimal for simple consultations, straightforward follow-up evaluations, and for patients who live far from the healthcare facility. One \"digital divide\" highlighted in this study was the difference in age of surgeon and level of satisfaction with TMEs, with older surgeons being less satisfied with TMEs at the follow-up survey. These findings are consistent with a survey of 800 physicians in 2019 which found an inverse relationship between willingness to participate in TMEs and age [7] . Similar trends have been shown with past introductions of new technology into the medical field. For example, younger physicians were more likely to be \"early adopters\" and have a higher opinion of electronic medical records after initial introduction [8, 9] . Despite the association between age and satisfaction, there was no significant difference in surgeon TME preference at the follow-up survey. Additionally, it would not be surprising if the association of age and TME satisfaction dissipates with time as younger physicians are now exposed to TME in their training or early careers.",

Recently, several studies have published guidelines on physical examination during TMEs [21, 22] . Adult studies have shown reliable diagnostic accuracy of TMEs for multiple surgical specialties [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, pediatric patients represent a unique population who may not always be able to communicate to provide additional feedback that would otherwise assist the provider with the interpretation of the PE during TMEs, potentially limiting the utility of TMEs in this population [27] .",

Additionally, the caregiver/patient response rate was low, primarily female, and predominately preferred to respond in the English language; therefore, our results may not be generalizable to a larger population. Exclusion of caregivers and patients without email addresses also pose a limitation that is unavoidable based on the study design. Satisfaction ratings may be biased in the setting of a pandemic, as there may not be any other alternative to physician consultation; however, prepandemic studies have shown comparable high satisfaction rates [38] [39] [40] [41] . While there no in-person control group due to institutional limitations to type of visit, participants were asked to compare their satisfaction to previous in-person experiences. As the pandemic continues, longer follow-up between the surgical faculty surveys may produce differences in perceptions.",
