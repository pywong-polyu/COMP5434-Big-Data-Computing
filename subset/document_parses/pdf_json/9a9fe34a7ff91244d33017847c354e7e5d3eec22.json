Having been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), addressing COVID-19 requires the proper administration of medical services, among which effective vaccination cannot be over-emphasized [1] . This is in alignment with conventional wisdom derived from the fact that, aside from access to safe drinking water, no other interventions in the history of mankind have had significant impacts on reducing incidences of morbidity and mortality as vaccinations [2] . The World Health Organization (WHO) is therefore advocating for speedy interventions that would ensure access of every individual to COVID-19 vaccines, as a way of securing our collective existence given the severity of the ongoing pandemic.",

However, individuals with compromised immune systems can access non-live vaccines without risk, although their efficacy may be substantially sub-optimal [5] . However, due to several factors, addressing COVID-19 through vaccination presents some peculiar challenges. The first borders on several speculations on the emergence of the virus, many of which may influence acceptability of global efforts in addressing its spread. Specifically, there have been a number of conspiracy theories advancing the hidden international agendas throughout the COVID-19 saga, many of which are precipitating fears and vaccine hesitancy [6] .",

Presently, the information around COVID-19 vaccines has been diverse, and much of this information is spreading misleading rumors [9] . There have been underlying notions that COVID-19 vaccines may contain deliberate poisons that are meant to control global population [10] . In a recent study, 91% of the information obtained from several countries on the internet was classified as rumors [10] . These include the fear of being sick or dying after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination and that the vaccine is a messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) that may distort the sequence of human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), thereby turning them into mere prototypic beings whose genetic compositions may have been silently modified [10] .",

During the first round in 2020, 3249 households were successfully interviewed (2271 from urban areas and 978 from rural areas).

In addition, using a sampling frame that was based on those whose phone numbers or references phone numbers were provided during the 2018/2019 ESS also undermines the representativeness of the data. This is a result of the low penetration of telecommunication in rural Ethiopia. This is more evidently revealed by the low proportion of rural respondents in the dataset, unlike the results from ESS that were conducted via face-to-face interviews in 2018/2019 [26] .

Therefore, an extension of the Probit model, in the form of the Instrumental Variable Probit regression, was used.

W i is the endogenous explanatory variable coded as 1 for currently working and 0 (0) otherwise. Equation (2) estimates the determinants of being currently working with gender of the respondents (G i ), which was coded as 1 for males and 0 otherwise representing the instrumental variable. If W i is not endogenous, then Cov(X i \u03b5 i ) = 0. However, if this is violated, estimating Equation (1) with standard a Probit regression model will produce biased and inconsistent parameters [28] . The analyses for this study were carried out with STATA 13 software. The software generated the Wald test of exogeneity statistic, which, if shown to be statistically significant, implies the adequacy of the instrumental variable(s) and the use of IV Probit is thus justified. Table 1 shows the distribution of the respondents' socioeconomic factors based on their decision to receive the vaccination. It shows that majority of the respondents (92.33%) would get a COVID-19 vaccination if the approved vaccines are freely available. The results in the Table further reveal that respondents from urban areas accounted for 75.34% of the respondents and majority of those who were not willing to be vaccinated came from urban areas. Based on gender, 62.21% of the respondents were males, but more females were unwilling to be vaccinated. In addition, 69.65% of the respondents were working at the time of the survey. The majority of the respondents were in their active age brackets of 25 < 45 years, while 4.64% were over 59 years of age. Figure 1 shows that SNNPR (99.30%), Oromia (97.54%), Tigray (97.04%) and Gambela (95.42%) had the highest proportions of vaccine-willing respondents while Dire Dawa (83.69%), Addis-Ababa (87.94%) and Harar (90.34%) had the lowest percentages. Figure 2 also shows that the respondents who occupied public administration positions constituted the highest frequencies of those that were willing and unwilling to be vaccinated. Figure 3 presents the reasons that were provided by the respondents for being unwilling to be vaccinated, coming from the different regions across Ethiopia. This Figure reveals that the safety of the vaccines was the topmost reason provided by the respondents across the different regions. In the Dire Dawa region, however, the second most important reason that was provided for the rejection of COVID-19 vaccine was based on side effects it might have, while second most important factor in Addis Ababa was the fear that it would not work. Table 2 presents the results of data analysis with the Instrumental Variable (IV) Probit regression approach. The model produced a good fit for the data based on the statistical significance (p < 0.01) of the computed Chi-square statistics (101.75). Additionally, the use of the Instrumental Variable Probit was justified by the statistical significance of the computed Wald test of exogeneity (p < 0.05). This implies that the currently working variable was truly endogenous and the instrumental variable was adequate.",

In Africa, 71% [29] and 59% [30] were willing to be vaccinated in South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, respectively. However, given the high-mutant property of COVID-19, a higher vaccination coverage would likely guarantee the attainment of herd immunity.

This is expected because age is one of the major factors affecting COVID-19 infection, with elderly people having weaker immune systems and thus at a higher risk of infection. A similar finding had been reported in some previous studies [15, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, the \"currently working\" variable significantly increased the probability of willingness to be vaccinated. This can be explained by the desirability of good health for individuals that are working, since being sick with COVID-19 would reduce their productivity and thus their income. However, the results show that engagement with non-farm businesses reduced the probability of willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine. This points to the fact that self-employed individuals may be less likely to see the need to get COVID-19 vaccines because they are not subjected to the operational contents of any formal contracts. The results also indicate that willingness to get vaccinated is influenced by some regional variables. This reemphasizes the need to factor in regional differences when addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.",

It should be emphasized that several socioeconomic variables are of fundamental relevance in addressing the willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, although older people would be more willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines, efforts to address the pandemic also require younger individuals to take adequate protective responsibilities, especially because they tend to be asymptomatic. In addition, there are some gender issues that should be taken cautiously in the ongoing efforts at promoting the effective management of COVID-19. Specifically, Ethiopian women are to be targeted with information to facilitate their responsiveness to COVID-19 vaccination. It is also important to ensure that occupational factors that are relevant for promoting COVID-19 acceptance in Ethiopia are addressed, understanding that informally engaged people would need to be specifically targeted with compelling information to address their hesitancy around the vaccine.",
