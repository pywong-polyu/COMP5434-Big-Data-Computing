Although the virus has reached most areas of the U.S., geographic disparities in case and mortality rates exist (CDC, 2020a) . To extend research examining how the sociodemographic factors of communities shape the spread and impact of diseases (Quinn & Kumar, 2014) , we explore the role of county-level household overcrowding on disparities in COVID-19 mortality. Household overcrowding is associated with higher rates of underlying health conditions (Krieger & Higgins, 2002 ) that may increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms (CDC, 2020c) and contribute to higher mortality rates. Furthermore, overcrowding may hasten the spread of infectious diseases (Aligne, 2016) , such as COVID-19, within households and across communities.",

In doing so, we examine whether the relationship between overcrowding and COVID-19 mortality supports a stages of disease framework. Because overcrowding is often considered a poverty indicator (WHO, 2018) , and socioeconomic disadvantage predicts both COVID-19 infections and mortality (Clouston et al., 2020) , we also examine whether and how overcrowding and poverty combine to influence county mortality rates over time.",

Overcrowding, health, In the U.S., overcrowding is defined by the number of persons per room (excluding balconies, porches, foyers, hallways, bathrooms, and half-rooms), with overcrowded households having more than 1.0 person per room (Blake et al., 2007, p. 38; WHO, 2018) . Overcrowding may contribute to COVID-19 impact in several ways. At the individual level, overcrowding poses health risks by contributing to interior moisture and dampness, which provides hospitable environments for viruses, molds, and pests (Krieger & Higgins, 2002) . Consequently, overcrowding is associated with an increased risk of various respiratory illnesses (Colosia et al., 2012) and adverse physiological outcomes, such as impaired lung functioning and increased inflammation (Packard et al., 2011) . Underlying conditions, such as lung disease, are associated with more severe cases of COVID-19 (CDC, 2020c) . Furthermore, the close proximity of individuals in overcrowded homes may exacerbate the spread of contagious diseases like COVID-19. For example, the widespread infection during the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was associated with intra-household contagion and the frequency of close contact with an infected person (Lau et al., 2004) . Overcrowding (defined as less than 50 square feet per person, which was the minimum hygienic requirement in army barracks) was also associated with increased cases of influenza among army regiments during the 1918 pandemic (Aligne, 2016) .",

This hypothesis is consistent with the theory of syndemicsa syndemic occurs when social conditions, such as overcrowding, are disproportionately experienced and are also risk factors that give rise to the concentration and interaction of multiple diseases within that population (Singer & Clair, 2003) . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, syndemic theory suggests that overcrowding not only contributes to the co-occurrence of high rates of respiratory illnesses and physiological outcomes alongside COVID-19 but that the health risks and outcomes are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Thus, vulnerability to multiple diseases may exacerbate the COVID-19 burden among overcrowded populations (Bambra et al., 2020) .",

A Massachusetts study, for example, found that zip codes in the highest quintiles of household crowding had more COVID-19 deaths compared to areas with less overcrowding during surges of mortality risk across the state between January and May 2020 (Krieger et al., 2020) . Similarly, Ahmad et al. (2020) noted that U. S. counties with poor housing conditions had higher COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates during March and April of 2020. Though the authors do not directly examine the relationship between overcrowding and COVID-19 outcomes, they suggest that overcrowding may explain the increased incidence due to increased transmission in crowded homes. Together with past work on overcrowding and health, this early evidence lays a foundation for the present research, which proposes that overcrowding plays a critical role in predicting disparities of COVID-19 mortality across U.S. counties.",

            "text": "Given the rapid spread of the disease throughout 2020, examining the relationship between county-level characteristics and COVID-19 mortality requires the incorporation of time. Time is of particular importance as the relationship between social inequality and preventable cause-specific mortality depends on the unequal distribution of knowledge and feasible intervention strategies throughout the population. Clouston et al. (2016) suggest that new population-level diseases follow four unique stages of disease, each of which marks a distinct relationship between social inequalities and cause-specific mortality rates: natural mortality, producing inequalities, reducing inequalities, and reduced mortality/disease elimination. During the first stage, natural mortality, little is known about the disease, including risk factors, preventive strategies, or treatments to reduce mortality. The presence and direction of mortality disparities are unpredictable because no group disproportionately benefits from disease-specific knowledge. In the case of the current pandemic, scientists and medical professionals knew little about the transmission of or treatments for COVID-19 when it first began to spread in the U.S. Although differences in baseline health made some groups more susceptible to COVID-19 complications, incidence and cause-specific mortality were prevalent across all social groups. This led to early naive reports that the virus was a socially neutral, non-discriminatory disease (Bambra et al., 2020) . As information about the disease is discovered and diffused throughout the population, a new stage emerges (Clouston et al., 2016) . In this second stage, producing inequalities, disparities in disease burden arise as groups with more privilege have greater access to information, preventative strategies, and treatments than less privileged groups. This progression is supported by several studies that follow historical cases of mortality-related diseases (such as colorectal cancer (Clouston et al., 2016) and HIV/AIDS (Rubin et al., 2010) ) and find that the development of mortality-preventative measures initially led to greater population-level disparities in mortality.",

Public officials have developed strategies for preventing mass infection or, minimally, slowing infection rates so that medical care resources are not overwhelmed (AJMC, 2020). A key intervention in this effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 has been for individuals to practice physical distancing. However, in line with the producing inequalities stage, this mitigation strategy is not equally accessible to all individuals and communities (Bourassa et al., 2020; Weill et al., 2020) . For example, individuals living in overcrowded households may be less able to physically distance at home. This can increase the rate of contact between infectious and susceptible individuals and, in turn, increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19. This increased intrahousehold transmission can spill over outside the home to increase the risk of infectious individuals exposing others in their community (Hargreaves et al., 2011) . If hospitals in those communities then become overwhelmed because of high infection rates, all community members will experience difficulty accessing necessary health care. This is critical as previous research suggests that overcrowded communities experience higher rates of underlying health conditions that could complicate COVID-19 symptoms (Colosia et al., 2012; Packard et al., 2011) .",

Consequently, disparities in COVID-19 mortality between areas with higher and lower rates of overcrowding likely grow throughout the pandemic.

However, not all counties experience high rates of overcrowding and poverty at the same time, and the effect of overcrowding on disease burden may vary across county-levels of poverty. In the context of COVID-19, the high rates of transmission and underlying conditions associated with household overcrowding may be particularly damaging for communities with high rates of poverty. Overcrowded homes with few socioeconomic resources may be unable to alleviate the effect of poor housing (e.g., via proper ventilation) or to pay for adequate medical care to treat health problems related to overcrowding. Although some early studies highlight that high community rates of both poverty and household overcrowding are important predictors of COVID-19 risk (Arcaya et al., 2020; Krieger et al., 2020) , it remains unclear whether these two dimensions of disadvantage jointly shape COVID-19 mortality.",

First, examining mortality rates allows us to better understand the impact of COVID-19 mortality on the entire county population, rather than just among those county residents who have tested positive for COVID-19. Second, unbiased COVID-19 case data is dependent on adequate and consistent testing across all U.S. counties.

We then examine the effect of overcrowding over time by interacting the rate of overcrowding with our period measure. Finally, we assess the multiplicative effects of overcrowded households and poverty on COVID-19 deaths over time by interacting our measures of overcrowding, poverty, and period. Results are presented and discussed using mortality rate ratios (MRR) and all continuous covariates are standardized for ease of interpretation. MRR are interpreted so that a MRR of 1.10 would indicate that for every standard deviation increase in a predictor variable, there is a 10% increase in mortality risk. Data management was conducted in R (R Core Team, 2019) and all analyses are conducted using Stata 16 (StataCorp, 2019). Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of COVID-19 outcomes and characteristics for the U.S. counties in our analyses. Between April and October 2020, the average cumulative COVID-19 mortality rate was 43.42 deaths per 100,000 persons in a county. When examining the rates within periods of the pandemic, we see a variation in the average cumulative COVID-19 mortality rate over time. During the first period (April and May), there was an average of 12.29 deaths per 100,000 and approximately half of U.S. counties had experienced at least one death. In the second period (June and July), average mortality rates decreased slightly to 11.01 deaths per 100,000, but more counties experienced at least one death (62.9 percent). In the third period (August-October), average mortality rates climbed considerably to 33.37 deaths per 100,000 persons. During this period, approximately 85.5 percent of counties experienced at least one death attributed to COVID-19. Fig. 2 plots percentiles of COVID-19 mortality rates across U.S. counties over the three periods. As evident in Fig. 2 , the spread of COVID-19 mortality rates progressed from a few geographic areas with high mortality in the first period to widespread mortality across all areas of the U.S. in the third period.",

Additionally, on average, 11.18 percent of families in a county were living below the poverty line with a standard deviation of 5.42. Examining the bivariate relationship between overcrowding and family poverty suggests that these dimensions of disadvantage are only moderately correlated (Pearson's r = .345) at the county-level. Thus, while many counties experience high rates of overcrowding and poverty together, some counties experience high rates of only overcrowding or poverty. Table 2 presents results from the multilevel negative binomial models predicting new monthly COVID-19 deaths net of demographic characteristics and past mortality rates and offset by population size. Results from Model 1 support descriptive results that indicated significantly fewer deaths in the second period of the pandemic (June and July) and significantly more deaths in the third period (August-October) compared to the first period (April and May). Compared to the first period, county mortality was on average 13.0% lower in the second period and 84.9% higher in the third period. Although the third period does include an additional month, ancillary analyses that do not include new deaths during October show similar substantive conclusions.

The percentage of overcrowded households in a county does not significantly predict mortality during the first period, but every standard deviation increase in overcrowding rate is associated with a 27.6% greater mortality risk during the second period and an 8.8% greater mortality risk during the third period compared to the first period.

Because analytic variables are standardized, the effects of overcrowding and poverty over time can be interpreted as the impact of overcrowding at average levels of family poverty and vice versa. Results suggest that consistent with prior work examining socioeconomic disparities in county-level mortality (Clouston et al., 2020) , higher family poverty rates were associated with lower COVID-19 mortality during the first period. This pattern flips during the middle and late periods so that counties with higher rates of family poverty have much greater mortality. Model 3 also allows us to examine the temporal relationship between overcrowding and mortality independent of the temporal effects of poverty. For counties with an average percentage of families below the poverty line, results suggest that overcrowding is a significant predictor of mortality during the first period and that the effect of overcrowding is similar in the first and third periods. Because family poverty and overcrowding are positively correlated but have opposite relationships with COVID-19 mortality during the first period, controlling for the negative effect of poverty reveals the positive effect of overcrowding on mortality in this period. In other words, the effect of overcrowding during the first period is only apparent when disentangling the effects of family poverty and overcrowding over time. However, consistent with Model 2, the relationship between county-level overcrowding and COVID-19 mortality is strongest during the second period.",

Although case data may be unreliable due to incomplete testing for COVID-19 across time and geography in the U.S., we conducted additional analyses (available upon request) that include the number of new cases per month as a time-varying measure in our model. The number of new cases per month was a significant predictor of mortality but including this variable did not alter substantive conclusions. We also conducted ancillary analyses that removed extreme observations of new COVID-19 deaths per month (+3 SD above the mean). Doing so did not change results, suggesting that results are not driven by cases of high mortality.",

Conversely, in counties with higher rates of overcrowding, the more frequent contacts between susceptible and infected individuals both within and outside of the home could have led to higher transmission rates within those counties.

As states struggled to combat ever-increasing infection rates (AJMC, 2020) and required new strategies during this period, counties across the U.S. may have been more equally impacted, despite differences in the ability to enact previous strategies. Additionally, the disparity in COVID-19 mortality during the second period of the pandemic may have produced community saturation of infection in counties with higher rates of overcrowding, but not those with lower rates. Though there is mixed research on how long the immunity period lasts, there is evidence that individuals carry some immunity for months after COVID-19 infection (Arafkas et al., 2020) .
