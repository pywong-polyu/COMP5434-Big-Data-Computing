This emergency accelerated the adoption of remote work and required skipping many of the steps that are necessary to implement an efficient remote work program [7] . The result was a so-called \"emergency telecommuting\", quite different from the planned choice made by organizations when launching remote work programs. However, setting up a flexible and productive remote work program is not an overnight journey. For instance, an efficient smart working program requires that managers develop new procedures to monitor and supervise employees, while remote workers learn how to coordinate with managers and colleagues [8] . Furthermore, context-specific barriers must be overcome, especially in Italian public administration. In these organizations, the lack of awareness of remote work benefits (partially recognized during the pandemic crisis) and the limited digitization of tasks [6] , make it more challenging to accept and adopt remote work, and require interventions that need time and effort.",

The former may experience dissatisfaction because they may wish to profit of the remote work opportunity, but their work does not fit remote work, or their manager does not allow them teleworking [15] . In general, several roles and positions cannot be covered remotely. On the other hand, many employees are interested in this type of arrangement and, in some cases, they constitute special groups of employees as, for instance, young women [16] , millennials [2, 17] , or older workers [18] . In addition, because remote work requires information and communication technologies, managers should also consider how much the organization is ready to adopt such technologies and how much remote workers are familiar with such tools. In fact, the effectiveness of technology is related to the personal skills and characteristics of the users, and the context in which it is used [19] . This issue, valid in any context, is even more relevant in the Italian public sector, in which many employees are described as not well accustomed to the use of digital technology [20] . In other words, public institutions should consider all these different groups, and develop inclusive processes that are capable of potentially enabling everyone to work remotely and efficiently.",

No significant changes in the relationship with colleagues were mentioned, except for aspects that were defined as minor, recoverable, such as rumors unrelated to work that the smart workers heard a few days later. The limited effect that smart working had on interpersonal relationships with colleagues probably depended on the little time spent working remotely (only one or two days a week) and the fact that smart workers were, anyway, frequently in contact with colleagues through telephone and e-mail.

From the beginning, there was a tendency to involve as many people as possible. Although a limited number of positions for the pilot test were available, each employee of the municipality could apply. Those with the greatest needs were selected, while, at the same time, there was attention to select only one worker from each department.

First, only a limited number of remote workers were interviewed (although we interviewed the whole population of remote workers involved, at that time, in the pilot program). Second, even if it is based on factual events, the analysis of the interviews did not use a systematic procedure. Third, the case study describes the procedures that were adopted by a public administration. However, we do believe that most of the procedures might also be the same in private companies. Fourth, the study was conducted before the pandemic, when few organizations had implemented remote work. This can be considered a limitation because the situation is now quite different; thousands of employees and organizations have experienced what has been called emergency telework. However, this case study highlights the critical steps to consider when a remote work program is intentionally and carefully introduced as a planned organizational change.",

This paper highlights the design of the program, the identification of work activities to be conducted remotely, and some psychological and social outcomes of a remote work experimentation, and concludes with some implications for HR managers.",

It also represents an opportunity to change some human resource management policies and reconsider the leadership style that is adopted by middle managers. The health emergency should be considered a primer to overcome the resistance to remote work and facilitate the adoption of smart working as a solution that creates value for the organization. In the transition from emergency telework to remote working, we believe that the experiences that are described in this study are resources to start to think about how to make this contingency a valuable opportunity.",
