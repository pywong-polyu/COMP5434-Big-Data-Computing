The inflammatory phase starts at the time of the injury and persists for some days, while the proliferative and remodeling phases endure for longer periods.

The circadian rhythm has been reported to regulate collagen homeostasis in intact tendons. 8 Although the circadian rhythm probably influences tendon healing, little is known about this. Changes in the microbiome have been reported to influence tendon healing as well as different immunomodulatory treatments, including platelet-rich plasma and corticosteroids. 15, 17 Moreover, there are interactions between the effect of loading and immunological changes during tendon healing. 16 Different load magnitudes have been shown to activate distinct mechanisms and have diverse effects on the structural and material properties of the healing tendon. 16, 23 Full loading triggers a stronger proinflammatory response than moderate loading, possibly because of microdamage and infiltrating leukocytes. 5, 22 Despite this obvious effect on the inflammatory response, previous studies on the effect of dexamethasone on tendon healing have used full loading models, 6, 17 and different load levels might display distinct outcomes.

To separate the mononuclear cells, the blood was carefully layered on Histopaque-1119 (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at room temperature (700g for 45 min), followed by buffy coat collection and addition of support buffer (RPMI 1640 without l-glutamine and phenol red, 4% inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES). The suspension was washed twice at 600g for 6 minutes, and 1 to 3 million cells were collected in Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend) and incubated 20 minutes while protected from the light and on ice with antibodies (Appendix Table A1 , available in the online version of this article). For live/dead discrimination, Zombie Violet (Biolegend) was added. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (Biolegend) and washed twice with Cell Staining Buffer. Cells from a control rat were used for fluorescence minus one gating. To sustain blinding, the operator (F.D.Z.) did not know which rat this was. FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences) was used in this study, and Cytometer Setup and Tracking Beads (BD Biosciences) ensured the stability of the cytometer. Compensation was performed with the same antibodies as in the experiment, and the gatings of discrete antigens were set on population morphology. In all samples, initial gating was performed on singlet cells, scatter parameters, and live cells to define single living leukocytes. Gating was performed in FlowJo Version 10.0.7 (Treestar). This method has been described in detail previously. 4 Histological Examination. Twelve rats were used for histological imaging with normal hematoxylin and eosin staining on saline-and dexamethasone-treated tendons. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane gas at 12 days postsurgery. Tendons were harvested and fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde overnight, followed by dehydration and paraffin embedding.

As seen previously, dexamethasone treatment during the proliferative phase (days 5-9) improves the material and structural properties of the healing tendon. 6, 17 Despite improved material properties in the tendons, we sometimes observed that treated tendons became elongated. 17 Within this study, when the treatment was delayed further into the proliferative phase or perhaps into the early remodeling phase at days 7 to 11, more pronounced improvement of the material properties was seen. This delay in treatment also led to less tendon elongation when compared with our positive control. The presence of tendon elongation 38, 39 and fibrotic tissue 21 after a tendon injury is a common clinical challenge. Better clinical results after an Achilles tendon rupture have been seen in patients with less elongation. 27 An elongated tendon can hinder simple activities such as running and jumping; hence, an understanding of how to use dexamethasone treatment, without inducing tendon elongation is therefore essential.",

A distinct healing response was seen according to the number of dexamethasone injections given, with peak stress varying by 41% to 95% (experiment 3), although better material properties were seen independent of the dose or number of injections. The strongest response was seen with the highest dose but with no significant difference when the dose was reduced 5-fold. Conversely, the higher dose did result in more pronounced muscle atrophy as compared with the lower dose or fewer injections. Tendon and muscle tissues have been reported to be influenced by sex hormones, especially estrogen, which has a role in skeletal muscle protein turnover. 24, 25 Female rats were used in all our experiments. The use of male rats could perhaps influence the effect of the drug on muscle and lead to different findings, but we have not investigated this. Furthermore, a reduction in load magnitude can lead to muscle atrophy. 2, 16, 20, 23 Mechanical loading profoundly affects tendon healing, and the dexamethasone effects found here could be, in reality, an effect of reduced loading levels.

The effect in fully loaded rats corresponds to that found in previous studies. 6, 17 However, full loading does not relate well to humans with an Achilles tendon injury; thus, moderate loading is more relevant. Full loading and moderate loading have been shown to activate somewhat different mechanisms after a tendon rupture. Full loading acts through mechanotransduction and microdamage and leads to an increased proinflammatory response, while moderate loading acts primarily through mechanotransduction. 23 As a positive effect of dexamethasone also was observed with reduced loading, this might indicate that dexamethasone improves tendon healing in more ways than an immunomodulatory effect, possibly through a direct effect on tendon cells. 13 Notably, moderate loading had no significant effect on muscle weight, as seen with full loading and unloading. The exact mechanism of corticosteroids during tendon healing is not yet clear, although one study did show a reduced number of CD8a 1 cells in dexamethasone-treated tendons and improved collagen alignment. 6 We observed that total granulocytes and the CD11b population increased, while CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells decreased, after systemic and local dexamethasone treatment. Granulocytosis 34 and lymphopenia 10 are known effects of corticosteroids, and the results in the locally treated group indicate that the systemic effect cannot be avoided even with local injections. Local corticosteroid injections have been reported to cause detrimental effects on intact 42 and healing 28 tendons. Although we did not observe any adverse effects by local treatment, beneficial effects were absent. Overall, positive mechanical outcomes of dexamethasone on healing Achilles tendons seem to be reliant on the route of administration.",

Additional studies on the mechanisms behind the effect of dexamethasone are desirable for further conclusions, as the treatment might act via systemic effects and local effects specific to the tendon cell and matrix. Moreover, the positive effects of corticosteroid treatment, without adverse effects, are more pronounced during the late proliferative phase or early remodeling phase (by daily systemic injections from days 7 to 11) and using the 0.1 mg/kg dose.",
