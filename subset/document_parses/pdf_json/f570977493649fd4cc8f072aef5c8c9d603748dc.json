            "text": "Behavior courses face numerous challenges when moving to an online environment, as has been made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges occur largely because behavior courses, like most organismal biology courses, often stress experiential learning through laboratories that involve live animals, as well as a lecture component that emphasizes formative assessment, discussion, and critical thinking. Although online behavior courses may be remote, they can still be interactive and social, and designed with inclusive pedagogy. Here, we discuss some of the key decisions that instructors should consider, provide recommendations, and point out new opportunities for student learning that stem directly from the move to online instruction. Specific topics include challenges related to generating an inclusive and engaging online learning environment, synchronous versus asynchronous formats, assignments that enhance student learning, testing format and execution, grade schemes, design of laboratory experiences including opportunities for community science, design of synthetic student projects, and workload balance for students and instructors. We designed this primer both for animal behavior instructors who need to quickly transition to online teaching in the midst of a pandemic, and for those facing such transitions in upcoming terms. Much of the manuscript's content should also be of general interest and value to instructors from all areas of organismal biology who are attempting to quickly transition to online teaching.",

Our experience spans public and private institutions, both undergraduate serving and research-intensive with extensive graduate programs. Our behavioral class sizes range from 10 to 200 students, and most of our courses incorporate laboratory components. Our experience teaching online varies, with two having extensive experience and the rest having only begun teaching in this modality since March 2020, in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While we intend for this primer to be useful to anyone preparing to teach online behavior courses, because we are all North American instructors, we may have introduced some biases that partially reduce the relevance for those from other continents.",

As instructors of behavior and other organismal courses, we saw the challenges of moving these courses online-courses that typically involve discussion, active student engagement, hands-on laboratories with live animals, and other components that can be challenging to replicate in the online environment. Now, many are faced with online instruction for an indefinite period of time. Our goal here is twofold: first, to summarize some of the best practices for pivoting to teaching behavioral courses in the midst of a pandemic, based both on the literature and on our collective experiences; and second, to provide a valuable resource for those of you switching to an online modality in the future, whether as a matter of choice or necessitated by the ongoing crisis. As many behavior instructors may have limited experience in online teaching and limited time to read the pedagogical literature, we review some of the basic principles of online course design and implementation. We hope instructors use this primer as a single-source reference guide for redesigning their behavior courses for remote teaching.",

Instead, we encourage instructors to choose where to focus their efforts based on their desired course outcomes, course size, available time, energy, and resources. Instructors facing an emergency return to remote teaching will necessarily employ different strategies than instructors already planning for continuing with online teaching through multiple terms, and we provide discussion and resources useful for both. We identify key questions to consider early in course planning, and identify priorities, challenges, and opportunities that may arise as a consequence of transitioning to remote teaching.",

Physical distancing requires either fewer students in the space, or the use of larger spaces that may not have been designed for teaching. Instructors and students alike will need to wear masks and as a result speak louder, possibly necessitating the use of microphones even for small classes, or to ensure adequate recording for students unable to attend in person. Masks also limit non-verbal communication, which can be important for conveying subtleties of content and giving critical feedback. Hardof-hearing students may especially rely on non-verbal cues and thus be disadvantaged by masks; clear face masks have been developed and are being utilized in some institutions. The inability to share physical resources is also a concern, as time must be incorporated into the session for cleaning of equipment, and some equipment will not be able to be used. When a class meets face-to-face, we suggest asking students to bring a Web-enabled device so that they can simultaneously view and comment on shared documents while remaining physically distanced, or so they can log into Zoom or a similar resource and watch from a distance as instructors or teaching assistants conduct demonstrations of animals or point out behaviors. These events can be recorded for those who cannot attend, and have the added benefit of being able to be reused.",

Specifications-based grading schemes, for example, come in many forms (e.g., mastery-based, laborbased, grading contracts), and are well established in composition and mathematics pedagogy (e.g., Inoue, 2019) . Specifications grading shares a set of common features: Assignments and activities are accompanied by a set of clear, well-defined specifications; evaluation of whether student work meets each specification is binary (no partial credit); and a system of thresholds for translating the degree to which the student completes work meeting specifications, sometimes in combination with percentage scores from traditional quizzes or examinations, to final letter grades. In specifications grading, final grades are a direct reflection of student mastery of course learning outcomes (at least to the extent that assignments and assessments reflect these).",

For the instructor, grading is simpler, takes less time, and is devoid of the angst often associated with assigning partial credit. Indeed, many of the low-stakes assignments and action-based laboratory activities (e.g., \"collect an hour of focal animal observations\" or \"create an ethogram of an animal's behavior\") designed for online courses make more sense to grade as meeting or not meeting specifications than by a points or percentage system.",

The latter can be built into the lecture platform as a separate feature (e.g., Zoom), rapidly toggled to when in PowerPoint \"Slide Show\" mode, or added as blank slides (e.g., VoiceThread). Alternatively, the instructor can use a tablet or separate Web-based app (e.g., Limnu, which also allows for separate breakout rooms). Remind students to take especially good notes when you deliver challenging content, and to pause videos when they notice their minds are wandering. In an asynchronous class, we recommend embedding short videos in mixed-media pages that include written passages, graphics, links to Internet content, PDFs of literature articles, and assignments/activities, all of which can be used to convey information that face-to-face classes might normally deliver in a lecture format.",

These have the added benefit of helping instructors know students' prior level of understanding. Consider subdividing students into discussion groups and assigning different prompts to each student. For example, if the topic is to discuss five key questions about a literature article, each student within a group of five could be responsible for presenting an initial answer to one of the questions; other group members could then be tasked with improving the answers. When held on an asynchronous discussion board, we have found it helpful to use the \"reply before seeing other posts\" option available in many LMS so that students must craft their own responses before seeing and responding to others. An additional tip is to require students to make responses at multiple time points throughout the discussion period, increasing back-and-forth conversation. Finally, we encourage instructors to be cognizant of their direct participation in discussions; students should perceive that the instructor is reading their posts, but student participation can be stifled by frequent instructor commentary. A weekly summary post by the instructor that reflects upon interesting student ideas that emerged from various groups, and adds instructor insights, can be an effective and time-efficient way to recognize student participation and take advantage of teachable moments.",

To ensure students are adequately prepared for a lively discussion, consider requiring a preparation assignment prior to class (e.g., critique the article in 100 words or less; create a 2-min podcast that explains the article to a high schooler; these approaches are amenable to satisfactory/unsatisfactory marking by teaching assistants).

It is worth considering why students might be tempted to cheat during assessments; reasons include anxiety, the high-stakes nature of examinations, the preparation \"gap,\" and peer behavior, which can normalize cheating and instill fear that other students are cheating and \"getting ahead\" (McCabe et al., 2001) . If the instructor wants to try to mimic the in-class examination experience, they can use one of these online proctoring services (e.g., Respondus). However, these options can add to student expenses, place additional technological constraints on students, raise privacy and equity concerns, and reinforce an adversarial, rather than collaborative, relationship. For these reasons, we discourage lockdown browsers and webcam monitoring during assessment activities. Fortunately, there are many alternative approaches that are well suited for online behavior classes, which we outline below. These approaches, while potentially challenging to implement at first, especially while trying to minimize the grading burden, are also readily applicable to face-to-face classes. Some of us have found that we never want to give a \"traditional\" examination again.",

Frequent low-stakes tests (i.e., at least one per topic or module) can maximize student engagement and learning while minimizing stress, because no one test contributes a great deal to the final grade. This strategy helps keep students from falling behind or procrastinating, while providing the instructor with a much more fine-grained analysis of what students do and do not understand, allowing for a more adaptive approach to teaching. Frequent low-stakes quizzes reduce student anxiety about the \"preparation gap\" and also work well with a specifications-based grading scheme (see Section 2.3, above). Perhaps most importantly, frequent testing is also highly impactful on student learning. Indeed, in a review of active learning methods, frequent quizzing was found to have the most support in effectively improving student learning (DeLozier & Rhodes, 2017).",

For instance, several of us typically teach our face-to-face courses with only a few weeks of \"standard\" laboratory exercises developed to teach basic observation skills, ethogram construction, use of event recorders, and experimental design. The remaining weeks of laboratory are used to support term-long research projects that could include the following: collaborative studies at local zoos, aquaria or animal shelters, and/or the development of mock grant proposals (Section 6 above).

A cohort approach is the best because it does not require additional instructors or physical laboratory space; choose the most important laboratories and cycle subsets of students through those laboratories over the course of the term, possibly putting the remainder of the laboratories online. Alternatively, shorten the in-person time spent in the laboratory room and have cohorts arrive at different times: For example, half of the students arrive for the first 2 hr, clean the laboratory for 15 min, and then the other half arrive for the last 2 hr. In-person laboratories are made all the more complex by the requirement to wear masks and all the ramifications that result (discussed in Section 2.2, above) apply here.

Be comfortable with that, and make space for your learning as the term progresses. Ask your students for anonymous feedback and discuss how you are responding to their comments. Take advantage of peer teaching expertise both at your institution and via the professional networks that have emerged (see Early Considerations and Recommendations; Seek Support, above). Keep track of common questions that arise on assignments and problems that you discover in the course structure so that you can improve in future classes. While we all hope for a return to face-to-face teaching soon, planning for more than one term in which a significant component of coursework is online may be wise. ",
