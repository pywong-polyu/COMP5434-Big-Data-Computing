He was severely dyspnoeic, requiring 6 L min -1 of oxygen by nasal prongs (?) to maintain an oxygen saturation of 92-93%. His D-dimer was increased (7,473 ng mL -1 ), consistent with the acute inflammatory process of COVID-19, and suspicion for pulmonary embolism was low. Deterioration of the patient and increasing oxygen requirement resulted in tracheal intubation for respiratory failure (arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio 247 mm Hg), and he was admitted to the ICU. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. On hospital day 6, because of progressive deterioration in gas exchange (PaO 2 /FiO 2 =120 mm Hg) despite lungprotective measures including pronation and the initiation of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), EIT was used to evaluate regional ventilation and pulmonary blood flow distribution.",

Our findings were consistent with a major perfusion impairment, likely due to pulmonary thrombosis (D-Dimer>10,000 ng mL -1 ). Echocardiography revealed an increased right ventricular systolic pressure (>35 mm Hg) and signs of right ventricular strain despite iNO administration, suggesting the presence of pulmonary hypertension.
