            "text": "In a viral pandemic, a few important tests are required for successful containment of the virus and reduction in severity of the infection. Among those tests, a test for the neutralizing ability of an antibody is crucial for assessment of population immunity gained through vaccination, and to test therapeutic value of antibodies made to counter the infections. Here, we report a sensitive technique to detect the relative neutralizing strength of various antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used bright, photostable, background-free, fluorescent upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a phantom virion. A glass bottom plate coated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein imitates the target cells. When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the particles would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a neutralizing antibody can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated substrate. A prototype system consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope was used to quantify particle attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of this assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2 \u00b5g/ml. This is to be compared to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially available kits.",

In such a pandemic, vaccination is anticipated to be the main tool to control the rapid spread of infections, and subsequent hospitalizations. Ideally, this paradigm works at its best when every vaccinated individual produces antibodies of sufficient strength and specificity to neutralize the virus. In practice, variations among individuals, population dynamics of antibodies, and frequent mutations of the virus can quickly reduce the effectiveness of vaccines [10] [11] [12] . One of the pandemic management tools still lacking improvement is a quick, reliable assay to measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum. This would facilitate decisions on the timing of revaccination, calculations of herd immunity, and provide a probe for ever-growing pool of viral variants 13 . In addition, laboratory-generated antibodies, produced as antibody therapeutic treatments, need to be evaluated with a sensitive test to quantify their neutralizing potential.",

            "text": "In the recent years, the fluorescent detection of single biomolecule has gained popularity [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, photobleaching of the fluorescent dyes remains challenging for fluorescent readout. In addition, high-resolution microscopy and a longer acquisition time are often needed for single molecule detection, limiting its applications [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . To resolve the photobleaching issue, the use of lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as fluorescent tags has been proven to be beneficial. For instance, Farka et al. use UCNPs as their fluorescent tags to detect prostate specific antigen with a sensitivity of 1.2 pg/ml (42 fM) in 25% serum 27 . UCNPs can be excited by infrared lasers and remain stable after long exposure. In addition, the use of a high-power laser in a wide-field illumination configuration can increase the fluorescent signals and reduce the acquisition time, leading to faster measurements. It has been shown that using highly stable UCNPs could improve the limit of detection (LOD) of upconversion-linked immunosorbent assay (ULISA) by an order of magnitude compared to commercially available assays 26, 27 . More sensitive optical readout can also improve the LOD in such bioassays 28, 29 . These progressions toward single molecule detection are pushing the sensitivity, specificity, and LOD beyond what was once theoretically possible 30-32 .",

We use fluorescent UCNPs to measure the relative effectiveness of antibodies in preventing the binding of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The method proposed in this study is in keeping with the principle that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies could prevent the interaction between the RBD of the viral spike protein with the ectodomain of ACE-2 33 . For one clone of antibody used, we calculated the midpoint inflection point (IC50) to be 12 ng/ml (80 pM) and the LOD, defined as a concentration two standard deviations lower than the mean negative control value, to be 4 ng/ml (33 pM).",

The assay relies on the natural affinity between RBD and ACE-2 protein. To fully take advantage of this property, we employed streptavidin conjugated upconversion nanoparticles and biotinylated RBD to produce the upconversion nanoparticle phantom virion (UCPV). If there is no antibody present in the sample (or if the antibodies present in the sample are non-neutralizing), the phantom virus particles will bind to the substrate without any obstruction. As a result, images taken from these samples will show high count of particles (Figure 1a and 1b) . On the other hand, if the antibody is effectively neutralizing the RBD, then the binding of phantom virus and ACE-2 will be hindered, thus a lower count of particles will be observed in the images (Figure 1c and 1d), compared to the negative control sample with no antibody present, as shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b.",

The activity of ACE-2 was evaluated by measuring the binding between ACE-2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is linked to mouse IgG Fc tag. RBD was further detected by goat anti-mouse antibody with Alexa fluor 633. The fluorescent spectra are shown in figure S4 (b, d, e, h). To make sure that non-specific bindings or autofluorescence signals were minimal, several control experiments were performed. ( Figure S4 a-h). Figure S4a shows the positive control test, in which the plates were coated with ACE-2/polydopamine mixture and then blocked with 5% BSA solution (supplementary materials). The next layer was RBD with mouse Fc tag which was detected with goat anti-mouse antibody with Alexa fluor 633. Figure S4b shows the spectrum of the Alexa fluor obtained with a 638 nm laser. This spectrum clearly shows the positivity of this sample. Figure S4c shows the negative control test, in which instead of RBD with Fc tag, the plate was incubated 1\u00d7PBS as a negative control sample. Figure S4d shows the spectrum of the Alexa fluor obtained with 638 nm laser from this sample. This spectrum clearly shows the negativity of this sample, as there is only background readout signal. Figure S4e shows the control sample which is missing the goat anti-mouse antibody with Alexa fluor 633. Since in these measurements the excitation laser was the 638 nm laser, there was a possibility of auto fluorescent background from any of the elements on the plate. To check if there was any auto fluorescent, we prepared this sample and scanned it. Figure S4f shows the spectrum of the Alexa fluor obtained with the 638 nm laser from sample shown in Figure S4e . This spectrum clearly shows the negativity of this sample, as there is only background readout signal. So, there are minimal auto fluorescent signals from other elements on the plate. Figure S4g shows the control test which is missing the ACE-2 protein. This plate was coated with mixture of 1\u00d7PBSand polydopamine and then blocked with 5% BSA. The purpose of this test was to measure the extent of non-specific binding of RBD with mouse Fc tag and secondary Alexa fluor conjugated antibody complexes with ACE-2-coated plates. Figure S4h shows the spectrum of the Alexa fluor obtained with 638 nm laser from figure S4g. This spectrum shows a small background in this sample. However, the positive signal shown in figure S4b is approximately 16 times larger than this background.",

The non-specific binding between the phantom virus and ACE-2 coated plates can increase the background signal, thus decrease the LOD and sensitivity. Polydopamine molecules, which are positively charged, can bind to the phantom virus without involvement of ACE-2 and RBD. In addition, any imperfection on the plate's coating or UCPVs can increase the non-specific binding. To assess this, we prepared ACE-2/polydopamine-coated plates and 1 \u00d7PBS/polydopamine coated plates, both blocked with 5% BSA to show that phantom virus particles only bind to substrate when ACE-2 protein is mixed with polydopamine and plated on the substrate. To test the affinity of the particles with the ACE-2 coated plates and compare it with blank and blocked plate (no antibody was used), we imaged the edge of the coated area (the location of the edge was found by rough marking on the glass plate and the coffee-ring effect of the coated area after it was dried). Figure 2a shows the 10 \u00b5l coating of polydopamine/ACE-2 protein. Since only a certain area of each well was coated, we expected to find the particles only in that coated region. Figure 2b shows very high binding between phantom virus particles and the coated area, while the uncoated area to the side did not show any non-specific binding to between UCPV and the blocked blank glass coverslip (effective imaged area is 145 \u00b5m by 145 \u00b5m).",

We expected to see a very low count of particles on these plates, based on this assumption that there is no affinity between UCPVs and polydopamine. Fig. S5 shows three images of three different areas of the same sample taken from the center of the coated area, and only a few of particles are visible in the images (effective imaged area is 145 \u00b5m by 145 \u00b5m). The particles appear as small diffraction-limited green spots on the dark background of the images. These results ( Figure 2 and supplementary materials Figure S4 and S5) prove that the binding between ACE-2-coated area and UCPV is specifically caused by the natural affinity between RBD and ACE-2 proteins. It is important to note that those non-specific bindings are due to surface imperfections of the substrate and the particles, as well as the protein coating integrity of the particles and substrate. For instance, excessive sonication (which is a step of the UCPV preparation procedure; see supplementary materials) can damage and denature the protein coating of the nanoparticles, either due to excessive heating or high-pressure waves generated by bath sonicator inside the nanoparticle vials. Optimization of every step and paying attention to such details can decrease the amount of non-specific binding.",

The Hill coefficient has been used to measure the cooperativity of multivalent binding systems 37,38 . In the dose-response curves, the Hill coefficients for NN54 and T01KHu were calculated to be 1.148 and 4.0836, respectively. Comparing with NN54, the binding of T01KHu is closer to multiple ligand interactions. These parameters were calculated by fitting the 4-parameter logistic function to the data sets using an online tool (supplementary materials). 33 Thus, we can differentiate between antibodies in terms of their strength (IC50) and cooperativity (Hill coefficients) in binding to the UCPVs. Figure 3a and 3b show the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies NN54 and T01KHu as their concentration increases. They also show that the non-neutralizing clone CR3022 does not prevent UCPVs from binding to ACE-2 coated plates. Our assay can differentiate the IC50 point with high sensitivity and determine the antibody with higher affinity without the use of enzymatic enhancement in ELISA. This assay also shows differences in the Hill coefficients for these two antibodies, which shows that T01KHu is a multiligand interaction while NN54 seems to be a single ligand interaction.",

The concentration of RBD in the assay depends on two factors, number of RBD bound to each UCNP and final working concentration of RBD. Accordingly, to control the concentration of RBD in the assay there are two methods one could use. It is possible to keep the working concentration of UCPVs constant and optimize the number of RBD per UCNPs 40 or keep the ratio of RBD to UCNPs constant and optimize the concentration of UCPVs (as it has been done in 27 ). We decided to choose the latter for the reason that it is necessary to optimize the concentration of UCPVs for a given RBD to UCNP ratio i.e. for any given ratio, one needs to choose the concentration of UCPVs in the linear region with the highest slope (0.1 \u00b5g/ml and 1 \u00b5g/ml in supplementary Figure S3 ) to achieve the highest sensitivity. As such, we maximized the amount of RBD per UCNP (1200:1), and optimized the concentration of final UCPV. Figure S3 shows the result of concentration optimization for our experiment. In the region between 0.1 \u00b5g/ml and 1 \u00b5g/ml the average number of particles counted per image changes rapidly, increasing with concentration of UCPVs and in this region, for the ratio of RBD to UCNP that we used, we have the maximum sensitivity.

Among those tests, a test for the neutralizing ability of an antibody is crucial for assessment of population immunity gained through vaccination, and to test therapeutic value of antibodies made to counter the infections. Here, we report a sensitive technique to detect the relative neutralizing strength of various antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used bright, photostable, background-free, fluorescent upconversion nanoparticles conjugated with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain as a phantom virion. A glass bottom plate coated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein imitates the target cells. When no neutralizing IgG antibody was present in the sample, the particles would bind to the ACE-2 with high affinity. In contrast, a neutralizing antibody can prevent particle attachment to the ACE-2-coated substrate. A prototype system consisting of a custom-made confocal microscope was used to quantify particle attachment to the substrate. The sensitivity of this assay can reach 4.0 ng/ml and the dynamic range is from 1.0 ng/ml to 3.2 \u00b5g/ml. This is to be compared to 19 ng/ml sensitivity of commercially available kits.

The input power to the objective was measured to be 300 mW ( Figure S2 , measured at point A). Each data point was scanned 10 times. Each scan was 145 \u00b5m by 145 \u00b5m and this area was imaged using a raster scan of 8 \u00d7 8 points. The fluorescent image from the particles was then reflected onto an ICCD camera (Starlight Xpress Trius Pro 674). The effective imaged area was 87 \u00b5m by 145 \u00b5m for the antibody titer tests. Each point of the 8 by 8 raster scan was integrated for 200 ms, resulting in acquisition time of 12.8 seconds per image. Each sample was imaged 10 times on a 2 by 5 grid. The step size for this grid was 500 \u00b5m. The scanning, imaging, and optical setup details can be found in Figure S2 . Image data were saved and reconstituted in Mathematica using a custom-made code.
