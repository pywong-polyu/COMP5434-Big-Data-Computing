Participants were given an Amazon Echo Dot with MedBuddy-a new medication reminder skill for Echo devices created by our team-attached to their study account, which they used for 60 days. Participants self-reported their baseline and poststudy medication adherence. MedBuddy use was objectively evaluated by tracking participants' interactions with MedBuddy through Amazon Alexa. The usability and usefulness of MedBuddy were evaluated through a poststudy interview in which participants responded to both quantitative and qualitative questions.",

Research findings indicate that 50% or fewer people adhere to agreed-upon medication regimens [1, 3] . Medication nonadherence contributes to suboptimal health management and increases overall health care costs among patients with chronic conditions [4, 5] . The reasons for medication nonadherence are multifactorial [6] but often divided into intentional (eg, believing that medication is not needed or effective and stopping because of side effects) and unintentional (eg, inability to pay for medication, lack of understanding of how to properly take medications, and forgetfulness) [7] . Among unintentional reasons for medication nonadherence, forgetting to take medicine is one of the most common reasons [8] [9] [10] . Findings from a meta-analysis of medication adherence interventions among adults demonstrated that linking medication taking with existing daily routines and using behavioral strategies (eg, prompts to take medication) are the most effective strategies to promote adherence [11] .",

Improved rates of medication adherence have been demonstrated while using smartphone apps [16] [17] [18] [19] . Key features of effective technological interventions include early participant input in the process to improve usability, a direct line between the patient and the people developing the technology along with the health care provider, a clear and easy-to-use interface, and the use of preexisting screening tools to measure medication adherence [20, 21] .",

Several medication adherence skills are available for use with Echo devices [26] . However, no study has specifically evaluated users' perceptions of their effectiveness. Beaney et al [22] suggested that Amazon's medication reminder skill could benefit from more development. For example, it does not have a feature for as-needed medications, that is, those not taken on a regular schedule [22] . Furthermore, Amazon's general medication reminder skill provides only 1 reminder and does not allow the user to record whether the medicine was taken as prescribed. In this context, the primary purpose of this pilot project is to assess the usability and usefulness of a new medication-taking reminder skill, MedBuddy, developed by our team for use with Amazon Echo devices.",

Although a variety of properties have been associated with usability (eg, learnability, efficiency, and effectiveness), we defined it more broadly as participants' likes and dislikes and whether they used the medication reminder system. Our definition of usefulness was pragmatic in investigating whether participants perceived the skill to improve medication adherence and whether they would continue its use and recommend others to use it.",

The skill tracks whether participants reported taking or missing their medicine and, if the medication was reported as taken, documents the time.

However, we conducted the initial usability and usefulness tests of MedBuddy with women who were college students and took oral contraceptives. We selected this population because (1) younger adults are likely to have more technological literacy than middle-aged or older adults and therefore may provide higher quality feedback about the skill with minimal frustration if it does not work as expected, (2) nonadherence to oral contraceptives is common [28, 29] , and (3) oral contraceptives are most effective when taken at approximately the same time every day [30] . Following the receipt of an exempt determination by the institutional review board, potential participants were recruited from an urban public university campus in the Southeastern United States. Recruitment flyers were distributed through electronic billboards, an electronic learning management system, and social media. In addition, an announcement about the research opportunity was presented to approximately 100 students who attended a university program orientation. Snowball sampling also occurred by enrolling referrals from current participants or our team's social contacts. Potential participants were directed to contact the study coordinator by phone or email. When contacted, the study coordinator explained the study purpose, potential risks, and benefits and screened the participants for eligibility. Eligibility criteria included (1) currently taking an oral contraceptive but self-reporting difficulty remembering to take the medication some days or at about the same time each day, (2) living off-campus (because of internet inconsistency or internet overload in campus housing), and (3) owning a smartphone. Students meeting the eligibility requirements were invited to participate, and, for those interested, an enrollment appointment was scheduled.",

Participants were first familiarized with activating the MedBuddy skill, using phrases such as \"Alexa, open MedBuddy.\" Once participants were familiar with activating the skill, the phrases for informing MedBuddy the medication had been taken or forgotten were demonstrated to participants. These phrases included \"Alexa, tell MedBuddy I took my medication at 2:00 PM today\" and \"Alexa, tell MedBuddy I forgot my medication.\" Participants were then given the opportunity to interact with Alexa and MedBuddy.

For instance, when some participants instructed Echo to open MedBuddy, Echo would open a different skill with the word buddy in the title. Similarly, a voice response indicating the medicine was taken or missed, which should cancel future reminders for the day, was sometimes not recorded because Echo did not recognize and communicate with the right skill. In these instances, participants received one or two additional reminders from MedBuddy after having said they had taken their medication. A participant noted that she continued to use MedBuddy because it helped her remember to take her medicine, but she stopped even trying to communicate with MedBuddy through Echo because of these described speech recognition interface problems.",

A MedBuddy feature frequently mentioned as helpful was the automatic receipt of three reminders, which made the reminder more difficult to ignore than, for instance, receiving one reminder or an alarm via their mobile phones. In addition, several participants stated that reminders sounding like a human voice made them more responsive and accountable to the system. This finding resonates with other research showing that some users personify voice-activated devices [23, 31] . Furthermore, being able to respond to MedBuddy using a voice command appealed to some users. The participants found the hands-free use efficient, which has also been reported among people who use VHAs for other purposes [32, 33] . More than 90% (21/23, 91%) of participants reported that MedBuddy helped them take their medicine as prescribed. In the self-reports of medication adherence, participants reported missing their medicine less in the last 1 and 6 months in the poststudy versus prestudy assessment. However, there was no baseline versus poststudy difference in the frequency by which they took their medicine within the desired 2-hour time frame. More than 65% (15/23) of participants stated that they would continue using MedBuddy if given the opportunity. Several of those who declined to continue MedBuddy use stated that MedBuddy helped them develop habits for a better medicine-taking routine, so they had no need for future use.",

Other skills' similar names sometimes made it difficult for the Echo device to differentiate commands for MedBuddy versus a command for a different skill. As it seemed to be a problem for some participants and not problematic at all for others, we believe communication success may have varied based on voice tones and diction-an issue noted by users of other voice-activated devices [35] . Thus, we deemed it necessary to change the skill's name. On the basis of naming tips for skills published on the web by Amazon, named skills and other software promoting medication adherence, and our interface tests between Echo and the skill, by using a short-list of potential names, MedBuddy was renamed as Pill Minder.

Participant feedback on the MedBuddy skill usefulness was particularly positive. Overall, the most notable features were multiple verbal reminders, with the capacity for a verbal response, and receipt of reminders external to the mobile phone, but compatible with it through the Alexa app. Although most participants also positively evaluated usability, several suggestions were made to improve the skill. The next version of MedBuddy-renamed Pill Minder-has been designed with features to address study participants' suggestions. Alpha testing has been initiated within our team, and further testing will be launched outside the team soon.
