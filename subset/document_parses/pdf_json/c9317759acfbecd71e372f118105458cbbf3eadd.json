As the clinical realm has rapidly adjusted to the realities of the pandemic, anesthesiology literature has also changed significantly to reflect this. Articles were then further characterized across multiple different variables, including country of origin, month published, type of article, and subspecialty of anesthesiology it pertained to. Of the 15 journals investigated, 676 (12%) articles of the 5,722 total articles published were found to be COVID-19-related material. The majority of the articles were found to be published in April (18%), May (19.5%), and June (14%). The majority of these articles were related either to general anesthesia (operating room anesthesiology that is not tied to a particular subspecialty fellowship track) (48%) or critical care (39%). By article type, most were determined to be editorial (71%) in nature, followed by original research articles (21%), of which most were cross-sectional (55%) studies. When compared with non-COVID-19-related articles, COVID-19-related articles had a significantly greater Altmetric score (29.518 versus 8.6333, p < 0.001). Of the COVID-19-related articles, original articles had the greatest Altmetric score, when compared to editorials and guidelines (54.794 versus 20.777 versus 40.643, p < 0.002). The response of the academic anesthesiology community to the COVID-19 pandemic was strong and timely, with a particularly strong focus on critical care anesthesia. The impact of the pandemic was strongly felt by the anesthesiology community, and their timely response served to guide our country and world through an incredibly challenging time. The pandemic highlighted the value of anesthesiologists worldwide, not only in the operating room setting but particularly as critical care physicians.",

An advanced PubMed search identified 5,722 articles published by these journals in 2020. Subsequently, articles were screened for content to divide these articles into two cohorts. Articles including mention of \"COVID,\" \"SARS,\" \"pandemic,\" \"corona,\" \"COVID-19,\" \"2019 nCoV,\" \"2019 novel coronavirus,\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" were selected for inclusion in the COVID-19related cohort, which resulted in 676 (12%) articles. The remaining articles comprised the non-COVID-19 article cohort. For all articles, the AAS was determined on April 1, 2021, using the Altmetric bookmarklet tool. The AAS is a tool that measures the dissemination of a research publication through social media, news outlets, and other media. The AAS is a cumulative score derived from contributions from numerous online media outlets. Various media outlet posts are differentially weighted based on the visibility of the medium on which it was shared. For example, a mention of an article by a news outlet is worth 32 times the value of a tweet of an article. The complete weighting system can be viewed on the AAS website [11, 13] . Concurrently, the National Institute of Health iCite function was queried to determine the number of citations accrued by each article in the analysis [14] . A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the Altmetric score for COVID-19related versus non-COVID-19-related articles. Articles in the COVID-19-related cohort were further characterized across multiple different variables, including the number of authors, country of origin, time from submission to publication, type of study design, quarter of the year it was published, and subspecialty of anesthesiology it pertained to. Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical software version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with a predetermined level of significance set as a p-value of <0.05.",

Primary authors from the United States published the highest proportion (30%) of COVID-19related articles, followed by authors from institutions in the United Kingdom (14%) and Canada (9%). The majority of articles were published in April (18%), May (20%), and June (14%) ( Figure 1 ). Most articles were related either to general anesthesiology (48%) or critical care (39%) ( Table 1) . When examined based on the type of publication, most COVID-19-related articles were determined to be editorials (71%), followed by original research articles (21%). Of the original research articles, the majority were cross-sectional (55%) studies. The mean time from submission to publication for all articles with this data available (n = 465) was 41 days, with editorial articles having the quickest turnaround time (34 days for editorials versus 60 days for non-editorials, p < 0.001). When compared with non-COVID-19-related articles, COVID-19-related articles had a significantly higher AAS (30 versus 9, p < 0.001) ( Figure 2) . Additionally, COVID-19-related articles published in quarter 1 (January to March) had a significantly higher AAS (79 versus 21 versus 12 versus 50, p < 0.001) when compared with COVID-19-related articles published during any other quarter of the year ( Table 2) . Of the COVID-19-related articles, original articles had the highest AAS when compared to editorials and guidelines (55 versus 21 versus 41, p < 0.002). There was no statistical difference in AAS across the types of original articles published, whether it was cross-sectional, review, survey, or case report (p = 0.83). The AAS for articles pertaining to general anesthesiology and critical care was higher than the other subspecialties; however, the association was not statistically significant (p = 0.65). Regarding citations, COVID-19-related articles had more citations than non-COVID-19-related articles (7 versus 0.8, p < 0.001). Articles that were published earlier in the year had more citations (37.5 (quarter 1) versus 6.7 (quarter 2) versus 0.8 (quarter 3) versus 0.4 (quarter 4), p < 0.001).

The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a great deal of interest in the medical community, specifically within the academic anesthesiology community. The AAS, a metric for the interest and attention that an article receives, was significantly higher for COVID-19-related articles. This highlights that COVID-19 research was of the utmost influence and interest to the anesthesia community during 2020. Furthermore, the AAS was the highest for articles discussing original research studies. The anesthesiology community was eager to learn about the effects of COVID-19 on their specialty, as made evident by the earliest published articles (January to March) receiving the highest levels of attention and dissemination ( Table 2 ).

This quick turnaround is a stark contrast to other studies that showed that article publication time can vary from months to years [8] . A number of explanations exist, such as the need for new COVID-19 information as the pandemic progressed, as well as increased demand to publish COVID-19-related information in a timely manner. Of note, the greatest number of articles were published in April, May, and June 2020, which represented the early stages of the pandemic when knowledge was still relatively limited.",

This demonstrates that articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic not only were of heightened public interest but also were higher in impact [11, 12] . Articles published earlier in the year accrued more citations than those published later in the year. This is most readily explained by the lag time between article publication and subsequent citation in the literature whereby articles published earlier have more time to accrue subsequent citations [9] . Given the life-and work-altering changes ushered in by the pandemic, it seems natural that these influences and impact would be reflected in the anesthesiology literature.",

The next highest mean AAS (50) was in quarter 4, and this is when many of the original articles and guideline statements began to be published. Given that non-editorial articles had a mean time to publication of 60 days versus 34 days for editorials, it is expected that these articles were published later in the year. Knowing this information, it would be interesting for future studies to assess the impact of COVID-19 articles that are published with long-term follow-up of AAS and subsequent citations in the literature. Many of these articles will likely be original articles, which lend themselves to having a higher AAS; however, the interest in COVID-19 may not ever be as high as it was at the beginning of the pandemic. Further characterization of these trends is necessary to classify this relationship.",

This is of particular importance as it highlights the unique value of anesthesiologists as both physicians in the operating room and the critical care setting.

Additionally, in this study, we elected to study the AAS as a continuous variable. Other analysis methods might reveal different trends that were outside the scope of this present study. Future studies can aim to highlight these comparisons as the data becomes available. Another limitation of this study is that we only analyzed articles published in English, which naturally excludes a fair number of articles from China, Italy, and other European countries that were affected by the pandemic.",
