Improving population health is dependent on both modifying the individual effects of social determinants of health as well as changing the structural barriers at system levels that impede population health (Canales, Drevdahl, & Kniepp, 2019; Storfjell, Winslow, & Saunders, 2017) . These upstream barriers at national and state levels prevent CNSs from improving the health of populations. Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are and will continue to be in positions that are key to identifying care need patterns and gaps in resources in the environments where patients with complex health conditions live and work (Storfjell et al., 2017) .",

Clinical nurse specialists use the latest scientific evidence in conjunction with health behavior pattern recognition to improve the quality and safety of care for all populations across the care continuum (Hansen, Kollauf, Saunders, & Santiago-Rotchford, 2019) . To safeguard the future health of the nation, CNSs are key champions of wellness and safety of not only vulnerable and complex populations, but also of individual specific patient populations across all health stages and the entire continuum of clinical and community settings (Baldwin, Black & Hammond, 2014; Coen & Curry, 2016; Fels, et al., 2015; Negley, Cordes, Evenson & Schad, 2016) . When supported to practice to the full extent of their education and commensurate licensure determined by each state, CNSs lead important system wide innovations (NACNS, 2016; NACNS, 2019a; Tracy & O'Grady, 2018) .",

In addition, even in states that have legislation that recognizes full CNS scope of practice and the CMS Final Rule 2012 that allows \"other practitioners (e.g., advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists) to perform functions within their scope of practice\" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012, p. 29034), APRNs are still frequently confined by individual hospital/institution and medical staff privileging rules and preferences that legally restrict their practice (Altman, et. al., 2016) . Clinical Nurse Specialists must be able to practice to the level of their educational preparation to optimize their role in achieving positive population health outcomes. The Consensus Model for APRN Regulation outlines the proposed regulatory requirements for APRN licensure, accreditation, certification, and education and serves as the architecture for states to standardize title, licensure and full practice for APRNs, including CNSs ( (Radley, McCarthy, & Hayes, 2017) . Storfjell and colleagues stress the imperative that APRNs need to be prepared to manage care for patients and their families with complex chronic conditions, including mental health, within their environmental setting (Storfjell et al., 2017) . As an example, mental health CNSs (an area of high patient need) encounter practice restrictions, worsening access for patients with mental illness to receive the care they need (National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), 2018). Especially problematic are those restrictions that may dissuade new CNSs to enter practice including limited or no prescriptive authority, mandatory collaboration and/or supervision, and limited or no third-party reimbursement (NCSBN, 2018) .",

The APRN Compact would allow APRNs to hold \"one multisite license with a privilege to practice in other Compact states\" (NCSBN, 2015) . Patients with complex conditions frequently require specialized care provided in specialized medical centers, which may be far from home and may be located in another state. Having all states conform to the APRN Compact will improve access to care for patients in rural areas and those requiring more complicated care needs by providing options to be cared for by CNSs who live in nearby states or via telehealth (e.g., tele-mental health). It is imperative that CNSs have legislative APRN recognition in order to continue providing their unique skills regardless of where the patient lives or receives care. Legislation at the state level that provides CNS title protection and full practice authority is the first step in supporting optimal care for patients by CNSs, regardless of their location, ensuring access to care for all patients, and allowing all states to participate in the APRN Compact (NCSBN, 2018) .",

The United States Congress has introduced the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Act of 2019 (H.R. 728) to reauthorize the federal nursing programs under Title VIII. The House passed the legislation in October 2019 and while awaiting action in the Senate, was ultimately incorporated into the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (H.R. 748) which was signed into law in March, 2020. The reauthorization of this updated legislation recognizes all four types of APRNs including the role of CNSs. This legislation also supports CNS educational programs through significant nursing grants (Congress.gov, 2020). Additionally, government agencies have begun to fully consider full practice authority of APRNs when evaluating ways to improve patient care. This includes the Veteran's Administration (VA) which has crafted clinical guidelines to allow CNSs full practice authority to perform their unique APRN role through consistent title protection and licensing from state to state in the VA regardless of the state in which the individual VA hospital or facility is located (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017; NACNS, 2019b). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is also considering this issue as it has previously solicited additional input and recommendations regarding the elimination of specific Medicare regulations that require more stringent supervision than existing state scope of practice laws, or that limit nurses and other health professionals from practicing to the full extent of their education and competence. Late last year, the White House released an Executive Order on \"Protecting and Improving Medicare for our Nation's Seniors.\" Section 5 of this Executive Order directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to propose reforms to the Medicare program to enable providers to spend more time with patients by including a \"comprehensive review of regulatory policies that create disparities in reimbursement between physicians and non-physician practitioners and proposing a regulation that would, to the extent allowed by law, ensure that items and services provided by clinicians, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, are appropriately reimbursed in accordance with the work performed rather than the clinician's occupation\" (Executive Order, 2019).",
