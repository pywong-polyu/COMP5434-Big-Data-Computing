We created pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) care pathways as decision aids for our multidisciplinary team to use when counseling patients. Methods Using a modified Delphi process, an expert team reviewed existing guidelines and literature to reach consensus on pathway definitions and components. Results Entry to the care pathways occurs via an advanced practice provider visit. Symptom and quality-of-life questionnaires as well as open-ended patient goals are used to guide patient-provider shared decision making. All treatment choices, including surgical and nonsurgical management, are presented to patients by advanced practice providers. Patients electing nonsurgical management follow-up by telehealth (preferred) or in-person visits as determined by the care pathway. Surgeon consultations are scheduled for patients desiring surgery. Surgical patients undergo urodynamics, simple cystometrics or deferred bladder testing according to the urodynamics clinical pathway. Postoperative follow-up includes telehealth visits and minimizes in-person visits for women with uncomplicated postoperative courses. Patients with resolution of symptoms are graduated from clinic and return to their referring physician. The pathways are revised following publication of new compelling evidence. Conclusions We developed POP and SUI care pathways to standardize care across a diverse provider group. Advanced practice providers use care pathways with patients as shared decision-making tools for initial evaluation of patients with prolapse and incontinence. These pathways serve as components of value-based care and encourage team members to function independently while utilizing the full scope of their training.",

            "text": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and urinary incontinence (UI) are commonly diagnosed conditions. In the United States up to 4.9 million women will be diagnosed with prolapse by 2050, and an estimated 28.4 million are expected to suffer from urinary incontinence [1] . Although 11% of women will undergo surgery for POP or UI before age 80, many patients elect to manage these quality-of-life conditions conservatively in the outpatient setting [2] . The urogynecology provider must deliver high-quality and effective care for patients with POP and/or UI using both surgical and nonsurgical interventions. Value-based healthcare, defined as improvement in patient-centered outcomes at lower healthcare costs, is an increasingly important consideration in healthcare delivery [3] . Standardized care pathways are used to ensure evidencebased and high-value care and have been shown to improve clinical outcomes [4] [5] [6] [7] . Although clinical pathways may incorporate a variety of components, it is generally accepted that a pathway must detail the steps for delivery of structured, multidisciplinary care based on sound evidence for a distinct patient population [8] .",

A multidisciplinary expert team, including generalist obstetricians and gynecologists, urogynecology surgeons, APPs, and pelvic floor physical therapists contributed to the development of the standardized POP care pathway. This team reviewed existing guidelines and literature for POP and SUI diagnosis and treatment, including landmark articles and society opinions, to reach consensus on care pathway definitions and components. A modified Delphi technique was utilized for construction of the care pathways [11] . Using this technique, providers first discussed possible definitions and components of a POP or SUI care pathway in an open-ended fashion. After an initial care pathway was developed, it was presented to the group for revisions and feedback was obtained to edit the pathway. With each variation of the clinical pathway, group feedback was obtained and used to modify the pathway until reliable consensus was reached. The same process was used to design the urodynamics clinical pathway. All pathways underwent external expert review. These pathways were then instituted in the University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School Women's Health Institute IPU. Pathways are periodically revised by the multidisciplinary team following publication of new compelling evidence or with opportunity for optimizing value-based care.",

Although surgical care pathways for the treatment of POP and surgical decision aids for SUI have previously been developed, similar pathways for initial evaluation and nonsurgical management of POP and SUI described here are not commonly utilized [26] [27] [28] . Second, a clear clinical pathway allows for all care team members to function independently while utilizing the full scope of their training, and to work effectively as a team. All recommended components of the initial patient evaluation, including review of PROs and goals, POP-Q examination, and counseling on treatment options, may be carried out by an experienced APP without direct supervision per American Urogynecologic Society guidelines [29] . This allows the urogynecology surgeon to evaluate primarily surgical patients and complex cases requiring their care. Finally, the pathway promotes value-based care through evidence-based recommendations. Weaknesses include pathway development and implementation at a single institution with a unique integrated practice unit care setting. The authors recognize that their interpretation of available literature for pathway development may differ from other experts in the field, and have attempted to minimize this bias through external expert review. Nonetheless, the pathways may not be easily utilized effectively or without modifications in other practice settings. In addition, patients often present with more than one concurrent pelvic floor disorder, making strict adherence to a single clinical pathway more difficult. Finally, individual and systemic challenges to pathway implementation have been previously described [30] .",

Hospital and intensive care unit length of stay were decreased for patients receiving care according to clinical pathways after blunt thoracic injury [4] . Pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were managed with an evidence-based care pathway also had a decreased length of hospital stay and overall cost, without an increase in readmission [5] . In addition, clinical pathways improve quality by ensuring evidence-based, efficient, and safe care [6, 7] . Our proposed pathway further promotes value-based care through an integrated multidisciplinary team, with the initial evaluation and counseling performed by APPs. A recent Cochrane review noted equivalent or improved health outcomes, quality of care, and patient satisfaction with nurse-led care [31] . Independently practicing primary care nurse practitioners have been found to deliver high-quality care with fewer patient emergency room visits [32] . As APPs are increasingly integrated into the urogynecology clinical setting, standardized pathways may further strengthen the quality of patient care and interprofessional collaboration [29] .",

Patient expectations and perceptions of their pelvic floor disorders and treatment are intimately tied to their individual goals [33] . The achievement of patientdefined goals correlates with an increased likelihood of continuing treatment, such as continuation of pessary use for management of prolapse symptoms [34] . Despite this, PROs are most often utilized as outcome measures in a research setting and less frequently used to guide clinical care [35] . Our pathways provide evidence-based, patient-centered care by allowing PROs and goals to guide clinical decision making. Improved patient retention in a clinic utilizing care navigation pathways for overactive bladder has been demonstrated, suggesting that patients might be satisfied with pathway-driven care [36] . Future cost analyses comparing multidisciplinary clinic use of evidence-based care pathways with a traditional care model would be valuable contributions to the literature on value-based care. Investigation of provider and patient satisfaction with their care and clinical outcomes within a POP and/or SUI pathway are needed. Data collection of these outcome measures is ongoing at our institution.",

These questionnaires were selected as the most commonly utilized symptom bother questionnaires in urogynecology studies and mental health screening in the primary care literature. Responses are used to guide patient-provider shared decision making throughout the patient's time under IPU care. A thorough patient history is obtained. Evaluation includes measurement of post-void residual (PVR) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) examination. Treatment choices of pessary, PFPT, and surgery are presented to all patients by APPs and one initial option is selected through shared decision making.",
