            "text": "The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has had a huge impact on people's lives all over the world, and the overwhelmingly negative information about the epidemic has made people panic for the future. This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying. Finally, two cases are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.",

At present, the long-term epidemic and the overwhelmingly negative news have made people panic about the future. Driven by this panic, panic buying has been rampant everywhere. For example, there has been news that toilet paper and masks are the same raw material, and the shortage of masks will inevitably lead to a shortage of toilet paper, which has triggered a panic buying of toilet paper in Japan, Australia, and other places (1) . The panic buying boom quickly spread to more people through social media, and further amplified people's panic about the shortage of materials, and resulted in offline large-scale panic buying. Therefore, panic buying not only seriously endangers social order and environmental safety, but also easily causes insufficient social supply. Therefore, it is of important theoretical and practical significance to analyze the key factors affecting panic buying and explore the underlying reasons for its formation.",

After the occurrence of COVID-19, scholars have generally observed the impact of COVID-19 on commodity supply and need (4) and public mental health (5) , which has led to a surge in panic buying incidents around the world (6) . Herd mentality promotes the further spread of panic buying behavior (7) . However, current research is mostly qualitative explanations without quantitative analysis. In addition, most of the research methods are statistical analysis methods, such as stepwise regression (8) or structural equation (9) .

            "text": "The suddenness and severity of sudden disaster events will trigger people's ultra-large-scale need for basic materials in the short term, which will cause a certain impact on the supply chain of survival necessities such as food, and even interrupt the supply chain. The ensuing imbalance of supply and need has further aggravated the panic buying behavior of people. Forbes (10) took the Christchurch earthquake in 2011 as an example, and deeply studied the change of consumer preferences caused by disasters; they found that consumers bought more practical products necessary for survival after disasters. Upton and Nuttall (11) proposed an agent-based model to simulate the transient need of the supply chain and consumers under the fuel crisis event and verified it with the fuel panic crisis events in the UK in 2000 and 2012, which provided practical suggestions for the panic buying of fuel. Arafat et al. collected media reports with the keyword of 'panic buying' (2) , and found through statistical data analysis (12) that the sense of product scarcity was an important factor leading to panic buying during COVID-19. In addition, there were also factors such as increased demand, importance of products, anticipation of price hike, etc. To investigate the mechanism of urban consumers' food hoarding behaviors, Wang and Holly (13) took three cities in China as samples and used the multivariate probit model to study. They found that people's food on hand and their expectation of the possibility of COVID-19 infection were the main factors affecting food hoarding. The above literature explains the occurrence of panic buying from the perspective of imbalance between supply and need. After a sudden epidemic such as COVID-19, the public's need for food and other practical commodities surged. Due to insufficient market supply, commodity shortages and price increases have occurred, intensifying panic buying behavior. Compared with other disasters, the particularity of COVID-19, that is, the risk of contracting the virus, will have an important impact on people's panic buying behavior. Therefore, when studying panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic, it is necessary to consider both physiological (material) and safety needs.",

            "text": "Sudden disaster events often trigger negative emotions among people. Some scholars have interpreted panic buying behavior from an emotional perspective. Thomas and Monica (14) took the September 11 attacks in the United States as an example, and pointed out that panic buying was a kind of self-protection behavior taken by the public in response to terrorism in panic. Sneath et al. (15) took Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as an example, and proposed a structural model based on the life event theory. The results showed that event-induced stress affects depression, which in turn leads to impulsive and compulsive buying behavior. Based on the stimulus-body response (SOR) model, Pandita et al. (16) adopted qualitative research methods, such as personal interview, and found that COVID-19 would lead to students' psychological problems, such as academic anxiety and fear, and behavioral problems such as panic buying. Bacon and Corr (17) conducted a questionnaire survey of British respondents and found that people were experiencing a psychological conflict between the urge to stay safe and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life, and panic buying was one of the ways to improve this psychological conflict. Christian and Ronn (18) used the health anxiety scale and open-ended questions to conduct online surveys on people's feelings, thoughts, and behaviors during the period of strengthening community isolation, and constructed the spectrum of panic consequences caused by COVID-19, including panic buying (18) . Yuen et al. (19) systematically reviewed the psychological causes of panic buying and pointed out that people would regard panic buying as the behavior of relieving anxiety and re-controlling a crisis. Jezewska et al. (20) used logistic regression analysis on the data of 1,033 Polish adults, and found that stress and trust in different information sources can lead to people's fear of limited food, and then lead to panic buying behavior. Arafat et al. (21) systematically reviewed the psychological explanations behind panic buying in critical moments and found that fear of scarcity and losing control over the environment, insecurity (which could be because of fear), social learning, and exacerbation of anxiety, are the basic primitive responses of humans responsible for the panic buying phenomenon. The above literature describes the emotional state of people's panic, anxiety, and depression after a disaster and the aggravating effect of these emotions on panic buying behavior. However, the research methods are mostly qualitative research, such as questionnaires and interviews, and there is limited research on the quantitative relationship between emotion and behavior. At the same time, the existing quantitative relationship research does not consider the influence of commodity supply and need on emotion.",

Charles (22) , a British scholar, used a large number of factual cases to show that when an individual was in a group environment, he was quick to show extreme imitation and gregariousness. Pochea et al. (23) used quantile regression analysis as an estimation method, and found evidence of herding behavior in all central and Eastern European countries, except Poland and Romania: when the market rises, investors will follow each other in buying transactions, but when the market turns down, investors will not follow each other. Ahmed et al. (24) used the multivariate method based on the structural equation model to study the data of 889 consumers and found that peer purchase and other factors had an important impact on the impulsive purchase mode. Zheng et al. (25) pointed out that consumers tend to imitate others, and social media posts can play an important role in the diffusion of imitation and purchase behavior. Chen et al. (26) used the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model to describe the state transition of individuals, studied the spread of public opinion in combination with the heterogeneity characteristics, such as individual herd, and verified the rationality and effectiveness of the model with the pricing event of the COVID-19 vaccine independently developed in China. Li et al. (27) integrated the particularity of panic buying public opinion, established a model of panic buying public opinion transmission, and analyzed the material panic buying problem caused by panic in an uncertain environment through computational simulation experiments. The above literature explains the reasons for the spread of panic buying behavior from the perspective of public psychology, and points out that social network media has become the main carrier of the rapid spread of panic. However, the above research has the problem of too much qualitative analysis and too little quantitative analysis.",

When individuals contact each other, there is a certain probability that they will transform each other. After that, scholars have carried out extended research on the basis of the SIR model, such as improving the crowd classification method, improving the propagation rules, and so on. For example, Chen et al. (26) added an individual category of exposed state and constructed the SEIR model.

All kinds of news related to the epidemic on the Internet can stimulate the actual needs of people. For example, seeing the news of other infected people enables individuals to perceive that they are in a dangerous environment and generate safety needs. The news of supply shortages will make individuals think about whether one's future life is guaranteed; in turn, there will be a need for supplies. If these actual needs are not met, the individual will panic. In addition, people will browse and publish information related to their lives on the Internet. Once they find their neighbors participate in panic buying, they will also have a buying desire due to group psychology. In reality, the unsafety of panic buying behavior increases their panic. Based on the above analysis, E i (t) is used to represent the panic value of individual i at time t and E i (t)\u2208[0, 1]. The higher the value is, the higher the panic degree is. Its calculation formula is as follows: where a and b are the weights of material need (physiological need) and safety need from an individual level, respectively (a + b = 1).

Due to the long-term inability to go out during the epidemic, in order to prevent shortage of supplies and meet their own physiological needs, people may rush to buy, hoarding a large amount of supplies at once. In addition, under the influence of panic, people with sufficient supplies may follow others and participate in panic buying. At the same time, there is a certain correlation between individual needs and panic. Individual needs are the internal factors causing panic. In order to analyze the influence of individual needs (material need, safety need) and the panic on the spread of panic buying behavior, different individual needs are set by random distribution. One hundred simulation experiments were carried out and the following information was recorded: the initial average material need, the initial average safety need, the initial panic value, maximum number of panic buyers, the moment to reach the maximum scale, and the moment when panic buying disappears completely. The demonstration of the maximum number of panic buyers, the moment to reach the maximum scale, and the moment when panic buying disappears completely is shown as Figure 5A . Figure 5 shows the comprehensive influence of individual demand and panic on panic buying. As can be seen from Figure 5B , the lower the safety need is, the higher the material need is, the higher the panic is, the more the maximum number of panic buyers is, and the larger the scale of panic buying is. As can be seen from Figure 5C , the higher the safety need is, the lower the material need is and the lower the panic is, so the shorter the time to reach the maximum scale of panic buying is. Moreover, the change brought by material need is greater than the change brought by safety need, indicating that the moment to reach the maximum scale of buying is more affected by the change of material need. As can be seen from Figure 5D , the moment when panic buying disappears completely has little correlation with individual needs and panic. Therefore, material need and panic have a positive impact on the scale and moment of panic buying, which has a negative impact on the scale of panic buying and the moment to reach the maximum scale. Individual need and panic have no obvious correlation with the disappearance of panic buying.",

The initial panic buying occurs and is influenced by other individuals. The individual panic spreads continuously, leading to the rise of polarization. In the latter stages, the panic buying has dissipated and the panic has abated. This is because in the early stage of spreading, the higher the individual conformity is, the higher the polarization rate of panic (the wider spreading range) and the shorter the time to reach the highest polarization rate (the faster spreading speed) will be, which is consistent with the conclusion in Figure 6 . In addition, in the later stage of spreading, the higher the individual conformity is, the faster the rate of panic polarization decreases. Higher conformity means listening to the opinions of others is easier, and the panic will dissipate faster. Therefore, although the increase of conformity makes the panic spread more widely and spread faster, it also makes the panic dissipate faster. In real life, in order to alleviate people's panic, relevant departments can guide people not to follow blindly and maintain independent thinking ability in the early stage of the event.

However, if the individual has a smaller social circle and fewer people to communicate with, will the spread of panic and panic buying behavior be affected? Therefore, BA scale-free networks with different connection numbers are set up. BA scale-free network is a network generated according to the adoption of growth mechanism and priority connection mechanism. It changes the number of edges m increased each time, so as to understand the influence of interaction number on the spread of panic buying behavior. The simulation results are shown in Figure 8 . Figure 8 shows the influence of interaction number on the spread of panic buying. Figure 8A shows the change of panic polarizability over time under different numbers of connections, which show different effects at different stages. Time\u2208(1, 6) is the formation stage of panic emotion. At this time, the number of connections has no obvious effect on panic. Time\u2208 (6, 20) is the main stage of panic remission. At this time, the panic polarizability is the highest when m = 3, followed by m = 6, and finally m = 1. This shows that the number of communicators does not faster reduce panic emotion. Instead, there is a threshold. When the number of nodes in the network reaches this threshold, the panic will reduce the fastest; over or under this threshold, the rate will slow down. In real life, if there are too many communicators, the individual may need to consider more and be more cautious. If there are too few communicators, they may be more self-centered and opinionated. Time\u2208 [20, 50] is the final stage of the panic reduction. At this time, the reducing speed of the panic is proportional to the number of node edges.

Therefore, in order to alleviate the panic among the people, the relevant departments must distinguish the stages. In the initial stage of panic reduction, their best strategy is to properly grasp the connection between people, and not to deliberately block or guide people communicate. When the panic has dropped to a certain level, the communication among members of the society should be reduced as much as possible, and the channels of information spread should be reduced. Figure 8B shows the distribution of panic buyers over time under different numbers of connected edges. It can be seen from the figure that the number of edges has no influence on the spread of panic buying behavior, so the number of people interacting has little influence on the spread of panic buying behavior. On the one hand, it may be that the influence of interaction number on panic emotion is mainly in the withdrawal period of emotion, and has no influence on the formation of panic emotion in the early stage, so there is little correlation on the spread of panic buying behavior. On the other hand, it may be because there are fewer isolated nodes in the network. Although there are differences in the number of individuals interacting with each other, it is still a closely connected network in general, and there is no isolated small group, therefore, it is easy to interact with each other, resulting in a chain reaction and forming panic buying.",

            "text": "Changes in external information will lead to changes in people's needs, which will affect people's desire to buy. For example, Chen et al. (32) studied the polarization of multi-dimensional public opinion and they found that the intervention of external information in different times and dimensions will affect the spread of public opinion. Keane and Neal (33) constructed a daily consumer panic index for 54 countries from January to April 2020. Research shows that the announcement of movement restrictions at the beginning of a pandemic can cause more panic than later announcements. Thus, this section will analyze the impact of the released time of external information on the spread of panic buying behavior, which will help relevant departments to explore the best time to release information, so as to better grasp the opportunity for intervening. The situation where the epidemic information about safety and supplies is negative and unchanged is studied first. The simulation results are shown in Figure 9A . It can be found that the number of infected people (I) reaches the maximum at t = 3, and the curves of infected people (I) and recovered people (R) intersect at t = 15. At t = 32, the number of infected people (I) drops to 0, and no individuals are participating in panic buying. Later, the influence of changes in external information on the spread of panic buying is observed, and the general direction of the change of epidemic information is that the material-related information changes from negative to positive, and the safety-related information changes from negative to positive, that is, material need and safety need are gradually reduced. Taking the time t = 3, 15, and 32 as anchor points, through the adjustment of the time points of the epidemic information change, the changes in the spread of panic buying are discussed. The change time points of the epidemic information are set to t = 2, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40, respectively. The results are shown in Figures 9B-G.   Figures 9B-G shows the changes at t = 2, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40. Comparing Figures 9B,C and Figure 9A , we can see that if the epidemic information changes before the first panic buying reaches a maximized scale, it will not cause a second wave of panic buying, otherwise there will be. Comparing Figures 9A,C-E, it can be seen that if the epidemic information changes occur before the I and R curves intersect, the impact on panic buying will fluctuate less, and vice versa. When t = 30, the first panic buying is about to end, and when t = 40, the first panic buying has completely ended. Comparing Figures 9A,F,G, it can be seen that the maximum size of the second panic buying at t = 30 is about 450 people, and the maximum size of the second panic buying at t = 40 is about 400 people. This shows that when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second wave of panic buying is to be controlled, the effect of releasing positive information after the first panic buying is better than before the end.",
