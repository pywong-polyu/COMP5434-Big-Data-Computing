Ontology offers the richest machineinterpretable (rather than just machine-processable) and explicit semantics that are being extensively used in the biodiversity domain. Various ontologies are developed for the biodiversity domain however a review of the current landscape shows that these ontologies are not capable to define the Indian biodiversity information though India is one of the megadiverse countries. To semantically analyze the Indian biodiversity information, it is crucial to build an ontology that describes all the essential terms of this domain from the unstructured format of the data available on the web. Since, the curation of the ontologies heavily depends on the domain where these are implemented hence there is no ideal methodology is defined yet to be ready for universal use. The aim of this article is to develop an ontology that semantically encodes all the terms of Indian biodiversity information in all its dimensions based on the proposed methodology. The comprehensive evaluation of the proposed ontology depicts that ontology is well built in the specified domain.",

For this purpose, users use motivation scenarios and write competency questions that provide a clear understanding of the purpose and scope of the ontology. \u2022 Now, the next step is to collect and analyze the information as per the defined scope of the ontology. For this purpose, users can use different sources or repositories and can also conduct the interview with domain experts in order to collect the information. This step is also called knowledge acquisition. \u2022 After collecting and analyzing all the required information, now need to formalize it. For this purpose, first, specify the classes and their properties. The formal competency questions can be utilized here to know that which concepts or entities will be treated as a class. Now, we start to build up the ontology by encoding the classes and properties. As per the need of the domain, we imposed constraints on the classes and their properties that act as axioms and help us to extract the semantic information from the ontology. It is good practice to use the existing concepts of the upper ontology or any standard ontologies so that data integration can be done smoothly and can avoid the multiple interpretations of the same entity. \u2022 To check the quality of the developed ontology is a very vital step of ontology development methodologies. Ontology evaluation shows completeness (Ontology contains all the required information as per domain need), accuracy (ontology is able to infer the correct answer of all the imposed queries), Correctness (Ontology is well encoded or build). There are various tools available that can be used to check the quality of the ontology. The competency questions are also very helpful for the evaluation of ontology. \u2022 The last step of ontology development methodologies is to document the ontology that can become the base of other activities. Apart from these methodologies, two methodologies namely Neon [4] , and SAMOD [5] are also available in the literature for the development of the ontology. Neon Methodology: This is a scenario-based methodology that focuses on the collaborative aspects of ontology development [6] . A set of nine scenarios is the key to this methodology. These nine scenarios are: (1) From the application specification: The ontology is developed from scratch and developers must specify the requirement of the ontology. (2) The reuse and reengineering of non-ontological resources: The developer must decide the reuse terms from the non-ontological resources and must return to the ontological reengineering process. is a new agile methodology that permits to development of the ontology in an iterative workflow manner. It focuses on to create well developed and well-documented models beginning from domain description. This methodology has three iterative steps (1) ontology engineers collect all the essential information about a domain with the help of domain experts. The aim of this step is to build the model by using ontology development principles. If everything works fine then release the prototype and proceed further (2) Ontology engineers merge the model of new test cases with the old one that proceeds in the proceeding step. If everything works fine then release the prototype and proceed further (3) Ontology engineers refactors the current models with concentrating on the last added part. If everything works fine then release the prototype and if there is another scenario that needs to be addressed then iterate the process.",

The aim of this ontology is to fill the gaps between biodiversity resources-related ontologies and semantic publishing ontologies. OpenBiodiv ontology focuses on the biological taxonomy and contains classes, relations, properties, and axioms. These classes are aligned with other relevant domain ontologies. \u2022 The authors Albuquerque et al. [8] developed a biodiversity ontology called OntoBio ontology. This ontology is divided into five sub-ontologies namely Sub-Ontology Collect, Sub-Ontology Material Entity, Sub-Ontology Ecosystem, Sub-Ontology Spatial Location, and Sub-Ontology Environment. These sub-ontologies are connected by the relationship between concepts and axioms. \u2022 The authors Walls et al. [3] have developed Biological Collections Ontology (BCO) that supports semantic sharing of biodiversity data. BCO includes the data from museum collections, environmental samples, and ecological surveys. BCO ontology offers a clear and well-structured logical definition of terms about the biological data and these terms are organized in a hierarchal manner. The latest version of BCO ontology is released on 31.03.2020 and openly available on various portals like bio portal and OBO foundry, for the public use. \u2022 The author Franco has developed a Biodiversity Ontology (BOF) that contains information about the biodiversity of INPA [9]. The latest version of BOF ontology is released on 08.01.2012 and openly available on various portals like bio portal and AberOWL, for public use. Although these ontologies have enough information about the biodiversity domain yet these ontologies cannot use in the Indian biodiversity domain because they do not offer complete information about the Indian biodiversity. A lot of data about Indian biodiversity is available on the web in different formats (like text, audio, videos, research articles) therefore it is essential to curate or develop the ontology from the available unstructured data so that users can get precise information of the imposed queries.",

We also identify the connecting points that connect the concepts with each other. Knowledge Synthesis: All the element-level concepts are organized in a hierarchical manner by defining the relationship between the concepts [14] . For example, class Biosphere Reserves relates with class Protected area categories via is_a relationship. We also impose the constraints on the concepts that restrict the interpretation of that concept like class Biosphere Reserves should be disjoint with class National_Parks. All the constraints and axioms are imposed on the basis of competency questions and motivation scenarios that help in the building of the correct ontology as per need. Reuse concept: To reuse the concepts assist to avoid multiple interpretations of the concepts. Few ontologies about the biodiversity information are available publicly so it is required to reuse or import the required concepts in the InBiodiv-O ontology.

The InBiodiv-O ontology has schema-level information about the Indian biodiversity domain that is encoded in web ontology language (OWL) by the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 5.5.0 tool. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is an open-source tool and allows the export of the ontology in various data formats (like RDF/XML, OWL/XML, OBO, and so on), and these formats are compatible with each other. By default, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tool supports Pellet and Hermit reasoners in order to check the consistency of the ontology. The ontology knowledge base consists of schema and instancelevel information. We have encoded schema-level information inside InBiodiv-O ontology by defining classes and their properties. The development of ontology is not the same as an objectoriented programming language. In ontology, the design decision is made on the basis of the structural properties of a class whereas in the object-oriented programming language, the design decision made on the basis of the operational properties of a class. Therefore, in the same domain, the class structure and relations (that hold between the classes) might not be the same in ontology and object-oriented programming. Defining Classes and Properties: The classes are the main entity of the ontology and it defines the reality of a domain. Thing is a main class of ontology and all the classes become the subclasses of the Thing class. All the classes are organized in a hierarchical manner. Three approaches are defined to build the ontology hierarchy. These approaches are (a) Top-down approach: define the most general classes and later on break them into more specific classes (b) Bottom-up approach: define most specific classes and later on group them into more general classes. (c) Combination approach: define more silent classes and later on make these classes specific and general as per need. We follow the combination approach to build the class hierarchy of InBiodiv-O ontology. Classes can have restrictions on themselves, for example, a class can be a SubClassof, Disjoint with, disjoint union, and many others.",

The proposed InBiodiv-O ontology describes the complete information about the Indian biodiversity domain and imported some concepts from the available ontologies as needed. Thus InBiodiv-O ontology is itself unique in scope. b) Criteria-based Method: We use a criteria-based method to evaluate the ontology qualitatively.
