Although the term rapid prototyping is commonly used, it is not precise. The technology is not limited only to the production of prototypes; it is adequate to fabricate both fully functional finished products and tools. The applications of rapid prototyping range from industrial to architectural to archaeological. Rapid prototyping of physical models is also becoming increasingly more important in medicine (e.g., implantology, prosthetics, forensic medicine).",

Since it does not require support structures, it is well-suited for manufacturing elements that need to be mechanically strong, are complex in shape and design or will operate in sliding contact. SLS is generally used in short series production or to fabricate customized products. It is also commonly employed to test and validate form, fit and functionality, which is essential for automotive, aerospace, medical, machine or appliance parts [13, 14] . Stereolithography (SLA, or SL) is the oldest 3D printing technology and still the most common for rapid prototyping. It is a laser-based method in which liquid resin is exposed to UV radiation. An object is printed \"bottom up\" by focusing a UV laser beam to scan the resin surface and selectively cure the material as successive cross-sectional layers are built. Supports required for protruding elements or cavities are formed automatically; their removal, however, is manual. SLA has a wide range of applications including visual prototypes, display elements, vacuum-casting (VC) patterns, industrial and non-industrial design projects, investment casting molds (TetraShell) and elements with intricate details. As it enables surface metallization, it is also an alternative for sheet metal prototypes [15, 16] .",

Deposition of melted material resembles printing with an ordinary ink jet printer. Heated nozzles moving along the X and Y axes melt the material to form a 3D object on the platform, which is lowered after each layer in the Z direction. This technique offers ready-to-use elements for the automotive and aviation industries; it is also suitable for prototyping in a variety of industries. The key advantage of FDM is the durability of materials, high quality of objects and stability of their mechanical properties over time. The materials employed in this technology are, for instance, e.g., ABS, [17, 18] . Selective Laser Melting (SLM), or 3D metal printing, is becoming increasingly popular. Direct printing to obtain complex, end-use products with high surface finish optimizes costs, which would be higher in traditional methods of production; it also reduces the object mass and the lead time. Like in Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), parts are built from metal powder deposited in thin successive layers and then exposed to laser light. Support structures of the same material are created automatically, but they need to be removed manually. Printed objects undergo heat treatment. There is a high degree of flexibility of design in terms of mechanical properties of metal [19] .",

Multi Jet Fusion is a powder- based technology with no use of laser. First, the powder bed is uniformly heated. Then, the fusing agent is sprayed onto the material to fuse particles selectively. The detailing agent is sprayed around the contours to improve the object resolution. When the lamps pass over the surface of the powder bed, the sprayed material absorbs heat and helps distribute it evenly. Multi Jet Fusion uses fine-grained materials to produce ultra-thin layers, 80 micron in thickness. Objects obtained in this way have higher density and lower porosity than those printed by selective laser sintering. The smooth surface achieved by the printer requires minimum finishing. This implies shorter lead times, which are crucial with functional prototypes and in small series manufacturing. The materials common in this technology are PA 12 and Ultrasint TPU 90A-01 [20, 21] .",

PolyJet is the first technology that allows two types of resin to be deposited simultaneously in one process. It can thus be applied to produce complex highquality objects. PolyJet involves spraying photocurable polymer to form an ultra-thin layer on the build tray. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light just after it is sprayed, which means printed objects can undergo finishing immediately. After 3D printing, gel-like support material is removed by spraying it with water. The PolyJet technology can be used to form horizontal layers with a thickness of just 16 microns, tiny details, and ultrathin 0.6 mm thick walls, depending on the object geometry. PolyJet printing is commonly used to fabricate high precision mechanical subassemblies, components with elastic properties (seals, gaskets, O-rings, washers), components in a range of Shore A hardness scale values, casting master patterns (e.g., in vacuum casting) and high-quality prototypes within short lead times. The materials used in the PolyJet technology are objet Vero colored, objet VeroClear, objet Tango, and composites [17, 22, 23] .",

It helps significantly reduce costs and time required to carefully design and then manufacture different types of valves. Verification of CFD simulation results obtained for 3D printed valve models, which requires comparing them with experimental data, is of crucial importance, as it allows us to discover and eliminate design errors at early stages, and, if necessary, easily redesign the valve before it reaches the production stage. This approach to the development of pneumatic directional control valves can be viewed as innovative.",

            "text": "Pneumatic directional control valves are elements designed to control the fluid flow in pneumatic drive and control systems [24, 25] . The direction of the fluid flow in a directional control valve can be changed by moving the spool. The spool is generally a plunger with seals, moving inside the body of a directional control valve between two extreme positions. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the 3/2 valve with its principle of operation. 3/2 directional control valves are some of the most common sliding spool valves. When the spool is on the right (Figure 1a) , the fluid flows along ways 1 and 2, with way 3 being cut off. After the spool moves to the left (Figure 1b) , the fluid flows along ways 2 and 3, with way 1 being cut off. Figure 2 shows the solid model of the 3/2 directional control valve developed in a 3D CAD program, taking into account the above principle of operation and the information about the existing designs. Pneumatic directional control valves fall into directly and indirectly actuated. In the valve considered here, control signals come from the control elements. In practice, these are miniature pneumatic valves with electromagnetic control and low power of an order of several watts. Such a solution is economically beneficial, because if the spool were actuated in a direct way by means of electromagnets, considerable power would be necessary to produce a force resisting the motion of the spool and the pressure of the compressed air acting on the spool. Indirect actuation of directional control valves involves switching an electric or external pressure signal of the adaptor (most commonly, a mini valve) to ensure adequate pressure of the working fluid on the active surface of the spool of the main valve, causing its movement. Generally, the initial valve is controlled mechanically as well. This allows the valve spool to shift with no need to provide electric or pneumatic signals. The key advantage of indirect actuation is that it is possible to control valves with a high flow rate using small-power electromagnets [26] . The main drawback is that the spool shifting and idle times are longer, when compared with those reported for directional control valves.

Expansion takes place at the outlet; the pressure in the outlet port is almost equal to ambient pressure. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the gas flow rate (velocity) and the gas Mach number. As can be seen, the pressure is virtually stable and equal to the pressure at the inlet to the valve. Expansion takes place at the outlet; the pressure in the outlet port is almost equal to ambient pressure. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the gas flow rate (velocity) and the gas Mach number. Air flows into port 1 with a rate of approximately 300 [m/s]. As can be seen, the rate with which air flows through the inlet and outlet close to the walls is equal to zero.

In pneumatic systems, energy efficiency can be improved mainly by reducing pressure loss and preventing leakage. As these factors are responsible for high operation and maintenance costs, changes in the design and production of pneumatic elements are necessary. The rapid prototyping technique used in this study has proved suitable to create 3D models and construct fully functional prototypes of pneumatic directional control valves in a short time and at a low cost. This technology can be used to produce customized pneumatic directional control valves. The approach presented in this paper enables us to obtain pneumatic valves with optimal design and performance, which can be produced in short series. The material that the pneumatic directional control valve was made of showed no defects after pressure and flow tests performed using a special test stand.",

Silicone paste was also used to eliminate external leaks, i.e., leaks of compressed air into the atmosphere. The design of the spool enabled optimal fit between the spool and the subbase. This solution significantly reduced internal leaks, i.e., those between the ports, but it did not eliminate them completely. A better alternative would be to use seals on the spool. But this would require additional elements, i.e., seals, made in technologies other than 3D printing. The aim of this study was to use one process to construct a ready-to-use valve suitable for various industrial applications. In their future research, the authors will attempt to design and print a new type of valve with better flow parameters using a different technology, e.g., SLM. ",
