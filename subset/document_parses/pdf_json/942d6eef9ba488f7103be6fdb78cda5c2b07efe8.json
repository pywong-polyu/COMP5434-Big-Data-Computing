When this occurs, underprivileged (such a low-income) and vulnerable populations (such as minorities) are disproportionately affected, contributing to heightened prevalence in morbidity and mortality among these groups. 6, 13, 14 In the current COVID-19 pandemic, New York City (NYC) has the largest number of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Recent data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) shows higher rates of COVID-19 deaths among Latinos and Blacks in comparison to Whites and Asians who reside in the City's five boroughs. 9 Data from NYCDOHMH indicates that a significant proportion of patients had an underlying medical condition (such as diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension and asthma). 9 This finding is consistent with prior research on SARS coronavirus indicating that underlying medical conditions led to severe disease progression or death among persons infected with coronavirus. 3, 16 Even though 76% of Queens' residents self-report their physical and mental health to be 'very good' or 'excellent', and only 14% reported to be smokers, 7 underlying medical chronic conditions continue to be an issue in the borough. Some of these parallel the underlying health conditions to have caused severe COVID-19 disease and death. While these diseases are important due to their association with increased risk of death from COVID-19, they alone cannot explain the disproportionately higher levels of infections and deaths currently observed in certain neighborhoods in Queens. The purpose of this study is to provide a descriptive analysis of communities severely impacted by COVID-19 to that of communities less affected by COVID-19, with an emphasis on the social determinant factors within them.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 215, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 216, "end": 218, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 219, "end": 221, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 694, "end": 696, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 697, "end": 700, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 701, "end": 703, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1035, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1205, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1405, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1408, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This study is a descriptive analysis of three community districts with an extremely high incidence of coronavirus (COVDI19) in comparison with three community districts with the moderate incidence of COVID-19 in Queens, New York.

Communities with extremely high incidence were collapsed and averaged into one group (called Group A-Extremely High Cases).

Table 1 shows the percentages of demographics and social determinant factors that were averaged and compared between the two groups. You will notice that the population between Groups A and B is similar in size. However, COVID-19 cases show to be 30% greater in Group A-Extremely High Cases than in Group B-Moderate Cases. Similarly, Group A shows to be significantly overcrowded than Group B, almost twice the average percentage. Blacks represent the largest of all racial groups in Group A followed by Latinos.

Our results show that overcrowding, chronic diseases, limited access to healthcare and poor education were prevalent in communities with severely high rates of COVID-19. As noted above, overcrowding in severely affected communities was almost double the percentage in comparison to moderately affected communities. 11 This is consistent with prior studies that highlight population density and overcrowding in urban areas as a breeding ground for the rapid spread of infectious diseases. 4, 17 Moreover, the communities affected with COVID-19 such as Corona, Queens, NY, already have a prior history of infectious disease burden, tuberculosis (TB) due to overcrowding. 8 Overcrowding can occur due to multigenerational families living in the same household or the inability to afford rent whereby more than one family share a confined space.

Access was defined as not having health insurance which averaged over 50% greater in severely high-affected COVID-19 communities. Lack of health insurance may explain the overrepresentation of avoidable hospitalization in severely affected communities as it is a barrier to primary healthcare. High percentages of lower education (less than a high school degree) and poverty were also observed in severely affected communities reiterating that high rates of infectious diseases occur in poor and vulnerable communities as indicated in previous studies. 6, 13, 14 The interconnectedness of communities with limited access to healthcare, poverty and low education is likely to have a ripple effect on manageable chronic diseases like diabetes, obesity and hypertension. For instance, the Gaskin et al. 5 study demonstrated that persons living in densely impoverished communities increased their odds of developing diabetes. According to our analysis, rate percentages of these chronic conditions were greater in communities severely affected by COVID-19 than other communities, suggesting that they may be more susceptible to the disease.
