Isolation policy in hospitals is one of the most crucial protocols to prevent nosocomial infection of COVID-19. It is important to monitor and assess the physical conditions of the patients in isolation. Methods Our institution has installed the novel non-contact wireless sensor for vital sign sensing and body movement monitoring for patients in COVID-19 isolation ward. Results We have collected and compared data between the radar record with the nurse's handover record of two patients, one recorded for 13 days and the other recorded for 5 days. The P value by Fisher's exact test were 0.139 (temperature, P > 0.05) and 0.292 (heart beat rate, P > 0.05) respectively. Conclusions This is the first report about the application experience of this equipment. Therefore we attempted to share the experience and try to apply this equipment in COVID-19 patients in future to offer the more reliable and safe policy.",

The majority of these contactless devices are infrared thermography with a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) digital camera. The applications of these sensors are monitoring of neonates in neonatal intensive care units, monitoring of heart rate during regional anesthesia, during dialysis and in the post-anesthesia care units. [9] Since the RGB camera records the facial features of the patient, there may be violations of privacy. Due to the same issue, the device can't be installed in the toilet or shower room. On the other hand, the selfinjection-locked radar uses the wideband oscillators and extracts accurate vital signs from the received Doppler-shifted signal. There is no high-resolution image captured, and the privacy issue is minimized. (Fig. 1) .",

The P value by Fisher's exact test are temperature, P > 0.05 and heart rate, P > 0.05 respectively. There is no statistics difference between these two sets of data. For patients in the isolation ward, the healthcare staff has to care them under PPE. However, in the report of Wang et al., the virus nucleic acid can be tested in multiple surface areas in the patient's room. [10] Therefore, utilizing the contactless radar technology allows the healthcare staff to check the heart rate and temperature of the patient from the nursing station (a clean zone) anytime. The nursing staffs no longer need to rush into the rooms to check the patients' vital signs if patients fall asleep. The continuously heart rate data can help medical staffs to rule out bradycardia situation of the patient. This can decrease the infection and transmission risk for the healthcare staff.",

This function can save time for the healthcare staff since there is no need to physically check on patients frequently. Another benefit is the reduced waste of PPE. The wireless feature will also provide another advantage for long period of isolation; the patient won't be \"cabled\" with the EKG wires.
