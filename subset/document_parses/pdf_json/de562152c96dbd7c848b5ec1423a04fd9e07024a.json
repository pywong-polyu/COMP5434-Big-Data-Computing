COVID-19 has affected access to food across most, if not all, the dimensions of food security, and the literature on why and to what extent this was the case has grown rapidly. For example, ref. [6] highlights the impact of COVID-19 on falling incomes, poverty, and the ability of households to purchase food; agricultural production, supply chain disruption, and trade restrictions; and increased deficiencies in key micro-nutrients. Others similarly focus on disruptions to agricultural sectors and particularly supply chains, resulting in increased food prices and/or food shortages in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [7] [8] [9] .",

[14] , using pre-pandemic data collected using a face-to-face survey and follow-up phone survey data collected during the pandemic, found that households' experiences of food insecurity have increased by between 6 and 15 percent. Though the authors highlighted the likely importance of social safety nets, their role in reducing food insecurity is not addressed explicitly. A study of households in Kenya and Uganda found that food security had worsened due to the pandemic, with households changing their dietary patterns in response to a loss of income. Both governments responded in various ways, with the Ugandan government providing a food safety net for vulnerable workers [15] .",

To fill this gap, in this paper, we use unique micro-surveys from nine African LMICs to take a first look at the food insecurity situation in the context of the pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, importantly, this paper provides the first cross-sectional analysis of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple African countries. We focus particularly on the socioeconomic dimensions of food insecurity, presenting a snapshot of food insecurity differentially experienced by households during a specific global pandemic. We highlight the role that safety nets, both food and cash, play in food security, and, as such, our findings can help to guide governments as to where best to target efforts to reduce food insecurity that households are experiencing.",

            "text": "Since the beginning of the pandemic, a number of lower-income countries, many in Africa, have conducted High Frequency Phone Surveys (HFPS) of households linked to ongoing panel micro studies. Most of these surveys have been conducted by the national statistical institutes in collaboration with the World Bank. However, individual countries have also added COVID-19 modules to their existing household surveys (for example, South Africa). The main aim of these surveys is to track and monitor the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic with a focus on employment, income (wages and business revenue), health, education, food security, and coping strategies, including safety nets. Given the social distancing measures implemented by governments across the world, face-to-face surveys that would generally be used to conduct population-based surveys have had to be suspended. Phone surveys do not require in-person interviews; they can be used to obtain similar information at a relatively low cost; and they offer flexibility in terms of sampling and questionnaire design. However, phone surveys have some limitations that may induce bias in the information obtained, including: (i) study attrition or non-response of respondents from the original/base survey, especially if there is a significant gap between the last in-person survey and the phone survey; (ii) selection bias induced by mobile phone ownership; (iii) differential mobile phone coverage within countries and demographic groups; (iv) that it may not be possible to verify accuracy of answers commonly used in face-to-face interviews, such as vaccine cards or utility bills; and (v) some topics such as mental health and sexual behaviour may be difficult to cover in a phone survey. Despite the concerns regarding phone coverage, the share of households with contact information for at least one household member or a reference person in the sample of countries ranges from 79.2 to 99.2%. Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that attrition is significant because adequate measures to replicate the sampling characteristics of the previous populationsurvey have been taken. Sample sizes vary across the nine countries. As examples, 39% of the respondents from the Nigeria GHS-panel in 2018-2019 survey were interviewed for the COVID-19 round; a sub-sample of 48% from the 2018-2019 Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS); and 54.4% from the Malawi Integrated Household Panel Survey (IHPS), conducted in 2019.",

We control for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as education, gender, and age of household head, log of pre-lockdown household income, and poverty status of households in the case of Chad, Djibouti, and Mali (as income data are not available for these countries). There is evidence in the literature that female-headed households tend to be at higher risk of food insecurity compared with the male-headed ones, due to the fact that women often have poorer access and control of resources [17] [18] [19] [20] , and so we anticipate the same for our data. Given evidence in the literature of a positive impact of education on income [21] [22] [23] and health [24, 25] , we expect households with higher educated heads to have lower chances of suffering from food insecurity. A household's ability to afford food is likely to be a strong determinant of food security. We therefore control for pre-pandemic income and expect that relatively higher income households will have a lower probability of food insecurity, while households that are considered poor are likely be at a higher risk of food insecurity. Because affordability of food is likely to be a strong determinant of food security, we include an additional dummy variable indicating whether the prices of major food items increased during the pandemic.",

There is considerable literature on the choice of appropriate safety nets, with heterogeneous evidence on their impacts [26, 27] . We also control for two important coping strategies that households have adopted during the pandemic: reliance on savings; and borrowing from friends, family, and non-government organisations.

Here, we first document how governments in these countries have responded to the pandemic, in particular, exploring the extent to which populations in these countries have been subjected to restrictions, and the consequent disruptions on economies, on jobs, and on livelihoods. We identify the efforts governments have taken to ameliorate the worst impacts of these restrictions. We then present individual country dimensions of food insecurity for selected countries for which data are available.

We report the stringency of the containment measures in Figure 1 . The data suggest that the stringency of the government responses reached their peaks during March and April, with only Djibouti and Mali relaxing the restrictions relatively early at the end of July. In August 2020, most of the sample countries continued to impose considerable restrictions. While the severity of government restriction could affect food insecurity, sub-national level data on these restrictions are not available, and, as a result, government restrictions could not be included in our econometric analysis. Given these restrictions, it is perhaps not surprising that across the nine countries, access to food has been disrupted, whether due to loss of income, disrupted food markets, or increased food prices. In Chad, for example, the lockdown imposed by the government to stem the spread of the virus disrupted food markets, causing the price of millet, a key staple, to rapidly increase [30] . Chad already had one of the highest levels of hunger in the world, with two-thirds of the population living in severe poverty before the pandemic [31] . Two-thirds of the survey respondents in Chad reported a loss in total income due to the economic slowdown as a result of the pandemic, largely driven by loss of family enterprise revenue (63% of family enterprises reported a decline in revenue); 20% of the respondents lost their jobs due to pandemic and the associated lockdown. The World Bank estimates that Chad's GDP will grow by 0.8% in 2020, much lower than the 2019 growth rate of 3.2% [1].",

In response to reduced food security due to the pandemic, primarily caused by higher prices of staples and lower incomes due to job losses, governments and international organisations have already distributed, or committed to distributing, additional cash and food benefits. For example, in Chad, the World Bank funded the distribution of 437,000 food kits to the most vulnerable, and seeds and equipment to smallholder farmers [35] . Unconditional cash transfers have been included in the FAO's COVID-19 business continuity plan [30] . At the time of writing, two waves of the World Bank survey had been undertaken for Djibouti (July and September/October 2020). The second wave revealed that 27% of respondents received government food stamps, 11% food assistance, and 4% cash transfers (this compares with 27%, 14%, and 5% in the first wave); 28% of households had cut the size of their meals, and 14% had skipped meals, though just 4% went a whole day without food [36] . In Ethiopia, just 8% of respondents had received government assistance, primarily free food (47%) or a direct cash transfer (39%) [37] .

The data ( Figure 3) show that the incidence of food insecurity is higher among households with a female head compared with those with a male head. As expected, households that are considered poor/have suffered a decline in income during the pandemic and those in the first and second quartiles for total income are also more likely to suffer from food insecurity. Finally, we map the responses for each of the food insecurity indicators aggregated at the sub-national level. These maps (Figures 4-11) show a wide heterogeneity both within and across countries. It is evident that food insecurity within these countries is spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that these challenges will require policies tailored to the specific situations in different parts of the each country. Increases in the prices of major food items and the different levels of increases within countries are reported to be the main reasons behind the heterogeneous sub-national level food insecurity. Supply chain disruptions leading to reduced access to staple food also resulted in differences in sub-national food insecurity. Import-dependent countries such as Djibouti also suffered from international supply chain disruptions, which led to knock-on effects in the domestic markets [38, 39] . ",

The results of our regressions are presented in Figure 12 (only statistically significant coefficients are shown) below (Detailed regression results are presented in the Appendix A; Tables A1-A4). Across all the specifications, female-headed households have a higher probability of suffering from food insecurity compared with male-led households, and this effect is particularly high in Malawi. While there are a few exceptions, the gender disparity is consistent across the four indicators of food insecurity that we study in this paper. Perhaps not surprisingly, we find that the chance of food insecurity is lower among households with relatively higher educated heads. However, this is still a critical finding because it suggests that education continues to play an important role even during a pandemic. What is particularly interesting, however, is that the strength of this difference varies considerably across countries, with the impact of education being most pronounced in Uganda.",

Again, though this might be expected, the impact varies across countries, with the differential impact being strongest in Ethiopia and Uganda with respect to reducing food insecurity. For Djibouti and Mali, which provide data on poverty status of households instead, the regression estimates show that poorer households have a higher probability of suffering from food insecurity, with the probability of food insecurity due to poverty status of a household being higher in Chad. Given the magnitude of the pandemic shock and the slow initial roll-out of safety nets from governments, it is perhaps not surprising that neither of the safety net policies (cash and food) appear to be consistently effective in reducing the probability of food insecurity across the four dimensions. However, the data do suggest that, at least in Nigeria and Djibouti, safety nets in the form of cash transfers have helped to reduce the probability of households skipping a meal and going hungry in Djibouti, and going without food for a whole day and running out of food in Nigeria. By contrast, food safety nets do appear to have reduced the probability of going without food for a whole day in just one country, Chad. Interestingly, in these three countries, the roll-out of assistance appears to have been relatively rapid, in as much as, by the time of the surveys, at least 20% of households in each of these three countries had been the recipient of at least one government safety net.",

This aligns with much of the literature that addresses food insecurity more broadly. For example, even without economic crises and government-imposed restrictions, studies across lower-income countries have found examples of female-headed households generally experiencing higher levels of food insecurity [40] . In Nigeria, this has been attributed to female-headed households having fewer resources [17] . In Brazil, the 2009 National Household Survey revealed that female-headed households were 32% more likely to experience moderate food insecurity and 16% more likely to experience severe food insecurity compared with male-headed households [18] . In South Africa, rural male-headed households have been found to experience less food insecurity, due to their having more off-farm labour participation opportunities [19] . Perhaps particularly relevant for our study, ref. [20] found that during the 2007-2008 food price crisis, female-headed households experienced greater increases in food insecurity than male-headed households.",

Ref. [41] also found female-headed households to be more vulnerable than male-headed ones in Malawi, and attributed this difference to women having poorer access to and control of resources. However, many of the studies that purport to compare female-and male-headed households are actually comparing female-headed single-parent households with a group most likely dominated by households comprising married couples with children [40] . Recognising this, ref. [42] compared three types of households in Malawi, those with both female and male adults, and those with either female or either male adults. They found that food insecurity is highest in both female-only and male-only households compared with what they term dual-headed households. Ref. [43] similarly found that, more broadly, married couples are less likely than single people to experience food insecurity. A number of papers have found no statistical differences between the food insecurity status of female-and male-headed households. For example, in Bangladesh, little difference was found for indigenous households, one rationale being that women from these groups have more freedom to participate in the labour force [44] . Similar findings have been reported in three sites in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda [45] .",

That poverty has been found to be closely linked to food insecurity, both in our analysis and in earlier literature, is perhaps not surprising. However, what is particularly interesting in our results is that the link between income and food insecurity appears to differ considerably among countries, with the effects in Chad, Ethiopia, and Uganda being particularly large. We have econometric evidence that households that were able to rely on their savings during the pandemic had a lower probability of suffering from food insecurity. This is supported by the fact that poorer households have suffered an income loss during the pandemic, and those in the lower-income quartiles are also more likely to suffer from food insecurity.",

We focused particularly on how poverty, education, and household composition differentially affect households' experiences. Our analysis can help inform governments as to where their efforts need to be focused to reduce food insecurity.

            "text": "Etudes Economiques et D\u00e9mographiques (INSEED) carried out the Chad COVID-19 impact monitoring survey. The survey's sample consists of 1748 households and was drawn from the Enqu\u00eate sur la Consommation des M\u00e9nages et le Secteur Informel au Tchad (Ecosit 4), conducted in 2018-2019. Djibouti: The National Institute of Statistics of Djibouti, with support from the World Bank, launched the COVID-19 National Panel Phone Survey in July 2020 to study the impacts of the pandemic. The survey consists of 1486 households drawn randomly from the social registry data restricted to urban households. Ethiopia: To monitor the impacts of the pandemic on households, a sub-sample of 3249 households was drawn from the sample of households interviewed in the 2018-2019 round of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) in collaboration with the World Bank. Kenya: This survey is being conducted by the World Bank in collaboration with the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and the University of California Berkeley. The first sample is a randomly drawn subset of all households that were part of the 2015-2016 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) pilot. It includes information on household background, service access, employment, food security, income loss, transfers, health, and COVID-19 knowledge for 4457 households. Malawi: A High-Frequency Phone Survey COVID-19 (HFPS COVID-19) was carried out by the National Statistical Office (NSO) in collaboration with the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). A total of 1729 households drawn from the Integrated Household Panel Survey (IHPS 2019) were interviewed with a 95% response rate for the first round. The aim of the survey was to assess the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic with a focus on behaviour and social distancing, access to basic services, employment and income, food, security, social safety nets, and agriculture. Mali: The COVID-19 Panel Phone Survey of Households 2020 was implemented by the National Statistical Office (INSTAT) in collaboration with the World Bank in May 2020. The survey consists of 1809 households and provides information on behaviour and social distancing, access to basic services, employment and income, prices and food security, income loss, and social safety nets. Nigeria: The Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (COVID-19 NLPS) was implemented by the National Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with the World Bank. The survey was conducted on a nationally representative sample of 1950 households between 20 April and 11 May 2020 drawn from wave 4 of the General Household Survey-Panel (GHS-Panel) in Nigeria. South Africa: These data come from the the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM). The aim of this survey is to investigate the socioeconomic impacts of the national lockdown in South Africa in March 2020, and the social and economic consequences of the global coronavirus pandemic. NIDS-CRAM is based on a sub-sample of adults from households in the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) Wave 5 (2017) and provides data on 7074 completed interviews. Uganda: The High-Frequency Phone Survey was launched in June 2020 by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) with support from the World Bank. The survey tracks the impacts of the pandemic. A total of 2259 households were interviewed from the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) 2019-2020.",
