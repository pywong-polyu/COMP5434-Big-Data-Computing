            "text": "Background Analyzing the molecular mechanism of drugs and diseases is a central task in drug discovery. For drugs, this task involves identifying the molecular targets whose interaction with the compound is associated with its pharmacological activity. The knowledge of the molecular mechanism of action (MOA) of a drug is important in ascertaining not only the therapeutic efficacy of this drug, but also any potential toxicity and side effects. On the other hand, insights into the molecular mechanism of a disease may lead to a better understanding of its pathogenesis and possible to new and better treatment formulations. In this regard, gene transcriptional profiling has emerged as a viable highthroughput platform for drug discovery and drug target identification [1, 2] and for studying disease mechanism [3] . However, determining the direct molecular targets through which a drug or a disease exert its effects using gene transcriptional profiles remains a major bioinformatics challenge. Changes in the gene expression caused by a drug or a disease may arise directly from the action of the drug or disease, or indirectly as downstream or secondary effects. Delineating direct and indirect gene targets from gene transcriptional profiles is further complicated by the fact that gene expression is a highly regulated process that involves a complex and context-specific gene regulatory network (GRN).",

            "text": "Many strategies have been proposed for inferring gene targets from gene transcriptional data [4] . In general, these strategies fall in two main categories: comparative analysis and network analysis methods. The former involves comparing the transcriptional profiles of interest with a library of reference profiles with known targets [1, 2, 5, 6] , under the assumption that a likeness in the transcriptional profiles is indicative of similarity in the molecular targets. The latter class of methods uses a model of GRN to account for gene transcriptional regulations when analyzing gene expression data. A number of network analysis methods, notably causal analysis [7, 8] and DeMAND [9] , employs graph models of the GRNs with nodes representing the genes and edges representing gene-gene interactions. Here, gene target identification is typically formulated as a statistical hypothesis test using the gene transcriptional profiles. Another group of network analysis methods, including network identification by multiple regression (NIR) [10] , mode of action by network identification (MNI) [11] , sparse simultaneous equation model (SSEM) [12] , and DeltaNet [13] , relies on a mechanistic model of the gene transcriptional regulatory network. By invoking a pseudo-steady-state assumption, the inference of gene targets from gene expression data is recasted as a regression problem. Generally speaking, a gene is scored highly as a potential target when its expression deviates significantly from what the GRN model predicts based on the expression of its transcription factors (TFs).",

As we have demonstrated earlier [14] , DeltaNet performed poorly when using time-series transcriptional data due to the invalidity of the underlying steady-state assumption. Such an issue likely applies to similar algorithms employing pseudo steady-state assumption, such as NIR, MNI and SSEM. There is a clear need to accommodate time-series expression data, as they constitute an important class of gene expression datasets. A notable example is the Connectivity Map (CMap), which includes over 1.5 million time-series gene expression profiles from 9 different cell types across roughly 5000 small-molecule compounds and 3000 genetic reagents.",

But, as we and many others have shown [15, 16] , such GRN reconstructions constitute an undetermined problem and thus the reconstructed GRN often has high uncertainty. In parallel, we have seen a tremendous progress over the past decade in the mapping of transcriptional regulatory elements [17] , the measurements of promoter/enhancer activity [18] , and the identification of TF binding motifs and binding sites [19] . Such information has enabled the reconstruction of GRN graphs for ~ 300 cell types in human [20] .

Notably, the application of DeltaNeTS+ to gene expression datasets from human lung Calu-3 cells infected by influenza strains H5N1 (avian flu) and H1N1 (swine flu) reveals key differences in the cellular responses to the two strains.",

We also compared the accuracy of the gene target predictions under two different scenarios; the first is where the gene perturbations are time invariant, and the other is where the gene perturbations are allowed to vary over time. Because of the small number of samples in the above datasets, when the GRN structure is not used, the application of DeltaNeTS+ using LASSO (see Methods) and a previous algorithm DeltaNet resulted in an empty target prediction, where the perturbation scores P were 0. Table 1 shows the ranking of the genes targeted by shRNA or mutation in C. elegans and human T-cell data with the gene perturbations set to be time-invariant, i.e. the gene perturbations are the same for all samples from the same treatment/condition.

IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are cytokines that induce innate immune response against viral infection through separate signalling pathways, called type I and type II signalling, respectively. The IFN-\u03b1 signal goes through type I IFN receptor and is followed by the formation of the complex IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2 that activates the transcription of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulated genes (ISG). Meanwhile, the IFN-\u03b3 signal is received by type II IFN receptor which leads to the transcription of genes containing gamma interferon activation sites (GAS) [40, 41] .

            "text": "Finally, we applied DeltaNeTS+ to analyze gene expression data from H1N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infected Calu-3 cells with the goal of elucidating the similarities and differences between the two important influenza viral strains. H1N1 strain is the cause of the 2009 swine flu outbreak and is known for its high transmissibility among humans. On the other hand, H5N1 strain is an avian influenza subtype that is known for its severe virulence with a high mortality rate of 60%. This high pathogenicity results in growing attention to understand the causal molecular mechanism [43] . Following DeltaNeTS+ analysis, we performed a GSEA to find over-represented Reactome pathways [37] and [38] analysis to identify gene modules with similar dynamic perturbations, using the gene perturbation scores produced by DeltaNeTS+. Figure 2 depicts the Reactome pathways enriched (adjusted p value < 0.01, see Methods) across the three phases of the infection: early (phase 1: 0-7 h), middle (phase 2: 7-18 h) and late (phase 3: > 18 h) (full results in Additional file 4). H1N1 and H5N1 trigger many of the same cellular pathways but often in different phases. Expectedly, immune response, such as cytokine signaling and innate immune system, is triggered by both viral infections with roughly the same trend over time. Other pathways however are modulated with different timings. Among the pathways significantly enriched only in H5N1 infection are those associated with G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and actin cytoskeleton (muscle contraction), both of which are known to be hijacked for viral entry processes (Fig. 2) [18, 44, 45] . On the other hand, programmed cell death and DNA damage (chromatin organization and DNA repair) are significantly enriched only in H1N1 data from the early through midphase of the infection. A previous study reported that death signaling molecules are downregulated in Calu-3 cells infected by H5N1 [46] , a finding that is consistent with the absence of enrichment for programmed cell death in the result of DeltaNeTS+ [47, 48] . These pathways are related to Histone cluster 1 families, and based on DeltaNeTS+ perturbation scores, are predicted to have been negatively perturbed (see Additional file 5). The negative perturbations signify a repression of cellular proliferation in H1N1 infection. In addition to enrichment analysis, we applied WGCNA to the DeltaNeTS+ gene perturbation predictions to group the genes based on the pattern of perturbations over time. In this case, WGCNA finds clusters of genes whose perturbation scores given by the P matrix are highly similar based on a topological overlap derived from the gene-gene correlations. In the WGCNA results, the time-course perturbation values in each group can be represented by the first principal component in that group, called eigengene. Figure 3 shows the eigengene perturbation profiles of seven groups identified by WGCNA, and Table 3 provides the summary of GO and Reactome pathways enriched in each group (see details in Additional files 6 and 7). For the smallest group M7, no pathway was found to be significantly enriched.",

DeltaNeTS+ builds on our previous algorithm DeltaNeTS which is able to utilize time-series datasets of gene expression, and adds the capability to take advantage of information on the GRN structure. The incorporation of GRN structure information enables accurate gene target predictions from a small number of samples, an advantage over our previous methods DeltaNet and DeltaNeTS. The direct gene perturbation of a gene is computed based on the difference between the measured differential expression of the gene and the differential expression predicted by the GRN model based on the expression of its transcription factors. We compared DeltaNeTS+ to three strategies, including (1) differential expression analysis, (2) a target inference method TSNI which relies on a model of the GRN [21] , and (3) a network perturbation analysis method DeMAND which relies on statistical hypothesis testing via Kullback-Leibler divergence [9] . The comparative methods were selected since they are among the most commonly used and well-cited methods for gene target inference and are able to handle time-series data. DeltaNeTS+ is most similar to TSNI [21] , as both methods rely on a linear regression formulation and time-series data. While TSNI uses principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of the unknown GRN matrix A and perturbation matrix P, DeltaNeTS+ employs a regularization strategy (ridge regression or LASSO, depending on the availability of the GRN structure). TSNI is unable to accommodate information on GRN structure. Adding GRN structural information to DeltaNeTS+ is highly beneficial and improves the gene target predictions, especially when the dataset contains only a few samples. The application of DeltaNeTS+ and a previous algorithm DeltaNet to C. elegans, T cell, and Calu-3 datasets without incorporating the GRN structure returned a null gene target prediction (P is 0; data not shown). Here, by using the available GRN structure, DeltaNeTS+ is implemented using ridge regression in which the dimensionality of the unknown GRN matrix A is reduced to known TF-gene regulations. As shown in C. elegans and human T-cell case study, DeltaNeTS+ was able to use the GRN structure to predict genetic perturbations with high accuracy more reliably than the comparative methods. Besides, gene targets highly ranked by DeltaNeTS+ were closely associated with the true gene targets -for example, genes that are directly regulated by the true gene targets (see Additional file 1). The ability to utilize GRN structure information is important high-quality cell type specific gene regulatory networks become more available in recent times, thanks to the success of large-scale projects such as ENCODE [17] and FANTOM5 [49] . Besides, advanced network inference tools such as ARACNE [50] and MINDy [51] allow us to reverse-engineer a context-specific network from the gene expression data for a cell of our interest.",

Vice versa, the gene target predictions for the C. elegans steady-state dataset were better upon using the GRN model from the combination of time-series and steady-state data than using that from steadystate data alone (see Additional file 2: Figure S1 ). While incorporating the GRN structure information enables DeltaNeTS+ to predict gene targets using a small set of samples, the result above demonstrates that a larger number of samples improves accuracy. The capability of DeltaNeTS+ to integrate both time-series and steady-state data seamlessly in the gene target prediction means that DeltaNeTS+ will be able to take advantage of a larger library of available transcriptomic datasets and avoid running separate analyses for each kind of datasets.",

Notably, H5N1 infection shows a strong induction of viral entry process and viral replication and a repression of cell cycle arrest, all of which are strategies that would ensure a successful proliferation of the virus. The pathogenic H5N1 infection also demonstrates inhibition of viral defense mechanism. Furthermore, the less severity of H1N1 infection is also associated with a successful activation of cell death and repression of cell proliferation, pathways that are crucial in curtailing viral progression.",

The size and color of dots indicate the score (negative logarithm-10 of p values) for the enriched Reactome terms. The influenza infection period is divided into three time phases: Phase1 = 0-7 h, phase 2 = 7-18 h, and phase 3 \u2265 18 h post-infection strains, the infection acts to repress cell cycle arrest and cellular matrix barrier (negative perturbations) and to activate viral entry pathways (positive perturbations). For groups M2 and M3, the signs of the perturbations for the two influenza A strains are the opposite of each other. In H5N1 infection, viral RNA transcription, translation and replication (group M2) are induced, whereas viral defense and immune mechanisms (group M3) are strongly inhibited. In contrast, in H1N1 infection, viral RNA replication processes are repressed, but genes for antiviral mechanisms are moderately induced. Taken together, GSEA and WGCNA of DeltaNeTS+ for H1N1 and H5N1 infection in Calu3 indicates that in comparison to H1N1, the more virulent H5N1 infection shows increased activity",
