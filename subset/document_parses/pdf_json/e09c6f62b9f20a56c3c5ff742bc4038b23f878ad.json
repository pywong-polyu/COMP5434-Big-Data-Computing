For signal reception, a mouse brain surface coil was used actively decoupled from a 72 mm inner diameter volume resonator. Animals were anaesthetized using an average 2.5% isoflurane in O2, and both animal respiration and temperature were constantly monitored with a preclinical monitoring and gating system (SA Instruments, New York, USA). Highresolution T2-weighted images (T2w) were acquired for anatomical references using rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement sequence with double echoes. The acquisition parameters were the following: orientation = axial plane, echo train length or rare factor = 8, field of view (FOV) = 1.92 \u00d7 1.92 cm 2 , matrix size (MTX) = 256 \u00d7 256 (75 \u00d7 75 \u00b5m/pixel), number of slices = 11, slice thickness = 1 mm, interslice distance = 1 mm, repetition time (TR)/ effective echo time (TEeff) = 5000/36 ms, number of averages = 1, and total acquisition time (TAT) = 2 min. Perfusion-weighted imaging was obtained using the MRI arterial spin labelling (MRI-ASL) technique without contrast. Two consecutive axial slices were placed in two different sections (Bregma \u22121.5 mm, \u22122.5 mm) according to the mouse brain atlas by Paxinos and Franklin [33] using a T2w sagital plane image as anatomic reference. The vendor provided ASL protocol using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion-recovery rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (FAIR-RARE) sequence. The parameters were the following: echo train length = 72, TR/TEeff = 16,000/ 50 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, thickness of the selective inversion slice = 4 mm, FOV = 1.92 \u00d7 1.92 cm 2 (150 \u00d7 150 \u00b5m/ pixel), MTX = 128 \u00d7 128, inversion recovery time (TIR) = 30 ms, increment of TIR = 100 ms, number of TIR = 22, and TAT = 13 min. The obtained ASL images were analyzed using the workstation software Paravision 5.1 (Bruker Espa\u00f1ola S.A., Madrid, Spain) to generate rCBF images. rCBF values were measured using a region of interest (ROI) created corresponding to cortex (Bregma \u22121.5 mm, \u22122.5 mm), striatum (Bregma \u22121.5 mm, \u22122.5 mm), caudate putamen (Bregma \u22121.5 mm), basolateral amygdala (\u22121.5 mm), and hippocampus (\u22122.5 mm) in both hemispheres ( Figure 5 ). Bilateral ROIs from the same mouse were analyzed together as a mean value and separately to evaluated left-right rCBF asymmetries between hemispheres. For correlations, asymmetry index (AI) defined as (right-left)/(right + left) * 100 was used.",

Log-rank analyses show an overall difference in survival curves over the four groups (\u03c72(3) = 10.634, p = 0.014).

No statistically significant differences in rCBF were observed ( Figure 6A ). However, 3xTg-AD female mice survivors had increased rCBF in the cortex and hippocampus compared with their NTg counterparts (Student t-test p < 0.05). In particular, genotype per sex interaction effects were observed in cortical rCBF (GxS, F(1,27) = 4.545, p = 0.044). For each group, the asymmetries in the rCBF of the left and right hemispheres are illustrated in Figure 6 B. In the cortex, rCBF asymmetries were found in females. The asymmetry between left-right hemispheres was also observed in the hippocampus of NTg males and 3xTg females and the striatum of NTg females (paired t-test, p < 0.05).

Worse physiologically relevant MRA structural and functional alterations of 3xTg-AD females suggested sex-dependent dysfunctions. We hypothesize that those findings would also extend to other cardiovascular health measures. Since the aging process is very heterogeneous [7] , here, we studied two cohorts where females exhibited worse mortality rates than males since birth. We were interested in exploring brain-cardiovascular interaction mechanisms relevant for long-lived animals. Eight functional aspects were successively studied from middle age to natural death or euthanasia at 16 months. First, we determined the physical (including frailty) and behavioral (neuropsychiatric-like and cognitive) phenotypes of animals. Once the \"mental health\" of each animal was characterized, we determined their \"cardiovascular phenotype\" through systolic blood pressure, rCBF, angiogenesis, and arterial function. Survival was continuously monitored. Glucocorticoid levels, an indicator of HPA axis function, were analyzed from blood samples collected during the euthanasia. In the results, the analysis includes the sample size at each time point; so that the results of a certain functional analysis are those taking into account the highest sample available. The results agreed with those from the analysis performed only using the final sample size of survivors (censored data).",

At the translational level, we have consistently reported increased vulnerability of 3xTg-AD mice concurrent with impairment of the neuro-immuno-endocrine system and in agreement with this sex-dependent profile [11, 12, 38] . However, we found cohorts that offered a distinct survival scenario, with pairwise comparisons in the survival curves confirming an effect of sex factor with worse survival of females, independently of the genotype. 3xTg-AD mice females had a shorter lifespan than males, and sex differences were less pronounced in NTg mice. The retrospective analysis of survival indicated that both groups of females exhibited an early mortality window, starting as soon as 2-3 months of age. While the male sex has worse cardiovascular mortality rates than females, the burden of cardiovascular disease in the female sex is widely reported [39] . Less is known in this regard in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the present cohorts offer an interesting experimental setting to study the morbidity/mortality paradox in surviving females. In this scenario, we were interested in studying the relationship between frailty, mental health, and cardiovascular phenotype.",

The frailty index, a common tool to measure health status that seems to be sensitive to predict mortality [5] , is a valuable tool in longevity and aging studies in mice [31] . In the general population, women usually present higher frailty scores and a reduced risk of mortality than men [42] . In contrast, higher frailty scores are recorded in men with AD [43] . In agreement, the Mouse Clinical Frailty Index, a translational adaptation of the frailty index data in humans [31] , was increased in male 3xTg-AD mice compared to NTg counterparts, while females exhibited similar frailty scores. A worse sensorimotor function was also previously reported [8, 10, 12] . Using the same frailty index, other researchers also noticed that 3xTg-AD males show higher scores, with sex differences in health span predicting lifespan in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD [44] .",

These data agree with our first report in 15-month NTg and 3xTg-AD [12] . In all groups, the corticosterone levels were higher than those reported at 15 months, which could be due to the animals' increased stress response to the experimental design, especially observed in females [47] .

Motor features can be discarded (the frail animals were males), but the swimming performance can reflect their emotional status in an aquatic environment known to be anxiogenic for mice [54] . To control this factor, the distance covered was used instead of the latency. Two learning and memory tasks differing on the level of complexity and involving short (15 min) and long-term (24 h) memory were used. The day-by-day and trial-by-trial analysis showed a notorious aged profile compared to previous reports in young [10, 11, 28, 37, 49, 51, 55] or old animals [8, 38, 48, 56] . Worse performance of female NTg mice was observed on the visual perceptual learning task. Long-term spatial reference learning and memory deficits were shown by all the groups in their first day of place learning task where the hidden platform, located in a reversed location, had to be found. Finally, the two-day place task indicated paradoxical better performances in male 3xTg-AD mice, which could be explained by the strong need that a frail animal may have to find and remember a safe place.",

In one of our recent collaborative studies in 3xTg-AD mice, we have reported that the number of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex at advanced stages of the disease was higher in females than in males [58] . Interestingly, co-localization of hypoxic areas and A\u03b2 plaques in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were observed only in females. In the present study, the increased CBF in the cortex and hippocampus in female survivors suggests a potential compensatory hemodynamic mechanism in end-of-life dementia, which is sex-and brain-region-dependent. This is interesting to note, since recent work in APP/PS1 transgenic mice at the early stages of AD has shown longitudinal changes in regional CBF, indicating age-and brain-regiondependent alterations of cerebral blood flow [59] . At the clinical level, an increased CBF has also been observed in patients at preclinical stages of AD when cognitive performance is still preserved, suggesting a compensatory response to the accumulation of A\u03b2 pathology [60] . Moreover, the reduction in CBF seems to be an important factor contributing to the cognitive dysfunction associated with dementia. One study performed with APP/PS1 mice in the late stages of the disease reported that a treatment that consists of the increase in the cerebral blood flow improves cognition [61] .",

            "text": "Brain structural and functional asymmetry in health/disease is an emerging field. The neurodegeneration of subcortical structures is not symmetric, with neuroimaging studies reporting volumetric regional, hemispheric asymmetries. Thus, asymmetric hippocampal atrophy has been recently reported in normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and AD [62] . A whole-brain analysis revealed increased neuroanatomical asymmetries in dementia for the hippocampus and amygdala and is proposed as a powerful imaging biomarker [63] . At the translational level, hippocampal asymmetry was important in rodents for acquiring spatial reference memory, retaining working memory [64] , and some features of non-spatial learning [65] . At the neurochemical and molecular levels, left-right hippocampal asymmetry has been demonstrated for the glutamatergic system [65] . We have just provided the first evidence of brain atrophy asymmetry in male 3xTg-AD mice, thus modeling that found in human patients with AD [50] . However, little is known about the alterations in CBF hemisphere asymmetries. In the present work, the MRI-ASL rCBF results unveiled, for the first time, the asymmetry between left-right hemispheres in the female's cortex, in the hippocampus of control males, and 3xTg-AD females, as well as in the striatum of control females. Therefore, the present results show asymmetry between left-right hemispheres in the 3xTg-AD model and aging mice, in both sexes (but mostly in females) and in cortical and subcortical structures. Moreover, to ensure that these detected asymmetries in rCBF measurements were not affected by differences in mice's head positioning (rotation respect to the sagittal plane) or differences in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between hemispheres, a SNR/CNR quality check analysis was performed that showed no statistically significant differences among the experimental groups (data not shown). This modeling will be useful for the translational development and assessment of the preventive/ therapeutic interventions and those of the risk factors and hazards and monitoring disease progression.",

On the other hand, the angiogenic growth capacity of the MCA and aorta was higher in 3xTg-AD compared to NTg females, and 3xTg-AD females showed greater aortic angiogenesis than 3xTg-AD males. In a precedent work, the anxiouslike behavioral profile correlated with vascular alterations in small mesenteric arteries from 15-month-old 3xTg-AD female mice [21] . Altogether, we suggest that the vascular profile is tightly linked to the overall health status, especially in female 3xTg-AD mice.",

These findings agree with previous studies that found increased angiogenesis in the hippocampus, midfrontal cortex, substantia nigra, pars compacta, and locus ceruleus of post mortem human AD brains [73] . It is worth noting that increased angiogenesis, which has been associated with the presence of A\u03b2 [24, [74] [75] [76] , could be linked to increased vascular permeability, especially under pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory environments, such as in AD [23, 24] . A non-invasive method was used to measure blood pressure due to the old age of mice. However, a high-fidelity blood pressure phenotyping method (e.g., radiotelemetry) would be necessary to confirm blood pressure data. Besides, we used the thoracic aorta (i.e., a large conductance artery) as a model for generic peripheral artery function. Therefore, the present study is limited by the lack of information on vascular function in peripheral resistance arteries, which might reflect better what happens at the level of cerebral vasculature.",

            "text": "Correlation analysis through all the components suggests functional interactions between NPS and cognitive impairment with amygdala and HPA axis. The vascular function correlated with activity, while the left and right hemispheres' asymmetry of rCBF with NPS and cognitive impairments. Increased activation of the amygdala in 3xTg-AD mice [55] could explain the specific correlation between amygdala CBF and body weight. Corticosterone level correlations agree with our first report on the increase in glucocorticoid levels concomitantly to increased anxiety and peripheral immune dysfunction [12] and recent work of other laboratories [77] . Systolic blood pressure correlated positively with the number of half-buried marbles and negatively correlated with latency to cross the T-intersection and TM test, which are indicators of a worse neuro-immunoendocrine function, accelerated aging, and premature death in mice [53] . These correlates agree with mice chronically subjected to high blood pressure being more active in the openfield and faster in a spontaneous alternation test [78] . Recently, we demonstrated the correlation between peripheral small vessel properties and anxiety in both NTg and 3xTg-AD mice, mostly in females [21] . Here, we show that the animals with lower endothelialindependent vasodilatations to sodium nitroprusside (i.e., lower muscle relaxation capacity) were the most active in the open-field test, in both non-goal-(horizontal activity) and goaldirected (rearing) behaviors [79, 80] . The correlation was consistent, as also observed in the repeated test. Regarding relative cerebral blood flow and neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairment, the cortex was the better area correlated with behavior. Cortex hemisphere asymmetry correlated with risk assessment (stretch attendance), neophobia in the corner test, and worse memory performance in the T-maze test. Correlation between asymmetry and neophobia was also observed in the hippocampus and amygdala. Since testing the pairwise correlations between dozens of variables without multiple comparison correction may involve a high risk of type-1 error, only those which are meaningful, obtained a maximum statistical significance (p < 0.001), and could be verified with closerelated variables were considered. Despite our aim to highlight and explore the sex-based differences, the statistical power of the sample size per sex did not allow to compare whether the correlations between these variables were different between male and female mice and thus modulated by the sex. Overall, this correlation analysis allows for finding meaningful functional correlations between behavioral responses related to the levels of anxiety, cognition and locomotor activity, and cardiovascular measurements. Especially, the present work provides pieces of evidence of the brain regions' asymmetry of both males and females with normal and AD-neurodegenerative aging correlation with neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits.",

Hippocampal's asymmetry index (AI), defined as (right-left)/(right + left) * 100 was negatively correlated with neophobia in the corner test (Figure 9M, p = 0.009), while amygdala's asymmetry index was positively correlated with neophobia in the second open-field test (Figure 9N, p = 0.005).The functional correlates of the behavioral signatures were also analyzed for the corresponding group and are presented as supplementary data (supplementary material).Briefly, the increased and persistent neophobia in female 3xTg-AD mice, confirmed also in the open-field test, was correlated with Phe %KCL-pEC50 (r > \u22120.983, p < 0.003), area under the curve (AUC) (r = \u22120.983, p = 0.001), PEC50 (r = -0.983, p = 0.007), and KCL (r > \u22120.965, p < 0.008). The hyperactive pattern of male 3xTg-AD mice in the open-field test was correlated with the striatum (Bregma -1.5 mm) asymmetry index (AI) (r = 0.790, p = 0.006), systolic blood pressure (r = \u22120.910, p = 0.002), PEC50 Acetylcholine (% Phe) (r = \u22120.842, p = 0.002), and amygdala (Bregma \u22121.5 mm) AI (r> 0.776, p < 0.009).

The slower speed of female 3xTg-AD mice in the water maze was correlated with the cerebral blood flow of whole brain (r = -0.878, p = 0.009), striatum (r = \u22120.893, +, p = 0.007), caudate putamen (r = -0.916, +, p = 0.004), and hippocampus (r = \u22120.906, p = 0.005).
