            "text": "Background: There is a dearth of evidence on what should be the optimal criteria for discharging children from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treatment. Programs discharging children while they are still presenting varying levels of weight-for-height (WHZ) or mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) deficits, such as those implemented under the current national protocol in Nepal, are opportunities to fill this evidence gap. Methods: We followed a cohort of children discharged as cured from SAM treatment in Parasi district, Nepal. Relapse as SAM, defined as the occurrence of WHZ<-3 or MUAC < 115 mm or nutritional edema, was investigated through repeated home visits, during six months after discharge. We assessed the contribution of remaining anthropometric deficits at discharge to relapse risk through Cox regressions. Results: Relapse as SAM during follow-up was observed in 33 % of the cohort (35/108). Being discharged before reaching the internationally recommended criteria was overall associated with a large increase in the risk of relapse (HR = 3.3; p = 0.006). Among all anthropometric indicators at discharge, WHZ<-2 led to a three-fold increase in relapse risk (HR = 3.2; p = 0.003), while MUAC < 125 mm significantly raised it only in the older children. WHZ<-2 at discharge came up as the only significant predictor of relapse in multivariate analysis (HR = 2.8, p = 0.01), even among children with a MUAC \u2265 125 mm. Of note, more than 80 % of the events of relapse as SAM would have been missed if WHZ had not been monitored and used in the definition of relapse. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the priority for SAM management programs should be to ensure that children reach a high level of WHZ at discharge, at least above or equal to the WHO recommended cut-off. The validity of using a single MUAC cut-off such as 125 mm as a suitable discharge criterion for all age groups is questioned. Further follow-up studies providing a complete assessment of nutritional status at discharge and not based on a restricted MUAC-only definition of relapse as SAM would be urgently needed to set evidence-based discharge criteria. These studies are also required to assess programs currently discounting or omitting WHZ for identification and management of SAM.",

Acknowledging the heterogeneity of case definitions, and the resulting variability in anthropometric deficits at admission, WHO further recommended to use the same anthropometric indicator to confirm SAM diagnosis and to assess nutritional recovery under treatment: for instance if MUAC is used to identify that a child has SAM, then MUAC should be used to assess and confirm recovery and decide end of treatment.",

WHO initially called for a stronger evaluation of the validity of MUAC and WHZ as discharge criteria, and the determination of optimal cut-off values [5] ; yet to our knowledge this issue has not been further investigated. Notwithstanding, the recent years have been marked by the controversial proposal that programs should stop assessing WHZ, whether for case detection, admission, monitoring or discharge [7] . Although the international normative guidance does not endorse the possibility that SAM treatment programs restrict admission to children with MUAC < 115 mm or nutritional edema [8] , this proposal has been increasingly promoted and applied [9, 10] . As opposed to its consequences on targeting and assessing eligibility to treatment, which have been described and discussed elsewhere [6, [11] [12] [13] , the impacts on discharge have not been analyzed. However, in programs abandoning the assessment of WHZ, MUAC \u2265 125 mm is used as the only restrictive criterion to consider children as cured, irrespective of the WHZ deficits that may be present upon admission. This practice is expected to discharge many children as cured with remaining WHZ deficits [14] and may affect treatment effectiveness to an unknown extent.",

According to this guidance, all internationally agreed-upon case definitions of SAM (low MUAC or low WHZ or nutritional edema) are eligible for treatment, yet discharge criteria are less stringent than WHO standards: they mainly consist in the observation of a MUAC > 115 mm after a minimum treatment duration of 6 weeks.

In agreement with the statement that relapse has been so far inconsistently defined across programs and research [17, 18] , we decided to use an inclusive and conservative definition of relapse: we defined relapse as SAM as the occurrence of an event of SAM, i.e. the deterioration of nutritional status from non-SAM to SAM, in children who were initially admitted to SAM treatment and then discharged free of SAM, i.e. WHZ\u2265-3 and MUAC \u2265 115 and no nutritional edema. In other words, a child discharged as cured was classified relapse as SAM at any time during the 6-months follow-up duration if s/he was presenting a WHZ<-3 or a MUAC < 115 mm or nutritional edema, while not displaying any of these characteristics at the preceding visit. This is an inclusive definition of relapse, as opposed to the idea of distinguishing relapse (in children discharged after reaching WHO-recommended discharge criteria) from regression (in children discharged before reaching WHO-recommended discharge criteria) recently promoted by experts [18] . We argue that all new occurrences of SAM should be counted into the same variable in order to assess the impact of not meeting the currently recommended discharge criteria and further demonstrate their relevance, as requested by the WHO [5] .

We are doing so in using an inclusive and conservative definition of relapse as SAM and in following an unselected cohort of children, discharged as cured from SAM treatment with a range of remaining anthropometric deficits. This study also adds to the scarce body of evidence on SAM management coming from South Asia. So far, the logical hypothesis of an association between lower anthropometric measurements at discharge and negative post-treatment outcomes such as relapse was only supported by a single retrospective study from Burkina Faso [25] . In this study, a significant effect of MUAC < 125 mm at discharge on relapse risk was reported in all children, yet the effect of WHZ was not assessed, MUAC < 125 mm was also the admission criteria, and the definition of relapse was WHZ<-2 or nutritional edema, thereby complicating the interpretation of the results. More recently, the authors of a prospective study in Nigeria reported a high rate of relapse (defined as MUAC < 115 mm or nutritional edema) among children discharged as cured with a MUAC \u2265 125 mm and concluded that this discharge criterion was not adequate to ensure full long-term recovery from SAM [26] . They called for more investigation to understand why the current criteria might be inappropriate in some cases and whether changes or additional criteria could be used to reduce relapse risk. Our results contribute to addressing these questions and to fill the large evidence gap surrounding current international and national recommendations for discharge: they indicate that raising the child's WHZ to a level at least above or equal to -2 should be the priority to decrease the risk of relapse after treatment, and that the practice of using MUAC \u2265 125 mm as a standalone anthropometric criterion for discharge should be revised.",

Indeed, analysis of the different types of SAM diagnosis in representative nutritional surveys in Nepal [6] as well as among children admitted to SAM treatment in our cohort shows that WHZ<-3 is the predominant case definition criterion among SAM children and only a minority of SAM children display a MUAC < 115 mm. Since WHZ<-3 is the dominant SAM diagnosis among these children, higher levels of WHZ at discharge may logically reflect a larger recovery during treatment and therefore more sustained protection against nutritional risk and relapse. We believe that a similar result would likely be obtained in all contexts where WHZ<-3 is the predominant anthropometric deficit among SAM cases, which is a prevailing situation in most countries across the world [6, 11] . This is particularly true in the high burden countries of the south-east Asia region, in the Sahel, as well as under acute crisis contexts [27] .",

            "text": "Using a 125 mm MUAC cut-off as the only discharge criterion for SAM children admitted with a MUAC < 115 mm has been recommended by WHO for years [5] and is currently part of most national protocols. More recently, it has been pushed forward as a possible standalone criterion in contexts such as the Covid-19 pandemic, where other anthropometric measurements cannot be safely monitored [19] . Besides, the proposal of abandoning the assessment of WHZ for identification and management of SAM has been increasingly promoted and applied in the past years [7, 9, 10] . As a result, it should be expected that many children will be considered as cured while still displaying important levels of WHZ deficits [14] . In revealing a large increase in the risk of relapse associated with WHZ<-2, even in the subgroup of children displaying a MUAC \u2265 125 mm at discharge, our study unveils a potential loss of effectiveness associated with the guidance of using MUAC as a standalone anthropometric criterion for discharge. Obviously, this guidance may be particularly inappropriate for children who are the most likely to reach a high MUAC cut-off with a remaining WHZ deficit, i.e. children admitted to treatment with a WHZ<-3. Programs following the proposal to abandon the assessment of WHZ may be particularly affected by this issue, as they are ignoring the presence of WHZ deficits at admission and do not monitor nor ensure the correction of these deficits. They should thus be applied with caution. Furthermore, our results reveal that MUAC \u2265 125 mm is not associated with a decreased relapse risk in younger children. The low proportion of children with MUAC < 115 mm at admission in our setting (less than 28 % of our cohort) may have blurred the association of MUAC \u2265 125 mm at discharge and risk of relapse in younger children. However, it should be reminded that according to the WHO growth reference, MUAC is growing with age: while a MUAC of 125 mm corresponds to a MUAC-for-age Z-score (MUACZ) below \u2212 3 in the older children, it corresponds to a MUACZ above \u2212 3 in children below 24 months, and even to a MUACZ above-2 in girls younger than 1 year [28] . In younger children, failure to reach this cut-off may thus not necessarily imply large remaining nutritional deficits and vulnerability. The proper interpretation of MUAC below a fixed cut-off value regarding nutritional status, or its causal relationship with functional outcomes, has long been regarded as problematic because of this age bias [29] .",

We however contend that this postulate originates from a single work, which was a re-analysis of former birth cohorts [31] and may not be relevant to children older than 6 months. Recent reanalysis of longitudinal cohort data from Nepal, Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of Congo collected in 1983-1992 indeed reported that SAM children aged 6 months or more who are also stunted neither have a higher case fatality rate nor an elevated mortality risk compared to non-stunted SAM children [3] . Another recent analysis of children aged 6-59 months in the 1983-84 Senegal cohort reported that mortality risk in wasted children did not change significantly based on whether they were stunted or not [32] .",

Besides, the sample of children enrolled in our study consists in a large proportion of the population of children admitted to SAM treatment and discharged as cured in this district of Nepal during the study period. We thus believe that our results are robust and can be generalized to the whole district, and similar contexts in Nepal. However, this study also has some limitations. The first one is our sample size. Although the high proportion of anthropometric deficits at discharge and the high frequency of relapse made it possible to reveal the strong impact of WHZ deficits on the risk of relapse, we may have lacked statistical power to detect more subtle associations, e.g. with duration of treatment or sex, and to detect significant associations in subgroups. Secondly, the recruitment of new patients had to be stopped in March 2020 due to the situation of the Covid-19 pandemic. This decreased our sample size to a large extent. It also prevented us from observing relapse in patients recruited over a whole calendar year and analyzing the impact of seasonality. In particular, we had to stop recruiting new children right before the season of the year expected to correspond to the peak of SAM admission, e.g. higher stress on nutritional security. This may have led to an underestimation of the overall risk of relapse in this context. We also had to reschedule every home visit originally planned during the 2-months lockdown. The observation of any SAM episode occurring during this period was delayed, leading to a possible underestimation of the relapse rate in our study. At the household or community level, the Covid-19 crisis may have modified some contextual risk factors of relapse. A sensitivity analysis excluding all observations after the start of the lockdown yet did not substantially alter our results. Finally, our modest sample size precluded testing the influence of possibly interconnected risk factors of relapse at the household or community levels. We restricted our analysis to the role of discharge criteria, which are amenable to change through the revision of program guidance.",

These studies should investigate the risk of relapse in all children discharged free of SAM from treatment. The first objective should be to document the possibly high rates of relapse induced by alternative discharge practices, such as using only MUAC at a single cut-off of 125 mm to discharge children, and to confirm the role of remaining WHZ deficits. Another objective would be to accumulate data from a range of contexts and profiles of patients to define the optimal discharge criteria for SAM treatment, typically through Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves analysis. Of note, although being discharged with a WHZ\u2265-2 appeared as a strong protective factor, there were still 20 % of relapse as SAM among those children. Since WHZ as a continuous variable displayed a strong association with the risk of relapse, the question arises whether a higher WHZ cut-off should be defined to keep relapse risk minimal. Optimal MUAC discharge cut-offs by age group should also be further investigated.",

Besides, the validity of using a single MUAC cut-off such as 125 mm as a criterion to end treatment in all age groups should be further investigated.
