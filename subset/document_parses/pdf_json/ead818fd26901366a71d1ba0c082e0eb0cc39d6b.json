Recent Findings Although the literature is increasing exponentially, most clinical trials have been preliminary, thus lacking robust evidence to support many of the drugs discussed here. The main exception is remdesivir, for which several trials have been published supporting its use for patients with severe COVID-19. No solid organ transplant-specific data on remdesivir or other antiviral therapies have been published so far. Summary While further studies are urgently needed, in particular those specific to solid organ transplant recipients, the evidence so far only supports the use of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19.",

Though the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains incompletely understood, the spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome with septic shock and multiorgan failure [2, 3] . Approximately 14% of patients with COVID-19 suffer severe cases and 5% are categorized as critical [4] . The reported mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 has varied significantly, with figures ranging from 2.3 to 7.2% overall and up to 61.5% among critically ill patients [4] [5] [6] . Comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung disease are widely recognized as risk factors for severe disease [3] .",

However, whether chronic immunosuppression in SOT with COVID-19 is either protective against or a risk factor for severe COVID-19 is an area of intense investigation, evolving since the initial stages of the outbreak [7] . As such, management of immunosuppression in SOT patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain [8] . Early case reports from China described favorable outcomes among heart and kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 [9, 10] . A more recent study of 47 SOT recipients, when compared to a matched group of non-SOT recipients with COVID-19, showed that transplant status itself was not associated with increased mortality [11] . Nevertheless, other studies from Europe and North America have indicated worse outcomes in this population [12] [13] [14] . While this remains to be determined, defining effective and safe therapies will be important in this vulnerable population.",

As a member of the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sensed singlestranded, enveloped RNA virus. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins: the S (spike) glycoprotein, E (envelope) glycoprotein, M (membrane) glycoprotein, and N (nucleocapsid) protein. The S, E, and M glycoproteins together create the viral envelope while the N protein binds the virion RNA [15] . Critically, the S protein mediates virion attachment and fusion with the host cell via the cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [16] .",

This interaction governs tissue tropism of the virus, with ACE2 found in various organs including the lungs, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract [17] . Once encapsulated within an endosome, acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein allows for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes with subsequent release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm [18] . In the second and third phases, virion mRNA undergoes translation to produce polyproteins, which are cleaved to yield a replicase-transcriptase complex. The process ultimately leads to the creation of more viral genomic and subgenomic mRNA. In the final assembly and release phase, subgenomic mRNA is translated into the virion structural proteins. The antiviral agents to be discussed below each target a specific step in the viral life cycle. For example, remdesivir and favipiravir inhibit the viral RNA polymerase, hydroxychloroquine putatively blocks the attachment and entry phase, and protease inhibitors act to prevent the cleavage of polyproteins.",

Remdesivir was also shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in human bronchial epithelial cells [30] . Given the absence of alternative treatment options and the progressive nature of the pandemic, these studies encouraged the use of remdesivir on the grounds of \"compassionate use.\" In an uncontrolled case series of 53 hospitalized patients from 9 countries who received from 1 to 10 days of compassionate use of remdesivir, Grein et al. reported clinical improvement in 68% of patients [31] . Patients were included if they had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less on ambient air or if they required oxygen support. In this group, 57% and 8% required mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at baseline, respectively. During a median followup of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in category of oxygen support.",

Particular caution must be taken in liver transplant recipients and other SOT recipients who may be at heightened risk of hepatic injury from remdesivir as well as those with chronic kidney disease, usually a major comorbidity in this population.

CP has since been used to treat a diverse range of viral pneumonias including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV with the largest study performed in Hong Kong showing that among patients infected with SARS-CoV-1, CP was associated with improved mortality [44] . CP provides passive immunity in the form of neutralizing antibodies collected from screened donor individuals. In SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, the main antigenic target of neutralizing antibodies appears to be the S protein; thus, CP may act to inhibit cellular binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 [45, 46] . Support for the use of CP to treat COVID-19 mainly comes from small observational trials. In a matched control trial of 39 patients classified as having severe to life-threatening COVID-19 treated with CP, plasma recipients had greater likelihood of stable or improved oxygen requirements with an adjusted analysis showing a survival benefit with CP in non-intubated patients (HR 0.19, p = 0.015), but not for intubated patients [47\u2022] . In an observational study of 46 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and need for mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure treated with CP, there was a decrease in mortality at 7 days compared to a match cohort [48] . In an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial of 103 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 at 7 centers in Wuhan, China, comparing standard care plus CP versus standard care alone, CP was associated with lower 28-day mortality (24% vs. 16%), greater likelihood of discharge by 28 days (36% vs. 51%), and faster clinical improvement [49\u2022] . However, none of these findings was clinically significant and interpretation of the results is limited by early termination of the trial due to insufficient eligible patients in the region of China where it was conducted.",

Several studies of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have raised concerns over QT interval prolongation from chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin [63, 64] . Both calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORs), such as sirolimus and everolimus, can also cause QT interval prolongation [65] . Careful monitoring of ECGs is critical for SOT patients on immunosuppressive agents who are treated with hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin for COVID-19. Another potential adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine in SOT patients is myelosuppression, although this would be unlikely to occur in the setting of short-term treatment of COVID-19. Regarding drug-drug interactions, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are moderate inhibitors of the cytochrome P450-2D6 pathway. There have been reports of SOT recipients who experienced a threefold increase in serum cyclosporine concentrations following initiation of chloroquine [66, 67] . In summary, caution must be taken when starting hydroxychloroquine in SOT patients maintained on immunosuppressive medications that share similar metabolic pathways.",

It was found that lopinavir can inhibit one of the key proteases in SARS-CoV-1, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL protein), thereby disrupting viral replication [68] . Pharmacologically boosted lopinavir was found to have activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [69, 70] .

These medications remain primarily investigational with limited data to support their use beyond clinical trials.",

Currently, there are no trials investigating antiviral agents primarily in SOT recipients and the major studies published so far have included few patients with any form of immunosuppression, especially SOT recipients. Therefore, the clinical impact of remdesivir and other therapies can only be extrapolated from these non-transplant patient populations. Nevertheless, it is our opinion that the overall approach to antiviral therapy for COVID-19 in SOT recipients should be similar to the general population and that the general recommendations in the NIH and IDSA COVID-19 guidelines should be applied to these patients as well [38, 39] . From an antiviral perspective, that would primarily include early initiation of remdesivir when the clinical picture is in accordance with the EUA guidance.",

Nonetheless, further studies are urgently needed on several fronts including, among many others, understanding the role of chronic immunosuppression in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying SOT-specific risk factors for severe COVID-19, discovering effective and safe antiviral treatments, and the optimal timing of therapy initiation in this unique and vulnerable patient population.

Patients were eligible if they had radiographic evidence of infiltrates or a peripheral oxygen saturation of 94% or less on ambient air or if they required supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO. Unlike the trial by Wang et al., there was no limit to the duration of symptoms prior to enrollment. The patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous remdesivir or placebo for up to 10 days[34\u2022\u2022]. Remdesivir treatment arm was significantly associated with reduced time to recovery (11 days versus 15 days), and the benefit was greatest in the subgroup of patients who required supplemental oxygen but who were not intubated. There was a nonsignificant trend towards improved survival with Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days of 7.1% and 11.9% in the remdesivir and placebo groups, respectively. Although there was no observed benefit in patients who were mechanically ventilated or on ECMO, the study may have been too short at just 29 days to detect a difference. Similarly, there was no observed benefit in the median time to recovery in patients with mild or moderate disease, although the numbers of participants in these categories were relatively small[34\u2022\u2022]. The authors do not specifically mention whether SOT recipients were included in the study; however, 6.9% of overall participants had an immune deficiency (either acquired or innate), not including cancer.",
