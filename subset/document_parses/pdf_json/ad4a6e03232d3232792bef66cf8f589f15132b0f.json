            "text": "Passive mobile sensing for the purpose of human state modeling is a fast-growing area. It has been applied to solve a wide range of behavior-related problems, including physical and mental health monitoring, affective computing, activity recognition, routine modeling, etc. However, in spite of the emerging literature that has investigated a wide range of application scenarios, there is little work focusing on the lessons learned by researchers, and on guidance for researchers to this approach. How do researchers conduct these types of research studies? Is there any established common practice when applying mobile sensing across different application areas? What are the pain points and needs that they frequently encounter? Answering these questions is an important step in the maturing of this growing sub-field of ubiquitous computing, and can benefit a wide range of audiences. It can serve to educate researchers who have growing interests in this area but have little to no previous experience. Intermediate researchers may also find the results interesting and helpful for reference to improve their skills. Moreover, it can further shed light on the design guidelines for a future toolkit that could facilitate research processes being used. In this paper, we fill this gap and answer these questions by conducting semi-structured interviews with ten experienced researchers from four countries to understand their practices and pain points when conducting their research. Our results reveal a common pipeline that researchers have adopted, and identify major challenges that do not appear in published work but that researchers often encounter. Based on the results of our interviews, we discuss practical suggestions for novice researchers and high-level design principles for a toolkit that can accelerate passive mobile sensing research.",

Because of the difficulties of continuously collecting longitudinal behavioral data in the wild (Reis 2012) , previous studies mainly investigated human daily behavior in the real world using an ethnographic methodology before the emergence of smartphones. Nowadays, smartphones, embedded with a number of rich sensors, have become ubiquitous and serve as a powerful sensing platform for passively capturing human behavior (Lane et al. 2010 ) at an unprecedented resolution.",

            "text": "In the past decade, researchers have been investigating how passive mobile sensing can be used for human state modeling, by applying this technique to many longitudinal behavior-related problems. It's been applied to a wide range of fields: physical and mental health monitoring (Carreiro et al. 2015; Canzian and Musolesi 2015) , affective computing (Zhang et al. 2018; Suhara et al. 2017; Mehrotra et al. 2017) , academic/work performance evaluation (Mirjafari et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2015) , routine modeling (Banovic et al. 2016; Qin et al. 2018) , etc. The main focus of previous research has been on demonstrating the value of the passive sensing technique. A typical framing of a research question is: whether passive mobile sensing can model/detect/ predict X, where X belongs to a kind of human state, such as emotions, mental health status, or substance usage. However, much less focus has been placed on the researchers themselves. Researchers themselves do not often appear in their publications with their detailed practices, challenges, and needs often hidden beneath their papers. Actually, many interesting and informative questions can be asked about researchers. For example, what are the methodologies they followed when conducting passive sensing research? What are the common problems and difficulties they encountered when running their study? What are the needs they had when collecting and analyzing the data? Existing publications do include a research procedure, such as how authors collected and analyzed the data, which indicates researchers' practices to some extent. However, many details are not included in papers, especially the difficulties and obstacles that do not directly contribute to the research goals but have to be solved by researchers nonetheless. For example, a typical publication about the application of passive mobile sensing often briefly describes the data collection procedure with a few paragraphs (e.g., (Bae et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2019) ). It does not introduce the challenges the authors encountered during the data collection study and how they solved them (e.g., the difficulties of application development and data quality monitoring), because these are usually not the focus of their paper. However, knowing the challenges and potential solutions can help researchers who are new to this area, allowing them to conduct similar studies without so much pain.",

Passive mobile sensing research is attracting more attention, and a larger number of researchers outside this area are looking to apply this approach to their problem domains. Answering these often hidden questions about researchers is of great importance and can benefit a wide range of audiences, especially for researchers who are interested in this research area but do not have much previous experience. First, our paper provides an overview of the current research practices and existing obstacles in the field of passive mobile sensing. There exists a few review papers on passive mobile sensing techniques and their applications (Choudhury et al. 2008; Harari et al. 2017; Trifan et al. 2019; Laport-L\u00f3pez et al. 2020; Lane et al. 2010 ) but they do not cover researchers' common practices and challenges. Our paper complements these review papers and provides valuable lessons for laymen and beginning researchers to better understand the state-of-the-art. Moreover, intermediate researchers can also benefit from the answers. They can learn from others to polish their own study pipelines, avoid unnecessary pitfalls, and better hone in on important research questions. Finally, an understanding of the practices and needs can further inform the design of a toolkit for assisting a wide range of researchers who plan to apply passive sensing in their studies.",

Mobile application development, debugging hardware/software issues, communication with study participants, and workload were major challenges that stood out during the interview. Researchers also struggled when conducting data cleaning and data analysis, due to difficulties of data heterogeneity, model selection, vague evaluation, communication among the team, etc. Moreover, participants further expressed a wide range of needs, such as missing data imputation, outlier detection, feature extraction, and algorithm selection, which can potentially be assisted by a new toolkit.

            "text": "As the adoption of passive sensing techniques becomes more widespread, the amount of literature has been growing quickly even within one single application domains. Take the area of healthcare for example. Recently, researchers have leveraged passive sensing for both physical and mental health (Madan et al. 2012; Lane et al. 2010) . Example topics from the broad category of physical health include daily activities, such as sleep (Min et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2018; Sun et al. 2017) , smoking (Shoaib et al. 2015; Naughton et al. 2016) , cocaine usage (Carreiro et al. 2015 (Carreiro et al. , 2016 Chintha et al. 2018) , and drinking (Bae et al. 2017 (Bae et al. , 2018 , as well as physical diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (Mazilu et al. 2016; Postolache and Postolache 2019) , diabetes (Alexander et al. 2017; Sarda et al. 2019) , and even on COVID-19 (Cho et al. 2020; Oliver et al. 2020) . As for mental health, examples include emotion recognition (Zhang et al. 2018; Mehrotra et al. 2017) , depression detection (Canzian and Musolesi 2015; Salekin et al. 2018; Lu et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019) , schizophrenia diagnosis (Wang et al. 2016b (Wang et al. , 2017 Ben-Zeev et al. 2016) , and so on. However, despite the large diversity of research topics, mobile sensing data and analysis methods share many similarities among the different studies. We illustrate this by showing two examples in detail. Wang et al. (2014) collected mobile sensing data from 48 undergraduate and graduate students over 10 weeks to investigate how mobile sensor data could reveal students' life experiences. They collected data from a number of sensors: accelerometer, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, microphone, light, and phone screen. They also inferred higher-level behavior data from basic sensor streams: activity (based on accelerometer and GPS), conversation (base on sound), and sleep (a combination of accelerometer, light, sound, and screen). In addition, they used self-reported surveys to collect students' academic records and mental health conditions. After the data collection, they extracted a number of behavior features from the data, and conducted a correlation analysis between the features and students' mental health survey scores. They identified a number of significant correlations, e.g., conversation frequency is negatively correlated with stress level.",

Both studies leveraged data from the accelerometer, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, microphone, and phone screen. This overlap is fairly common across passive sensing studies involving mobile phones as most mobile phones have relatively uniform types of sensors. We further conducted a smallscale survey to identify some of these common sensors and features used in studies, as summarized in Table 1 . This indicates that there is a lot of similarities in data collection and feature extraction across different mobile sensing studies. We refer readers to Harari et al. (2017) , Trifan et al. (2019) , and Laport-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020)for more complete surveys. In addition to similarities in the data being collected, researchers also leverage common techniques such as correlation analysis (e.g., Wang et al. 2014 Wang et al. , 2015 Bae et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018; Mehrotra et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017) , and building machine learning models (e.g., Wang et al. 2015; Bae et al. 2017; Doryab et al. 2019a; Wang et al. 2017; Saeb et al. 2015) . The similarities and overlap in these publications suggest common practices and challenges that researchers have in their research. However, these are often not directly reflected in their publications, which focus more on the novel application areas, new algorithms, and data insights mined from the data. To our knowledge, our work is the first to summarize the common practices and needs of researchers in this area.",

(2004) interviewed nine tangible user interface (TUI) researchers to inform the design of a toolkit for tangible input. Their results revealed a few challenges that researchers encountered, including the massive amount of programming when deploying novel ubiquitous hardware, the vague association between the interaction design and the specific software implementation, the difficult debugging process to figure out sensing error. In the work of Carter et al. (2008) , they interviewed 28 developers in ubiquitous computing. Nine of them worked on mobile systems. The results showed that developers were concerned about valid evaluations and focused on field studies. However, it was difficult for developers to develop robust prototypes in uncontrolled settings, especially when deploying their applications to more than one type of device and across different infrastructures. Meanwhile, researchers also reported the difficulties of gathering data in field experiments. More recently, Min et al. (2016) conducted in-depth interviews with seven experienced mobile developers and conducted an online survey with 46 developers to understand their challenges when developing power-efficient mobile sensing applications. Developers' key challenges were from the significant time and effort for repetitive power measurements since power use needed to be evaluated under a range of real-world usage scenarios and sensing parameters. To our knowledge, there is no previous work specifically focusing on researchers in the area of passive mobile sensing.",

Meanwhile, because of the richness of mobile sensing data, participants (seven out of ten) also used a data-driven approach.

Therefore, researchers often collect their own datasets. Three participants used existing datasets collected by other research groups, while the remaining seven participants all conducted their own in the wild data collection studies. Nevertheless, regardless of whether a public dataset or a new dataset was used, data cleaning is a necessity after having the raw data, as mentioned by all participants. Then, data analysis is conducted on the cleaned data, during which domain-experts are often involved for feature engineering and results interpretation (as shown in the grey arrows in Fig. 1 ). It is noteworthy that sometimes research questions appeared to researchers not at the beginning of their work, but only after exploration of their dataset. For example, P9 published a paper about daily habit behavior mining, but the focus on daily habits was not determined at the beginning. \"Initially, we did not have a clear research question. We mined the rules after we got the data and found some interesting rules, then the research questions became clear.\" (P9) This shows that there can be an interesting iteration between data analysis and research question formulation (P3, P6, P7, P9), as shown in Fig. 1 . In addition, we point out another common iteration between data cleaning and analysis. Participants reported that it was often hard to complete data cleaning all at once because of the richness of the mobile sensing data. Participants mentioned an iterative process between the two steps. \"We did some cleaning, and then we analyzed a bit... Then we cleaned our data in a better way.\" (P8) Researchers often realized how they could improve data cleaning after some initial analysis, so they went back and modified the cleaning step, and use the refined data for further analysis.",

Among the seven participants, six used monitoring methods during their studies. Data streams from multiple sensors on mobile phones and wearable devices (if any) are uploaded to a server and the size of the data is usually huge. Therefore, monitoring the incoming data is important for researchers to keep track of the study status. A dashboard that visualizes the status of incoming data streams (e.g., amount and quality) was commonly adopted by the majority of the participants (five out of six). For instance, P10 ran a study to collect GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth data from smartphones, and physical activity data from smart bands. \"We developed a dashboard to visualize the amount of data from each sensor of each participant every day. This helped us a lot! We knew the cases where some sensors' data did not come in.\" (P10) Other common methods include periodically querying study databases (P1, P2, P6), and checking whether new data files were generated (P5, P7). For example, P2 set up an automatic process on the server to monitor the data collection study. \"We set up cronjobs to do automatic querying once every few hours to get a sense of the current data collection progress.\" (P2) When the monitoring process detects abnormal data behavior (e.g., some sensors' data are missing), researchers can quickly react to it. Researchers often start with debugging the server or the mobile application, as reflected in the loop within the data collection block in Fig. 1 . They also reach out to users when necessary. For example, P10 ran into a hardware issue and the server stopped collecting data from users' phones. After they fixed the problem, \"...some sensors' data did not come in. Then we followed up with our participants [to get a copy of their local data].\" (P10) The team found that the only way to collect the missing data was to ask users to send data that was being cached on the phone. Although such an effort was time-consuming, this helped to maintain the integrity of the data.",

Six participants used these methods to identify missing or erroneous data. For visualization, histograms (P1, P3, P6) and time-series line plots (P1, P2) were frequently mentioned. Participants also use simple statistics, such as direct data counts for missing data (P1, P2), confidence intervals (P4, P6, P7), duplication tests (P2, P3), and normality tests (P6, P7), to detect missing value and abnormal data. These methods are not specific to mobile sensing data. Prior knowledge of the data also played a significant role in problematic data detection. The passively sensed data capture users' daily behavior and researchers had certain expectations on how a user's data should look like, based on their own commonsense and life experiences. If the visualization or statistics of the data deviates from expectations, then it suggests the possibility of abnormal data. For instance, the overall daily step count should fall into certain ranges, such as from 0 to 50,000 and the step count is time-dependent. With such an expectation, P3 found some abnormal step data. \"There was some [data] like one person having zero steps during the night, but suddenly he had 100 steps at like 3:10 AM. A weird small peak. This was definitely an outlier and it should be filtered.\" (P3) Another example is the location. P10 found that some users' location data did not make sense. \"You know, GPS can be very inaccurate. I have seen data showing this person is in a lake and obviously, they were not on a boat or swimming...\" (P10) In these cases, participants relied on their prior knowledge to recognize problematic data that won't necessarily be detected by statistical analysis.",

P10 particularly pointed out the potential value of inspecting the data closely because some meaningful outliers (e.g., intentionally powering off the phone might reflect the mental state of social distancing) could easily be mistakenly recognized as problematic data. One interesting method somewhat unique to mobile sensing data is that some sensors can complement each other because sensors capture different aspects of information in the same context. Both P1 and P6 synthesized GPS and WiFi data to obtain better location information when one of them was missing (WiFi SSID could be used to estimate physical location given the WiFi geolocation information). P5 synthesized weather and users' comments to impute missing GPS data, e.g., if the weather was cold and a user claimed to be at home on particular days, locations were imputed with the home position. Multiple sensors capture the same environment from their own aspects. Therefore, these sensors can corroborate each other, allowing researchers to impute their data in a valid way.",

However, they are often less familiar with technical details about the format and content of the data. On the contrary, mobile sensing researchers are more familiar with the data but have relatively less experience in the specific domain of interest. Interdisciplinary collaboration introduces expertise from both sides, which can point to directions for new feature extraction (P4, P8, P9). Specifically, participants often summarized the information embedded in the data so that it was straightforward and easy to understand. Then, they gave a high-level summary to their domain-specific collaborators. Experts commented on the existing features and provided ideas of new potential behavior features that could be captured by mobile/wearable devices. Since sometimes not all features were feasible (e.g., number of people that a user talked to, the amount of calorie consumed in a day), participants then created feature extraction code for the feasible ones. For instance, P7 worked with doctors to understand patients' behavior captured by mobile phones. \"When I was writing the code for feature extraction, I talked with my collaborator Dr.",

For example, theories suggests a positive relationship between more exercise and better mental health (Deslandes et al. 2009; Morgan and Goldston 1987) . These theories do not involve a particular time or context of exercising, but mobile sensing can capture these relationships in detail, e.g., a user often talks with someone else over the phone while exercising. A corresponding feature can be \"the duration of conversation during exercise\" but no existing theory would have directly suggested this feature. Five participants used their own life experiences and intuitions when designing new features for extraction. \"Some features were extracted by the essence of the research question, intuitively.\" (P1) Although there was no direct supportive literature, P1 extracted communication features specific to users' family and close friends (e.g., number/ duration of phone calls). In another example, besides consulting experts, P9 further relied on their own life experiences to extract additional location features. \"We also used some rule-based heuristics to get features such as 'from work to home'.\" (P9) These creative features proposed by participants themselves were effective in their own projects.",

Researchers often resort to literature to triangulate and understand their results. Beyond this, similar to the feature engineering step (Sect. 4.4.1), domain-experts also get deeply involved in the process of the interpretation. These two steps are closely linked. The extracted features used for analysis (directly or through models) are the basis of the interpretation. As a proxy of human behavior, mobile features may not reflect a person's behavior directly. Participants often summarized their low-level analysis results into high-level understandings and discussed with their collaborators. For example, P9 worked on a project about investigating daily routine behavior from a user group. He extracted group behavior rules from a cleaned mobile sensing dataset his team collected, and then leveraged domain experts to get a better understanding of the rules. \"After getting the measure of [the rules'] group-fit, I started to cross-validate with experts to interpret the results.\" (P9) Moreover, there is an interesting loop between feature engineering and result interpretation. Continuing the previous example, P9 realized a huge number of ordinary, uninformative rules after consulting with experts. \"... so we go back to the mining algorithm and adjust the threshold [to obtain different rules].\" (P9) Feature extraction establishes the basis of the interpretation, and the interpretation can in turn inform adjustment or additional directions for feature extraction.",

The iOS platform imposes strong constraints on what an application can collect so it was hard to collect data such as application history even though researchers had consent from users. When asked about why they did not collect data from iOS users, P5 replied with what appeared to us as a bitter smile. \"It's painful to learn to develop an app on a completely different platform. But a more important thing is that iOS won't give me the data I want. I need to get the foreground app that users were using. This is impossible on iOS... so it doesn't make sense to collect data from iOS users\" (P5). Moreover, updates of mobile operating systems could also create problems as related privacy policies changed. \"The updates of the operating system can sometimes ruin the app. Some APIs were deprecated so I need to rewrite a few modules.\" (P1) For example, Android 9.0 started to restrict access to the microphone, camera, and other sensors when an application is in idle mode or running in the background.

There are many problems that are related to users' behaviors. For example, users may turn off certain sensors to extend battery life and forget to turn them on later. These sensors' data will then be missing. In these situations, following up with users is often unavoidable. Communication with users can help researchers to (1) obtain a better knowledge of users' behavior such as forgetting to charge wearable devices (P2, P7), or (2) fix hardware/software issues (P1, P6), e.g., granting permission to or turning on certain sensors (P2, P10), or (3) collecting local data if the mobile application loses connection to the server (P2, P6), or (4) collecting additional information such as follow up questionnaires (P6). However, participants found such communication with users difficult and demanding. P7's study used a rolling-enrollment approach, where participants joined/left the study at different times. \"Participants were at different paces. Some joined earlier. Some joined later. Communication with them is difficult and hard to manage.\" (P7) The communication becomes more challenging as the number of participants increases. \"I prepared some email templates but I still had to customize some.\" (P4) P6 found that her users were particularly concerned about privacy and reluctant to answer her follow-up surveys (they signed the consent but changed their minds). \"Privacy is a big concern when we tried to reach out to them for more survey questions.\" (P6) There were even cases when users completely disconnected from the research team. \"They just didn't reply... Sometimes they got back to me a few weeks later. What can I say?\" (P5) All these problems forced participants to spend extra time on managing user communication. Some participants' teams recruited study coordinators to help (P7, P10), but participants still needed to identify those users' problems to decide what to communicate. The ultimate goal of passive mobile sensing is to completely remove user burden and seamlessly provide personalized services to facilitate users' life experience.

Participants could not simply use the same piece of code to deal with multiple sensors. Instead, they developed cleaning code for each sensor separately (P1, P10). This requires extra work.",

Eight out of ten participants were involved in multiple projects with different data collection studies. However, different studies had different settings, with different sensors of different sampling rates (Blunck et al. 2013 ). These differences made it hard for participants to have cleaning scripts that could handle multiple settings (P1, P3, P6, P9, P10). \"There were too much data from different sensors that sometimes I was not aware of the error in my code. This became worse when I was cleaning multiple datasets because the data were different. The code worked on the first wouldn't work on the other. So I ended up writing multiple repositories for the cleaning.\" (P9) Participants paid extra effort to develop ad-hoc cleaning scripts and check the quality of the cleaned data. Beyond data cleaning, data heterogeneity further brings up more problems in the analysis step, as shown in Sect. 5.3.3.",

This was regarded as one of the major challenges in data analysis. Five participants mentioned that trials of various algorithms for feature selection and model selection were time-consuming. For example, P6 needed to select from over six hundred mobile features. She tried both information gain and gini index as the selection criteria, which led to two close but different feature sets. Both methods were valid and supported by statistics and machine learning literature (Manek et al. 2017; Lee and Lee 2006 Note that the challenges of feature selection, model selection, and parameter tuning stem from the areas of data science and machine learning rather than mobile sensing itself. Improving skills in these areas or collaborating with experts in machine learning may help researchers more easily tackle these problems. Six researchers also mentioned the need for a tool to help with comparing and tuning models, An automated tool for features, models, and parameters searching could greatly facilitate the research process. \"After setting up the input features, the tool can select the algorithms and tune the parameter automatically.\" (P6) Similar to Sect. 5.2.2, the majority of the participants wanted the selection and tuning procedures to be available and transparent so that they could control them and make decisions on the final choices of features, models, and parameters. \"A tool that can automatically select features and machine learning models and tune the hyper-parameters. It's like a full system but gives the option to make some changes within a certain part of the pipeline and each component should be flexible.\" (P5) Such a tool would allow researchers to focus on understanding the data and interpreting the results, which is an essential part of mobile sensing research (Sect. 6.1.2).",

Therefore, results interpretation is often not straightforward. Participants explicitly mentioned their hard time developing appropriate interpretations of the results (P4, P9, P10). For example, P4 developed an unsupervised clustering algorithm to understand mobile phone usage behavior patterns. The algorithm output a large number of clusters, but it did not help to answer how one usage pattern cluster was different from others. Interpreting the clusters required P4 to look deep into each cluster, summarize the difference between clusters, and generate humanunderstandable findings. \"Using our algorithm, we obtained clear clusters of users' app usage behavior. But I spent over one month to understand and make sense of these clusters.\" (P4) She further tried to triangulate her findings by conducting user interviews. But the interview sample was a very small fraction of the mobile data sample. \"Some participants gave me feedback that was contradictory to what they did on their phone... The data only reflected 'when' and 'which' mobile application users used, but did not tell us 'why'.\" (P4) As mentioned in Sect. 4.4.3, the use of literature and experts often help with the interpretation. However, due to the fine-grained data resolution provided by mobile sensing, sometimes findings are beyond the coverage of existing literature. This is also reflected in the feature engineering step (Sect. 4.4.1). \"I found some really interesting behavior patterns in the data. But I did not find any papers to support my findings. I consulted a few experts in behavior science but did not get a satisfying answer.\" (P9) In the final version of the publication, P9 presented these findings, provided shallow discussion, and encouraged domain-experts to explore this in future work.

As a proxy for human daily behavior, it is hard for mobile data to capture and represent human behavior exactly (P4, P5, P7, P10). For instance, a combination of the GPS, WiFi localization, and ambient noise sensor could infer whether a user gets involved in an indoor activity (Wang et al. 2014 ), but it could not reflect the details of the activity or the exact behavior of the user. \"Mobile sensing is ambiguous. The information is latent and just a representation. It requires a lot of interpretation. You can only estimate but cannot have the exact information.\" (P8) Moreover, the relationship between the volume of data available and the amount of information can be mismatched. \"... mobile sensors' data are very rich... But the data size is not proportional to the amount of meaningful information. More data does not necessarily ensure more information.\" (P7) Because of the intrinsic complexity of human behavior, for classification and regression problems with mobile sensing data, sometimes even the labels may be inaccurate. For example, P3 used self-reported emotion scores collected by ecological momentary assessment (EMA). He believed that self-report is one of the most accurate ways to measure users' emotions because a person is the one who knows themselves best. However, he also had concerns because sometimes the results reported by users could be influenced by subtle factors such as environments in which users were completing EMAs, which could greatly affect the accuracy of their subjective feelings. This is different from other types of machine learning data such as computer vision or natural language processing where labels are usually accurate.",

This follows a bottom-up path, where evidence from the data is used to support theories and literature. In contrast, the theory-driven method is a top-down path, where theories are leveraged to guide data processing and analysis. These two paths are compatible with each other. Researchers can leverage theories from the literature or experts to have a general direction for the research. Meanwhile, they should also explore the data to obtain intermediate results.

Note that these functions can also be modularized, so that a function can easily be applied on multiple sensors when appropriate, to support optimum flexibility. For instance, using the toolkit, researchers would be able to easily modify the analysis pipeline by adjusting or changing modules for different studies, where they usually have different settings and collect data from different sensors. Meanwhile, the modularized design also supports expandability. The toolkit should have good coverage of sensors using a predefined sensor set. However, as new sensors emerge, the predefined set can be expanded. The toolkit would allow researchers to add new customized sensors as new modules when needed.

Packages such as scikit-learn could serve as a good starting point. The input of the model needs to be flexible, either using a single sensor or a customized sensor list. Each sensor's input feature list should also be easily modified to support selective training, where researchers can easily define the input as needed. Note that there is a trade-off between results and time. The more models and parameters the toolkit tests, the more complete the preliminary results will be, but the longer the selection and tuning will take. Therefore, the toolkit should allow participants to easily focus on a subset of feature lists, model lists, and the range of parameter tuning according to their needs. In addition, the toolkit should leave an open interface for researchers to add their own models. This can save them time when introducing their new models into the original pipeline.

Our interview results reflect two important aspects of the stateof-the-art research: (1) common practices when researchers conduct their projects, and (2) researchers' challenges and needs during the stages of data collection, data cleaning, and data analysis. We also identified essential roles that researchers play in the research process, that is, roles that they would not want to give up, as well identifying the uniqueness of mobile sensing data for data collection and analysis. Our findings provide practical suggestions for future researchers and practitioners, and high-level design guidelines for a toolkit that could facilitate the whole research process. We envision our findings benefiting a wide range of audiences, but are especially for researchers who are interested in but do not have much previous experience in mobile passive sensing, and intermediate researchers who are working to improve their skills in the area.",

His research interests include human-computer interaction (HCI), ubiquitous computing, and applied machine learning.Jennifer Mankoff is the Richard E. Ladner Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Her research is focused on giving people the voice, tools and agency to advocate for themselves. She strives to bring both structural and personal perspectives to her work. For example, her recent work in the intersection of mental health and discrimination uses sensed data to explore how external risks and pressures interact with people's responses to challenging moments. Similarly, her work in fabrication of accessible technologies considers not only innovative tools that can enable individual makers but also the larger clinical and sociological challenges to disseminating and sharing designs. She received her PhD at Georgia Tech, advised by Gregory Abowd and Scott Hudson, and her B.A. from Oberlin College. Her previous faculty positions include UC Berkeley's EECS department and Carnegie Mellon's HCI Institute. She has been recognized with an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, IBM Faculty Fellowship and Best Paper awards from ASSETS, CHI and Mobile HCI. Some supporters of her research include Autodesk, Google Inc., the Intel Corporation, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft Corporation and the National Science Foundation.",

Anind is renowned for his early work in context-aware computing, an important theme in modern computing, where computational processes are aware of the context in which they operate and can adapt appropriately to that context. His research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction, machine learning, and ubiquitous computing. For the past few years, Anind has focused on passively collecting large amounts of data about how people interact with their phones and the objects around them, to use for producing detection and classification models for human behaviors of interest. He applies a human-centered and problem-based approach through a collaboration with an amazing collection of domain experts in areas of substance abuse (alcohol, marijuana, opioids), mental health, driving and transportation needs, smart spaces, sustainability, and education. Anind was inducted into the ACM SIGCHI Academy for his significant contributions to the field of human-computer interaction in 2015. Before starting at the University of Washington in 2018, Anind was the Charles M. Geschke Professor and Director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University for 4 years, and was a member of the faculty for 13 years. Previously, he was a Senior Researcher at Intel Research and an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Anind received his PhD and MS in computer science, and an MS in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech, and a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Simon Fraser University.",
