Study design: This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 2013 participants who were selected among registrants of an Internet research company between September 8 and 13, 2020. Methods: Participants completed an online survey that included thoughts and concerns about the application, status of use, and questions about whether the application was being used correctly. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis to clarify the association between the use of the app and sociodemographic factors and user concerns. Results: Of the 2013 respondents, 429 (21.3%) participants reported using this application, but only 60.8% of them used it correctly. The percentage of those having some concerns about the application ranged from 45.9% to 75.5%, with the highest percentage being 'doubts about effectiveness of apps for preventing spread of infection'. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed, the main concerns inhibiting application use were insufficient knowledge of how to use it, privacy concerns, doubts about the effectiveness of the app, and concerns about battery consumption and communication costs. Additionally, the prevalence of the application was lower for lower-income individuals.",

Conventional contact tracing methods use patient interviews and contact verification to check the social encounters of infected individuals [6] . Despite this being a stringent method, contact tracing may be insufficient in situations where infected individuals are uncooperative or unable to avail themselves for an interview for whatever reasons, such as severe health conditions. Additionally, it is generally laborious and requires a lot of time [7] . COVID-19 contact tracing apps could automate the process of tracking people's movements and notify potentially infected people at the earliest possible stage [8] . Although there has been much debate concerning the utility of these apps, they have been introduced globally [9] [10] [11] . For contact tracing apps to work effectively, it must be used by a large number of the population, but a survey conducted by a private-sector company revealed that as of July 2020, the use rate for these apps was around 20% even in countries with the highest rates, and only about 9% on average [10] . To promote and increase the utilization of COVID-19 contact tracing applications, additional activities are essential. However, to do this, it is necessary to first identify the underlying factors that might determine the public's decision-making to use or avoid these apps [2] . Further, Bluetooth-based apps rely on the user to activate the Bluetooth feature for it to function properly, yet it is unclear whether individuals possess such knowledge to use apps correctly.",

This longitudinal survey was started on February 25, 2020, and follow-up surveys were conducted approximately every six weeks. Each wave survey mainly included only questionnaires on the implementation and thoughts of personal protective measures, and no interventions were provided to participants. The questionnaire for the follow-up survey was changed slightly for each survey, because over time, various new information, scientific findings, and social issues related to COVID-19 became available. The socio-demographic factors and the contact tracing app were only surveyed in the first wave and sixth wave, respectively. The study participants were recruited from those registered with a Japanese online research service company, MyVoice Communication, Inc., which had approximately 1.12 million registered participants as of January 2020. In the first wave of the longitudinal survey completed on February 25, 2020, we collected data from 2400 men and women aged 20-79 years (sampling by sex and 10-year age groups; 12 groups, n \u00bc 200 in each group) who were living across seven prefectures in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The online research service company randomly chose potential respondents from the registered participants. A total of 8156 registrants were invited by email to participate in the survey. The questionnaires were placed on a secured website and potential respondents received a specific URL in their invitation email. When the number of participants who voluntarily responded to the questionnaire reached 200 in each group, no more responses were accepted from that group. Data were obtained from 2400 participants in the first wave of the survey. In the sixth wave of the survey, the online research company contacted these 2400 participants by email to participate in a survey on September 8, 2020. Similar to the first wave, the questionnaires were placed on a secured website and potential respondents responded to the questionnaire by accessing the specified URL in their email. Participation was voluntary. The response cut-off date was September 13, 2020. Reward points valued at 50 yen were provided as incentives for participation (approximately 0.5 US dollars [USD] as of September 2020).",

COCOA uses Bluetooth like many other COVID-19 contact tracing applications [8] . COCOA does not require registration of any personal information and does not record any personal information. It can be used with just a simple initial setup, such as accepting the user policy [11] . The application will record anonymous contact information from the opposite smartphone when one COCOA-installed smartphone comes in close proximity (within 1 m) with another COCOA-installed smartphone for 15 min or more. If COVID-19 is diagnosed in one of the smartphone owners, a notification is sent via the Internet to the recorded contact persons in the app with whom the smartphone owner has been in contact. Although the health center and government do not know who received the notification, if a person who received the notification contacts a local health center it is possible to get tested for COVID-19 if the health center decides that it is necessary.",

This may be for a number of reasons, 1) the number of young participants in this study was higher than in the average Japanese population [19] , and 2) since this study was an online survey, it is possible that a number of people were familiar with the Internet and smartphones. However, even though the percentage of app users in this study was higher than what has been generally reported in Japan, the prevalence of app users in this study was still merely 21.3%. Although it is yet to be determined exactly how much participation of the population is required for the COVID-19 contact tracing application to be sufficient enough in preventing the spread of infection [20] , further promotion may be needed for a wider adoption of the app. In the current study, low income levels and unemployment were factors associated with incorrect use of the app. Therefore, it may be effective to provide education targeting these populations during a pandemic when time and resources may be limited. Results also indicated that there were other various concerns about the COVID-19 contact tracing application among citizens. Among these concerns, insufficient knowledge of how to use the application, concerns about privacy, doubt about the effectiveness of apps for preventing spread of infection, and concerns about smartphone battery consumption and communication costs were factors associated with not using the app. It is documented on the website of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare that the COCOA does not collect any private or personal information, and has low battery consumption as well as communication costs [11] . However, the current study revealed that many participants were concerned about these points. To increase the popularity of the COVID-19 contact tracing application, it may be important for the government to give a more extensive explanation for these concerns regarding the software.",

            "text": "Although there is concern that elderly people may not use the COVID-19 contact tracing application [21] , the study found little association between age, the use of the application, and correct usage. However, since this study was an online survey, the participants may have been composed of people who already had some interest in technology compared with the general population. In particular, the difference between the elderly in our study and those within the general population may be large. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the association between age and use of COVID-19 contact tracing applications, since these results may be influenced by selection bias. On the other hand, low income level was a factor that inhibited the use of the application. According to the multiple logistic regression analysis regarding correct usage of the application, the point estimation of odds ratio was lower for people with lower income, although this was not statistically significant. The rise in health inequalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic has become an increasing concern [22] . Oronce et al. reported that in the U.S., states with higher income inequality experienced a higher number of deaths due to COVID-19 [23] . Furthermore, we also recently reported that the mental health of the Japanese people deteriorated from the early to the community transmission phases of COVID-19, and the degree of deterioration was more remarkable among those with low income [24] . The results of this study suggest that income may lead to inequality not only in health outcomes but also in the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 contact tracing applications. Activities for promoting the use of COVID-19 contact tracing applications should include support that target low income populations, in addition to raising general public awareness of COVID-19 contact tracing applications.",

            "text": "There are some limitations that should be considered in our study. First, participants were recruited among people registered at a single online research company and very little is known about online communities and the characteristics of people involved [25] . According to the latest White Paper issued by the Japanese government in 2019 [18] , the percentage of those who use the Internet regularly were approximately 95% for people in their 20s-50s, and 76.6% and 51.0% for those in their 60s and 70s, respectively. In addition, it has been reported that individuals who use the Internet regularly tend to have a higher income compared to non-users [18] . Therefore, participants in this study may be more educated or have a higher income than the average Japanese population. Additionally, when comparing the composition of age and sex for study participants to the latest population estimates reported by the Japanese government [19] , there were more people in their 20s and fewer in their 40s in this study. Further, this study excluded 387 individuals from among 2400 participants in the first wave of the survey. Many of the excluded participants were in their 20s, had no underlying diseases, were not married, or lived in nonmetropolitan areas (data not shown). Considering these facts, the results of this study, such as percentages of COVID-19 contact tracing application users, should be interpreted with caution, as they may have been affected by selection bias, and may be overestimated. Second, this study was a self-reported evaluation, and these results may be affected by recall bias [26] . There may be a discrepancy between people's perception of the correct use of Table 2 The association between using the COVID-19 contact tracing application and sociodemographic factors and opinions among participants who owned a smartphone (n \u00bc 1682). . A response of 3 or 4 was defined as \"having concern\" about that matter. f Reference.",
