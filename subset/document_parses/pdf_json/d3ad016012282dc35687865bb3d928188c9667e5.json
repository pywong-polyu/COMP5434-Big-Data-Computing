Public engagement events offer an opportunity to communicate these multifaceted issues and raise awareness about the climate change impact of food choices. An interdisciplinary team of researchers was preparing food and climate change educational activities for summer 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown disrupted these plans. In this paper, we report on shifting these events online over the month of June 2020. We discuss what we did and the reception to our online programme. We then reflect on and highlight issues that arose. These relate to: (1) the power dynamics of children, diet and climate change; (2) mental health, diet and COVID-19; (3) engaging the wider science, agriculture and food communities; (4) the benefits of being unfunded and the homemade nature of this programme; (5) the food system, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and diversity; and (6) how our work fits into our ongoing journey of food and climate change education.",

TakeABi-teCC was organised to share widely the scientific evidence about how food and agriculture contribute to climate change, providing easily accessible information and fun activities to help citizens understand how they can help reduce their climatic impact. Preparations were underway to develop TakeABiteCC activities for summer 2020 including teaching resources for open days and schools.

We reviewed the facts that COVID-19 and the resulting lockdown had: (1) dramatically changed people's food habits (Hubbub 2020); (2) closed schools, leading to many schoolchildren experiencing distance/online learning for the first time; and (3) increased the time that people were at home, changing daily routines (including school work and families eating together). There appeared to be a 'window of opportunity' to make people aware of the important role of the food system in climate change. The TakeABiteCC team decided to develop free online materials on this subject that were released each weekday in the month of June 2020. Our main target audience was English speaking schoolchildren aged 7 to 14 years, along with school teachers and parents/carers.",

We also encouraged a two-way process of participation and interaction generating mutual benefit. This was done with 2 days of the activities (Q&A and Showcase Fridays) in which we explored the participatory nature of public engagement while also providing opportunities for creativity. The final Q&A session was with policy and education influencers in the UK, providing inspiration and discussion about how children could influence food producers and governments. However, a question for the Theme 4 Q&A panel highlighted that these actions happen within a family unit, and the power to enact these changes may not sit with children but with the families' decision-maker(s), even though children play an important role in families' decision-making (Lawson et al. 2019 ). Due to this need for wider family action and communication, an additional information sheet was developed with bespoke stories from Ro Randall, a psychotherapist with experience in helping children communicate with adults on climate action (and participant in the 'At Home' Q&A). This sheet provided tips on talking to family members about climate and dietary change from a child's perspective and used stories to help children understand when is a good time to approach adults and/or decision-makers about climate and food issues. In retrospect, this use of stories, and additional content on how to engage family decision makers in changing diet was a crucial (and previously overlooked) part of the TakeABiteAtHome process. Future engagement must provide participants with support and advice so that they can approach their family members and wider community to discuss any issues raised.",

By encouraging children to think about their food choices and climate change, we were concerned that their anxiety related to eating or thinking about the future would increase. To address this issue the materials produced were analysed by Dr Chantal Basson (Lead Consultant, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust) and Ursula Arens (Member of the Sustainable Diets Specialist Group of the British Dietetic Association). Additionally, mental health and nutrition health warnings were placed on the TakeA-BiteCC website. The nutrition health warning advised people to take care, particularly if significantly changing their diets, and to check with a healthcare professional if there were any pre-existing health or food issues. It mentioned that reducing intake of animal-based foods can be done in a healthy way but may require planning around particular nutrients such as vitamin B12. This included advising contacting healthcare professionals and links to resources for childhood anxiety during the COVID-19 lockdown. We also felt that empowering through knowledge and ideas for action could help manage anxieties, so we designed videos focused around empowering messages, with the communication style geared for children not only in terms of accessibility, but also tone. We would recommend any future engagement to map potential issues related to mental health and anxiety and develop a list of age-and audience-appropriate empowering resources at the start of the project.",

However, due to its unfunded nature, we had no external requirements on content, delivery method or style, giving us total freedom and a much faster response time to develop new material. Its planning, development and sharing were made possible through free and/or accessible platforms (such as PowerPoint, Zoom, YouTube, social media), in addition to the TakeABiteCC website. Also, the team involved in the development of these materials (researchers, guests and collaborators) worked as volunteers. Despite the difficulties in developing educational materials without funding, even though this project would have achieved better reach with funding, it has shown that it is possible to develop free, evidence-based educational content in a short time and with reduced resources with a group of dedicated volunteers. In this sense, our experiences can be used as an example for developing educational materials for other food-related topics, facilitating the dissemination of science through the school community. However, this was largely possible due to unforeseen availability as a result of changes of schedule due to lockdown (cancelled examinations and travel), and the culture of spontaneous homebrewed content that arose during the first lockdown period.

Children, therefore, have gained an invaluable amount of information on what impact they have on their world as well as ways of making positive changes without the pressure of guilt.

It would be expected to give food impact on climate change a priority to each individual's learning. Children seeing their work recognised and praised encourages them to continue to hold these areas as important and has meant that these necessary conversations about food impact are being had beyond the classroom. Although we recognise that not all children are in a position to make significant immediate changes to the food consumed by their household, they are in a position to influence others in the impact of the food choices being made as shown previously in Lawson et al. (2019) . This led to schoolchildren asking to grow their own vegetables and discussing the origins of fruit and vegetables and the impact of transport on eating habits. The more conversations that children have about food production and consumption with all adults around themthe sooner adult decisions will be questioned and hopefully changedplacing more priority on how eating habits can be changed for the good of the planet and all of our futures.",
