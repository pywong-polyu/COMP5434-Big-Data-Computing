In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of 14.6 \u00b1 5.6 days.

Its main purpose is to forecast short term changes in the weather. It is often imprecise as it relies on a number of assumptions linking variations of air pressure to atmospheric conditions. Nonetheless, overall, we accept it as an important tool in weather prediction that has saved countless lives since its introduction for forecasting in the 19th century. In an evolving crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is in a dire need of a barometer that would provide us with reliable estimates of the disease dynamics when lockdown measures are either enacted or removed. 1 The transmission of an infectious disease depends mostly on three key aspects: the biology of the disease when individuals are in contact, social and human behavior that dictate the way individuals interact, and the physics of such contacts (closed spaces, close contact, crowded spaces) (1) . We still do not know about the details of the COVID-19 pathology, and in particular how different age or population groups either transmit or are susceptible to the disease (2, 3) . But, the disease pathogenicity and transmissibility cannot be altered in the absence of a vaccine or preventive treatments. On the behavioral side, there has been a dramatic change in everyday habits with widespread adoption of new rules to prevent both close contact between individuals and the exchange of contaminated bodily fluids. The remaining factors, frequency and type of contact, depend on human activity. Work, school, and leisure inevitably increase the number of contacts, and hence the risk of transmission that occurs in everyday life (4) . At the global level, human mobility, tracked by mobile phone use, has recently emerged as a possible proxy for human activity. Studies of the effective reproduction number R(t), the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person, against in-state human mobility data in China (5) (6) (7) and in the United States (8, 9) have demonstrated that as long as the epidemic is ongoing, mobility and reproduction number are indeed correlated (10) . Interestingly, successful exit strategies reveal a decorrelation between these mobility and reproduction which implies that an increase in activity does not lead to an increase in infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 634, "end": 635, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1106, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1109, "text": "3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1665, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1968, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1972, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1976, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2005, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2006, "end": 2008, "text": "9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2127, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "When considered together, current mobility data and disease indicators follow the typical pattern shown in Fig. 1 (a) with four distinct phases: Phase I of exponential growth during the initial outbreak of the disease; Phase II of outbreak control during which global and local mobility are rapidly reduced; Phase III of reduced growth under lockdown with reduced local and global mobility; and Phase IV of gradual exit during which lockdown measures are successively released and mobility increases while the number of new cases continues to decrease. The end of Phase IV marks the beginning of the second wave with newly increasing case numbers. An important feature of the outbreak dynamics is that a reduction in the number of new cases is delayed by about two weeks compared to the reduction in mobility and that this feature appears systematically in across countries. This is not particularly surprising as it is the primary goal of lockdown measures. However, we will show that another key property of the data is the high correlation between mobility data and the reproduction number after lockdown.

Precise predictions require more fine-grained models (15). These models consider multiple effects and mirror the complexity of interaction in societies; they include many parameters, including mobility and proximity data, that are difficult to track, especially since rapid changes in behavior often render a-few-day-old studies and historic trends irrelevant. A complementary approach is to consider coarse-grained models with fewer parameters. While these models cannot be used to make precise long-term predictions of the number of infections or deaths on a given day, they are particularly valuable when predicting global trends in a robust manner since they only rely on a few parameters that are almost entirely determined by the data alone. Here we adopt this approach to study the relation between mobility and disease dynamics. We use the well-established Susceptible -Exposed -Infectious -Recovered SEIR compartment model with a network structure and evaluate the local disease dynamics at the level of a node, which represents an individual country. We incorporate the local driving mobility at the nodal level and the global mobility at the network level through passenger air travel with diffusive transport.

The data reveal three interesting trends: First, local mobility decreases before global mobility with minima in the week of March 17-24 for car and March 24-31 for air traffic.

To ensure similar initial conditions, we begin each simulation at the individual date the country hit 100 confirmed cases. We compute the effective reproduction number, R(t), by the semi-parametric Gaussian process model and use only the country-specific mobility data over time as input. We train the Gaussian process model in a hierarchical manner and share the priors for the model between all countries. The close agreement of the fit in Fig. 3 indicates that the model is capable of learning the individual behavior based on shared posteriors. The hierarchical posterior distribution of the adaption time t * in Fig. 3 shows a mean response time of 18.8 \u00b1 2.2 days, with regional variations ranging from 11.2 days in Austria to 26.7 days in Sweden. We also determined the associated cross-correlation between the local mobility and the effective reproduction number. The time lag \u2206t varies from the shortest time interval with 14.6 \u00b1 5.6 days to the longest interval with 30.3 \u00b1 6.3 days.

Second, variations in the reproduction number during the early phases are highly correlated with changes in local mobility, while later they are not. Our analysis with training and testing suggests that, as long as the disease remains endemic, trends in local mobility allow us to forecast the outbreak dynamics for a two weeks window. This correlation has potentially important consequences: Some proposed exit strategies suggest either periodic or on-demand lockdown once the number of new cases begins to rise again. The general objective of most outbreak control strategies is to keep the effective reproduction number either strictly below one or slightly above. The problem with the latter approach is that by the time a critical rise becomes observable, the inertia of the exponential dynamics is already difficult to control and long periods of lockdown would become necessary to manage the overall outbreak dynamics. Our study shows that mobility data can serve as a barometer to adjust particular sectors of the economy, in real time, to maintain future effective reproduction numbers smaller than one. Importantly, in this approach, the forecast of the reproduction number, the correlation levels, and the window of correlation can be updated daily as new data become available.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 59, "end": 77, "text": "August 11, 2020. .", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "2nd Wave: Complete decorrelation between mobility and reproduction indicates the end of the first wave-In the case of COVID-19, during the early stages of exponential growth, almost all European countries experienced a strong reduction in local mobility. Around Mid March, numerous political measures were implemented in different stages, ranging from prohibiting gatherings to complete lockdown, with a restriction to essential business only. During this period, the virus spread non-linearly across Europe, see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 (c). Throughout this time window, individual mobility had a massive potential to accelerate the outbreak and generate large effective reproduction numbers. This agrees well with our observation of a distinct time lag and associated strong correlations between mobility and reproduction among all European countries within the full dataset, see Fig. 4 (a). Due to behavioral changes after the first phase of the outbreak, our analysis suggests that the time lag increased from initially 14.6 \u00b1 5.6 to 30.3 \u00b1 6.3 days, before mobility and reproduction decorrelate. This is clearly visible in the cross-correlation for different time intervals of the dataset, see Fig. 4(a & b) . The decorrelation begins after the infectious curve peaked, i.e., R(t) \u2264 1, and the dynamics of traffic and reproduction become increasingly independent as the effective reproduction approaches zero. In this range, the amount of infectious individuals is too low to be amplified by human mobility. For example, for the case of Austria, which was among the first countries in Europe to aggressively implement outbreak control, we observe an early peak at the end of April in Fig. 4(c) .

The learnt survival period is S D = 6.62 \u00b1 0.14 days. The adaptation time distribution in Fig. S1 (b) indicates an adaptation time of t * = 16.6 \u00b1 2.8 days. The box plots in Figs. S1 (c & d) show the country-specific case fatality rates \u03bd f and detection fractions \u03bd d .
