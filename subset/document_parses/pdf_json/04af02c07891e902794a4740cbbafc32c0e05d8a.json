Another concerning factor is that social isolation itself is a risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms. The present population suffering from chronic pain was seriously affected by social isolation, usually in-home confinement, as an important measure to mitigate the risk of COVID19 infection. Also, pain management services have been postponed or canceled, considerably diminishing the condition of the general population suffering from chronic pain (Eccleston et al., 2020; Shanthanna et al., 2020) . In addition, physical well-being and mental health were deeply harmed, enhancing symptoms such as depression, anxiety, disruption of sleep, worsening pain status and resulting in a poorly quality of life. It is obvious that the relationship between chronic pain, COVID19-related mental disorders and those affected by social isolation can be drastic for chronic pain patients, with an additional impairment of their conditions and quality of life in general.",

(2020) reported three cases of patients, clinically diagnosed with COVID19, who presented acute abdominal pain and lung injuries, without other major respiratory symptoms or fever at the time of hospitalization, indicating that abdominal pain is a relevant occurrence for COVID19 diagnosis and treatment. Also, Poggiali et al. (2020) reported 10 cases of patients presenting fever and flu like symptoms in the previous 5-10 days, with general malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) highly expressed in the human small intestine, is the main described cell receptor for the novel coronavirus (Su et al., 2020) . Diarrhea occurs secondary to the interaction between ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples, confirming fecaloral transmission (Poggiali et al., 2020) . These data reinforce the presence of abdominal pain as a differential symptom in COVID19 infection.",

Headache is highly prevalent in infected individuals with COVID19, and in some surveys up to 90.5% of infected patients reported headaches as a first symptom (26%) or a symptom that appeared up to 48 h (62.5%) after admission at the emergency service (Lechien et al., 2020; Trigo et al., 2020) . Headache was accompanied by anosmia, arthralgia, cough, light headedness, and myalgia (Trigo et al., 2020) . Generalized inflammation, release and increase of cytokines, injury to endothelial vessels, macrophage activation, and increased glial activation are some of the mechanisms suggested for pain (Dro\u017cd\u017cal et al., 2020; Kanberg et al., 2020; Trigo et al., 2020) . Increased expression of ACE2 receptors in spinal neurons would play a role in pain sensibility, and therefore, central pain. However, further investigation are still necessary to demonstrate the exact mechanisms leading to central pain as well as causes and correlation of headache with COVID19 severity (Su et al., 2020; Trigo et al., 2020) .",

Chronic pain patients that do not receive adequate treatment for their pain condition, present drastic levels of depression (Choini\u00e8re et al., 2010) . A specific serotonergic pathway from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the lateral habenula, via the central amygdala was identified as a key neural circuit governing depressive symptoms in chronic pain (Tappe-Theodor and Kuner, 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) . Chronic pain may induce depression and vice versa, depression may cause abnormal pain perception and modulation, with increased risk of developing chronic pain (Currie and Wang, 2005 ; Tappe-Theodor and Kuner, 2019). High levels of anxiety or presence of anxiety disorder have been observed in more than 50% of individuals with chronic pain. Neuroimaging studies suggest that overlapping brain areas, such as thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex are activated by both chronic pain and anxiety (Hsieh et al., 1996; Davidson et al., 1999) .",

Thus, with the disruption of their usual healthcare access, the consequences of abruptly interrupted/altered healthcare treatment will diminish patients conditions (Eccleston et al., 2020) . The risks of harm from under treatment can be aggravated further by inadequate treatment (Eccleston et al., 2020) . Despite the fact that pharmacological therapies for pain management and related syndromes tend to be ineffective, negatively affecting the quality of life of individuals (Shamji et al., 2017; Campos et al., 2020) , opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in the treatment of acute and chronic pain, even considering their adverse effects, tolerance and potential for addiction (Busse et al., 2018; Szok et al., 2019; Campos et al., 2020) . Thus, the impact of the cessation of pain treatment caused by the COVID19 pandemic can lead to several unintended consequences, such as increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications and potential increased morbidity (Deer et al., 2020; El-Tallawy et al., 2020) . The effect of opioids on the immune system seems to be complex and have been linked to infection in individuals on chronic opioid therapy. Therefore, its use by immunocompromised patients should be cautious and limited (Plein and Rittner, 2018; Cohen et al., 2020; El-Tallawy et al., 2020) . With quarantine and social distancing in COVID19 pandemic there was a worsening of opioid use disorders, hence more attention must be placed on the appropriate prescription of these medications. Non-opioid strategies were suggested (e.g., using clonidine) to prevent opioid withdrawal and in last case, for patients at risk of opioid withdrawal, an in-person visit should be scheduled (El-Tallawy et al., 2020) .",

Mechanisms for shutting down pain triggered by the virus have also been recently suggested and should be further explored (Moutal et al., 2020) since it may help in explaining the variability of pain symptoms. Despite the large number of COVID19 patients and manuscripts, there is still a lack of epidemiological studies focusing on pain symptoms. These studies should have more comparable criteria for selecting subjects in order to obtain a more representative picture of pain symptoms in COVID19. To better comprehend the mechanisms involved in the disease and the role of pain in the development of the infectious condition, pain should be analyzed as a consequence of the disease. Admitting that social isolation play a very important role in worsening pain cases is an extreme need for treatment and improvement in the quality of life of patients with chronic pain and other psychiatric comorbidities. Epidemiological data should be used to assist future health policies that seek to reduce the magnitude of future epidemics and their many consequences for chronic pain. The recognition that COVID19 induces chronic pain and exacerbates pre-existing chronic pain will be of utmost importance for a better understanding of the disease. In addition, immediate and targeted treatment as well as strategies to reduce the potential impact of chronic pain should be strongly encouraged.",
