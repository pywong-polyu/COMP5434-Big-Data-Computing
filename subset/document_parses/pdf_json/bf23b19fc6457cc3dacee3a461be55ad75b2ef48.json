However, the side effects or adverse reactions from vaccination have been highlighted and investigated. Serious side effects from vaccination could cause long-term health problems. As one of the cardiovascular side effects, there has been a focus on myocarditis [1] , especially in young men, although cases are rare [2] . However, the vascular effects after COVID-19 vaccination are not well known.",

However, these changes were temporary, with a peak at 1 day after vaccination, and had recovered to baseline at 2 days after vaccination. Thus, they concluded the shortterm cardiovascular safety of the vaccine. A very recent study by Jabagi et al. showed that no increase in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or pulmonary embolism was detected 14 days following vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine [4] .

These could be responsible for endotheliopathy and a hypercoagulable state. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines also trigger innate immunity to promote immunological memory [6] . It cannot be denied that a similar excessive immune response-induced cytokine storm occurs in some subjects after vaccination. However, incidents of thrombosis are not significantly increased with BNT162b2 vaccination compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although an elevated risk of myocarditis has been observed in both subjects with BNT162b2 vaccination and those with SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] . Thus, there is no need for concern about BNT162b2 vaccineinduced systemic responses or macro-and microthrombosis.",

Vaccination with the ChAdOx1 vaccine tends to rarely show the development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by plateletactivating antibodies against platelet factor 4 [9] . Moreover, mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines are varied to induce different immune formation in innate immunity after vaccination [6] . In the present study, Terentes-Printzios et al. showed only the results of BNT162b2 vaccination. Thus, more broad investigations are needed to reach a conclusion on the effects of the vaccines on endothelial function. The possible mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 as described above are shown in Fig. 1 .",

There is a fear that increased physical inactivity and sedentary behavior (so-called \"staying at home\" long-term) during the COVID-19 outbreak will increase the global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [10] . Such non-communicable diseases induced by communicable diseases should be highlighted as a future perspective in long-term mortality, including that due to CVD, especially in the elderly. Vaccination reduces the need for elderly people to \"stay at home\" and protects them from lifestyle-related diseases. This effect may be the most powerful tool in CVD prevention by attenuating the impairment of vascular function.",
