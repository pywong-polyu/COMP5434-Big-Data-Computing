Around a third of those with the condition require regular care from their partner. 9 MG can therefore impose a financial burden on patients and their families. People with MG often have impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL), [9] [10] [11] [12] and depression has been reported in around a third of those with the condition. 9 10 MG is a treatable disease; however, the rate of complete remission is very low and that of pharmacological remission is about 26%. 13 Most patients can be stabilised with current treatment options, but experience residual mild to moderate symptoms. 1 14 Around 10%-15% experience refractory disease. 15 Treatment is also often burdensome and side effects are common. 16 Therefore, people with MG experience an ongoing unmet need. As with many other rare diseases, there is a lack of data about the burden of MG. Data collection and sharing are vital to improve disease management and outcomes in rare diseases, where knowledge and expertise are limited, and patient populations are geographically dispersed. 17 Indeed, the need for data sharing in rare diseases has been identified and incorporated into strategy by policy makers at international 18 19 and national 19 20 levels.",

In rare diseases, where there are likely to be challenges in conducting adequately sized and controlled clinical trials, RWE is of particular worth.
