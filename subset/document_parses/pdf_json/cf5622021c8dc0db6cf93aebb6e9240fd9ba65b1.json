The S protein allows the virus to bind to the host's cell membrane. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells have been found to be the target of S proteins. It then undergoes structural changes to fuse with the host, and this eventually allows viral genes to enter the host cell [5] [6] [7] .",
