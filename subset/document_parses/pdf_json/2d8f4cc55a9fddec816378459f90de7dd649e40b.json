In particular, there is little research regarding whether social support has a mediating effect on the relationship between physical activity and aging anxiety. Accordingly, this study investigated how social support affected physical activity and aging anxiety in 778 prospective senior citizens (55 to 65 years old) out of a total of 1447 senior citizens who participated in the Embrain Panel Power and Panel Marketing Interactive. Participants completed the IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaires), Social Support Scale, and Aging Anxiety Scale. Physical activity in these Korean pre-older adults affected aging anxiety (p < 0.001), with a fixed effect of physical activity on social support (p < 0.001). Further, social support affected aging anxiety (p < 0.001). Social support was also an important parameter in the relationship between physical activity and aging anxiety. In conclusion, high physical activity of pre-older Korean persons lowered their anxiety regarding aging. Social support acted as a mediator that lowered anxiety regarding aging in the most active pre-older persons.",

According to this report, the characteristics of Korean older adults may be distinguished from those of older adults in other OECD member countries. The report indicated that Korean senior citizens participate in irregular low-wage labor to pay for their livelihood even after retirement, and the proportion of senior citizens aged 65 or older is one of the largest among OECD member countries. In addition, the poverty rate was ranked first among OECD members and subjective health was ranked 30th out of 35 OECD member countries, with most senior citizens reporting poor subjective health. The most serious issue is the fact that Korean older adults are very socially isolated, and the suicide rate is also the highest among the member countries. This indicates that the Korean government is not properly implementing health promotion programs, welfare programs, and care for the elderly. Above all, that children do not take care of their parents represents a harsh aspect of Korean society.",

Participants were also asked how many hours they spent sitting down. Subsequently, these data were calculated as Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET)-minutes scores based on the IPAQ score conversion method. The calculation formulae are shown in Table 1 . In addition, physical activity was classified into three groups according to the international physical capacity evaluation scoring system. Low-intensity physical activity included persons who did not report any activity. The moderate physical activity group reported at least 20 min of intense activity per day for three days or more, at least 30 min of moderate activity or walking for five days or more, or, a combination of walking, moderate physical activity, and vigorous physical activity for at least 600 MET-min/week for five days or more. The high-intensity physical activity group included those active more than 1500 MET-min/week through intense activity for more than three days a week, or more than 3000 MET-min/week through complex physical activity of walking for seven days or more, moderate activity, and intense activity (only one participant met these criteria).",

The scale consists of 20 questions that address four factors: \"Fear of Loss\" (4 questions), \"Physical Appearance\" (4 questions), \"Fear of Old People\" (5 questions), and \"Psychological Concerns\" (7 questions). Responses range from \"Not at all\" (1 point) to \"Very much\" (5 points); the higher the score, the higher the aging anxiety. Cronbach's \u03b1 was 0.90 in Lee and You [47] . This questionnaire has been recently used for elderly Koreans [48] . Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to verify scale validity. For social support, three factors were extracted from 12 questions. Cronbach's \u03b1 for social support indicated good internal consistency reliability (\u03b1 = 0.925-0.955). The results are shown in Table 2 . For aging anxiety, four factors were extracted as a result of factor analysis of 20 items, excluding two questions with low factor loading values. Cronbach's \u03b1 values for aging anxiety were 0.764-0.851. The results are shown in Table 3 . Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to derive a measurement model for each variable verified through exploratory factor analysis and a reliability analysis. The recommended Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) indices were used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the measurement model in consideration of model fit and simplicity [49] . The reference value of the indices was interpreted as an acceptable fit, namely TLI and CFI > 0.900 and RMSEA < 0.050-1.000 [50] . In addition, it is recommended that \u03c7 2 and df be presented in the study results. This is because these two statistics are the basis for almost all other indices [51] .",

In the absence of social support, physical activity and the path to aging anxiety were analyzed. The fit of the overall effect model was as follows: \u03c7 2 = 63.891 (df = 5), incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.912, normed fit index (NFI) = 0.905, CFI = 0.911, and RMSEA = 0.123. RMSEA < 0.100 denotes moderate fit; although RMSEA exceeded 0.100, the incremental measures IFI, NFI, and CFI all showed good fit (all > 0.900). The path coefficient of the overall effect model is shown in Table 7 . In the absence of social support as a mediating variable, physical activity had a significant negative effect on aging anxiety. As suggested by Baron and Kenny [53] , the influence of independent variables on parameters should be noted. To assess the influence of the parameter on the dependent variable, a parameterization effect model was analyzed, whose fit statistics were as follows: \u03c7 2 = 139.802 (df = 18), IFI = 0.938, NFI = 0.930, CFI = 0.938, and RMSEA = 0.093, indicating satisfactory overall fit. Therefore, the mediating model was suitable; the corresponding path coefficients are shown in Table 8 . Physical activity had a significant negative effect on aging anxiety, confirming H1. The independent variable, physical activity, had a significant positive effect on social support, supporting H2. H3 was supported by the finding that social support as a mediating variable had a significant negative effect on aging anxiety as a dependent variable. Accordingly, a mediating effect was present on social support. The total effect, direct effect, and indirect effect in the path analysis are shown in Table 9 . Table 9 .

Specifically, in the validation of mediating effects, the null hypothesis that there was no mediating effect was assessed by using bootstrapping to generate the applicable confidence interval [54] (Table 10 ). In Table 5 , the 95% confidence interval (CI) was \u22120.171 to \u22120.078. Since zero was not included in the interval, the null hypothesis was rejected and research hypothesis H4 supported. To specifically verify the mediating effect of social support, a partial mediation model and a complete mediation model were introduced as competitor models. To distinguish between the two competitor models, statistical significance of the \u03c7 2 difference was assessed; the fits of the structural equation models were compared (Table 11 ). In the partially mediated model, the df decreased by 1 and the \u03c7 2 value decreased by 5.499 compared to the fully mediated model. Since the critical values of \u03c7 2 (df = 1) for p < 0.05 is 3.84, the two models were statistically different. In addition, TLI was 0.905 in the partially mediated model and 0.904 in the fully mediated model; fit of the partial mediated model improved. RMSEA suggested decreased fit in the partially mediated model (0.092) versus the fully mediated model (0.093). Given the fit results, the fully mediated model was more suitable than the partially mediated model. Therefore, the fully mediated model was finally adopted.",

Accordingly, one can understand sociocultural aspects of the Korean prospective elderly and present policy alternatives for the current elderly that consider Korea's transition to an aging society. In addition, the current work helps predict changes in Korea, whereby new cultures will emerge due to the aging society, and indicates positive directions in which culture might change. Moreover, the data may help relieve the fear of aging by providing indications of how persons may lead healthier lives. The work can be the basis for introducing programs to encourage physical activity among older persons and encouraging active social activity, so as to increase social support.",

            "text": "The study targeted prospective elderly people, namely the post-Korean War generation. The results indicated how the amount of physical activity and social support of Korean prospective seniors affected their aging anxiety and how social support is a parameter related to physical activity and aging anxiety. Prior studies have shown that high levels of physical activity in older adults increase social support and decrease fear of aging anxiety and anxiety [69, 70] . These findings are consistent with those of the current study. However, there are few studies of how social support affects aging anxiety among older persons. The available studies indicate that social support and lifestyle have a positive effect on the health of the elderly [71, 72] . The current study was limited to the elderly in Korea. Unlike other countries, the elderly in Korea have a high suicide rate, isolation, low subjective health levels, and the longest participation in labor. Hence, the role of social support in decreasing aging anxiety is especially meaningful for this group. Prospective elderly Koreans appear to be attempting to live a healthy life in preparation for aging, and are investing in themselves rather than in their children. Based on these results, further study of the elderly in Korea will help predict the structure of Korean society in the future.",
