The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic (the highest possible risk assessment level) on March 20, 2020. As of April 4, 2020 (Korean time), there have been 1,134,124 confirmed cases and 60,305 deaths (a mortality rate of 5.33%) in 210 countries worldwide; there have been 10,156 confirmed cases and 117 deaths (mortality rate 1.74%) in South Korea. During the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015, nosocomial infections with MERS-CoV were reported in major tertiary care hospitals in South Korea; the Korean government shut down such hospitals for the duration of the disease incubation period as soon as infections were confirmed. Thus, patients with emergent postoperative bleeding or other critical complications had to be transferred to other hospitals [1] . Currently, patients who have visited contagious areas, such as hospitals shut down because of nosocomial COVID-19 infection within the prior 2 weeks, are considered to be at high risk of infection; for such patients, COVID-19 screening is required before surgery or hospitalization. However, in contrast to patients undergoing elective surgeries or procedures, patients who exhibit emergent postoperative hemorrhage cannot wait for test results prior to treatment.",

During bleeding control in the emergency room or operating room, physicians are at very high risk of infection by aerosol-borne COVID-19 from the oral and nasal cavities of infected patients. More recently, head-and-neck surgeons have been required to manage post-oropharyngectomy bleeding in patients undergoing transoral robotic surgery to treat tonsillar cancer; the bleeding rate is 6.47% [4] . Here, we sought to create an appropriate treatment protocol for post-tonsillectomy bleeding that helps patients and concurrently protects medical staff at high risk of infection from COVID-19.",

If the patient's vital signs are stable, a thorough history-taking should explore the following items prior to any procedure: 1) Any history of close contact with an individual who had confirmed COVID-19 in the past 2 weeks? 2) Any history of travel abroad in the past 2 weeks (i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic)? 3) Any epidemiological link with any domestic outbreak in the past 2 weeks? 4) Any COVID-19 symptom (e.g., fever, chills, cough, and/or loss of taste or smell)?",

            "text": "In general, it is best to control bleeding in the outpatient clinic; however, the patient should not be moved from the emergency room to the outpatient clinic if the negative-pressure facility is not prepared. Most ear-nose-and-throat outpatient clinics are not equipped with negative-pressure facilities; bleeding may require treatment in a negativepressure room adjacent to the operating room or in the operating room itself (under negative pressure). To identify the bleeding site, the patient must remove any mask and the doctor must look closely into the patient's mouth. The doctor is thus at risk of exposure to patient body fluids if a cough reflex is triggered when blood is aspirated. Aerosols are always generated during suction or electrocauterization. Therefore, if the patient belongs to a high-risk group or is confirmed to have COVID-19, medical staff should work within negative-pressure facilities and wear high-level (level D) personal protective equipment (PPE) or powered air-purifying respirators. It is best to use a portable ear-noseand-throat endoscope (30/70\u00b0); if this is not available, a headlight should be fitted to the PPE prior to any procedure. If an endoscope is not used, the distance between the patient and the doctor is very small. Only the minimal number of medical staff should be present, to conserve PPE and medical resources and to protect the staff. In general, one surgeon and one assistant are sufficient. The assistant must also wear level D PPE. All medical staff must be experienced and must discuss the planned surgery in detail prior to the procedure, thereby minimizing communication errors caused by protective garb. Tracheostomy performed in the intensive care unit generates aerosols that may transmit disease to medical staff. During the SARS outbreak, medical staff used a wide range of PPE (from face shields to powered air-purifying respirators) during surgery [5] [6] [7] [8] . PPE use was essential to prevent disease transmission. If bleeding is not controlled in the negative-pressure room, the patient must be transferred to the operating room; thus, it is necessary to check the planned patient flow plan and the availability of an anesthesiologist in the negative-pressure operating room. To minimize exposure to patient-derived aerosols during the procedure, it is important to note the following: 1) Prior to the procedure, anesthetize the oral cavity and pharynx using xylocaine spray to suppress the gag and cough reflexes; 2) Minimize suctioning. If suctioning is essential, use a closed inline suction system fitted with a viral filter; 3) Treat the patient gently to reduce the gag reflex; 4) Control active bleeding via cottonoid compression and minimize the use of electrocauterization At the end of the procedure, carefully dispose of all waste and thoroughly decontaminate all equipment, while avoiding contamination of the environment. All responsible personnel should wear appropriate PPE (Fig. 1 ).",
