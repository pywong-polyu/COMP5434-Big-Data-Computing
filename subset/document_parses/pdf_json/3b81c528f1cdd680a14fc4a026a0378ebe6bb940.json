Here, we evaluated the diagnostic performances of a rapid, extraction-free and connected reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay on saliva. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and saliva from 443 outpatients were collected simultaneously and tested by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as reference standard test. Seventy-one individuals (16.0%) were positive by NP and/or salivary RT-qPCR. Sensitivity and specificity of salivary RT-LAMP were 85.9% (95%CI 77.8-94.0%) and 99.5% (98.7-100%), respectively. Performances were similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants were analyzed and no dominant mutation in RT-LAMP primer region was observed during the period of the study. We demonstrated that this RT-LAMP test on self-collected saliva is reliable for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This simple connected test with optional automatic results transfer to health authorities is unique and opens the way to secure professional and social events in actual context of economics restart.",

For the next coming months the strategy for reopening and relaunching social and professional events will be central. In addition to middle/long term pandemic monitoring, testing population is still important since vaccine immunity and natural immunity are imperfect and social distancing is more flexibilized 16 . To this end, next to collective surveillance approaches (for instance sewage virus testing), authorities are looking for individual testing systems with higher population acceptability and efficiency. Hence, the ideal individual virus test specifications are: (1) Painless and simple sampling to avoid any reluctance from population for recurrent testing, (2) Easy, rapid and low cost to make it usable at very large scale and in any condition including without specialized laboratories and expertise, (3) Sensitive and specific to bring safety and (4) To be real time connected to allow immediate individual information as well as monitoring by local or national authorities 17 . This latest point is central to secure events or professional plants to return to activities. The development of a rapid salivary RT-LAMP that meets most of these points for SARS-CoV-2 detection would be a step forward in deploying a point-of-care test to safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks.",

LeGoff et al. read by visual observation the coloration of the tube after reaction while we used the dedicated smartphone/tablet application EasyCOV Reader\u00ae, which is preconized by the manufacturers to avoid any well-known subjective interpretation of the readout depending on the light of the room and the operator.

Over the course of evolution, some variants become preponderant in human populations (e.g. \"UK variant\"-lineageB.1.1.7) and raise widespread concern 27-29 . Genetic variants can lead to false negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing if mutations occur in the targeted regions of the primers or probes of the diagnosis tests. We evaluated the frequency of sequenced variants in France and over the World presenting mutations in the annealing region of the RT-LAMP primers during the period of the study of LeGoff and collaborators and ours. No dominant mutation was observed and our analysis shows that 91.9 to 99.1% of all sequenced samples presented 100% of identity with the target sequence of RT-LAMP primers between May 2020 and February 2021 in France and 95.0 and 97.1% over the World (Supplementary Table S6 ). Further, continuous surveillance allows to evaluate the capability of EasyCOV\u00ae to detect the new appearing strains of SARS-CoV-2. Four recent mutated variants (AY.25, AY.34, B.1.621 and B.1.621.1) present mutations in the region targeted by RT-LAMP primers but together they represented only 6.6% of all the sequenced specimens in samples collected in the last four months.",

Nagura-Ikeda et al. 34 compared six different NAATs (including one RT-LAMP) and an antigen test using self-collected saliva from hospitalized patients. The sensitivities of the evaluated tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection were 50.5 to 81.6% (70.9% by RT-LAMP) using NAATs and 11.7% using the antigen test. Yokota et al. 8 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Further, a recent meta-analysis found a high pooled sensitivity for antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) when using NP samples and a Ct cutoff for RT-qPCR < 30 (79.90% (95%CI 70-87). However, for saliva specimen the pooled sensitivity found was 37.9% (95%CI 12-74) independently of the Ct cutoff used for the reference standard RT-qPCR 35 . Despite the rapidness and the low-cost of Ag-RDTs, the observed performances in the meta-analysis were lower compared to EasyCOV\u00ae and NP sampling is still required for Ag-RDTs to achieve even moderate diagnostic performances.",

A total of 71 individuals were positive from which 43 had discordant results between NP and salivary RT-qPCR. Most (n = 39) were detected positive only in saliva while clearly negative in NP RT-qPCR without Ct value. Five individuals proceeded to a serological test and all were positive, corroborating the salivary RT-qPCR results and suggesting an infection at sampling. Contrarily, four participants were positive in NP RT-qPCR only. For three of them, the presence of the viral RNA at low loads in saliva was observed (Ct value \u2265 35). Different kinetics of virus replication in saliva and NP have already been described 6, 7 . In our study, NP RT-qPCR broadly underestimated the number of positive cases detected using salivary RT-qPCR and salivary RT-LAMP. Low sensitivities have also been reported earlier 19, 20 and might reflect the difficulty of the NPS sampling. Collecting saliva is a non-invasive and easy procedure in contrast with NP or OP swabs. In ambulatory practice, the use of saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 has several advantages. It avoids individual's discomfort, minimizes healthcare personnel exposure and well accepted by population. Accordingly, we showed the feasibility of saliva self-sampling in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic outpatients. Despite NPS being the most used sampling method, saliva was demonstrated to be a reliable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in other several studies 6, 8, 9, 11, 21, 32, [41] [42] [43] and our results showed that saliva presents a superior performance for COVID-19 diagnosis using RT-qPCR compared to NPS.",

Real-time detection and thermal cycling conditions were identical to previously described 23 . Saliva samples were analyzed in triplicate and RT-qPCR Ct values were the mean of these results. An absence of amplification on replicates was expressed as Ct = 40 which is the maximum value obtained by our method. For each experiment, we performed positive and negative controls using a SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA (CODEX DNA, SC2-RNAC0500), well-characterized positive and negative saliva samples and no template control (H 2 O).",
