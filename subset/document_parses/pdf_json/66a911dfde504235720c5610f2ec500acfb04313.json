The key is to be able to detect this initial drop in oxygen saturation levels so that patients infected with COVID-19 who begin to suffer from pneumonia can be detected very early on and put on a treatment plan to prevent the lungs from deteriorating further. Consequently, early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia can prevent patients from having to be treated with highly invasive procedures such as intubation and mechanical ventilation, a procedure which currently results in an 80% mortality rate for COVID-19 patients.",

Normally, pulse oximeters can be purchased at a relatively affordable price without prescription at pharmacies and retail stores. However, the availability of pulse oximeters in the US has become extremely limited since the first case of COVID-19 was reported (Quartz). However, it is still possible to perform this early detection of silent hypoxia in COVID-19 patients using smartphones. It has been shown that oxygen saturation readings measured using smartphones correlate highly with readings obtained using medical-grade pulse oximeters. Using a Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone, Tayfur and colleagues compared pulse oximetry readings against two medical-grade devices commonly found in emergency rooms and reported correlations of between 96-99% [2] . Additionally, smartphone-based pulse oximetry has been found to be particularly accurate when the oxygen saturation levels in the users are above 90% [3] . Oxygen saturation in healthy patients range from 95-100%, so the general public could use their smartphones to regularly take their own measurements conveniently at home and contact their health provider immediately should they notice a visible drop in their oxygen saturation of below 95%.",

With the widespread availability of smartphones, this approach could increase the chances of detecting pneumonia in COVID-19 patients before severe infections set in to their lungs. This would almost certainly significantly reduce intensive care admissions, intubations, and the mortality rate of COVID-19.",
