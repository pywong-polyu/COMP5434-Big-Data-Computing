The genome of HEV is organized into three open-reading frames (ORFs): ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. The ORF1 non-structural Y-domain region (YDR) has been demonstrated to play an important role in the HEV pathogenesis. The nucleotide composition, synonymous codon usage bias in conjunction with other factors influencing the viral YDR genes of HEV have not been studied. Codon usage represents a significant mechanism in establishing the host-pathogen relationship. The present study for the first time elucidates the detailed codon usage patterns of YDR among HEV and HEV-hosts (Human, Rabbit, Mongoose, Pig, Wild boar, Camel, Monkey).",

The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis indicated biasness towards C and U over A and G ended codons in HEV across all hosts. Codon frequency comparative analyses among HEV-hosts showed both similarities and discrepancies in usage of preferred codons encoding amino acids, which revealed that HEV codon preference neither completely differed nor completely showed similarity with its hosts. Thus, our results clearly indicated that the synonymous codon usage of HEV is a mixture of the two types of codon usage: coincidence and antagonism. Mutation pressure from virus and natural selection from host seems to be accountable for shaping the codon usage patterns in YDR. The study emphasised that the influence of compositional constraints, codon usage biasness, mutational alongside the selective forces were reflected in the occurrence of YDR codon usage patterns.",

Studies have reported the isolation of other strains of HEV from specific hosts, such as HEV-5 and HEV-6 from wild boars in Japan [14, 15] . HEV-7 from dromedary camels [24] and HEV-8 from Bactrian camels [25] . The genetic code encompasses 64 codons, separated into 20 distinguishable groups. Each individual group, consists of one to six codons, encodes the same amino acid. Thus, each standard amino acid is often encoded by alternative codons belonging to the same group. These alternative codons are termed as \"synonymous\" codons. These synonymous codons differ not only between genomes but also within the same genome of the organisms/organism. This phenomenon is referred to as codon usage bias [26, 27] and has been well documented in many organisms including prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

However, in viruses, mutational pressure rather than natural selection is found to be the major factor influencing codon usage variation [40] [41] [42] [43] .",

The present study is the first in its kind which have reported the detailed codon usage analysis on a total of 7 hosts in HEV YDR. Therefore, knowledge obtained from the presented study will not only augment our understanding towards molecular evolution but is also envisaged to provide insight into the efficient viral expression, viral adaptation and host effects on HEV [31, 44] .",

With this study, we implemented a systematic survey of the evolutionary pressures (i.e., mutational bias and natural selection) across the YDR to gain insights into the HEV functional implications in regulation as well as adaptative evolution. Jenkins and Holmes (2003) reported that codon usage bias phenomenon can be influenced by the overall nucleotide composition pattern [37] . Thus, initially, we computed the nucleotide frequencies of the YDR from HEV and its hosts. The HEV YDR revealed an over-representation of C, with overall C/U codon bias pattern in the nucleotide composition. In HEV, the percentage of C was the highest followed by U and G, with A having the lowest value (except hosts, camel, and monkey which followed the trend U > C > G > A). This clearly revealed that there was unequal distribution of A, U, G, and C nucleotides among the YDR codons. Additionally, in HEV and rabbit, the nucleotide values at third codon positions also followed the same trend, i.e., C3 had the highest value, followed by U3, G3, and A3 with the least value (while hosts followed the trend C3 > U3 > G3 > A3). Therefore, it could be interpreted that the initial nucleotide compositional patterns showed more preference towards C-and U-ended codons followed by G/A-ended codons. This is consistent with the recent investigation that has reported U/C rich genome in ORF1 of HEV [45] . However, the overall C/U rich pattern in the nucleotide content in YDR is opposite to the pattern observed in RNA viruses, which showed the prevalence of A/C-rich genomes (HIV, hepatitis C, rubella viruses) [46] . Thus, it could be interpreted that this biasness in YDR was due to the adaptation of common ancestor of modern HEV strains in terms of nucleotide composition requirement of the host during its process of evolution [47] .",

For instance, AU-or GC-rich composition preferred codons ending with either A and U or G and C, Table 3 Preferred codons for each amino acid in the YDR of HEV and its hosts Comparison of codon usage frequency of preferred codons among HEV and its hosts. All the preferred codons are highlighted indicating the highest codon frequency. Thus, codon usage pattern of YDR was a mix of coincidence and antagonism with respect to its host respectively. These trends, when observed, support the influence of mutational pressure [37] . The RSCU analysis revealed that HEV had comparatively higher codon usage bias towards U-and C-ended codons. The overall RSCU patterns can potentially hide host-specific patterns, so we next calculated the RSCU values for specific hosts. Thus, the comparative analysis was performed among HEV and its hosts, by correlating their RSCU patterns. It was noted that the host-specific codon usage patterns also showed preferred codons ending with U and C. Thus, in line with nucleotide composition analysis, the RSCU analysis further confirmed the codon biasness towards U-and C-ended codons. Thus, it could be interpreted that mutational bias was found to be a major force determining the codon usage patterns of YDR, which probably suggested that compositional constraints influenced the selection of preferred codons. However, it is interesting to mention that though HEV and its hosts was endowed with higher percentage of GC rather than AC, the RSCU analysis revealed a biasness towards U-terminated codons. This suggested that other factors in combination with mutation pressure also existed in the process of HEV evolution. Therefore, selection pressure from hosts contributed to shaping the molecular evolution of HEV at the level of codon usage. The codon usage in virus's genome in accordance with its host codon preferences is an important aspect which determines the evolutionary adaptation of the virus to its host cell. The alteration of codon usage in viral genomes due to the proper information obtained from host genes regulates the virus-host interactions [48] . As viruses are obligate parasites, their optimal codon selection is largely dependent on their host cells translational machinery [49] . A noteworthy variation was observed in the usage for the preferred codons among HEV and HEV-hosts. This implied that the codon usage patterns of HEV as well as the possible fitness of HEV to adapt within its dynamic host range were largely influenced by the selection pressures exerted from HEV-hosts.",

            "text": "In this study, it was observed, that unlike other viruses, that have evolved completely identical to their hosts or completely opposite to their hosts codon patterns [50, 51] , the HEV evolution showed a mixture of two codon usage patterns. Our results revealed that none of the hosts showed complete resemblance or complete discrepancy to the HEV. The ratio of common/uncommon preferred codons between HEV-Human, HEV-Rabbit, HEV-Mongoose, HEV-Pig, HEV-Wild boar, HEV-Camel, and HEV-Monkey were 13/5, 11/7, 15/3, 13/5, 13/5, 12/6, and 8/10, respectively. Thus, codon usage pattern of HEV YDR showed a mixture of coincidence and antagonism with respect to its hosts. The resemblance in synonymous codon patterns among HEV and its hosts implied that HEV could adapt to its host cells, resulting in its multiplication. This phenomenon suggests that the virus can replicate in host cells due to similarity in usage for preferred Table 4 Most frequent and least used codons among HEV and its natural hosts Codon frequency is given in parentheses following the relative synonymous codon usage Top 5 most frequent used codons HEV ACC (8.8), GAG (7.9), UAC (6.5), GUC (6.4), GGC (6.3),",

It has been suggested that the coincident portions of codon usage could facilitate efficient translation of the corresponding amino acids among viruses and their respective hosts [52] . This indicates that preferred codons or more abundant tRNA molecules are chosen to increase the accuracy of translation [53] . While the antagonistic portions of codon usage may aid in proper folding of viral proteins, even though decrease in the corresponding amino acids translation efficiency is observed [52] . This implies that rare codons help in reducing the inappropriate co-translational folding of proteins [54] . Thus, our results clearly suggested that the codon usage pattern of HEV is both coincident and antagonistic to that of its hosts. Such patterns of coincidence and antagonism have been previously reported in HBV [55] , HCV [52] and enterovirus 71 [29] . Therefore, our results probably suggested that disfavored codons encoding amino acids cannot be considered as a deleterious factor for viral genes in order to adapt to its hosts. Thus, it could be interpreted that the influence of compositional constraints, codon usage biasness, and mutational alongside the selective forces were reflected in the occurrence of HEV YDR codon usage patterns.",

Thisnovel approach is expected to strengthen our understanding on the common attributes and differences in the codon usage patterns among HEV and its various hosts. The nucleotide compositional analysis showed relative abundance of C and U nucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed that the preferred synonymous codons mostly end with C/U. Moreover, it was observed that the HEV codon usage pattern to that of its host cells is a mixture of coincidence and antagonism. The compositional characteristics indicated that interaction between the mutation pressure from virus and translation selection from host exist in the processes of HEV evolution. Our study suggested that synonymous codon usage in HEV is an evolutionary process, perhaps reflecting a dynamic process of mutation and selection forces to adjust its codon usage to different hosts and conditions. The present study is thus envisaged to infer the evolution, adaptation, and biology of HEV via specific codon preferences.Abbreviations HEV: Hepatitis E virus; YDR: Y-domain region; RSCU: Relative synonymous codon usage.",
