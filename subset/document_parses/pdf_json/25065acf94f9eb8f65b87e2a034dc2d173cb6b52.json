A low-cost ventilator seems to be an alternative substitute to fill the lacking. This paper presents a numerical analysis for predicting the delivered parameters of a lowcost mechanical ventilator. Based on several manufactured mechanical ventilators, two proposed designs are investigated in this study. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is used for solving any problems with the first design, and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis with moving boundary is used for solving any issues with the second design. For this purpose, ANSYS Workbench platform is used to solve the set of equations. The results showed that the Ambu-bag-based mechanical ventilator exhibited difficulties in controlling ventilation variables, which certainly will cause serious health problems such as barotrauma. The mechanical ventilator based on piston-cylinder is more satisfactory with regards to delivered parameters to the patient. The ways to obtain pressure control mode (PCM) and volume control mode (VCM) are identified. Finally, the ventilator output is highly affected by inlet flow, length of the cylinder, and piston diameter.",

            "text": "COVID-19 outbreak has become a global issue as this new pandemic has strongly affected the world [1] [2] . This virus causes a substantial global health problem with very significant economic and social impacts [3] [4] [5] [6] . Studies have shown that most people affected by COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but other people, like adults over 65 and those with chronic illnesses, develop severe symptoms in the pulmonary system. This is reflected by the fact that the potentiality of these groups of people to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen between blood and lungs begins to fall once they are attacked by the virus [7] . At this stage, patients are hospitalized to support their lung functions with mechanical ventilation, as it is the best medical treatment currently recommended by doctors. It has been reported that the early use of endotracheal intubation (invasive intubation) can cause secondary lung infection because of the risk of germs entering through the tube, which car- Positive end expiratory pressure chest, and the intercostal muscles, which are located between the bones of the rib cage. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and moves toward the abdomen cavity, and the intercostal muscles contract to lift the rib cage outward. As a result of these two muscle movements, the volume of the rib cage increases, and the pressure in the cavity where the lungs are housed, decreases. The increase in volume and the decrease in pressure urge outside air to fill the lungs, to balance the pressure in the lungs with external atmospheric pressure. During the expiration phase, the process is reversed, where the pressure inside the lungs increases above atmospheric pressure, thus resulted in a pressure difference which draws air out of the lungs [15] [16] [17] . Mechanical ventilation works entirely differently than the physiological breathing system. Instead of having depression during the inspiration, the mechanical ventilators push the gas by creating high position pressure. The ventilatory parameters are carefully adjusted by the doctor according to the ventilation mode that has been chosen. It is possible to change the inspired oxygen fraction between 21% and 100% while maintaining positive expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the circuit during expiration [ 8 , 9 ] .",

This type of simulation is essential to evaluate the performance of the design before proceeding to the fabrication stage. The study of the mechanical ventilation process requires the use of fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The FSI problems play prominent roles in many scientific and engineering fields, yet a comprehensive study of such problems remains a challenge due to their strong nonlinearity and multidisciplinary nature [19] [20] [21] [22] . FSI method couples computational fluid dynamics used for fluid flow with finite element analysis used for the solid domain. It enables the investigation of the fluid behavior, structural behavior, and how they interact and affect each other. In a One-Way FSI study, the results obtained from the solution fluid or structural domain are used as a boundary condition when solving the different domain. In a Two-Way FSI study, at each sub-step, the fluid and structural domain solutions are solved in parallel. The solution must be converged before moving to the next step [23] .",

Frequently, the respiratory cycle consists of the inspiratory time (TI) of 1 s and the expiratory time (TE) of 2 s [24] . In this case, the respiratory frequency is often 20 cycles per minute. Once inspiration gets triggered, the insulator opens the inspiratory valve VA ( Fig. 2 ) and closes the expiration valve VB, causing the airway pressure to rise and then, compressed gas enters the lung. During expiration, the mechanism is reversed. The inspiratory valve is closed and the expiratory valve opens, causing the airway pressure to drop, and the gas leaves the lung (passive exhalation). These two valves always act in opposite ways. However, this mechanism cannot generate a PEEP. The regulation of the expiratory valve causes the desired PEEP by taking into account the resistance of the breathing circuit [25] .",

The case of VCM is chosen because it is most frequently used by doctors, as already mentioned. These curves are not deduced from a confirmed case of the ventilated patient but are purely theoretical. From Fig. 3 , it can be seen clearly that when inspiration starts (point A), the flow increases considerably to reach a plateau (point B) and stays at that target level for the duration of inspiration before the expiration begins (point C). At this time, the pressure goes up gradually from PEEP and continues spreading until the preset tidal volume is delivered. The volume increases monotonically (linear rise) to reach the tidal volume (remember that volume = flow \u00d7 time). During expiration, the flow curve goes below the time-axis and back to zero (point D). Simultaneously, the pressure drops to the set PEEP level, and the volume decreases and returns to zero.",

Fig. 13 presents the streamlines on the vertical plane for different instances.
