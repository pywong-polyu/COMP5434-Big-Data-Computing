This practice framework rests largely on the fact that occupational performance should involve an occupational balance (OB), i.e., a sense of harmony between occupations, becoming a necessary condition to ensure that occupations properly perform a process for obtaining health and wellness [2] . From an occupational perspective of health, it should be noted that there is a variety of risk factors that can affect the right use, choice, opportunity, or balance in an occupation, thereby resulting in occupational dysfunction, which may also involve other negative 2 of 12 consequences such as occupational deprivation, occupational alienation, or occupational imbalance [3] . In this respect, it is important to have accurate instruments for identifying potential occupational determinants in order to examine their effects on health outcomes; however, the number of available instruments with which to perform occupation-based research remains low.",

            "text": "Although it is recognized that OB is a very complex term to assess, the literature suggests three different forms of OB as main indicators to measure this complicated subjective experience. Along with maintaining a \"harmonic mix\" within occupations, OB has been conceptualized as the capacity to manage the amount and variation of duties within an occupation while preserving personal preferences, as well as the ability to maintain a strong sense of self-identity through participation in meaningful occupations based on personal values [12] . To our knowledge, there are 23 different instruments for assessing OB [13] [14] [15] [16] . Most of these instruments were initially designed for clinical purposes and not as assessment tools for research. In fact, the available research on OB is based largely on the use of several instruments that were recently developed: the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ) [14] , the Occupational Value with Predefined Items (OVal-pd) [17] , the Satisfaction with Daily Occupations and Balance (SDO-OB) [15] , and the Occupational Balance-Questionnaire (OB-Quest) [16] . The OBQ [14] particularly focuses on assessing the person's satisfaction with the amount and variation of occupations, resulting in a global picture of one's own occupational balance. Unlike the other OB instruments, this questionnaire examines people's own perceptions of their OB, with the advantage of representing a wide variety of everyday occupations rather than focusing on a single category (e.g., housework, rest, work, etc.) [14] . Interestingly, this questionnaire was developed using a holistic approach based on the experiences of occupations as a way of integrating the three dimensions of OB within a broader scope, thereby providing a full assessment of a person's occupational performance. It consists of 13 items that measure the current experience of OB according to the quantity of and variability between the occupations and their significance within one's own personal occupational pattern. Each item can be rated on a scale of 0 (i.e., completely disagree) to 5 (i.e., completely agree). The total score can be obtained by calculating the sum of the respective values of each item, ranging from 0 to 65 points. The OBQ has shown a good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha, 0.94) and test-retest reliability (r s (Spearman rho) = 0.93) [18] , which makes it a reliable instrument to measure OB.",

Briefly, there were discrepancies in most of the items between the two Swedish-to-Spanish translations of the OBQ, although they were mainly due to the use of different words to express the content of the item (e.g., the expressions \"I have balance\" or \"I maintain balance\" in items 1, 4, 8, and 12). Regarding idiomatic issues, the equivalent expressions \"I make enough variety\", \"I have enough variety\", \"I vary sufficiently\", and \"I have enough variation\" used for the translation of the items 5 and 11 were considered as confusing and unusual in Spanish, opting instead for \"I vary enough\" as a more suitable expression. Moreover, regarding semantic issues, one of the major discrepancies arose from the translation of the terms \"energy-giving activities\" and \"energy-taking activities\" included in item 12 into the expressions \"passive and active activities\" and \"sedentary and physical activities\". The authors of the original questionnaire clarified the meaning of these terms and provided examples to improve their understanding and conceptual equivalence. As a result, considering that energy-giving activities do not necessarily have to be passive and that energy-taking activities are not always active, the original terms were maintained as being the most appropriate.",

Overall, problems of semantic congruence and conceptual equivalence were the main reasons for discrepancy when comparing the two back translations of the OBQ. For example, the items that contained statements beginning with \"I have\" (i.e., items 1, 4, 8, and 12) were changed to \"I maintain\", since the term \"maintain\" is considered more appropriate than \"have\" to express balance between different things or aspects in Spanish; however, both terms were included in the pre-final version of the OBQ-E used for the pilot testing to check potential misunderstandings. Moreover, following the technical advice of the authors of the original version, minor changes were made to improve the pre-final version of the questionnaire. The expression \"I have enough variety\" used in items 5 and 11 of the original version was translated from Spanish as \"I vary enough\"; however, the authors of the original OBQ explained that these items had to indicate satisfaction and not only variation, so the initial wording (\"I have enough variety\") was retrieved in both items (i.e., items 5 and 11).",

Table 2 summarizes the analysis of comments and proposals provided by participants that helped in elaborating the definitive Spanish version of the OBQ, i.e., OBQ-E. In general, the contents of the items and instructions were well understood and positively valued by the participants. Regarding the items containing the expressions \"I have balance\" or \"I maintain balance\" for items 1, 4, 8, and 12, no differences were found in the way these were understood. At the suggestion made by the participants who were occupational therapy graduates, the term \"study\" was included as an everyday activity in item 4 to differentiate it from \"work\". This everyday occupation (i.e., study) was not included in the original version. In summary, after discussing all participant comments and proposals, the research team opted to make a few slight modifications to the final version of the OBQ-E. In this version, the instructions at the beginning of the questionnaire provide a more precise definition of the term \"occupation\" and a brief explanation of why all the items should be completed, even if some items seem to be somewhat similar to each other. In addition, the wording of the OBQ-E items was improved in order to clarify that everyday activities should be understood as generic terms. The final version of the OBQ-E was carefully reviewed by the research team to check that statements were idiomatically and semantically well-constructed and to ensure the items reflected an adequate level of cultural understanding. This version preserves the structure (i.e., 13 items) and scoring system (i.e., a six-point response scale) from the original version. Table 2 .

Similarly, the Guttman split-half coefficient was 0.85 (part 1, Cronbach's alpha = 0.72; part 2, Cronbach's alpha = 0.82). The results of the test-retest reliability of the total OBQ-E showed a strong Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.73 (p < 0.001). Table 3 displays the score distribution for the total OBQ-E, GHS/QoL (overall status and related QoL), and SWLS, while Spearman correlation coefficients were estimated for convergent validity. As displayed, the total OBQ-E was positively correlated with GHS/QoL (both overall status and related QoL), showing acceptable correlation values of 0.37 (p < 0.001) and 0.42 (p < 0.001), respectively, and with SWLS r s = 0.54, p < 0.001, which indicated a strong correlation. Regarding the response distribution for the total OBQ-E score, no ceiling or floor effect was detected. With respect to each item, the percentage of cumulative responses in the maximum score value (i.e., ceiling effect) was less than 12.7% for most items, except items 2 (28.8%), 3 (20.6%), and 6 (25.1%). The percentage of cumulative responses in the minimum score value (i.e., floor effect) was less than 1.4% overall.

The findings of the first phase showed that there is a linguistic and conceptual equivalence between the OBQ-E and the original instrument, thereby ensuring good content validity. To improve the clarity and comprehensibility of the final version of the OBQ-E obtained from this first part of the study, a few slight changes were introduced by extending the instructions at the beginning of the questionnaire to facilitate its completion and by rewriting some items using idiomatic expressions or terminology more appropriate to the Spanish context. It should be noted that the cross-cultural adaptation of the questionnaire was conducted in three different samples, including people suffering from fibromyalgia, in order to widen the applicability of the OBQ-E to several segments of the Spanish population. Moreover, the results of the psychometric testing showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity, which indicates that the OBQ-E is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating OB in the Spanish population. To our knowledge, this is the first study ever done to validate a self-reported questionnaire on OB among people from the general population in Spain with a sufficiently large sample size, which reinforces the validity and reliability previously reported for the same questionnaire [14, 31] .",

Moreover, it should be noted that this process was performed according to standardized procedures [32, 33] commonly used for the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of self-reported measures such as ours. This process involved a series of steps including forward and backward translation and their respective expert panel's reviews, as well as the pilot testing of the pre-final version of the questionnaire. This last step entailed the analysis of the content of all the items and instructions (i.e., wording, terminology, scale of answers, etc.) and the participants' feedback, which were used as performance indicators of the OBQ-E. Importantly, the pilot testing constituted a necessary step to verify that the pre-final version of the OBQ-E was suitable to the target population. All items of the final version were satisfactorily comprehensible and relevant to assess OB and the 6-point scale of answers was deemed appropriate. This suggests that the OBQ-E may adequately represent the concept of OB and seems to show good construct validity. After careful review by the expert panel and due consideration by the authors of the original version, the definitive version of the OBQ-E was approved for further psychometric assessment.",

Tested on a sample of 67 healthy people, the original OBQ presented excellent results for internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94), such as for test-retest reliability (r s for total OBQ score = 0.93), without evidence of ceiling or floor effects [14] . The validation of the English version was estimated in a sample of 86 adults and only provided results of the test-retest reliability (r s = 0.74; p = 0.003) [31] . Given that the time interval between the first and second administration of the questionnaire was very different between our study (i.e., 4 months) and the other studies (i.e., a one-week period in the Swedish study and a two-week period in the English study), it could have been reasonably expected that the test-retest coefficient calculated from our data would be lower; however, the estimates remained very close to those found in these studies. Although it may be argued that we did not follow the recommended time interval of 1-4 weeks between the measurements [28, 34] , it should be noted that the timing of administration can considerably vary because of the type of study variables [34] , especially when validating instruments that measure changing variables such as OB. In such cases, the time interval must be a period of time in which it is expected that there will be no changes in the study subjects by ensuring the assessment will be conducted under the same conditions on both occasions [34] ; thus, in terms of reproducibility, our test-retest reliability findings verified that the OBQ-E seems to be a stable instrument capable of producing the same results in the same circumstances [28, 35] . Regarding the results for convergent validity, our study showed that the total score of the OBQ-E was related to several global measures of health (i.e., overall health status and related quality of life as measured by GHS/QoL) and wellbeing (i.e., satisfaction with life as measured by SWLS). These findings, although not directly comparable, are in line with those observed for the total score for the English version of the OBQ, which was positively related to health status measured by Short Form Health Survey-36 Version 2.0 (SF-36v2) and negatively related to stress as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) [31] .",

To overcome the lack of representativeness, this study was enlarged to generate normative values using a wider Spanish population sample with different sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, and educational level) recruited according to the reference population's rates published by the National Statistics Institute (INE) of Spain [36] . Moreover, these data will be used to replicate the psychometric evaluation of the OBQ-E by conducting a more extensive analysis, thereby ensuring the generalization of the findings and enhancing the accuracy and capacity of this scale as a screening instrument of OB for the general population. In the meantime, we believe that the estimates of the present study provide convincing evidence to support the accuracy of OBQ-E as a suitable instrument for research, as well as serve as a methodological basis for the incipient epidemiological research focused on OB [19] [20] [21] .",
