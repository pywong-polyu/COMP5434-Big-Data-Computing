Patient 7, who also did not wear a surgical mask, met patient 1 in the same clinic when patient 1 attended to the outpatient clinic (Figures 1 and 2) . Due to the limited conditions in the early stage of the epidemic, nucleic acid testing lagged behind.

So far, 171 cases had been reported in Qingdao City, which included 118 confirmed cases and 53 asymptomatic infected persons. This cluster, as the first cluster in Qingdao, was of great significance for prevention and control of the epidemic. On the 1 hand, it further confirmed the importance of \"4 early\" (early detection, early identification, early isolation, and early treatment). The timely detection and isolation of cases and their close contacts could effectively prevent further spread of the epidemic, which was the key point of successful control of this cluster. 2 On the other hand, this cluster raised people's awareness of effective measures to prevent and control the epidemic, that is, they should not take it lightly and especially wear masks consciously and avoid eating meals together. 3 Above all, Qingdao successfully controlled several clusters of outbreak, and no community transmission occurred. As shown in our study, it was crucial to detect and isolate cases and trace and quarantine close contacts as early as possible, which was particularly important when PCR results were delayed.",
