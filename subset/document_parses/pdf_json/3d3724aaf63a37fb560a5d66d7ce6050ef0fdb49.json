COVID-19 eliminated some traditional barriers to change leading to efficient solutions, thus highlighting a need to sustain these positive changes into routine practice to develop an adaptive healthcare system receptive to QI.",

This seemingly straightforward set of methods is often difficult to translate into action in daily practice. Many staff undertake improvement work regularly without recognising it as such and therefore miss out on the learning from these efforts [2] . Additionally, when healthcare organisations impose demands on their staff to demonstrate engagement in improvement work, staff may see this as an imposition rather than a learning experience [2] . The onset of COVID-19 has impacted the context in which healthcare staff and teams operate as it necessitated rapid changes to maintain safe and effective care delivery. Despite this, the QI mindset, concepts, and tools are still relevant in the current emergency situation and can allow health systems to learn faster, fail better, and learn safely from small scale improvements [3] .",

During the pandemic, the pace of change has been monumental rather than incremental as it required changes in all aspects of care delivery including clinical care, coordination, education, training, performance measurement and reporting. During this time, there has been an outpouring of support for healthcare staff from the public and plethora of stories have been shared in the media and through social media about staff implementing rapid positive changes during the pandemic. Previous studies have often reported mixed outcomes of QI application while some have even reported no statistically significant association of lean methods with patient satisfaction and health outcomes and a negative association with staff satisfaction [5] . However, during COVID-19 staff have reported an increased use and usefulness of QI tools and methods [6] . Previous literature has often highlighted reluctance of healthcare staff to participate in QI implementation, however during COVID-19 staff were actively involved in, and motivated to implement changes. These changes in practice coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic warranted an investigation of whether healthcare professionals' skills and experience of QI methods were helpful in implementing innovative practices and to explore other factors supporting effective change during COVID- 19. This rapid change in working context is not without its challenges. A concern raised by studies is the grief, anxiety, uncertainty, and stress experienced by healthcare workers across the globe as they work during the pandemic response [7] . On the other hand, COVID-19 has increased flexibility of health systems by removing bureaucratic processes, enabling rapid changes, multidisciplinary, national, and international collaborations, and enhanced communication pathways among different actors in the health system [8] . COVID-19 has been a deeply emotional experience for healthcare staff from a personal and professional perspective. Without trivialising these experiences, the pandemic presents a unique opportunity for researchers to document people's experiences and understand phenomena during a crisis [9] . This also highlighted a gap in research methodologies of QI research being conducted during the pandemic, and the importance of positioning these studies by honouring staff 's overall experience of the pandemic and listening to their voices and stories.",

This necessitated the use of a research method which accommodates the mixing of personal and professional and provides space to participants to voice their emotions while discussing their experience of rapid change. Therefore, the choice of research design for this study is a qualitative narrative approach. Human beings are naturally inclined towards storytelling as we live storied lives and narrative research gives a voice to research participants to share their experiences and reflections in the form of stories [10] . Additionally, it allows participants the fluidity to move between past, present, and future which is essential for the aims of this research [11] . The study aligns with the constructivist pragmatist paradigm as it relies on participant views to make sense of the phenomenon and acknowledges that participants may make sense of the same phenomenon differently depending on social, and contextual factors [12] . The researcher is familiar with the healthcare system and previously conducted research about the development of QI and measurement skills in healthcare staff during a non-crisis time. The study is reported using Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) guidelines [13] .",

Even though research suggests that QI methodologies have played a vital role in rapid implementation of altered care pathways to reduce the transmission of the virus and to ensure high quality care [14] . Health systems struggled to meet the sudden increase in the demand for services without the availability of additional resources. For our research, we are using the stories of change implementation of Irish healthcare staff to understand what motivated them to actively engage in change during this pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Ireland on 26th February 2020 and the country went under the first lockdown on 13th March 2020 leading to substantial reorganisation in the health system guided by the need for ensuring safety of staff and service users while maintaining continuity of care. Since then, the Irish health system has withstood three waves of the pandemic, rapidly changing, and adapting. No published studies have addressed this research area using a narrative approach, and the study outcomes and learning will have implications for health systems across the world.",

Our study showed that the pandemic forced the health system to prioritise and focus on the most important changes rather than trying to take on everything simultaneously. Studies conducted during the pandemic suggest that using proven QI methods, collecting, and regularly reviewing data to inform PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles and rapidly adjusting care pathways not only proved to be useful during the pandemic but can also play a role in reopening services [14] . In this study, few initiatives such as the contact management programme were explicitly driven by the QI methodology and in many sites the ongoing QI activities were halted to focus on emergency response. However, retrospectively, our storytellers were able to see the application and relevance of QI principles in the rapid changes they implemented. Fidelity and authentic application of QI principles is considered important when evaluating success of QI initiatives and many studies have reported finding low levels of QI and PDSA fidelity in practice [16] . During the pandemic, most teams did not explicitly employ authentic QI methods, but relied on implementing and refining solutions based on rapid tests of small-scale change. This raises questions around balancing fidelity against adaptability and flexibility of QI methods depending on the context. This highlights the need for a dialogue between frontline teams and QI educators and healthcare organisations around QI implementation without overburdening staff with documentation.",

However, our study revealed a different phenomenon during the pandemic, where everyone across the health system shared the common goal for staff and patient safety. This not only served as a driver for these changes but also a source staff engagement, motivation, and commitment to the changes. Research also suggests that QI teams that include staff from varied disciplines can draw on multiple resources, skills, and collaborations to conquer challenges more efficiently as compared to teams that are restricted to one discipline [18] . Our study confirmed these findings in the pandemic as well as storytellers discussed the important role of working and learning across disciplines, collaborations and benefiting from variable strengths of team members in implementing rapid changes. Healthcare staff are often unenthusiastic about measurement in QI initiatives even though it is a pillar of the QI methodology [19] . During the pandemic there was a different attitude to measurement, teams were self-motivated to collect data from patients and staff to understand the impact of initiatives and to improve them.

The focus was on completing the task and the position in the hierarchy was less relevant as all team members relied on each other for clinical and emotional supports. Studies exploring contextual factors that influence QI initiatives often cite an organisational culture that supports improvement work and the presence of individuals who drive change as important elements [21] . These elements were observed in this study as well. Our storytellers discussed how certain organisations were slow to respond and hesitant to commit resources to facilitate the rapid changes while others with flatter hierarchies found it easier to adapt. The storytellers also talked about the importance of having champions of change who drive the changes on the wards during the pandemic as well. Leadership played a central role during the pandemic. Studies about leadership practices during the pandemic highlight the importance of practicing distributed leadership and concern for staff physical and psychological safety needs [22] . In our study as well, leadership at all levels emerged as an important influence of rapid changes. Leaders willingly shared power with their teams, empowering them to experiment with innovative ideas which spearheaded the implementation of change and improved staff confidence.",

COVID-19 unshackled healthcare staff to deliver bottom-up continuous improvement at the required pace [23] . Instead of 'slow, staged and incremental' change, COVID required implementation of rapid changes at an unprecedented pace, forcing staff into a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) mindset without them realising it. This has made the staff, teams, and organisations more receptive to change however it is uncertain how much of these changed practices will be retained. COVID accelerated the vision of the future for many teams and organisations with the introduction of more efficient solutions and integration into electronic systems but there is also a risk of some organisations and the health system falling back to old, siloed ways of working. Similarly, the immense stress, grief and burnout healthcare staff have endured in their professional and personal lives needs immediate attention. Staff fatigue and burnout has exacerbated during the pandemic, this coupled with a need for rapid team formation, lack of adequate time for patient and selfcare can lead to safety and quality problems [24] . The next logical step of individuals, teams, organisations, and health systems should be to prioritise the review of these changes and sustain the ones that work and focus on capacity building among all levels of healthcare staff to make sustainable improvements [7] .",

All these elements were observed to varying degrees in our study highlighting the global relevance and importance of the study findings. From a methodological point of view, using a narrative approach and collecting stories allowed the staff that they were being listened to and allowed the researchers to understand the stories more intimately. If the researcher focused too narrowly on experience of rapid change and QI without any regard to emotional impact of the pandemic, it would have represented an incomplete story. It also offered staff more flexibility to reach into past events and share their aspirations for the future in relation to the rapid changes that they implemented. A significant step in learning from these stories was to first understand the professional and personal impact of the pandemic through their emotions and feelings which was facilitated by using a narrative approach. Narrative research and storytelling will be an important tool for healthcare leaders and organisations to listen to staff voices and learn from their experiences during the pandemic. Stories of rapid change and QI can also serve as case studies for QI educators as exemplars of bottom-up, staff driven improvements.",

Many were able to retrospectively identify the relevance of QI principles in the implementation of rapid changes during the pandemic. After the initial shock, grief, and anxiety with the onset of the pandemic, staff employed coping mechanisms and employed a person centric approach to deliver care in an environment which is safe for patients and staff. The pandemic not only accelerated the pace of change but also facilitated it by introducing staff to a new, flexible, and less hierarchical way of working which removed many traditional barriers faced by QI teams. However, to sustain these changes and the improved QI context, there is a need for individuals, teams, organisations, and health systems to reflect, learn and address the risks and challenges that the experience has highlighted.
