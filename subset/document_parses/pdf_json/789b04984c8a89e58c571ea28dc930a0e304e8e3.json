Food insecurity is defined as the inability to access nutritious, safe food as well as feeling not being satisfied with the food consumed [2] . A recent report by the World Food Program shows that in the year 2020, about 137 million people worldwide faced acute food shortages, and this figure is significantly higher compared to the initial estimates before the inception of COVID-19 [3] . The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals set an ambitious goal--to end hunger by 2030. Unfortunately, the pandemic has disrupted this goal, as over 150 million people globally today are stuck in extreme poverty [4] . A report released by the World Bank predicted that nearly 40 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa would be pushed into extreme poverty as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 by the end of 2020 [5] . Malawi remains one the poorest countries in the world with more than half of the country's population living below the poverty line (less than $1.90 per day), and a quarter living in extreme poverty [6] . An increase in the levels of poverty has been historically driven by low agricultural productivity exacerbated by catastrophic weather events and the outbreak of COVID-19 has disproportionately resulted in widespread food insecurity [7] . Perceptions of food security and insecurity in Malawi center around maize production, distribution, and utilization. While Malawi produces a variety of food crops, maize accounts for 90% of the produce. It is the staple food in the country, consumed by the entire population. Other crops such as rice and potatoes only supplement maize consumption. Thus, in a Malawian context, the availability of and access to sufficient maize defines food security [8] .",

            "text": "Given the already existing problems of extreme poverty, hunger, water shortages, and the burden of diseases affecting Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the problems. There is inadequate knowledge regarding the questions of who and how COVID-19 policy measures threaten food security among the urban poor in SSA countries such as Malawi. In Malawi, the first case of COVID-19 was registered on April 2, 2020 [9] . As of January 2021, Malawi had about 14,851 COVID-19 cases and 353 deaths [10] . This included the demise of high profile and widely known politicians as well as Government officials such as Sidick Mia who was the Minister of Transport as well as Lingson Berekanyama who was the Minister of Local Government [7] . As COVID-19 cases and related deaths surged tremendously, the Malawi Government, under the leadership of Lazarus Chakwera, desperately enacted strong restrictive policy measures as a way of containing the spread of the virus. Some of the measures implemented included: (i) reducing the capacity or number of passengers boarding minibuses and taxis (ii) closing bars and marketplaces at eight o'clock in the evening time, and (iii) closure of schools, and social distancing [7] . These measures were deemed to be extremely harsh by the urban dwellers especially those in the informal work force such as street vendors, sex workers, and minibus/tax drivers, as they posed a threat to their livelihoods [10] . Thus, sex workers and minibus drivers across the country took to the street demonstrating against the COVID-19 policy measures. Studies have documented the impact of COVID-19 on health, agriculture, and the economy in general, but little has been researched to explore how COVID-19 policy measures have affected informal and private school teachers in urban Malawi. Therefore, our study addresses this dearth in knowledge by exploring the perceived implications of the COVID-19 policy measures on food insecurity among the low-and unstable income residents in the urban areas of Blantyre in Malawi. Understanding the nexus between COVID-19 measures and food security in the Malawian context is crucial for effective implementation of interventions that can help reduce the risk of being food insecure while preventing further spread of the virus. Food insecurity is linked to child stunting, and this remains a problem in Malawi as evidenced in the central region [11] . Our study contributes to the existing literature by exploring the emerging geographies of food insecurity linked to COVID-19 by answering the following questions: i) What are the perceived experiences of food security amidst COVID-19 policy measures? and ii) How have COVID-19 policy measures affected access to food and food consumption patterns? These questions helped us to address our goal by documenting who and how the COVID-19 policy measures have impacted on food security among the urban residents in Malawi's secondary city of Blantyre.",

Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory unfolds the interconnectedness between the environment and the people it nurtures in the context of accessing basic resources. Thus, the theory stresses that external factors can influence an individual's capacity to do certain actions, and at the same time, the environment can be altered by the individual's activities. External factors can include but are not limited to interpersonal, societal, community, organizational, state, and/or national levels. These are nested within the broader context of culture and policies that reinforce specific values and individual behaviors. Several studies have been conducted globally to examine issues of food security as well as disease burdens using a socioecological framework.",

Likewise, a study that explored the barriers that influence the adoption, sustainability, and consistent use of sanitation facilities using a socio-ecological framework revealed that a complexity of multiple factors ranging from individual, household, community to national levels had implications on the adoption and use of sanitation facilities in rural areas of Ethiopia [13] . In this instance, our application of ecological theory helped us to understand how the societal systems and structures such as government policies on COVID-19 have exacerbated household food insecurity by looking at changes in daily meal consumption as well as people's capacity or ability to access adequate foods.",

More than half of the country's population is living below the poverty line and a quarter is trapped into extreme poverty. Malawi has three main cities: Mzuzu, Lilongwe, and Blantyre, situated in the North, Central, and Southern regions, respectively. This study was conducted in Blantyre city, one of the oldest cities in Malawi [8] . Our study focuses on an urban area for the following reasons. First, there has been an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, which have disproportionately increased urban poverty as many people have lost their jobs due to closure of some industries as well as disruption of business activities [6] . Second, based on our knowledge, the lockdown and many other restrictive measures were mainly applied in urban areas where people survive through working, unlike in rural areas. Given that Blantyre city serves as the second largest commercial city in Malawi, informal employment is the main source of income for the vast majority [8] . Most people are engaged in agricultural activities, and unregistered work such vendors, sex workers, domestic workers, and hawkers [14] .",

Besides, the research assistant is a university graduate and has over 5 years of experience working in qualitative research with local organizations in Malawi. We interviewed fifteen participants (n = 15) comprising of minibus drivers, street vendors, private secondary school teachers, and sex workers. We targeted these participants based on their low socio-economic class status, as most of them have unstable or unreliable sources of income. Participants were drawn from different localities within the city region of Blantyre-namely Bangwe, Chichiri, Chilomoni, and Ndirande south ( Fig. 1 ). For ethical reasons, all the names assigned to participants in this manuscript are pseudonyms. Prior to the actual interviews, participants were asked if they reside in Blantyre city, which served as an inclusion/exclusion criterion for recruiting the participants. Participants' age ranged from 18 to 31 years old, and they had a family size of five members on average. We determined the sample size and the participants based on the principle of maximum variation to collect diverse data [15] . A snowball sampling strategy was used to identify the participants in which a referral was obtained from the first participants to get the next one who shared similar socio-economic characteristics or social network [16] . Interviews were conducted to capture in-depth information regarding their experiences about feeling food insecure as a result of COVID-19 preventative measures.",

The questions adopted and modified revolve around the following key constructs of HFIAS: (i) participants' feelings of uncertainty over food access, ii) perception of having inadequate food, iii) reduction in food intake/consumption, and iv) consequences of the reduction in the intake of food [17] . These constructs were used as a proxy indicator to assess food security. A consent to participate in the study was obtained from each participant verbally in either English or Chichewa languages.",

            "text": "This study employed a purely qualitative inquiry approach by conducting in-depth interviews to explore and better understand how COVID-19 policy measures have impacted food insecurity among urban residents in Blantyre city, southern Malawi. We crafted our discussion of the findings within the lens of Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory by demonstrating how macro-level policy decisions affect people at the household or community levels. Our study findings are consistent with recent studies on the implications of Covid-19 on food security and livelihoods in Nigeria [19] , Kenya and Uganda [20] , and in Ethiopia's capital city of Addis Ababa [21] . Drawing on evidence from Nigeria, many households with low-income status worried about being food insecure as a result of COVID-19 policies such as lockdowns instituted by the government [19] . Accordingly, we support this idea; one of the critical themes that emerged in our study was that participants expressed a great grief of worry about having no or little access to income and other resources following the imposition of the COVID-19 preventive measures. Our finding agrees with a recent study conducted in Malawi which revealed that almost 87.78% of the population were afraid and worried of going hungry as a result of COVID-19 outbreak while expressing no concern about catching the virus [22] . Our study shows that residents who are engaged in informal and unstable sources of income-such as street vendors, sex workers and minibus drivers-were badly hit by these measures to earn reasonable amount of income. As a result, they struggle to provide adequate food for their families during the pandemic period. Most of the participants were unable to work and do other business activities as usual for their daily livelihoods due to the restrictive COVID-19 policy measures such as banning close contact, closing bars and nightclub sand marketplaces, shutting down schools, and reducing the number of passengers riding in minibuses. These policy measures provided a hostile environment for socio-economic activities by disrupting normal business activities, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the residents to food insecurity. Our findings are also consistent with a previous study about the geographies of food access which revealed that informal workers in urban areas of Blantyre were more vulnerable to food insecurity as a result of their poor or low socioeconomic status [8] . Some teachers from private schools reported to have lost their jobs or were not being paid during the school closure, and this had serious implications on their daily livelihoods. Thus, sex workers, vendors, and minibus drivers faced similar fates, as their income levels dwindled due to disruption of the business activities. Given that the urban life depends on income, lack of financial and other resources has resulted in severe complications for the informal workers to afford buying adequate nutritious food for health as well as deteriorating their livelihoods.",

Skipping meals, eating less than the normal size, and consuming less nutritious food can result in malnutrition, which increases risk for illness. Thus, advancement in such coping strategies puts the lives of some Blantyre residents, especially the poor, at substantial risk of suffering from deficiency diseases, stunted growth, and increased deaths. Our claim accordingly aligns with the study on the \"Early Food Insecurity Impacts of COVID 19\" researched in Vermont, United States [23] despite the differences in the geographical context between these two countries. The study projected increased healthy related diseases if the Vermont population continues consuming poor dietary food as coping strategies [23] . Likewise, the COVID-19 outbreak exacerbated food insecurities among the urban dwellers in Blantyre city.",

            "text": "Our study shows that the COVID-19 policy measures, put in place to avert the spread of the virus, have ironically brought devastating implications on the already vulnerable people for them to access basic needs such as adequate food and other means of livelihoods in selected urban areas of Blantyre in Malawi. Some of these policy measures include closure of schools, early shutdown, and closures of nightclubs/bars as well as reducing the capacity of passengers boarding minibuses or taxis. Using our understanding of ecological theory, the implementation of these COVID-19 policy measures by the authorities has heavily affected the socio-economic activities of some Blantyre residents and their livelihoods in general. Our study reveals lowering in the income levels of the already vulnerable residents whose means of livelihoods are unstable or unreliable. The vulnerable residents as identified in the study included sex workers, minibus drivers, private school teachers, and street vendors. Closure of schools deprived the private school teachers from receiving salaries while some even lost their jobs. These challenges paralyzed Blantyre residents from securing adequate and nutritional food for their families, rendering them food insecure. When respondents were asked if they had access to adequate food, most of them overwhelmingly expressed worry as well as an inability to access or buy enough food to feed their families due to having little or no money. This has forced participants to eat less nutritious food as well as skip meals thereby risking their health, safety, and well-being. Despite Malawi's historical record of being vulnerable to food insecurity, we validate our understanding that COVID-19 policy measures have further aggravated food insecurities among the urban poor. We therefore suggest that the Malawi government should continue and expand its provisional cash transfer program by targeting the most vulnerable population in urban areas so as to alleviate the risk of food insecurity while containing further spread of the virus. There is also a need for the government to engage all stakeholders and work collaboratively with people at local levels in making and adjusting far-reaching policymaking decisions.",
