The monthly data is gathered during January 2008 to December 2019 and is divided into two sets. The first set is the data from January 2008 to December 2018 for the modelling by the method of decomposition, Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing method and the Box-Jenkins. The second is the monthly data in 2019 for comparing the performance of the forecasting models via the criteria of the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that, in term of forecasting, the multiplicative decomposition is the most accurate technique for the short-term (3 months) forecasting period with the lowest MAPE and RMSE of 1.04% and 42,054.29 international tourists, respectively.",

Thailand shares the border with Myanmar and Laos to the north, with Laos and Cambodia to the east, with the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia to the south and with the Andaman Sea and Myanmar to the west. There are 76 provinces and Bangkok is the capital. The popular provinces are Phuket, Krabi, Chiang Mai, Nan, Buriram, Maehongson, Ayutthaya also Bangkok. Thailand encompasses diverse ecosystems, cultures, also, religious backgrounds. This diversity enchants tourists both Thais and foreigners. The famous tourist attractions are, for example, beaches, islands, floating markets, temples, mountains, waterfalls, national park, full moon parties and civilization of the cities. According to the data from [1] , Fig. 1 clearly displays the increasing trend of both the number of foreign tourists (in million people) entering to Thailand and their expenditures (in billion baht). The percentage increase of foreign tourist arrivals of 2019 to 2008 is 172.88%. This may be due to the political factors in Thailand that are likely to improve which affect investors' confidence, the recovery of the economy of Thailand and other countries in the world, organizing an illegal tour, the low-cost airlines, the more direct flight, or even an increase in inflation rate according to oil prices.",

It can be seen that the income from the tourism industry varies with the number of foreign tourists entering Thailand. The Thai government realizes the importance of the tourism industry as evidenced by the tourism action plan of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) which has four goals [2] . One of those 14 is aiming to be the popular tourist destination for sustainability and still generating the highest tourism income in the world top 7. Hence, there are several strategies to build the international market, i.e., adjusting the image of the Thai tourism brand, boosting consumer spending, and expanding the market base of special interests such as medial and wellness tourism, sport Tourism, marriage celebration, wedding anniversary including traveling to visit relatives. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak situation, countries all over the world have implemented travel restrictions to control the outbreak within the country. For the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on international travel, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has reported that in the first quarter of 2020, the world's international tourism has declined 22% and is expected for the full year of 2020 to drop by 60% from the previous year. In Thailand, the pursuant to the Declaration of Emergency Situations in all areas of the Kingdom of Thailand starting on 26 March 2020 including the announcement of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) to temporarily ban the inbound passenger flights result in no foreign tourists traveling to Thailand since April throughout September 2020 [1, 3] .",

[10] proposed the decomposition-ensemble approach to enhance the predictive accuracy of tourism demand forecasting of Hong Kong from nine sources: mainland China, Korea, Japan, the USA, Philippines Singapore, Australia, the UK, and Thailand. The competing models are the na\u00efve, ARIMA and the artificial neural network (ANN) models. Hwandee and Phumchusri [11] aimed to forecast the international tourist arrivals to Thailand from 5 major countries: mainland China, Malaysia, Korea, and Russia during Jan 2013 to September 2018. In terms of the mean absolute percentage error, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average outperformed the multiple regression model with several important economic factors: income, price, exchange rate, and seasonal effect. Additionally, Rahman and Lee [12] presented the artificial neural network forecasting with the missing values imputation. The accuracy performance was validated by the mean absolute error and root mean square error of two forecasting methods which are SARIMA and ANN. Based on the imputation method of the decomposition, SARIMA performed better. In the other way, based on the imputation method of the spatial weighting method, ANN outperformed. Lately, in 2021, Janjua et al. [13] adopted the univariate time series forecasting method of tourist arrival based on the data from January 1991 to March 2020. The ARIMA (12, 1, 12) was suggested to forecast the international arrival from April 2020 to December 2020. The forecasts showed that Thailand will face significant negative zone arrival of international tourists due to the COVID-19 pandemic crises, which adversely affect Thailand's economic due to the shortfall of international tourist arrivals.",

In the view of forecasting performance, the short-, medium-, and long-term forecasts are focused. The multiplicative decomposition is superior for all terms of forecasting followed by Holt-Winters and Box-Jenkins. This point shows that the best model does not always support the superior forecasting. The principle of time series forecasting is that the forecast model is created by the pattern or the behavior of the past data. This is the main reason of selecting the time series before the emergence of corona virus pandemic. The limitation of this study is that the forecasting models are valid only for Thailand during the specific period of time. As a result, the number of foreign tourists has changed greatly since February 2020 [1] (see Fig. 8 ) and more importantly this affects the component of time series data. This severely affects tourism revenue which is the major contributor to the GDP and economics of Thailand and exactly all over the world. The government stakeholders including the private sectors should find policies or measures whether the campaign of getting the Covid-19 vaccine shots to build up the immune response, or the epidemic prevention measures, or the policy of maintaining the tourist attractions to encourage foreign tourists to return to Thailand under normal conditions.",

The performances of the model are separated into model and forecasting based on the criterial of the lowest of MAPE and RMSE.
