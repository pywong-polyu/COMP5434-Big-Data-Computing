            "text": "The widespread and versatile prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas proteins) constitute powerful weapons against foreign nucleic acids. Recently, the single-effector nuclease Cas12a that belongs to the type V CRISPR-Cas system was added to the Cas enzymes repertoire employed for gene editing purposes. Cas12a is a bilobal enzyme composed of the REC and Nuc lobe connected by the wedge, REC1 domain and bridge helix (BH). We generated BH variants and integrated biochemical and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) studies to elucidate the role of the BH for the enzymatic activity and conformational flexibility of Francisella novicida Cas12a. We demonstrate that the BH impacts the trimming activity and mismatch sensitivity of Cas12a resulting in Cas12a variants with improved cleavage accuracy. smFRET measurements reveal the hitherto unknown open and closed state of apo Cas12a. BH variants preferentially adopt the open state. Transition to the closed state of the Cas12a-crRNA complex is inefficient in BH variants but the semi-closed state of the ternary complex can be adopted even if the BH is deleted in its entirety. Taken together, these insights reveal that the BH is a structural element that influences the catalytic activity and impacts conformational transitions of FnCas12a.",

(ii) In the expression and maturation phase, the CRISPR locus is transcribed and the resulting precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) is further processed to yield the mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (7) . (iii) In the final interference stage, the binary complex consisting of Cas protein(s) and crRNA binds invading DNA or RNA with sequence complementarity to the crRNA.

            "text": "The single effector nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a garnered widespread attention as genome editing tools (9-13) because (i) Cas9 as well as Cas12a can be easily programmed to target a specific DNA sequence by complementary crRNAs and (ii) single effector nucleases act independently during the interference stage. Cas12a (formerly Cpf1) is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease classified as class 2 type V-A Cas protein (3, 14, 15) . Cas12a, in contrast to other Cas systems, is able to self-process the pre-crRNA (16) . Programmed with a crRNA, Cas12a recognizes and binds a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the target DNA with the sequence 5 -TTTV-3 (V = G/C/A) (17, 18) . The single active site for DNA cleavage resides in the RuvC domain, which cleaves the non-target strand (NTS) faster than the target strand (TS) resulting in a sequential cut thereby creating a double strand break with staggered ends (8, (19) (20) (21) (22) . The NTS is further shortened due to the trimming activity of Cas12a. After cleavage, Cas12a releases the PAM-distal part of the target DNA but remains bound to the PAMproximal product (23, 24) . This cleavage event is termed 'cis-cleavage' of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). However, Cas12a possesses also a trans-cleavage activity that is acti-vated upon dsDNA cleavage. Here, a Cas12a-crRNA complex unspecifically binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and degrades it (25) . The trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a has been repurposed to establish quantitative platforms for nucleic-acid detection (26) (27) (28) (29) .",

The wedge domain (WED I, WED II, WED III, PI (PAM interacting)) operates as hinge between the two lobes ( Figure 1A ) (2, 17, 30, 31) . At the 5 -end, the crRNA forms a pseudoknot structure that is anchored in the WED domain and additionally forms an extensive network of interactions with the RuvC and REC2 domains (2, (30) (31) (32) . The 3 -end of the crRNA encodes the sequence complementary to the target strand and interacts with the target DNA thereby forming an R-loop. Structural studies showed that Nuc and REC lobes undergo a closed-to-open transition upon loading of the DNA target in the crRNA-Cas12a complex (2, 17) . The bridge helix (BH) is a central helix in the protein that structurally links the REC and the Nuc lobe. For Cas12a from Acidaminococcus sp. (AsCas12a) it has been shown that amino acids in the BH interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the target DNA strand and play a role in the heteroduplex recognition of crRNA and target DNA (31) . A tryptophan residue at the end of the BH (W958 in As-Cas12a, W971 in Cas12a from Francisella novicida (Fn-Cas12a)) is anchored in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the REC2 domain ( Figure 1B /C). This interaction stabilizes the closed and active conformation of Cas12a (31, 32) . The crRNA has a parallel orientation to the BH and also connects the Nuc and the REC lobe ( Figure 1A ). In this context, the question remains if and how the BH influences the catalytic activity of Cas12a and whether the integrity of the BH as well as the anchoring in the REC lobe is required to ensure efficient cleavage activity of Cas12a. Furthermore, given the central position of the BH, the question arises whether the BH influences the conformational transitions of the enzyme.",

            "text": "Here, we performed a mutational analysis of the BH and evaluated the cleavage activity and cleavage accuracy of a variety of BH variants. Cas12a is still catalytically active when the alpha-helical nature of the BH is disrupted or the anchoring of the BH in the REC lobe is prevented. However, mutations in the BH affect the trimming activity and decrease the mismatch tolerance of Cas12a. We employed single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements on diffusing molecules to follow the conformational transitions of FnCas12a and the BH variants during their catalytic cycle making use of sitespecifically labeled Cas12a. We show that Cas12a in its apo state exists in both an open and closed conformation. The open conformation is preferred if the BH is not accurately anchored in the REC domain. Nevertheless, the crRNA induces the closure of the enzyme even if the anchoring of the BH is prevented or the BH is removed from the enzyme most likely because the adjacent helix 1 of the RuvC domain acts in concert with the BH and can ensure structural integrity. We demonstrate furthermore that the cr-RNA (independent of the BH) plays an essential role to direct the conformational transitions to reach a cleavagecompetent state. A third, semi-closed conformation has to be adopted to allow the binding of target DNA. However, the stabilizing effect of the crRNA is sufficient to adopt the semi-closed state in all BH variants. Taken together, these data indicate that the BH is a structural element that influences the cleavage accuracy and trimming activity, increases the specificity of Cas12a and enables the apo enzyme to adopt the closed state thereby promoting efficient crRNA loading.",

Cas12a variants (E1006A (dCas12a), I960P, W971A, W971D, W971K, W971F, Y953-K969 ( BH), Y953-W971 ( BH)) were generated via site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Table S1 ). Protein expression was performed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were grown at 37 \u2022 C. At an optical density (600 nm) of 0.4, the cells were transferred to 18 \u2022 C. Protein expression was induced with IPTG (1 mg/l) at an OD 600 = 0.6. Cells were further incubated at 18 \u2022 C overnight. After harvesting the cells (10 min, 6000 g, 4 \u2022 C), they were resuspended in 20 ml Tris-Cas-A buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5% (v/v) glycerol). 3 l Universal Nuclease Mix (Pierce\u2122) and 1 tablet of cOmplete\u2122 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) were added and the cells were lysed via sonication.

The tryptophan at position 971 is accommodated in the hydrophobic pocket of the REC2 domain (31,32) ( Figure 1C ). This residue was mutated to a range of amino acids with different chemical properties (W971A, W971D, W971K, W971F), e.g. amino acids that differ in size and charge, to investigate whether the anchoring of the bridge helix is important for the structural integrity and catalytic function of Cas12a. Additionally, we created a variant in which the BH is deleted ( BH, Y953-K969, deletion of 17 amino acids). All variants could be purified to homogeneity (Supplementary Figure S1 ) and exhibited comparable stability as assessed by a thermal shift assay (Supplementary Figure  S2) .",

The BH variant was the least active mutant with only 15% of target DNA being cleaved as compared to 91% cleaved by the WT enzyme after 60 min ( Figure 1E ). EMSAs revealed that the BH variant is not impaired in DNA binding (Supplementary Figure S4) suggesting that the reduced cleavage activity is solely caused by a catalytic defect of the variants. Variants W971A and W971F are not impaired in their activity. The I960P variant was only marginally less active than the WT. Variants W971D and W971K remained active and showed \u223c77% of the WT activity. A detailed study of the reaction kinetics was performed at 28 \u2022 C to be able to follow the reaction with a good time resolution (Supplementary Figure S3) . Here, cleavage products appeared already after 2 min for the WT enzyme. Variants W971K, W971D as well as I960P cleaved the DNA considerably slower than the WT.

To follow the cleavage reaction on both strands simultaneously, a Cy3 and Cy5 label was attached to the 5 -end of the non-target strand (NTS) and the target strand (TS), respectively. Cleavage products were resolved on a denaturing sequencing gel in order to analyze cleavage products with single-nucleotide resolution ( Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure S5 and S6). In case of the WT enzyme, a predominant cleavage product is visible and two minor products with one and two additional nucleotides are detected. In contrast, the variants show mainly longer cleavage products (up to 5 nt longer than the main product produced by the WT). Only the W971A and W971F variants generated products as short as the WT. Notably, this is not the main product of these variants. Kinetic studies using the WT enzyme (Supplementary Figure S5C , E) showed that also the WT produces longer NTS cleavage products at the start of the reaction. Over time, the long cleavage products are shortened to yield the main product. This is the result of a trimming activity that shortens the NTS by up to 4 nt (19) . After cleavage of the target DNA, the PAM distal part of the DNA is released but Cas12a remains bound to the PAM proximal part (24) (here labeled with Cy3 at the NTS). While still bound, Cas12a further shortens the NTS via the trimming activity. Trimming of the NTS was also observed for the W971A and W971F variants yielding two or three main cleavage products including the final cleavage product observed for the WT (Supplementary Figure S6 ). However, trimming of the NTS by the mutated enzymes is less efficient as the final product is not the dominant product even after prolonged reaction times. In contrast, all other variants never yielded the final cleavage product of the WT enzyme. This suggests that variants I960P, W971D, W971K and BH lack the trimming activity altogether. The cleavage pattern for the TS is the same for all Cas12a variants and shows one main cleavage product and two additional products 1 nt longer and 1 nt shorter than the main product. Our data are in agreement with previous studies that reported the imprecise cleavage of the TS by AsCas12a and FnCas12a (19, 20) .",

            "text": "BH variants of SpyCas9 have been shown to be more or less sensitive to mismatches between crRNA and target DNA (41, 42) . We tested whether mismatches influence the cleavage specificity of WT FnCas12a and the BH variants in an additional set of cleavage assays. To this end, we used substrates that carried a single mismatch at position 2 (MM 2, mismatch in the seed region), 10 (MM 10) or 20 (MM 20) of the R-loop ( Figure 3A) . WT FnCas12a showed a moderate sensitivity to substrates that carried a mismatch at position 2 or 10 but the MM 20 substrate was cleaved equally well as the fully complementary substrate (MM 0). A mismatch at position 2 led to a decrease in cleavage efficiency for the wildtype and to a similar extent in all BH variants of Fn-Cas12a (Figure 3 B,C) . The exception is the W971F variant that was significantly less active when using the MM 2 substrate as compared to the wildtype whereas this mutant was equally active as the WT when using the MM 0 substrate. All BH variants were very sensitive to a mismatch at position 10. Additionally, BH variants W971D and W971K did discriminate against a substrate with a mismatch at position 20. Notably, in case of FnCas12a variants, the relative reduction in cleavage efficiencies was more pronounced when using mismatched substrates as compared to fully complementary substrates (e.g. W971D reduction to 50% of WT level in case of MM 0 as compared to 3.6% in case of MM 10). Taken together, these data show that the target selectivity of FnCas12a is modulated by the BH.",

However, no structural information is available for the apo Cas12a enzyme and for the pre-crRNA-Cas12a complex in the absence of a DNA target. In order to follow the conformational transitions of Cas12a and to evaluate whether the BH mutations affect the conformation of Cas12a, we performed smFRET measurements on diffusing molecules. To determine relative intramolecular distances in WT Cas12a, we site-specifically incorporated the unnatural amino acid para-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF) via the Amber-suppressor strategy (33, 34) . We placed the label either in the WED domain (K647AzF), the Nuc (T1222AzF) or REC lobe (D470AzF) yielding the following variants: Cas12a K647AzF/T1222AzF (termed Cas12a WED-Nuc ), Cas12a D470AzF/K647AzF (referred to Cas12a WED-REC ) and Cas12a D470AzF/T1222AzF (referred to Cas12a REC-Nuc ) (Supplementary Figure S7 ). Coupling of the fluorescent dyes DyLight550 and DyLight650 to the azide group of AzF was performed via the Staudinger-Bertozzi ligation (36) (Supplementary Figure S8 ). We used a stochastic labeling approach that yields proteins that carry a donor and acceptor dye pair or proteins that carry only the donor or acceptor. Cas12a molecules that carry the donor-acceptor pair can be spectroscopically sorted based on the (PIE) excitation scheme (49) Figure S7) . EMSAs and activity assays demonstrated that all variants were able to bind nucleic acids and to cleave the target DNA ( Supplementary Figures S4 and S9) .",

            "text": "First, we used the Cas12a WED-Nuc and Cas12a WED-REC variants to follow conformational changes of Cas12a along the WED-Nuc lobe axis and the WED-REC lobe axis, respectively. To this end, we performed smFRET measurements using (i) the apo enzyme, (ii) the binary complex composed of Cas12a plus pre-crRNA, (iii) the binary complex composed of Cas12a plus mature crRNA, (iv) the ternary complex (Cas12a + mature crRNA + dsDNA target) and (v) a ternary complex loaded with a single-stranded target. The Cas12a WED-REC and Cas12a WED-Nuc variants showed a single low FRET population for the apo enzyme, the binary and both variants of the ternary complex, respectively ( Figure 4B ). This indicates that the distance between WED and Nuc domain and the WED domain and REC lobe do not significantly change when Cas12a progresses through its activity cycle. This is in agreement with structural studies (2,21) and molecular dynamics simulations (50) , in which only marginal changes in distances between these positions can be detected (Supplementary Figure S7) . Using the Cas12a Nuc-REC variant, a low FRET population with a FRET efficiency of 0.12 (\u00b1 0.04) and a high FRET population (E = 0.97 \u00b1 0.01) can be detected for the nucleicacid free Cas12a. This indicates that the apo form can adopt a closed and open conformation with the majority of the molecules (68 \u00b1 7%) found in the closed state. Addition of crRNA to the protein shifts the molecules to the high FRET population (84 \u00b1 2%). This effect is noticeable after the addition of mature crRNA, but also upon addition of pre-crRNA (Supplementary Figure S10A) . Cleavage assays using samples that contained pre-crRNA or the mature crRNA (Supplementary Figure S10C ,D) yielded comparable cleavage efficiencies. This demonstrates that the pre-crRNA is processed by Cas12a as only the mature cr-RNA allows loading and cleavage of dsDNA (16) . Even though we cannot rule out that the pre-crRNA is partly processed during the incubation and single-molecule measurement time, the data nevertheless indicate that the pre-crRNA/Cas12a complex does not give rise to an additional FRET population and hence, it can be assumed that the pre-crRNA/Cas12a complex does not adopt a distinct conformation. This is in agreement with structural data (2, 21) . Notably, the formation of the binary complex is dependent on the crRNA concentration added to Cas12a underscoring the observation that the high FRET population reflects the binary complex (Supplementary Figure S11A) . crRNAbinding therefore induces the closure of the protein reflecting the closed state of Cas12a (2) (Supplementary Figure  S7) . Upon loading of the DNA, a third population with a FRET efficiency of 0.82 (\u00b1 0.02) emerges. This indicates that the protein re-opens thereby providing enough space for the binding of target DNA. The relative number of molecules in the middle FRET population increased while the number of molecules that adopt the high FRET state decreased with increasing target DNA concentration indicating that the loading of DNA triggers the emergence of the middle FRET population (Supplementary Figure S11B) . The measurements were also performed with the catalytically inactive variant of Cas12a (dCas12a, Supplementary Figure S12 ). Here, highly comparable data were obtained. This demonstrates that the medium FRET population corresponds to the ternary complex with bound target DNA and that the conformations of the ternary complex before cleavage (dCas12a) and after cleavage (WT Cas12a) of the target DNA do not significantly differ. Interestingly, loading is only moderately efficient and \u223c30-50% of the proteins loaded with a crRNA remain in the closed FRET state (Supplementary Figure S11B) . Additionally, we probed a ternary complex that lacks the NTS. Cas12a can process the TS even in the absence of the NTS (Figure 4 , Supplementary Figure S13 ) (20) . Omitting the NTS, the high FRET population drops to 9% (in the presence of NTS: 40%) and the middle FRET population increases to 60% indicating that loading of the sterically less demanding single-stranded TS is very efficient allowing a successful transition from the binary to the ternary complex. The FRET efficiency of the middle FRET population, however, does not significantly change suggesting that loading of the TS is sufficient to induce the opening of DNA cleft. Taken together, we show that the smFRET measurements re-capitulate the structural data of the binary complex (closed state) and the opening movement of Cas12a upon target DNA loading (semiclosed state). A single-stranded TS is sufficient and more efficient to induce the transition into the semi-closed state. Moreover, we can assess the structural state of the apo enzyme and show that apo Cas12a can adopt an open and closed conformation.",

For all BH variants, low, middle and high FRET populations were detected. However, differences in the relative distribution of these states were observed. In the apo state, all W971 variants showed a shift towards the low FRET population suggesting that a destabilization or modulation of the anchoring of the BH in the REC lobe increases the probability to adopt the open state. Interestingly, in case of the BH variant, the FRET efficiencies of the respective populations did not change and high and low FRET states were almost equally populated. As the residue W971 is still present in this variant, we hypothesized that this might be sufficient to maintain the opened and closed state. In order to test this hypothesis, we made use of the so-called BH in which not only residues 953-969 of the BH but in addition residues 970/971 were deleted resulting in a Cas12a variant fully devoid of the BH. Here, the relative distribution of the FRET states and the FRET efficiencies were not significantly altered (Supplementary Figure S14) . For all Cas12a variants, no dynamic switching between the open and closed state was observed during the millisecond timescale that we capture with our measurements. While a shift towards the low FRET population was observed for the W971 variants, the defined structural states represented by the low and high FRET population can still be adopted by the BH deletion variants. We therefore suggest that the BH is not the main structural element that defines the open and closed state of Cas12a.",

In contrast, variant W971F and the BH variant readily formed the closed state upon crRNA addition even at low crRNA concentrations (Supplementary Figure S11A) . If a variant preferentially adopted the open state in the apo form, the loading of crRNA was inefficient. This suggests that for a subset of BH variants binding of the crRNA or the conformational transition from the open to the closed state is impaired resulting in reduced amounts of the binary complex (Supplementary Figure S15) . In contrast, formation of the ternary complex is efficiently induced upon target DNA addition in all BH variants ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S11B) implying that the mutations in the BH do not affect the loading of the target DNA.

            "text": "The single effector nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a of the CRISPR-Cas type II system form a characteristic bilobal structure comprised of the REC and Nuc lobe, which are connected by the bridge helix. In Cas9, the BH reaches deep into the REC lobe and contacts directly or indirectly the target DNA, crRNA and tracrRNA (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) . An argininerich patch in the BH orientates the seed nucleotides of the crRNA to render them solvent-exposed. Thus, the crRNA can readily base-pair with the target DNA strand. Consequently, mutations in the BH of Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) influence RNA and target DNA binding, mismatch sensing and RNA-loop stability (41, 42, 56, 57) . Several SpyCas9 BH variants showed increased specificity rendering them more suitable for genetic engineering purposes (41) . The BH of FnCas12a also connects the REC and Nuc lobe but does not insert as deeply into the REC lobe as observed for SpyCas9 (2, 21) . The BH of FnCas12a is not in close contact with the target DNA or crRNA and only contacts the sugar-phosphate backbone of the crRNA (31) . The seed region of the crRNA is arranged by the REC1 domain instead. Nonetheless, our mutational analysis shows that the BH of Cas12a contributes to the catalytic activity and specificity of the enzyme. Deletion of the entire BH severely reduced the catalytic activity. Similarly, a BH deletion variant of SpyCas9 was inactive (58) . This shows that the BH is an essential segment for both enzymes. Additionally, we evaluated whether the helical nature of the BH or the anchoring of the BH in the REC domain is a pre-requisite for full catalytic activity. Introduction of a proline residue at position 960 in the BH resulted in a reduced NTS-trimming activity showing that the helical nature is required to reach the full activity spectrum of Cas12a. Disturbing the anchoring of the BH in the REC domain affected the cleavage reaction rate and/or trimming activity. Charged amino acids led to a reduction of the DNA cleavage rate. Additionally, the trimming activity of Cas12a was lost. In contrast, an alanine substitution did not affect the cleavage and slightly reduced the trimming activity. Replacement of W971 by a phenylalanine residue only marginally influenced the cleavage activity. Trimming of the NTS was only slightly affected. The differing effect of the mutations can be rationalized from a biochemical perspective: charged residues cause a repulsion of the BH from the hydrophobic pocket in the REC2 domain whereas the small and uncharged alanine substitution might still fit in the pocket. Phenylalanine is also a hydrophobic residue and can most likely functionally replace tryptophan. Consequently, the variant is only mildly affected. Similar to some variants evaluated in this work, Swarts et al. identified Cas12a mutants that exhibited reduced trimming activity (e.g. R918, D920, S1083, R1218, D1255, D1227). However, these variants are constituting the active site or are in close contact to the catalytic residues. This is not the case for the variants tested in this study. Notably, all BH variants showed a higher selectivity in DNA targeting. In contrast to the wildtype, all BH variants did not tolerate substrates with a mismatch at position 10 of the R-loop. Additionally, BH variants W971K and W971D did discriminate against substrates with a mismatch at position 20. Swarts et al. tested the cleavage efficiency of FnCas12a using linearized plasmid substrate variants with mismatches to the crRNA (2) . These experiments showed that a mismatch at position 2 prevented cleavage of the DNA while a mismatch at position 10 and 20 resulted in approximately 50% and 100% cleavage, respectively. The results for mismatch position 10 and 20 are in agreement with our data. However, we still observe DNA target cleavage with the MM 2 substrate (65% relative to the MM 0 substrate). Possibly, the nature of the substrate (linearized plasmid versus short dsDNA) causes these differences. Strohkendl et al. showed that mismatches throughout the R-loop slow down binding of AsCas12a to the DNA (19) . As R-loop formation is the rate-limiting step for cleavage, the reduced rate of R-loop formation impacts the substrate cleavage rate. In case of AsCas12a, cleavage rates were most dramatically de-creased when a substrate with mismatches at position 2, 4 or 16 was used while mismatches at position 10, 18 and 21 only led to a slight decrease in cleavage rate. Our data therefore reveal differences in the relative tolerance of AsCas12a and FnCas12a towards mismatches throughout the R-loop (e.g. a mismatch at position 2 was well tolerated by FnCas12a but led to an almost 100-fold reduction in cleavage rate in case of AsCas12a). In case of SpyCas9, introduction of a double proline substitution in the BH led to an increase in specificity. However, these effects can be rationalized by the stabilizing role of the BH in R-loop formation in SpyCas9 (41, 42) . The BH of FnCas12a only contacts the phosphate backbone of the crRNA especially in the pseudoknot region (2) . We therefore hypothesize that the BH stabilizes the Rloop in an indirect fashion. Moreover, destabilization of the BH anchoring seems to increase the mismatch sensitivity. Given that the W971K/D variants also showed a reduced cleavage and trimming activity it seems plausible that the anchoring of the BH is essential for the stable formation of the R-loop.",

Strikingly, we found that the BH length expands upon ternary complex formation. Notably, structural changes in the BH occur in tandem with structural changes in the adjacent helix 1 of the RuvC domain ( Figure 6A-D) . The re-positioning of the binding pocket in the REC domain requires the positional shift of tryptophan 971 by 8.7\u00c5 to allow docking of the residue in its binding pocket also in the ternary complex ( Figure 6A, B) . To promote this movement of W971, the residue has to be released from helix 1 as observed in ternary complex structures that show that helix 1 is shortened by six residues thereby releasing W971 into a flexible loop that connects the BH and helix 1. Concomitantly, the BH is extended by approximately two residues and four residues in FnCas12a and LbCas12a, respectively. Hence, these two helices act in concert as 'suspension helices' to compensate for the large conformational changes of the REC domains upon transition to the ternary complex. Part of the BH is not resolved in the binary complex structure indicating that this is a flexible region in the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Furthermore, a conserved lysine residue (K978 in FnCas12a) in helix 1 contacts the backbone of the target DNA in the ternary complex. Due to a shift in the position of helix 1 upon transition to the ternary complex, K978 is ideally orientated for the interaction with the DNA. While K978 is positioned in the middle of helix 1 in the binary complex, it is shifted to the N-terminal end of the re-modelled helix 1 and not released into the flexible loop in the ternary complex. This indicates that the integration of K978 into helix 1 is essential to function as DNA-contacting base. It seems likely that some of the mutations introduced into the BH of FnCas12a affect the tandem movement of the BH and helix 1 and consequently, DNA contacts and the position of the REC domains are slightly altered. This might include contacts of helix 1 residues with the phosphate backbone of the target DNA in the R-loop (e.g. K978) (2) . In turn, this might have a negative impact on the R-loop formation process and thereby increases the mismatch sensitivity of Fn-Cas12a. Altogether, these disruptions most likely cause the Binding of (pre-)crRNA induces the closure of the enzyme. In order to bind a single-stranded or double-stranded target DNA, Cas12a re-opens again giving rise to a medium FRET population in single-molecule FRET measurements. The bridge helix (BH, in green) is a central structural element in Cas12a that connects the REC and Nuc lobe with the tethering residue tryptophan 971 (shown in red) that anchors the BH in a hydrophobic pocket in the REC lobe. The length of the BH (green), the adjacent helix 1 (gray) and the interconnecting linker (black) as well as the position of W971 re-adjust upon transition from the binary to the ternary complex (see insets). Mutations in the BH or replacement of W971 affect trimming activity of Cas12a and influence the equilibrium between open and closed state of Cas12a. observed trimming defect. For example, formation of an extended BH in the ternary complex might be prevented by the I960P variant that is located in the middle of the BH. However, while it is assumed that a proline breaks a helix, we cannot rule out that the introduction of a proline can be accommodated by the flexible nature of the BH. Similarly, the absence of the entire BH completely disrupts the coupled helical restructuring events. In addition to repulsion of the W971D or W971K residues from the hydrophobic binding pocket, these substitutions might also affect the formation of the extended BH as position 971 re-positions to the very beginning of the loop (next to the end of the BH). Notably, the tandem helix arrangement is conserved in all Cas12a variants studied so far (Supplementary Figure S17) .",

            "text": "Crystal and cryo-EM structures (2, 17, 20, 21, (30) (31) (32) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) as well as smFRET studies (20, 23, 59) indicated that not only the protein itself but also the bound nucleic acids undergo substantial conformational changes. Hence, we employed smFRET measurements to follow the movement of the REC and Nuc lobe of Cas12a WT and the BH variants. Our data faithfully replicate the structural states of the binary and ternary complex known from crystal structures and add hitherto missing information about the conformational state of the apo enzyme. More specifically, we observe a closure of the Cas12a protein upon loading of the crRNA and a slight re-opening upon loading of the DNA. This is in agreement with structural data for FnCas12a and AsCas12a (2, 17, 20, 21, (30) (31) (32) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Dong et al. observed that LbCas12a is conformationally flexible in its apo state and that addition of crRNA to LbCas12a led to a defined structural state that could be analyzed using cryo-electron microscopy (30) . These data are in line with our smFRET data that led to the detection of two conformational states for the FnCas12a apo enzyme and a defined conformational state for the binary complex (reflected by the high FRET population). Our finding that the ternary complex is more flexible than the binary complex agrees with recent molecular dynamics simulations that showed the increased flexibility of the REC and Nuc lobe in the ternary complex (50) . We found that loading of the DNA target is more efficient when a ssDNA target is provided suggesting that the formation of a Cas12a-crRNA-dsDNA complex is energetically demanding. In line with crystal structures, the expansion of REC and Nuc lobe upon transition to the ternary complex does not depend on the single-stranded or doublestranded nature of the DNA and loading of the TS is sufficient to induce the conformational change in Cas12a (21) . Conformational heterogeneity was detected for the apo enzyme. Here, Cas12a can adopt an open or closed state. No crystal or high resolution cryo-EM structure of the apo enzyme is available so far. But the existence of an open state has been proposed based on smFRET studies by Stella et al. While we performed smFRET measurements on diffusing molecules, Stella et al. employed immobilized Cas12a proteins to follow the relative distance between the REC and Nuc lobe (20) . The apo enzyme and all complexes tested in the study by Stella et al. showed a wide range of conformations that could not be discerned as discrete states. However, in the apo state, a relatively high fraction of the molecules was found in a low FRET state supporting the finding of an open state in this study. Considering the central position of the BH, it seemed feasible that a deletion of the BH might result in a collapsed state of Cas12a. However, this was not observed in our single-molecule FRET measurements. Interestingly, the structural integrity is preserved even in the BH/ BH variants and these variants can load crRNA and target DNA efficiently. Considering the previous finding that the BH structurally re-arranges in concert with helix 1 of the RuvC I domain it seems plausible that an intact helix 1 (possibly in addition to structural elements in the PI and WED domains) is responsible for the correct distance between the REC and Nuc lobe. Consequently, the BH only influences the equilibrium between the open and closed state in the apo enzyme. Additional structural data that elucidate the structural state of the BH and helix 1 in the apo enzyme would be of high interest in this context.",
