The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is, however, calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective population-level contact matrices by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. We produce age-stratified contact matrices for 35 countries, including 277 subnational administratvie regions of 8 of those countries, covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. We use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. The contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "M athematical and computational models of infectious disease transmission are increasingly used to provide scenario analysis and forecasts during epidemic outbreaks and quantitative answers to complex public health questions such as devising the effectiveness of control strategies (vaccination, school closure, etc.) during health threat emergencies 1 . Modeling approaches have thus moved away from the classic homogeneous and stylized framework 2,3 , progressively incorporating heterogeneities that depend on between-and within-country population variability, disease timescale, transmission settings, as well as specific pathogen characteristics. For instance, geographically structured models allow evaluation of spatially heterogeneous interventions in both animal and human diseases 4, 5 , while individual-based models lay down the possibility of simulating all micro-details of the transmission process and tracking in time and space each individual of the simulated population [6] [7] [8] . When data-driven, these approaches have highlighted the importance of the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of the population in determining the actual mesh of contacts underlying disease spreading among individuals. For this reason, a broad range of methodologies have been used to study human-mixing patterns, including surveys 9-12 , contact diaries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , wearable sensors 20, 21 , analysis of time-use data 22 , development of synthetic populations [23] [24] [25] , and mixed approaches for instance integrating diary-based contact data with timeuse data 26, 27 or combining contact data with modeling techniques 26, 28, 29 . However, each methodology has different limitations and assumptions because contact patterns among individuals vary according to the geographical scale (from census blocks to the national level), the disease under consideration, and the detailed socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the population.",

The resulting contact matrices capture differences at the subnational level that reflect the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries.

Then we compare summary statistics derived from the generated synthetic population for each geographical area to those reported in official (macro) statistics (e.g., census data). Examples of the summary statistics used in the approach are the age structure of the population, distributions of household size, type, number of children by household size, and so on, depending on the summary statistics available from official sources. The generated data is compared to the distributions of summary statistics by using the goodness-of-fit tests at the desired level of significance (generally 5%). We use a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to test the uncertainty level of our sampling. This procedure is iterated until a satisfactory fit is reached. In the case of inadequate microdata (e.g., sub-optimal sample size), we use the microdata to extrapolate rules on the age gaps between household members conditioned on the age of the household head, household size, and the relation between the members (e.g., age gap between spouses, age gap between siblings). Note that the same arguments are extended to other settings (e.g., schools, workplaces, hospitals) and can be extended to further stratifications relevant for other diseases (e.g., easy access to health care facilities).

The increased frequency of contact between adults of similar ages along the main diagonal of the household contact matrix represents couples of similar ages living together, while the bands of high frequency above and below the main diagonal indicate contact between parents and children. While most locations share these overall features, the contact matrices show different age-mixing patterns. For instance, in China (Fig. 2a) , the lower frequency of contact between children within households is the reflection of the country's so-called \"One-child policy\". The policy, enacted in 1979 up to 2016, has resulted in over a generation of many Chinese youths growing up without siblings, and hence having less contact on average with other children in this setting. This is a stark contrast with the United States and India (Fig. 2a) , where the presence of multiple children born to a family results in an increased frequency of contact between this age group in the household matrix. The presence of multigenerational families in countries like India is also evident from the increased frequency of contact between all age groups, notably between the elderly (60 years and older) and young children. The same feature was observed in ref. 19 for Zimbabwe. Even within the same country, contact patterns may be markedly different. Figure 2a shows the age-mixing patterns within households for two different provinces of China: Beijing and Guizhou. While the household contact patterns in Beijing show a clear signal of the \"One-child policy\", Guizhou shows the presence of multigenerational families, as well as an increased presence of multiple children living in the same household. This can be traced back to the fact that the Guizhou Province is characterized by a large frequency of minority groups and the \"One-child policy\" was less strictly applied for minorities. Figure 2b , c shows the inferred contact matrices in the school and workplace settings for China, the United States, and India. In both settings, the age-mixing patterns vary strongly, reflecting differences in the educational systems, and economic conditions unique to each location. For all locations in our study, the school setting consistently exhibits the highest frequencies of contact between children and young adults attending school together. Interaction with older adults in this setting reflects the contact students have with instructors and other staff members in school. The variability of age-mixing patterns between children in India ( Fig. 2b ) also reflects the many different kinds of schools that children can attend throughout the country and the different age groups found in those schools. In the workplace environment, most interaction takes place between individuals in the range of 20-65 years of age, with the age range depending on local retirement, employments regulations, and culture. For instance, in many parts of the world it is common for teenagers to be fully or partially employed (see the work contact matrix for the US- Fig. 2c ); in India, census records for employment list even children among the population of workers.",

It is worth remarking that the estimated weight for household contacts is larger than the average household size.

For this reason, as a validation of this calibration method, in Fig. 3a we report the correlation between the resulting synthetic matrices for France, Japan, and the Shanghai Province of China and the available empirical matrices for these additional locations [30] [31] [32] . We find significant (P value < 0.001) Pearson correlations of 0.92, 0.9, and 0.8 for France, Japan, and Shanghai Province, respectively. Moreover, we use the Canberra distance as a measure of the similarity between two contact matrices 23 (see \"Methods\" for the definition of the Canberra distance). We estimate the distance between the seven survey-based matrices used in the calibration phase and their respective synthetic matrices to be 0.21 on average (range: 0.17-0.28). (Note that the resulting Canberra distance is normalized by the square of the number of elements of the contact matrix to account for the different number of age groups considered by the different diary-based contact surveys). When considering the three locations used as out-of-sample validation, we estimate a slightly larger average distance of 0.29 (range: 0.21-0.37), suggesting the adequacy of the employed methodology. Finally, Fig. 3b shows a visual comparison between the synthetic and survey matrices, which highlights that the synthetic contact matrices are able to capture the specific features of each location such as contact patterns at school and the relative intensity of the main diagonals. Figure 4a shows the synthetic overall contact matrices for China, the United States, and India. The contact matrices for all locations share many similarities: bands of increased contact along the main and off diagonals reflect the familiar household contact patterns, increased contact between adults age 20 and~65 years old account for the interactions between the population's workforce, and the dominant contact patterns in the lower left of the contact matrices reflect the high number of interactions between school-aged individuals. Depending on the age structure of the population, the intensity of interactions occurring in the school setting can vary; however, this feature consistently dominates the contact matrix for all locations in our study.",

Susceptible individuals (i.e., those at risk of acquiring the infection-S) can become infectious (i.e., capable to transmit the infection-I) after coming into contact with infectious individuals. Subsequently, infectious individuals recover from the infection and become removed (R) after a certain amount of time (the infectious period). In an age-structured implementation of the model, individuals are now identified also by their age, and the contact matrix is introduced to describe the number of contacts between susceptible individuals of age i and all of their possible infectious contacts of age j 2,13 (see \"Methods\" for details). More specifically, we considered a transmission model with identical disease parameters across geographical locations considered in the study. The contact matrices are thus the only factor driving the difference in dynamics and attack rate (total number of infected individuals) of the simulated epidemic.",

Indeed, if we examine the attack rates by age and setting (see Supplementary  Information) , we observe that the greatest proportion of infections occur as a result of contact due to the school setting, and that attack rates, in general, are highest for school-aged individuals. Going further, an inspection of the incidence profile by age (see Supplementary Information) also clearly shows that individuals with high contact frequencies with others in the school setting are infected earlier in higher proportions. These results mirror well-known influenza spreading trends/patterns observed in the real world 14, 23 . The observed results are robust (although with quantitative differences) to changes in transmissibility patterns and susceptibility to infection by age (see Supplementary Information).

The kind of data available also varies by country and even at the subnational level, thus necessitating the development of adaptive algorithms that can take in the available data and accommodate for variability in data organization to produce a faithful Fig. 7 Subnational heterogeneity. a The black dots represent the estimated attack rates in each province of China by using the country-level contact matrix and the location-specific age structure of the population. Colored dots represent the estimated attack rates in each location by using both the locationspecific contact matrix and the age structure of the population. The colored lines connect the two estimated values of attack rate for each location. The transmission rate is set such that R 0 = 1.5 when using the country-level matrix. Each map shows the percentage variation of the attack rate using the location-specific contact matrix with respect to using the national contact matrix as a proxy for the subnational contact patterns (i.e., (AR c \u2212 AR l )/AR c , where AR c is the attack rate estimated by using the country-level contact matrix, and AR l is that estimated by using the location-specific matrix). Colors toward Astra in the color scale indicate an overestimation of the attack rate in the location when using the country-level contact matrix as a proxy for the subnational contact patterns. Conversely, colors towards grape in the color scale indicate an underestimation of the attack rate in the location when using the country-level matrix as a proxy for the subnational contact patterns. b Same as a, but for the USA. c Same as a, but for India.",

            "text": "The first step in the reconstruction of a real-world population is the generation of households. In this process, we use two types of multinomial sampling. The first is based on the probability distribution M\u00f0y\u00de of an independent sociodemographic characteristic y. For instance, such characteristic y can be the household size or composition, depending on the data available. The second type of multinomial sampling is based on the probability M\u00f0xjy 1 \u00bc i 1 ; y 2 \u00bc i 2 ; :::; y n \u00bc i n \u00de of characteristic x conditional on the value i of a previously determined variable(s) y. In this case, x and y are assumed (when supported by available data) to have bivariate or multivariate joint distributions. Typically, the larger the number of joint distributions incorporated, the more precise the reconstruction of the real-world population. The precision of such a reconstruction is, however, often limited by the scope of the data (such as the survey sample size for each characteristic y) and its availability. For example, of the multinomial joint distributions used here, one is the distribution of the age of the head of the household by the size of the household and the household composition (whether a couple, a single parent with children, siblings, multigenerational families, etc.). The bivariate joint distributions incorporated is considerably long and includes (but is not limited to) distributions of the age of household members by the age of the head of the household, the age gap between couples living together by the age of one in the pair, the mother's age at childbirth by the age of the child, the number of household members by their relation to the age of the household head (such as a spouse, parent, child, grandchild, sibling, in-law, etc.) by the age of the household head and the household composition. These joint distributions were either found in the macro data or estimated from the micro survey data. Characteristics of the resulting synthetic households are compared to the distributions of the summary statistics available from the macro-level data using a goodness-of-fit test at the desired level of significance (generally 5%).",

For each location, these age-based contact patterns are encoded in a contact matrix F k , whose elements F k ij describes the average frequency of contact between a given individual of age i and individuals of age j in setting k. We focus on 4 social settings: the households (H), schools (S), workplaces (W), and the general community (C). Specifically, here we adopt the frequency-dependent (mass action) transmission model, with the implicit assumption that an increased population density has no effect on the per capita contact rate between individuals 45 . This choice of modeling mechanism was already proved to represent a good approximation for the description of the transmission patterns of several infectious diseases 2 . Moreover, it allows us to readily compare epidemiological parameters between social settings and locations with disparate population density, and thus makes for an appropriate framework when modeling the transmission dynamics of heterogeneous populations around the world.

We perform a multiple linear regression to calibrate the weights of the synthetic setting contact matrices such that their linear combination matches the overall contact matrix for all seven locations coming from the survey studies (see Supplementary Information for details and for a comparison between the empirical and synthetic contact matrices).",
