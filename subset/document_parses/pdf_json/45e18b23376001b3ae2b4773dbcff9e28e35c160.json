To meet the standards of proficiency, a variety of qualifications and competencies are required such as a sociable personality, positive attitude, empathy, and decision-making skills. In addition, the cabin crew must constantly make efforts to keep customer satisfaction at a high level, which includes resolving complaints.",

As multicultural companies, they recruit cabin crew from more than 100 different countries, regardless of nationality, race, religion, or gender. Upon employment, the cabin crew are relocated to the Middle East, where they experience a completely different culture from their homeland. For this reason, airlines look for applicants who are open-minded to other cultures and have the ability to adapt to new environments without difficulty. Nevertheless, cabin crew in Middle Eastern airlines have shown higher rates of resignation than other domestic airlines. Recent research has reported that the main causes of high turnover rates for foreign cabin crew are, first, acculturation stress, including culture shock and homesickness; and second, job stress caused by emotional exhaustion, jet lag, shift work, etc. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

It has been even suggested that personality is one of the more important factors to help for effective adjustment than professional work skill, which can be learned through special training [13] . Furthermore, it has been proven by earlier studies that personality is an important factor to predict individual's job performance or work-related competency [14] [15] [16] .",

They tend to bond easily with strangers, and enjoy talking with others almost without any difficulty. On the other hand, Introversion (I) types gain energy from their inner world of ideas and experiences; thus, they prefer to communicate in writing and process information at their own pace quietly. Sensing (S) types use their own senses to take in information. They are most concerned with the present and empirical evidence, and are often detail-oriented and rule-focused. In contrast, Intuition (N) types rely on insights and process information through a big picture or patterns, rather than details. They tend to enjoy designing new ideas and challenging the diversity of life. Thinking (T) types make decisions by rational, critical thinking based on objective criteria and utilize logical thought processes to solve problems. They are considered businesslike people, and focus on the result of the project, rather than the process or harmony. Contrariwise, feeling (F) types are concerned with personal relationships, and judge situations based on their feelings, personal values, and social considerations. They focus on emotional communications and are motivated by the desire to help others. Judging (J) types approach life in a structured and organized way. They like to set a detailed plan for their schedules, and follow it strictly. Similarly, they like to keep their areas neat and tidy as a daily routine. Opposite to Judging (J) types, Perceiving (P) types approach the life in a freewheeling and spontaneous way. They tend to perceive structure as restriction, and prefer flexibility [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

The definition has been expanded to the social and cultural spheres; it was interpreted in the context of the development of behavioral and psychological adaptative mechanisms [22] . Cross-cultural adjustment is often called acculturation, which refers to a process of social, psychological, and cultural change that stems from the balancing of two cultures while one adapts to the prevailing culture of the society [23] . In the cross-cultural experience, people readjust themselves to another culture. In this process, they may face changes in lifestyles and thinking principles that would lead them to acquire distinct changes in perception or physical/mental life [24] . However, environmental changes may create acculturation stress such as culture shock, homesickness, anxiety, loneliness, and depression [23, 25, 26] . Failure to recover from this stress can have a negative impact on an individual's physical health as well as mental health [27] [28] [29] , and it may cause premature returns. In this study, cross-cultural adjustment competency is defined as the ability of the cabin crew to accept and respect different cultures with open minds, and the capacity to successfully adjust to cultural changes.",

The sample group was limited to the cabin crew in full-service airlines because they have similar flight operation sequences in terms of duties for cabin service, galley operating, duty free sales, etc. Additionally, they have similar procedures for assigning cabin crew positions onboard. We advertised for research volunteers on the Korean cabin crew community website. All volunteers were informed that the data will be kept confidential and destroyed after the analysis is completed. After obtaining consent to participate in this research, the volunteers received invitations with MBTI access serial numbers via email. Once participants completed the online MBTI self-report test, they received the test results along with the questionnaires for evaluating their level of cross-cultural competency, occupational competency, coping competency, mental health, and turnover intention. A total of 185 personality tests and surveys were distributed from 3 August to 9 October 2020. However, 2 participants refused to conduct the personality test due to concern of leaking personal information, 8 participants did not finish the test, and 3 missing datapoints were found.

We conducted a multiple regression analysis to verify the moderating effect of overseas experience on the relationship between cross-cultural adjustment competency and turnover intention by separating the two sample groups. Overall, a high level of cross-cultural adjustment competency negatively affected turnover intention. However, Table 5 shows that cross-cultural adjustment competency for cabin crew members without overseas experience did not influence turnover intention (\u03b2 = 0.056, t = 0.379, p < 0.707). On the other hand, cross-cultural adjustment competency for cabin crew members with overseas experience significantly influenced turnover intention (\u03b2 = \u22120.258, t = \u22120.753, p < 0.007), implying that previous overseas experience has a positive effect on adjusting to new cultural environments, as well as lessening the desire to leave the occupation. Figure 2 provides the hypothesis testing results. The proposed impact of MBTI personality types on cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, and coping competency was tested (H1, H2, H3) , finding that the cabin crew members showed different levels of cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, and coping competency depending on their MBTI personality types, which supports Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. Hypotheses 4, 5, and 6 were also tested, finding a significant association between cross-cultural adjustment competency and mental health (\u03b2 = 0.196, p < 0.012), and between coping competency and mental health (\u03b2 = 0.466, p < 0.000). These results supported Hypotheses 4 and 6. On the other hand, occupational competency did not impact mental health (\u03b2 = \u22120065, p < 0.358). Thus, Hypothesis 5 was not supported. Hypotheses 7, 8, 9 , and 10 were then tested. Our findings showed that occupational competency directly influenced turnover intention (\u03b2 = \u22120.177, p < 0.012); in addition, mental health also had a direct impact on turnover intention (\u03b2 = \u22120.416, p < 0.000), which supported Hypotheses 8 and 10. Although cross-cultural adjustment competency and coping competency did not have a direct impact on turnover intention, they indirectly influenced turnover intention through the mediating effect of mental health. Hence, the results supported Hypotheses 7 and 9. The variables within the proposed theoretical framework explained 24.2% of the total variance in cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, coping competency, and mental health, and 22.8% of the variance in cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, coping competency, and turnover intention.

According to the result of data analysis, the most dominant personality types of among Korean cabin crew in the Middle Eastern airlines was ENFP (15.1%, n = 26), followed by ESTJ (14.0%, n = 24) and ESFJ (10.5%, n = 18), whereas regarding the MBTI analysis of Korean domestic airlines cabin crew showed that ESTJ (19.3%, n = 45) was the most common type, followed by ESFJ (15.9%, n = 37) and ESFP (12.9%, n = 30). Meanwhile, the least common types were INTJ (1.2%, n = 2), ENTP (1.7%, n = 3), INTP (1.7, n = 3), and ENTJ (2.3%, n = 4). This distribution exhibited similar results with Korean domestic airlines cabin crew (INTP: 0%; ENTP: 0.9%, n = 2; INTJ: 1.3%, n = 3; ENTJ: 1.3%, n = 3) [17] . In terms of individual indexes, Extroversion (E) accounted for 66.3% (n = 114), while Introversion (I) was 33.7% (n = 58). This result reflects the fact that the cabin crew recruitment process generally involves public speaking interview, and many airlines remind in job descriptions that they look for candidates who are sociable and outgoing to enjoyably engage with passengers onboard. Sensing (S) types were 65.7% (n = 113); on the other hand, Intuition (N) types were 34.3% (n = 59). While Feeling (F) types accounted for 56.4% (n = 97), Thinking (T) types were 43.6% (n = 75). Cabin crew in Korean airlines also showed a similar outcome (Feeling: 62.2%, n = 145; Thinking: 37.8%, n = 88). It demonstrated that regardless of cultures and base of companies, for important personality as cabin crew, airlines generally show more concern for empathy, consideration, and desire to help others with a caring attitude than being rational and logical. Lastly, there was no significant differences between Judging types (51.2%, n = 88) and Perceiving types (48.8%, n = 84).",

This implies that although all crew members conduct the same duties during the flight, and seem to go through some difficulties when adapting to other cultural environment, their cultural adjustment level can be vary, and even performance in each duty can appear different depending on their own personality, which also affects their mental health and turnover intention.",

First, there have been numerous studies of airline crew, yet the majority of existing studies have focused on such factors as job satisfaction, stress, burnout, and safety behavior [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 43, 65, 76, 77] . This study sought to emphasize the importance of personality traits as the factor influencing cabin crew members' cross-cultural adjustment competency, occupational competency, and coping competency. Thus, this study is the first attempt to discover international airlines' cabin crew personality profiles using the MBTI. In addition, the findings supplement earlier MBTI studies, which failed to provide empirical support regarding the relationship between MBTI traits and individual competency.",

Moreover, it suggests that each cabin crew member has unique and different personalities; thus, airlines should establish a communication training program to help them understand each other, and to avoid any conflicts within the team. Second, for cabin crew in Middle Eastern airlines, being expatriates, effective adaptation to the local community is a particularly important psychological issue. Therefore, this study gives practical suggestion to international airline companies hiring foreigners in that it is necessary to support employees by providing regular acculturation training and psychological counseling.",

In certain airlines, each crew member, except for the onboard leaders, is assigned to serve as either a cabin service operator or galley operator on every flight. These duty positions are normally decided by a purser or crew scheduling system regardless of employees' capacities or preferences, whereas certain airlines allow the crew members to decide their positions themselves. Our results indicate that each crew member has an inherent, distinctive personality and that it is essential to place an employee with the right talent in the right position for effective crew resource management. This is thus a practical contribution to human resource management guidelines for cabin crew recruitment, as well as for crew position assignment.",

First, there was a limit to collecting sufficient surveys due to the redundancies caused by COVID-19 and the time difference between Korea and the Middle Eastern countries. Moreover, it should be noted that all study participants were Korean, so these findings cannot be generalized. Therefore, for the generalization of future studies, it will be necessary to ensure that sufficient samples are collected from the Middle Eastern airlines, or we expect future relevant research to extend our model with cross-culturally generalizable samples in order to evaluate the comparison of personality profiles and their association with variables more objectively. Second, to assess MBTI personality types correctly, it is important to hold an in-depth conversational interview between MBTI experts and participants. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to use online methods of data collection. Moreover, the survey questionnaire was assessed by self-reporting, which could be affect by response bias, social desirability, or subjective judgement towards the participants' competency. Therefore, for future research regarding MBTI personality, it is recommended to carry out research using face-to-face in-depth interviews or qualitative methods.",
