A total of 1785 potential HIV-1 IN inhibitors were collected from the databases of ChEMBL, Binding Database, DrugBank, and PubMed, as well as from 40 references. The database was divided into the training set and test set by random sampling. By exploring the correlation between molecular descriptors and inhibitory activity, it is found that the classification and specific activity data of inhibitors can be more accurately predicted by the combination of molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints. The calculation of molecular fingerprint descriptor provides the additional substructure information to improve the prediction ability. Based on the training set, two machine learning methods, the recursive partition (RP) and naive Bayes (NB) models, were used to build the classifiers of HIV-1 IN inhibitors. Through the test set verification, the RP technique accurately predicted 82.5% inhibitors and 86.3% noninhibitors. The NB model predicted 88.3% inhibitors and 87.2% noninhibitors with correlation coefficient of 85.2%. The results show that the prediction performance of NB model is slightly better than that of RP, and the key molecular segments are also obtained. Additionally, CoMFA and CoMSIA models with good activity prediction ability both were constructed by exploring the structure-activity relationship, which is helpful for the design and optimization of HIV-1 IN inhibitors.",

HIV can be divided into two subtypes: HIV-1 (i.e., the main pathogen of AIDS) and HIV-2. HIV-1 is characterized by strong infection, rapid mutation, and high mortality and can be transmitted through blood, mother-infant, sexual intercourse, etc. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Since the first case of HIV-1 infection in 1981, the number of AIDS patients has exploded worldwide [9] . According to World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) data of 2019, more than 38 million people have been infected, and 7.1 million of them have died [10] . Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the main strategy in the clinical treatment of AIDS-the combination of drugs inhibiting both reverse transcriptase (RT) and the protease (PR), which can reduce the damage of virus to immune system [11] . However, the high variability of HIV-1 results in poor efficacy of HAART treatment, leading to the emergence of drugresistant virus strains. It is urgent to identify new targets and develop novel structural inhibitors [12] [13] [14] .",

Unlike PR and RT, there is neither known functional analog of IN in human cells nor apparent cellular toxicity for IN inhibitors [17, 18] . Encoded by the pol gene, HIV-1 IN is composed of 288 residues with molecular weight of 32 kDa, which can be divided into three domains: Nterminal domain (NTD, residues 1-49), catalytic core domain (CCD, residues 50-212), and C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 213-288) [19] . The zinc finger in NTD is conductive to the stability of the whole IN enzyme; proper chelation of DDE motif (i.e., Asp64, Asp116, and Glu152) in CCD with two Mg2 + ions is essential to maintain high enzymatic activity; CTD serves as the nonspecific binding to viral DNA [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Diketoacids are the most fully studied and most promising inhibitors against HIV-1 IN, showing high efficiency, high selectivity, and low toxicity [34] [35] [36] . In terms of inhibitory mechanism of diketoacid compounds, the carbonyl and carboxyl groups both are, respectively, chelated with two different Mg2 + ions, which significantly weakens ST reaction by destroying metal-DDE recognition. Raltegravir (RLT) was the first approved IN inhibitor drug through FDA in 2007, followed by elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG) for clinical use [37] [38] [39] . Here, all three belong to diketoacid compounds.",

(2) How to effectively modify the diketoacid inhibitor by obtaining the key groups that affect molecular activity and then combining 3-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) results? In this work, HIV-1 IN inhibitors were first collected to establish a personalized database; the activity prediction model and the key groups affecting the activity both were obtained with recursive partition (RP) and naive Bayes (NB) model; finally, based on the structure and activity data of pyruvic acid inhibitors against HIV-1 IN, a 3D-QSAR model with good predictive ability was proposed [40] [41] [42] . In particular, the quantitative relationship between molecular structure (such as spatial conformation, electrostatic characteristics, hydrophobicity, and H-bond) and its inhibitory activity was explored, which will provide theoretical guidance for the design of effective anti-AIDS drugs.",

Molecular fingerprints can be transformed into two-dimensional fragments, which aids the design of HIV-1 IN inhibitors. Figure 4 shows the top 20 potential favorable molecular fingerprints of HIV-1 IN inhibitors obtained by NB classification. Most of the advantageous fragments contain nitrogen-oxygen heterocycles (such as oxazole rings and pyridine rings), providing implications for molecular design based on inhibition mechanism and ligand structure. In addition, oxygen-sulfur double bond, nitrogen-nitrogen double bond, and pyrimidine ring appear in the unfavorable fragments (see Figures S3) , which should be filtered out to improve the screening efficiency of HIV-1 IN inhibitors. Figure 5 shows structures and pIC 50 of 22 quinolinone acid inhibitors, where 18 inhibitors were randomly selected into the training set to establish three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model. In the preprocessing step of 3D-QSAR analysis, the conformations of quinolinone acid inhibitors overlap quite well (see figure S4 ), which lays the foundation for the subsequent establishment of a good model.",

In CoMSIA model, the contribution rates of S, E, H, D, and A were 7.4%, 13.2%, 16.9%, 45.7%, and 16.8%, respectively, which shows that the H-bond donors of quinolinone acid inhibitors have great influence on their activity.

Figure 6 shows the correlation between experimental pIC 50 and the predicted values by two models. It can be found that the correlation coefficient R 2 was greater than 0.9, and the deviation between the predicted and experimental data was less than 1, which proves the reliability of the two models.

The yellow blocks are widely distributed around the ketone, carboxyl, and chlorine atoms; the green blocks are clustered In the E field, the blue area near the ketone group indicates the introduction of a positively charged groups is conducive to improving inhibitory activity; there is a red block near the amino group, so the introduction of negatively charged group should be fully considered in molecular design.

In the A field of CoMSIA contour map, the red blocks near the carboxylic acid group and the contralateral nitrogen atom are mainly H-bond receptor rejection regions, and the introduction of H-bond receptors is strictly prohibited. Based on the above analyses and previous studies, several design suggestions on improving the activity of quinolinone acid inhibitors are proposed: (1) the structure of betacarbonyl carboxylic acid is strictly preserved, which is the key to maintain its activity; (2) at the N atom of amino group, long fatty chains (especially negatively charged one, such as carboxy group) are recommended; (3) H-bond donors (such as amino or hydroxyl group) may be considered for addition to the diphenylmethane side of quinolinone. To be objective, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and biochemical enzyme experiments both are still needed to further verify the above molecular design ideas. ",

By analyzing the key fragments transformed from molecular fingerprints, the nitrogen-containing ring including oxazole and pyridine rings is suggested to be introduced into subsequent inhibitor modification. Finally, CoMSIA and CoMFA models with good predictive ability (R 2 > 0:9) both were established by selecting quinolinone acid inhibitors against HIV-1 IN.
