            "text": "Open access conditions from patients through to government level. 8 Singing for lung health (SLH) is a popular group singing programme specifically developed for people with CRD. Small scale trials and qualitative studies suggest SLH has a range of biopsychosocial benefits for participants, 9 10 however, there is a lack of larger, longer-term, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the impacts of this intervention. 11 12 The 'Singing for Health: Improving Experiences of Lung Disease (SHIELD) trial' was setup to help to address this gap, planning to randomise 120 individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to participation in 12 weeks of group singing or usual care (UC). During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures aimed at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission have led to profound social adaptations and disruption. 13 Group activities, particularly involving people with long-term health problems who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, have in most cases been suspended, including pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programmes-one of the highest value interventions for people with respiratory disease. 12 14 Similarly, there are particular concerns that group singing could be a high-risk activity regarding viral transmission, however research is currently limited. 15 15 This context has driven interest in the implementation, and ongoing development, of online approaches that attempt to reproduce the social, psychological and physical effects of singing, dance and more established interventions such as PR. 16 17 Such approaches are especially important for people with lung conditions as even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic access to these interventions was inadequate. 18 19 Furthermore, measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 in this group appear to be causing substantial disruption to care and access to health services, with high levels of anxiety and loneliness being reported. 13 20 21 The first group of participants in the SHIELD trial, which began in February 2020, initially met face-to-face but the delivery of the intervention changed to an online format which is likely to remain necessary for the foreseeable future. We decided that this transitional group should be reported as a pilot study. This was first because research on the health and well-being impacts of online singing groups is lacking so the results could guide both the further delivery of the SHIELD trial and the design of other studies. Second, this would provide useful information from individuals who had experience of both faceto-face and online activities and could therefore enable a comparison of the two types of intervention experience.",

A lack of confidence trouble-shooting technological challenges is likely to have consequences beyond these sessions by limiting access to digital health and social resources more generally. As such, supporting digital access in this context could be a useful way to build digital literacy and confidence. Online delivery was also felt to be less personal, as interaction between participants was more challenging 'meeting at the Brompton was much more engaging. It's so nice to sing together as a group'. One participant stated that 'Physically demanding things are better done in a group', with group motivation more palpable in person than online.

The psychosocial impacts were highly valued by participants, but more difficult to achieve in the online format. Technological difficulties prevented some people from participation in online sessions, which were also felt to be less personal as social interaction was more challenging.

However, these findings should be interpreted within the context of COVID-19-related physical distancing and 'shielding' measures. In a small (n=28) RCT of a 6-week course of twice weekly face-to-face SLH, Lord et al 30 found psychological improvements, though these related to anxiety rather than depression, and qualitative research has reported similar findings to the current study in relation to perceived impact on health and wellbeing. 31 Qualitative research from a dance group for people with CRD and breathlessness also identified perceived holistic benefits with an emphasis on psychosocial impacts (KEJP Dance qual). Previous studies on SLH Open access for people with COPD have suggested improvements in quality of life, 30 32 33 which was not seen here, though it is not clear if this was due to the small sample size. Furthermore, our findings echo those of a study comparing the experiences of participants in a virtual choir with those in a live choir, which found the two types of experience provide very similar emotional benefits, though differences in how 'present' participants felt. 34 The qualitative data identified specific barriers and facilitators related to the different formats of delivery, which helps to explain the attendance data. The consort diagram highlights that many (n=23) potential participants declined due to issues with physically accessing the face-to-face sessions, mainly related to viewing public transport as too challenging given their health condition. However, online delivery demonstrated good potential to overcome physical distance as a barrier to access. As highlighted in the interview feedback, during the online section of the study, there were days when individuals participated but felt they would not have felt well enough to come in person if the sessions were still being held at the hospital. Regarding the online sessions, difficulties with digital literacy and digital access presented barriers, in some cases preventing ongoing participation in those who stated they deeply enjoyed the face-to-face sessions.",

            "text": "Some limitations to this study are important to discuss. First, the need for rapid adaptation of study delivery meant that the methods for supporting singing online had not been refined. That said, it has provided a unique opportunity to gain insights into the transition from face-to-face to online delivery which has, by necessity, become widespread. Second, given the novelty of the online delivery, the session content and technical considerations are likely to develop over time with experience, which could alter the relevance of the current findings to future sessions. However, this is not necessarily a weakness, as the current findings provide useful results on which to base these developments. Third, the sample size was small due to the circumstances in which it was decided to evaluate this group and because the mode of delivery changed part-way through. This limits the confidence in quantitative impacts, and means it is unclear whether singers experienced benefits during the face-to-face or online part of the programme, or a combination of the two. Nevertheless, as a convenience pilot study, it provides useful indications of impacts, as well as informing future research. Similarly, the suboptimal attendance during online sessions limits the extent to which impact can be assessed, although when combined with the interview feedback this provides useful information regarding barriers and facilitators to participation that can be addressed in both practice and future research. See tables 2 and 3 for suggestions. Finally, it is important to consider the context in which this trial took place. The developing COVID-19 pandemic was a considerable source of concern for many people with COPD, who were identified as being at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Though all the participants lived in London, the situation and their response to it, is likely to have differed between individuals, which intern, may have shaped their experience of the intervention.",

Larger studies of SLH specifically, both online, and face-to-face (when appropriate to do so) remain a priority. Even after the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic online delivery of singing groups presents an opportunity to widen access to certain groups of people. In-depth qualitative research exploring participant experience would also be valuable, and in particular, in what ways the wider context of physical distancing measures impacts the experience of in person or online singing sessions.",
