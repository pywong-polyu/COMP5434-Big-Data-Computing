In this sense, the adoption of models that assess comprehensively, in an integrated manner and in different perspectives, the general performance of these innovations allows managers to guide their decisions. The object of this research is the use of an eco-innovation in the production processes of cassava, where the waste generated is treated by biodigesters. These cassava processing industries are located in southern Brazil, Paran\u00e1 State, comprising a multiple case study. A literature review was also carried out to propose a set of indicators capable of assessing the overall impact of this eco-innovation in eight lines of action: (1) environmental, (2) social, (3) economic, (4) human resource training, (5) institutional development, (6) introduction of innovation, (7) unwanted occurrences, and (8) characteristics of environmental management. To compile and process the data, the computerized model INOVA-tec System was used. The objective was to employ the INOVA-tec System model as an instrument for evaluating eco-innovative processes in leading companies in its segment, looking for evidence to expand its usability to other realities in the agro-industry. The results show that the technology scenario is favorable to its dissemination; however, the low performance of the indicators together makes it underutilized.",

In Nigeria, which is the world's leading country, as an example, cassava production has been given little attention regarding sustainable solutions, thus contributing to the problem of the emission of solid waste, as shown in Fig. 1 , contaminating the environment.

However, if they are disposed of indiscriminately in rivers and lagoons, these effluents will be responsible for eutrophication of the waters, developing an overpopulation of decomposing microorganisms that consume oxygen from the water, resulting in the asphyxiation of aerobic species. The result produces adverse effects, such as odor problems, fish death, the formation of toxins, and harmful effects on human health. Omotosho and Sangodoyin (2013) and S\u00e1nchez et al. (2017) reinforce that these effluents are very polluting and that they need to be treated before disposal, representing a serious threat to the environment and the quality of life in rural areas. Achi et al. (2018) Due to the cost of electricity consumed in aerobic treatment systems, the great majority of starch plants use anaerobic lagoons to treat their effluents, and it is during this process that biogas is formed, a gas mixture that is composed of a large amount of methane, classified as a more aggressive greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and pointed out by researchers like Santamouris (2016) , as having a direct relationship to climate change and local pollution problems. However, this biogas can be recovered and used in the production process to heat boilers, in addition to its potential as a fuel to drive electric power generators. Okudoh et al. (2014) recommend considering cassava and its biomass as the next energy crop for biogas production in Africa, especially in South Africa. Andrade et al.

In the following year, James (1997) defined eco-innovation as new products and processes that offer value to the customer and the business, significantly reducing environmental impacts. Extrapolating the environmental dimension of sustainability, eco-innovation can also be understood as the production, application, or use of a new product, process, organizational structure, or management methods for the company or for the user, whose life cycle results in the reduction of environmental risk, as pollution and the negative impacts of resource use (Kemp and Pearson 2007) , also demonstrating its potential as a source of competitive advantage. For Rennings (2000) , eco-innovation concerns the decisions and actions of relevant actors that lead to the development and application of new ideas, behaviors, products, and processes, contributing to the reduction of environmental degradation and to achieving specific ecological goals. This included product and process innovations, changes in organizational management, and, concerning the sociopolitical level, changes in environmental regulation, consumer behavior, or way of living in general. This definition resembles Kemp's (1997) , who understood eco-innovation as new or improved processes, products, techniques, and management systems that prevent or reduce negative environmental impacts.",

To corroborate with the central idea of the research, which is the use of biodigesters as an eco-innovation for the treatment of polluting materials with a high organic load, and with this generating biogas, in addition to producing biofertilizers, eco-innovative initiatives carried out around the world and in Brazil. Okudoh et al.

            "text": "When pointing out the importance of encouraging ecoinnovation initiatives, Sivamani et al. (2018) highlight that cassava is the third significant source of calories after rice and corn in tropical countries and that, including the husk, bagasse, stem, rhizome, and leaves, the annual production of solid cassava waste is 350 million metric tons (MMT), and that in general, with the exception of leaves, all this raw material can be exploited for the production of solid, liquid, and gaseous biofuels. With that, it is observed in this input and with the proposal of this research, that it is a raw material with a low water footprint, capable of producing more than one type of biofuel, through the treatment of the residue of its food production, in a way that the authors of this article reiterate positions such as those of Okudoh et al. (2014) and Sivamani et al. (2018) . These authors suggest a paradigm shift and a more holistic and complementary view of food production and biomass energy, aiming to overcome the existing technical and economic challenges, which can be achieved through research incentives (Sikdar 2020) . Adewuyi (2020) discusses the production of clean energy at affordable prices in Nigeria, considered the world's largest producer of cassava, and a major exporter of fossil fuel, (2017) in addition to generating clean energy from residues from cassava production. It also points to the use of waste materials and underutilized inedible seed oil, such as Jatropha curcas, to minimize controversies associated with the use of food materials as raw material for production of biofuels in Nigeria and other African countries. The author also points out that this strategy would boost the creation of jobs and income, so the focus should be on developing Nigeria's waste management strategy, which has the potential to generate enough energy to boost the economy and serve as a means of employment, and thus, while promoting the generation of clean energy, and the economic and environmental developments. Shah et al. (2015) point out that co-digestion, pre-treatment, and the design of the biodigester are the main techniques to optimize the production of biogas, which confirms the understanding that eco-innovations, including those aimed at the conceptions of new models and constructive methods of biodigesters, prove to be excellent sustainability strategies. In Cambodia, Hyman and Bailis (2018) evaluated the National Biodigester Program, established in 2006, to build and maintain domestic biodigesters through a program that, in just its first six years, installed almost 20,000 biodigesters and established a network in the country of financiers, construction companies, qualified masons, specialists, and after-treatment technicians to rural users in more than half of Cambodia's provinces. In this same direction, Livia et al. (2020) in their research, on the evaluation of the potential for reusing wastewater for irrigation in semiarid rural areas in Chile, highlighted the relevance of integrating social and environmental criteria, in addition to technical and economic ones, to support decision-making processes related to the reuse of effluents. Clemens et al. (2018) analyzed the Partnership Program for Biogas in Africa in three countries, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, created in 2009, to promote the adoption of biodigesters by rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa. They noted that between 2009 and 2017, more than 27,000 families installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. In Zimbabwe found the profile of fostering a distributed generation that eco-innovation aimed at biodigesters can promote, since the country has a high level of dependence on the national electricity grid. The authors also pointed out the potential for sanitation, waste management, and fertilizer production, in addition to the fact that biogas is a high-quality fuel, which can be used for heating and powering vehicles. Another highlight was the lack of control and monitoring devices in most of the biodigesters sampled in Zimbabwe.",

They stated that, since the indicators are central tools for monitoring aspects of interest about an object of analysis, they make it possible to plan actions to improve performance. Indicators can then be analytical tools for the study of changes in society, which when combined allows the formation of indices. In this article, the interest falls on the sustainability indicators, which, in the perspective of sustainable development, are a set of parameters to measure and communicate the anthropic impacts of a given system in relation to the established goals (Moura 2002) , reinforcing the use sustainability indicators as a planning, monitoring, and evaluation tool. For companies, the concept behind sustainability indicators must be objective and simple enough to identify whether a company is approaching or moving away in terms of sustainability (Veleva and Ellenbecker 2000) .",

Regarding the quality of the product, the results achieved so far are direct, but still low, with respondents reporting that the use of biogas provides greater stability in the temperature of the boiler and the steam generated by it, benefiting only the drying process of the starch. Madeira et al. (2017) concluded, from an economic feasibility study of a large biohydrogen production plant, that using cassava wastewater makes the business highly competitive. The economic feasibility calculation involved the investment, operation, and maintenance costs of the biogas steam reformer and the cost of hydrogen production, which reached the value of US $ 0.13/kWh with a 7-year return, demonstrating that this type of hydrogen production is a good option for power generation.",

After interviews with professionals involved in the implementation of the biodigestor technology, it was possible to add another 23 indicators, totaling 35, with which it was possible to evaluate the biodigestor technology as an eco-innovation, taking into account economic, legal, political, social, and environmental issues. Thus, the 35 indicators fed the INOVA-tec System, demonstrating the feasibility of the biodigester technology in relation to economic gains, compliance with legal aspects, improvements in working conditions, the promotion of more specific government policies, and, finally, mitigation of the environmental impacts of waste from cassava production on the environment.",

The application of the INOVA-tec System model brought new and important information that allowed a holistic and systemic analysis. By correlating the results obtained in the two evaluation strands used to assess the general impact of innovation, which culminated in the formulation of the significance index and the magnitude index, the model allowed us to identify that there is an underutilization of the technical potential of the innovation, which is found in a favorable scenario for its dissemination in the market, but with low global performance of the studied indicators, which demands corrective actions internal and external to the companies.",

Parana law already requires the installation of biodigesters to treat the effluents generated by agribusiness activities, but this requirement does not yet apply to the capture/sequestration of these gases, in the case of this research, methane gas.
