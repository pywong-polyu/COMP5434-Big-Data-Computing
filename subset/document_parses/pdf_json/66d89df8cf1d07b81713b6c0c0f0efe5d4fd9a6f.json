Thus, preventing the spread of disease from pathogens has come to the forefront of the public consciousness. This has brought an increasing demand for novel technologies to prioritise clean air. In this study we report on the efficacy of novel biocide treated filters and their antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi and viruses. The antimicrobial filters reported here are shown to kill pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Escherichia coli and MRSA in under 15 min and to destroy SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in under 30 s following contact with the filter. Through air flow rate testing, light microscopy and SEM, the filters are shown to maintain their structure and filtration function. Further to this, the filters are shown to be extremely durable and to maintain antimicrobial activity throughout the operational lifetime of the product. Lastly, the filters have been tested in field trials onboard the UK rail network, showing excellent efficacy in reducing the burden of microbial species colonising the air conditioning system.",

Investigation of London Underground Oyster card data demonstrated a significant correlation between higher rates of influenza-like illnesses in people with increased underground usage and/or those who incur more contact while travelling in London boroughs 2 . The risk of developing COVID-19 is also increased with greater public transport use by several studies 3 . In particular, a recent case study demonstrated that among the 68 passengers who travelled on a bus with one infected individual, 24 became infected with SARS-CoV2. This is compared to none who travelled on a separate bus 4 . Both buses had air conditioning on a recycling mode, and the pattern of spread supported a role for airborne transmission, as the risk of COVID-19 was not significantly associated with distance from the index case.",

For example, in aerospace cabins HVAC systems are designed to be used with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters 5 . HEPA are extremely efficacious at screening out airborne viruses and bacteria due to their small particulate size 6 . However, a significantly higher level of energy is required to push air through HEPA filters compared to basic HVAC filters. While these air filtration systems can effectively remove pathogenic microorganisms from the indoor air environment, the organisms are not destroyed and can remain viable, or even proliferate, within the air filtration system and on the filter media. Therefore the filter itself can behave as a source for contamination of the air environment with airborne pathogenic microorganisms 7, 8 .",

            "text": "Due to the risk of filters acting as a reservoir for contamination of the indoor air environment, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in demand for novel antimicrobial technologies to prevent transmission. The incorporation of silver nanoparticles into meshes for filters has also been tested in a range of forms [9] [10] [11] . Dong et al. reported the development of a nanofibrous air filter with incorporated silver nanoparticles to impart an antimicrobial effect 12 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria on the filters. The effect appeared to be bacteriostatic with no growth observed over the 24 h, rather than bactericidal. Limited efficacy of the filters was also demonstrated against coronaviruses, however the reduced survival effect falls short of the required log reduction needed for it to be registered as a biocidal product 13 . Alternative approaches include a novel carbon nanofiber technology, which used particles of specific size similar to bacteria and viruses to demonstrate enhanced airborne contamination capture 14 . It is not known if this will translate to be efficacious against bacteria and viruses as well as particle modelling. However, Park et al. have successfully demonstrated that the inclusion of carbon nanotubes onto glass filters can reduce the survival of viruses after contact with the filter 15 . Carbon nanotube filters demonstrated a 90% reduction in virus survival downstream of the filter, which is significantly more effective than the silver nanoparticle technology. While these technologies require development of new filters, existing filters can also be modified with biocides, as reported by Kim et al., in which HEPA filters are modified with tannic acid 16 . The modified air filters demonstrated ~ 90% capture of the H1N1 virus compared to standard HEPA filters.",

MK3 filters (supplied by Pullman AC) were modified by NitroPep Ltd. in order to incorporate CHDG into the filter media. Both the standard MK3 filters and CHDG treated MK3 filters were imaged using light microscopy and SEM to determine visible and structural differences between the standard MK3 filters and the CHDG treated MK3 filters ( Fig. 1a-d) . Images at both 3.5\u00d7 and 64\u00d7 magnification showed no structural differences between the control and treated filters following incorporation of the biocide. Imaging was also carried out using SEM. SEM images also demonstrated no visible differences at either magnification (Fig. 1e,f) .",

The distribution of CHDG coverage was observed to be on all fibres in the filter and to be uniformly distributed across the fibre surfaces ( Fig. 2a,b) . The variation in distribution upon fibres observed is proposed to be the result of a combination of sample topography and shadowing where secondary ions are collected less effectively in some areas. This is confirmed with the C 7 H 4 N 2 Cl \u2212 secondary ion distribution correlating with intensity variations within the total secondary ions. The relative amount of chlorhexidine applied to the fibre surfaces is illustrated in Fig. 2c which shows the C 7 H 4 N 2 Cl \u2212 secondary ion intensity for untreated and treated samples.",

In order to determine the durability of the antimicrobial on the filter, filters were subjected to two different durability tests. Firstly, the filters were sectioned and installed in a laboratory test rig complete with a capture membrane to determine if any CHDG leaches from the surfaces due to air flow. The filters were maintained in air flow continuously for 240 h. The capture membrane was removed and analysed for biocide at 24 h intervals and potential leached CHDG was then released from the membrane into solution. The amount of CHDG in the solution was monitored using an established assay 19 . No measurable amount of CHDG www.nature.com/scientificreports/ was leached from the filter throughout the duration of the test (Fig. 5a) . Following the final time point of the durability test, the filter was destroyed and CHDG extracted. The remaining CHDG in the filter after 240 h was measured at 82% \u00b1 15% of the applied CHDG. This demonstrates that the biocidal treatment is very stable and confirms the results of the air flow durability study. Extracted CHDG solutions from the durability test and the time-course interval filters were used to test bacterial survival as E. coli is sensitive to significantly lower concentrations of CHDG than that detectable by absorbance/fluorescence assays (E. coli K-12 BW25113 CHDG MIC = 2 \u00b5M). Extract from the membranes was incubated with 1 \u00d7 10 6 CFU E. coli for 1 h and bacterial survival was assessed by dilution and counting of CFU (Fig. 5b) . Despite this assay being sensitive to increases in concentration of 2 \u00b5M, no significant changes in bacterial survival were observed from the extract of membranes from any time point. When CHDG was extracted www.nature.com/scientificreports/ from the filter by destruction after the final time point, no CFU were recoverable from the E. coli survival assay, confirming that the filters are durable throughout their lifecycle and do not leach significant amounts of CHDG.",

It is well documented that the increase of ventilation can significantly reduce the spread of disease in such areas. However, before the COVID-19 pandemic commenced in 2020 the driving force in HVAC was to have closed systems in order to reduce energy wastage, which in turn limited ventilation possibilities. Train HVAC systems recycle up to 90% of the air in a closed environment and the filters are only designed to remove particles, such as pollution and pollen (6-100 microns), not to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms 21 . This is in contrast to air transport systems, which use HEPA filters (effective from 0.01 micron) to clean the air before recycling it. Despite the target size range for particle filtration being greater than many microorganisms, the filters within HVAC systems have been shown to harbour potentially harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses that can lead to subsequent pollution of the air environment [22] [23] [24] .",

            "text": "There have been multiple attempts to generate efficient antimicrobial air filters to allow standard air filtration systems to remove and inactivate pathogens from air. The most commonly used antimicrobial in the generation of air filters is silver. Silver has been incorporated in a number of different ways through the incorporation of silver/carbon nanotubes into the filter material 25 , the incorporation of chitosan, silver and silica nanoparticles into the filter material 26 or through the generation of a composite fibre of poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic acid) loaded with silver nanoparticles 27 . While these technologies are effective, they take > 18 h to reduce bacterial load. This is a significant drawback, as the nature of HVAC systems requires that the pathogens be killed in seconds as they pass through the filter. As we have demonstrated, there is a high level of microorganism survival on the filter material for extend periods of time, meaning that contaminated filters could behave as a reservoir for pathogens to be dislodged from the filter causing an infection risk hours or days later. The treated filters described in this paper show antimicrobial efficacy in under 60 s against bacteria, fungi and viruses therefore addressing this issue and limiting the potential for re-contamination of the air environment.",

Neither of these is ideal for the majority of existing HVAC systems as they both require significant infrastructure upgrades. In comparison, the technology we report here can be applied to existing filters and used in existing HVAC systems with no modifications. Unlike the novel polymer materials, treatment of filters with CHDG can be applied to any porous filter. Therefore, the base filter www.nature.com/scientificreports/ material does not need to be modified and the treatment can be applied to all filters currently in use in HVAC systems 29 . We have also demonstrated that the CHDG treatment does not impede the existing air flow or fibre diameter of the filters when used in industrial air condensing units and that the technology is durable. This level of compatibility with existing systems removes many of the barriers encountered when new technologies are brought onto the market.",
