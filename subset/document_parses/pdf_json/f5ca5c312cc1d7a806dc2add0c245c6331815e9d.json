METHODS: A survey of perceptions about, and availability and utilization of institutional wellness activities, was distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists nationally. Bivariate analyses were performed using \u03c7 2 tests or independent t tests. Multivariable logistic regression models for categories of institution-sponsored programming as a function of potential predictors of program utilization were performed. Qualitative content analysis was performed for free-text survey answers. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of respondents participated in institution-sponsored wellness opportunities. Debriefs, Schwartz Center Rounds, mental health services, and team building events were the most available institution-sponsored wellness activities, whereas debriefs, team building, Schwartz Center Rounds, and pet therapy were most frequently utilized. Respondents desired greater social/emotional support, improved leadership, enhanced organizational support, and modifications to the physical work environment, with no significant differences across subspecialties for \"wish list\" items. CONCLUSIONS: Physician wellness requires more than a \"one-size-fits-all\" initiative. Our data highlight the importance of encouraging and normalizing self-care practices, and of listening to what physicians articulate about their needs. Preimplementation needs assessment allows a \"bottom-up\" approach where physician voices can be heard.",

            "text": "The importance of physician well-being has moved to the forefront of national dialogue about healthcare. [1] [2] [3] [4] The impact of burnout, secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue, and moral distress on the personal and professional lives of US physicians can no longer be ignored. [4] [5] [6] [7] Institutions and healthcare systems have begun implementing physician \"wellness initiatives\" for students, trainees, and faculty. 8, 9 A working definition of physician wellness has been suggested to include not merely the \"absence of ill-being,\" but \"physical and mental well-being that allows physicians to develop their full potentials across personal and work-life domains.\" 3 To that end, the Triple Aim (enhanced patient experiences, population health, and health cost reduction) has expanded to a Quadruple Aim that incorporates the importance of collective wellbeing of the patient care team to achieve desired healthcare objectives. 10, 11 Despite the inherent difficulties, the most stressful and emotionally challenging elements in physicians' lives may also be the activities from which the greatest satisfaction is derived. 12 Therefore, it is critical to better understand what drives work-related distress and satisfaction and whether there are ways to support one while minimizing the other. Although personal self-care strategies and institution-sponsored programs are both essential for physician wellbeing, workplace initiatives likely have greater impact in reducing burnout. 8, 13 Although some institution-sponsored programs may be effective, little is known about who uses them and how likely they are to be utilized. 8 Of particular importance is understanding which programs/services physicians wish they had available, as this may help target interventions to specific physician audiences and suggest new possibilities to explore.",

In our current study, we conducted a cross-sectional national survey of physicians in five pediatric subspecialties (neonatology, critical care, palliative care, emergency medicine, and hematology-oncology) to: (1) characterize existing institution -sponsored wellness offerings; (2) determine utilization of available institution -sponsored wellness activities; and (3) identify interventions physicians wish were available to them. We hypothesize that desired interventions will be influenced by subspecialty as well as by individual personality characteristics, and that there is a disconnect between wellness programming that is offered to pediatric subspecialists and what they themselves truly desire.",

NICU and HO physicians were less likely than PC and EM providers to have had education about compassion fatigue (P < 0.01) and were also less likely to have received education about burnout when compared with EM (P < 0.01). Personal self-care Virtually all participants engaged in one or more self-care activities outside the workplace. Time spent with family/friends/pets, conversations about work-related distress, and exercise were the most frequently reported personal wellness activities (Table 1) . EM and CC physicians were significantly more likely to exercise than HO (P < 0.004 and P < 0.01, respectively). EM physicians were significantly more likely to talk about work-related distress than CC, HO, or NICU physicians (Supplementary Table S1 ; P < 0.001, P < 0.008, and P < 0.001, respectively). PC physicians were significantly more likely to socialize, explore creative arts as a therapeutic outlet, participate in holistic practices, and utilize mental healthcare services than the other subspecialists (Supplementary Table S1 ), and were the least likely to engage in \"negative behaviors\" (e.g., self-designated excessive food or alcohol consumption, recreation drug abuse; Supplementary Table S1 ).",

The most frequently cited barriers to participation were the (in) convenience of scheduling (45.3%), time constraints (27.2%), the preference of participants to \"handle things on my own\" (34.1%), and the sentiment that partaking in the activity would not be helpful (21.9%). Sixteen percent of participants had \"no idea\" what programs their institution offered for physician wellness, with HO physicians the least aware and PC providers the most aware of available activities (Supplementary Table S2 , P < 0.006). Impediments to participation were independent of subspecialty (Supplementary Table S1 ). While female study participants were significantly more likely than male participants to report \"inconvenience\" of institutionally sponsored wellness programs as a barrier (51.6% vs. 35%, P < 0.01), male physicians were more likely to prefer to \"handle things on their own\" (46% vs. 26.1%, P < 0.001) and to assume that wellness interventions would not be helpful (30% vs. 17%, P < 0.02). Participants who self-identified with \"extroversion\" or \"agreeableness\" were less skeptical of the potential personal value of attending institution-sponsored wellness activities (P < 0.05), while those who identified as \"conscientious\"' were more likely to find events \"too time-consuming\" (P < 0.04). Scheduled debriefs/critical incident management, Schwartz Center Rounds, and professional counseling/support groups were the institutionally sponsored wellness activities that were most available to study participants ( Table 2) .

            "text": "Because compassion fatigue, moral distress, and burnout are interrelated phenomena that negatively impact well-being and professional performance, physicians may be unable to pinpoint a specific cause of their emotional distress. 21, 22 Being able to \"name it to tame it\" 23 may well apply to physician distress. In our study population, nearly two-thirds of participants had some education about burnout, whereas less than half had received education about compassion fatigue. Greater knowledge about the prevalence of these phenomena, as well as their signs and sequelae, may help pediatric subspecialists recognize the importance of integrating selfcare routines into their daily lives. We identified differences in personal self-care practices based on subspecialty, sex, and personality characteristics. While it is perhaps not surprising that PC providers were the most engaged in self-care outside of the workplace, 24 it was unexpected and concerning that NICU physicians in our sample were less involved than the other subspecialists in activities that strengthen social/emotional connections in private life. That female study participants were more likely to utilize social/ emotional liaisons for self-care is also not surprising, given what is understood about differences in relational styles between men and women. 25 Similarly, that \"extroverts\" participated in activities with greater social/emotional connection and that \"neurotics\" were more likely to engage in \"negative\" habits and utilize mental health services was notable but not entirely unexpected. 26, 27 In recent years, many institutions and healthcare organizations around the country have embarked on wellness initiatives to address the widespread problem of physician distress and burnout. 8, 9 The cost of investing in institutional programs to promote physician well-being and retention is far less that the cost of replacing a \"burned-out\" physician. 28 In our study population, the range of available institution-sponsored physician wellness activities differed across pediatric subspecialties. This raises important questions about how institutions determine which wellness interventions to provide. Are pre-implementation needs assessments being performed? 29 Or are less systematic smatterings of activities simply put in place to \"check the box\" of providing physician wellness opportunities? Availability of an institution-sponsored wellness intervention in no way guarantees that the target audience of physicians knows it exists, uses it, or finds it effective in easing compassion fatigue or burnout. In our cohort, nearly 20% of participants reported having \"no idea\" what institution-sponsored self-care activities were available to them. Because it can be extremely difficult for a distressed or \"burnedout\" physician to seek support, it is disheartening that dissemination of this information may be so variable and/or inadequate. That barriers to participation differed by sex and personality traits speaks to the importance of providing more than a \"one-size-fitsall\" approach to what is offered. In our population, while there were significant differences in utilization of institution-sponsored wellness activities across subspecialties, the overall utilization rate was~60%. While this level of involvement in self-care at work is somewhat encouraging, it does not in any way speak to the effectiveness of these interventions. Given the current alarming levels of burnout and dissatisfaction among physicians nationally, some institution-sponsored wellness activities may not be as beneficial as intended. 8 In our study cohort, scheduled team debriefings, Schwartz Center Rounds, mental health services, and organized team building events were the most available institution-sponsored wellness activities, whereas debriefs, organized team building, Schwartz Center Rounds, and pet therapy were the most frequently utilized programs. Interestingly, while professional counseling/support groups were available to 43% of participants, only 17% utilized the intervention. This is in contrast to team building events and pet therapy, which while less available (40% and 18%, respectively), had greater participation (60% and 45%, respectively). It is possible that participants perceive less stigma associated with these activities. 30 This underscores the importance of an institutional culture that views a physician's receipt of mental healthcare as self-care rather than frailty.",

Free-text responses (Fig. 2) included desire for \"more social events within the group to deepen relationships and build camaraderie\" and \"social gathering to share difficult situations and debrief about them.\" This is aligned with the most commonly utilized institutional offerings. Coworker relationships impact overall job satisfaction, and work-related distress arising from coworker conflict has been associated with burnout in some pediatric subspecialists. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] In specific, participants sought increased opportunities for \"real-time debriefing sessions for difficult cases\u2026 either after a death or even during care of a critically ill patient.\" Debriefs/critical incident management has been shown to provide a sense of support and community, and may improve resilience. 31 The knowledge that peers face similar struggles can serve as a source of relief. However, successful critical incident management requires skill and sensitivity in order to avoid causing additional traumatic stress. 32 There are several limitations to our study. Our survey response rate was low, which raises reasonable concerns about nonresponse bias. Response rates to physician surveys have declined steeply in recent years, with job demands and email/survey fatigue as the most commonly cited reasons. 33, 34 There is no scientifically validated, minimally acceptable survey response rate, and a low response rate, in and of itself, is not an indicator of response bias. 35 Survey response rates are not strongly associated with survey quality. 36 That said, we acknowledge that our response rate (at <10% in this pilot study) may introduce a greater degree of non-response bias. It is not possible to compare variables between those who responded to the survey and those who did not. However, because pediatric academic subspecialists share similar attitudes and behaviors, it is possible that responders and non-responders have comparable characteristics and thus provide similar responses. Contact information for some study participants may have been outdated; thus, our response rate may actually have been higher than our calculation. 37 We did not query social/emotional support, improvements to leadership, organizational support, and modifications to the physical work environment.

However, actualization of physician wellness requires more than simply implementing a \"one-size-fits-all\" wellness initiative. Institutional leadership must continue to work diligently and thoughtfully to change the current pervasive culture that contributes to physician distress. 38 Our data highlight the importance of providing better education to pediatric subspecialists about sources and sequelae of work-related distress, of encouraging and normalizing physician selfcare practices both at home and in the workplace, and of listening and responding to what physicians articulate about their own needs. Thus, pre-implementation needs assessment allows a \"bottom-up\" approach where physician voices can be heard and, hopefully, answered.",
