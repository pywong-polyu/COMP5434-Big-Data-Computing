This is not only contrary to conventional wisdom, but also runs counter to what was observed during previous infectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola [45, 46] as well as to the literature reporting on the effects of COVID-19 on Mental Health [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 47, 48] . Despite the fact that during the Measures period the temperature was warmer and there was more sunshine than usual, the analysis on weather data for Germany did not show a significant impact on the changed mental health symptoms. Our findings are supported by a growing body of evidence from ongoing studies [49] and recently published research [50] , as well as anecdotal evidence reported in various mainstream media reports [51] [52] [53] which suggest that at least in the short-term the mental health effects of the COVID-19 measures may not be as negative as expected. One factor may be that the stress of everyday life and work/study is reduced during lockdown and home office/schooling. In addition, the reduction of excessive daytime sleepiness may be due to .

Second, the data is user-driven as a user self-reports their symptoms during an assessment on their own initiative. This allows for identification of changes that would not be detected in traditional studies focusing on specific and/or predefined areas. Third, the large number of symptoms presented in the results that are consistent with expectations, the observation of seasonal differences, and that the results were observed in both Germany and the UK is an indication of the reliability of Ada's data, demonstrated especially by the detected increase in the less frequent but typical COVID-19 symptoms hyposmia and diminished sense of taste.
