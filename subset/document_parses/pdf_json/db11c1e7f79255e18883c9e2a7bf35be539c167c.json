In this paper, the application of the ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm in clinical anesthesia was studied. In this paper, 24 patients who underwent lung examination under medical anesthesia at our hospital were evaluated by the ultrasound vertical mixed echo method. rough patient voluntary selection and consent, 16 patients were examined with B-mode ultrasound and the other 8 patients with M-mode ultrasound to compare the effects of different ultrasounds on diaphragm image quality. In addition, this paper also analyzes the differences between different ultrasounds and the strengths and weaknesses of diaphragmatic ultrasound evaluation in clinical anesthesia. e suggestions of using different ultrasounds in ultrasonic evaluation are given. e study showed that 16 cases of B-mode ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm obtained ultrasound images which showed a large field of vision, acoustic frequency between 7 and 18 MHz, and thickness difference between 0.35 and 0.52 cm. In 8 patients with the diaphragm evaluated by M-mode ultrasound, the local features of M-mode ultrasound images were clearer than those of B-mode ultrasound images, but the visual field area was smaller, the acoustic frequency was between 10 and 15 MHz, and the thickness difference was between 0.12 and 0.18 cm. Based on the above data, this paper suggests that, in the ultrasonic evaluation of the diaphragm, B-mode ultrasound should be used to check the patients first, and then M-mode ultrasound should be used to check the parts with poor quality so that the accurate diaphragm quality of patients can be obtained in the vast majority of patients.",

During anesthesia, the breathing is not smooth. At this time, the energy efficiency of the pulmonary membrane is very important for the safety of people under anesthesia. For example, patients after surgery can be evaluated within 1 hour of mechanical ventilation treatment (60%-70% of the total). Ultrasound evaluation means that it usually needs two to three times of trial failure, which can be successfully evaluated within 7 days after repeated evaluation by clinicians and clinical intervention. Chronic obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease, heart failure, neuromuscular diseases, and other potential causes often exist in these patients. ere is a long time between the complex underlying diseases of patients and the primary diseases leading to acute respiratory failure.",

However, there is no research on the application of tubeless technology in the treatment of respiratory diseases. is paper fills the gap in this field and provides a reference for further research in the future [1] . Wang et al.' s research showed that the transurethral vaporization of the prostate with the 980 nm/ 1470 nm dual-wavelength laser under local anesthesia has good efficacy and safety and minimizes the length of hospital stay and hospitalization costs. It is considered that the transurethral vaporization of the prostate with the dualwavelength laser under local anesthesia can be applied to high-risk patients with BPH [2] . Liu et al. reported that the change of the blood lactate level before and after SBT can be used as a reference index to guide the evaluation time, and the success rate of the evaluation plan based on blood lactate level monitoring is significantly higher [3] . Chen et al.'s study also showed that the blood lactate level is one of the important indicators to evaluate the outcome of patients receiving device ventilation for more than 7 days [4] . Ohsumi et al. proposed that the diaphragm motion parameter, especially diaphragm mobility, is a new widely used evaluation and prediction index, and its prediction effect has been affirmed by some researchers. e blood lactate level is a new indicator that had potential predictive value in recent years [5] .",

Garutti et al. explored the predictive value of diaphragm motion parameters combined with the blood lactate level before and after SBT in evaluating the outcome in order to find a method that can accurately predict the outcome of patients receiving long-term mechanical ventilation and provide reference for clinical guidance in selecting the evaluation time [7] . Bertani et al. proposed that the use of propofol or inhaled anesthetics during operation did not increase the risk of delirium within 3 days after cardiac surgery. Compared with the propofol group, the incidence of delirium in the inhaled anesthesia group had no significant difference [8] . Watanabe et al. proposed that delirium results are different in different trials due to different evaluation methods and objects. CAM-ICU was used to evaluate delirium. is method is easy to master, and the evaluation time is short. Studies have shown that the sensitivity of this method is 93%, and the specificity is 98% [9] . Qin et al. were induced by intravenous anesthesia. Some studies suggest that propofol is used in combination during anesthesia induction, which has been proved to weaken the potential benefits of inhalation anesthetics and may affect the test results [10] . e time of delirium assessment in the above studies is short, and there are few studies related to delirium mainly due to valve surgery. And there is no use of ultrasound evaluation to detect the pulmonary diaphragm, so the lack of entity detection is not enough to pay attention to the safety of anesthesia.",

Some guidelines pointed out that when the treatment of patients with primary disease turns, it should be considered to let patients pull out the endotracheal intubation and breathe autonomously [11] . At the same time, some studies have confirmed that nearly half of the ventilation treatment time is used by clinicians to evaluate the timing and implementation process of the evaluation. Removal of endotracheal intubation is not only an important milestone in the process of improving a patient's condition but also poses a considerable risk of complications and failure. Without considering the changes of patients' condition and the pathophysiological changes of evaluation, clinicians rashly decide the time of evaluation and implement the evaluation [12] .",

            "text": "In clinical practice, we usually divide the assessment, time required, and difficulty level into simple assessment, ultrasound assessment, and extended assessment. Simple assessment means that patients can complete the assessment of the ventilator and extubation after the first SBT. ese kinds of patients usually have no basic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and their respiratory circulation is relatively stable [13] . Prolonged evaluation refers to the failure of three SBT trials or failure of evaluation after repeated evaluation by clinicians and clinical intervention for more than 7 days after the first SBT [14] . Some patients with prolonged assessment may have dysphagia or respiratory muscle strength problems and other irreversible factors, leading to the need for long-term mechanical ventilation treatment. Screening of evaluation: in some ICUs, senior doctors still make decisions on the evaluation time, but this evaluation method has a high failure rate in all kinds of ICUs. At present, the implementation of daily sedation interruption and SBT trial is encouraged [15] . e application of a rigid bronchoscope in airway diagnosis and treatment has the advantages of simultaneous operation and ventilation, but in terms of the semiclosed state of the whole respiratory circuit and the frequent entry and exit of instruments in the operation process, it cannot effectively avoid the occurrence of air leakage in the circuit [16] . In addition, due to the high responsiveness of the airway itself, the operating space is narrow, and repeated stimulation is easy to cause airway bleeding, edema, spasm, and asphyxia, aggravating the obstruction of ventilation and oxygenation. erefore, it is very important to find a safe and feasible anesthesia airway management method. In this paper, in order to reduce the occurrence of airway spasm, edema, and other events, both groups were given aminophylline, hormone, and other means as preventive use before operation [17] . During the operation, total intravenous anesthesia was used for induction and maintenance, which effectively avoided the environmental pollution caused by the leakage of inhalation anesthetics. At the same time, Narcotrend continuous EEG monitoring can well guide the maintenance of anesthesia depth and better inhibit the stress reaction caused by the placement of the rigid bronchoscope and the operation process in the airway so that the perioperative hemodynamic indexes of the two groups of patients can be relatively stable as a whole so that the operation can be carried out smoothly without malignant arrhythmia adverse events such as airway spasm, and even surgery termination occurred [18] . Although the heart rate and blood pressure of the two groups fluctuated to a certain extent compared with before operation, the mean arterial pressure was above 65 mmHg, which could better meet the requirements of important tissue and organ perfusion [19] . In addition, it is not difficult to find that the incidence of circulatory instability in the ultrasound evaluation group is obviously higher in a short time. e fluctuation of blood pressure may be related to the changes of intrathoracic pressure and carbon dioxide retention caused by intermittent hand-assisted ventilation. In aeration, there was hypoxemia in the ultrasound evaluation group, and carbon dioxide retention events were significantly higher than those in the S-ultrasound evaluation group. Although intermittent hand control could improve ventilation to some extent, hypercholesterolemia occurred in all patients, and overall pH in the internal environment was not conducive to the management of anesthesia [20] . e reason is that ultrasound evaluation is affected by the Venturi effect and surgical operation. With the increase of injection frequency, the inhaled tidal volume gradually decreases, thus aggravating the obstacle of carbon dioxide discharge. erefore, it is not suitable for long-term surgical treatment [21] . e S-ultrasound evaluation group was significantly better than the ultrasound evaluation group in maintaining normal oxygenation, without hypoxemia, and internal environment pH and PaCO 2 were basically maintained at normal levels, so it was more safe and feasible [22] . As a new type of ventilation mode combining normal frequency ventilation with high-frequency ventilation, S-ultrasound evaluation can form a pulse-type inspiratory pressure platform and positive endexpiratory pressure. e pulmonary inspiratory pressure platform produced by normal frequency infusion allows the patient to obtain adequate minute ventilation, improve lung mobilization, promote carbon dioxide release, avoid repeated absorption, and further oxygenate. High-frequency jets can create positive end-expiratory pressure in the lungs.",

Comprehensive monitoring was established, including ECG, invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, body temperature, urine volume, end-expiratory carbon dioxide, central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO), stroke variability, and peripheral vascular resistance. e mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (SPAP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PAWP) were continuously monitored with a floating catheter. Arterial blood gas analysis, coagulation, and platelet function were measured at any time. One patient in the tubeless group had a small amount of pneumothorax after operation, which was considered as the residual gas in the thoracic cavity after operation and then gradually absorbed and disappeared. erefore, residual gas in the chest cavity should be carefully inhaled at the end of surgery to fully secure lung mobilization and reduce postoperative complications. Compensatory hyperhidrosis is a special complication after thoracoscopic thoracic resection. e mechanism is unclear, and it is mostly considered to be related to the scope of nerve transection. In this study, 3 cases of mild compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred, and the incidence is lower than the previous research level. e application of the tubeless technology also puts forward higher requirements for the operation team, such as the following: anesthesiologists must be able to change the mode of anesthesia during the operation and solve various emergencies during the operation, such as hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Surgeons must establish accurate evaluation standards and strictly grasp the surgical indications to ensure the safety of patients. Due to the lack of postoperative thoracic drainage, postoperative nursing management is also a great challenge. It is necessary to establish a complete system, such as reasonable selection of surgical patients, perioperative management, formulation of discharge standards, and out-of-hospital follow-up. Figure 1 , there is no significant difference in common postoperative complications and compensatory hyperhidrosis between the two groups, but there are still some shortcomings. Most of the patients seeking surgical treatment are moderate and severe patients. erefore, the number of cases in this study is limited. For patients with obesity, poor lung function, and severe intrathoracic adhesions, the application of this technique is limited, so it is necessary to strictly grasp the surgical indications and contraindications.

Rapid inflation may lead to recruitment pulmonary edema, and it is necessary to prevent hypotension caused by ischemiareperfusion.

In 8 patients with the diaphragm evaluated by M-mode ultrasound, the local features of M-mode ultrasound images were clearer than those of B-mode ultrasound images, but the visual field area was smaller, the acoustic frequency was between 10 and 15 MHz, and the thickness difference was between 0.12 and 0.18 cm. Based on the above data, this paper suggests that, in the ultrasonic evaluation of the diaphragm, B-mode ultrasound should be used to check the patients first, and then M-mode ultrasound should be used to check the parts with poor quality so that the accurate diaphragm quality of patients can be obtained in the vast majority of patients.",

In terms of drug use, the average daily consumption of morphine equivalent in the cancer group was close to that in other studies, while the average daily consumption of morphine equivalent in the noncancer group was lower than that in other studies. In addition, 4.8% of the outpatients who prescribed opioids were noncancer patients, of which 3.3% were noncancer pain patients, which was far lower than other research results. e above results indicate that there are still many obstacles to the use of opioid analgesics in the management of noncancer pain associated with physicians, patients, and families. Doctors' pain and misunderstandings of opioid analgesics lead to inadequate pain management. According to the results of a study, most doctors consider it legal and acceptable to prescribe opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain, but only half of them hold this view for chronic noncancer pain. Many clinicians are reluctant to prescribe opioid analgesics because of the risk of addiction and abuse. In addition, doctors tend to prescribe low-dose opioid analgesics for patients because they are worried about the investigation of opioid analgesics. e drugs are limited to the first or second step analgesics of the three-step analgesic therapy of the World Health Organization. In view of the above problems, pharmacists need to further communicate with doctors to improve their understanding of opioid analgesics, so as to provide adequate pain control for noncancer patients. Secondly, there are obstacles in the use of opioid analgesics such as the fear of adverse drug reactions and addiction and the belief that pain is inevitable and uncontrollable. e adverse reactions of opioid analgesics, such as constipation and nausea, may limit the dosage of opioid analgesics and lead to early withdrawal or insufficient analgesia. 15%-40% of patients receiving opioid analgesics will have nausea and vomiting, and 87% of patients will have constipation. e fear of opioid addiction exists in most patients, their families, and some doctors. In this case, it is necessary to educate the patients and their families about the use of opioids.",

In the future, multicenter and large-sample experiments are still needed to prove the predictive value of each index. However, in the data collection stage, whether the measurement of inferior vena cava variability or diaphragm displacement, the measurer must have the qualification of severe ultrasound examination, but there are still subjective factors in the measurement process. In this paper, because the measurement of the left diaphragm displacement is affected by the movement of the heart and lung and the interference of gastrointestinal cavity organs, it is difficult to measure, so the measurement index did not collect the left diaphragm displacement. e limitation of this experiment lies in that there is no dynamic monitoring of multiple time nodes when the measurement time node is SBT 30 min. In the ICU, every clinical intervention and evaluation is the embodiment of clinical experience and wisdom of clinicians. It is expected that there will be better indicators and safer methods to implement the evaluation, so as to benefit patients.",
