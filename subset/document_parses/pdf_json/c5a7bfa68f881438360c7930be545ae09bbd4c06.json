I examine the gains from considering heterogeneous interpersonal interactions (homophily), which induce potential contamination, when designing testing pools. Homophily can be identified ex ante at a scale commensurate with pool size, so that the risk of contamination is higher within a well-designed pool than with an outsider. This makes it possible to overcome the usual information-theoretic limits of group testing which rely on an implicit homogeneity assumption. More importantly, group testing with homophily detects asymptomatic carriers that would be missed even by exhaustive individual testing because of false negatives. Such a strategy should be implemented at least at a weekly frequency to fit the time profile of test positivity. It can be used either to avoid unnecessary lockdowns or to make lockdowns more efficient.",

Pools may include a few dozen individuals, at most one hundred (See Section 4 on dilution). Thus, it is needed to identify ex ante potential clusters of limited size. Madewell et al. (2020) report that \"To better understand clustering within households, it would also be useful for researchers to report the number of infections by household in addition to the total number of infected individuals.\" Unfortunately, this is rarely done, so that the feasibility of the strategy here analyzed must be evaluated indirectly. This can be done for instance by looking at studies on small clusters with high attack rate (ratio of contaminated people in a given group) or secondary attack rate (SAR is the number of people contaminated by an index case, divided by the people in contact with this index case). Koh, Naing, Rozledzana et al. (2020) provide a meta-analysis of 20 studies on secondary attack rate. Household is quite often the place where the SAR is highest (15.4% on average), and Qiu et al.

For that purpose, I evidence that if homophily is \"strong\" enough and can be properly identified when designing the pooled tests -more specifically, when designing the pools -, it makes it possible to overcome the most recent and tight information-theoretic lower bounds on the efficiency of group testing. These limits have been identified by Chan et al. (2011) who, for the first time in the literature, define limits in terms of actual numbers and not only rate or capacity, and Baldassini et al. (2013) , who follow the same path and provide a new and tighter lower bound.",

(2020) point to patient-specific idiosyncratic noise. These two issues are analyzed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively, and I show that taking homophily into account brings specific gains. Conversely, the general form noise models (such as the symmetric error model, see e.g. Chan et al. , 2011 , or the additive model, see e.g. Atia and Saligrama, 2012) are not relevant to analyze these forms of noises, so that there is no need to provide a general noisy-models analysis. I consider noiseless tests for different other reasons. First, this makes it clear that the benefits of taking homophily into account in group testing are not limited to noise-related issues. Second, it makes the comparison with the information-theoretic limit of Baldassini et al. (2013) easier. Baldassini et al. (2013, Section III) analyze a noiseless test in a population of size N, with K defectives (K is known for simplicity). They show that if the number of tests is limited to T, the probability of correct identification of the set of defectives is:",

Think of testing the 8 groups independently in a first step and testing individually all people in the first two groups that turn positive in the first step. With decent homophily, this strategy would likely provide a very good probability of success while (1) would give a bound equal to 0.3 %. Actually, (1) would not apply since the strategies examined by Baldassini et al.

The rate is even lower for the pharyngeal swabs: 11 % to 61.3 %; once again higher for the swabs collected over the first week (60 % to 61.3 %). Wang, Xu, Gao et al. (2020) analyze eight types of samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, sputum, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, feces, bood and urine). They also find a high rate for false negative for individual nasal swabs and even more for pharyngeal swabs. They also point the very poor performance of rRt-PCR tests based on blood and urine. Wang, Tan, Wang et al. (2020) compare the detection performance of individual nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for 535 patients. They also find better results for the former, and find that using both tests increase detection slightly over nasopharyngeal alone, which confirms the existence for false negatives for both. Overall, nasal swabs, which are widely used for rRT-PCR identification of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang, Hu, Hu et al., 2020) , display a significant rate of false negatives. Yang, Yang, Shen et al. (2020) underline cases in which all upper respiratory tests (or all upper respiratory tests over a given period) are negative for confirmed COVID-19 patients. This points to the fact that false negative results are related to specific individuals rather than mere technical errors.",

If \u03b1 is the proportion of false negatives in carriers and false negative individuals are i.i.d. in the population of carriers, the risk of missing the identification of a carrier is \u03b1 for individual tests and for test with only one carrier in a pool, but it is \u03b1\u00b2 if there are 2 carriers in the pool\u2026 and \u03b1 n if there are n carriers.

If homophily was disregarded when designing the pools and carriers are distributed i.id. in the pools, it is likely that five groups contain each 1 carrier (1 1 1 1 1) or one group will contain 2 carriers and 3 groups will each contain 1 (2 1 1 1) .

Furthermore, the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is painful. The social acceptance of its large scale repeated collection is unlikely for COVID-19, which has a rather limited mortality rate. 5",

Indeed, RT-PCR based on nasal swabs are efficient over the first two weeks after onset, so that a test implemented every fortnight is likely to identify asymptomatic carriers if they follow a pattern similar to mild cases. Conversely, the rate of false negatives soars afterwards. The efficiency of BALF is questionable for asymptomatic carriers. Thus, the second step should be based either on upper respiratory track swabs alone or on a combination with CT-scan or radiographs. If the latter are not widely available, it is crucial to implement complementary exams, and the whole procedure, weekly. 5 Whether sputum can be used in the first step instead of or together with nasal swab is on open question. In the second step (individual complementary exams), if the sputum test is negative, the individual undergoes additional exams which are likely discover the presence of the disease and may include painful bronchoalveolar lavage. Thus, cheating during the series of complementary exams is irrational. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

This percentage of availability is applied to the percentage of positive identification in columns 3 to 6. When available, RT-PCR is highly positive for actual carriers. Requires trained operator and specific suction device; the procedure is painful for the patient. Very efficient according to Wang, Xu, Gao et al. (2020) but inefficient for mild cases according to Yang, Yang, Shen et al. (2020) 2g CT scan ? High % ? High % ? High % ?CT scan is implemented by Yang, Shen et al. (2020) for 3 carriers, including one without positive results for any previous RT-PCR test on upper or lower respiratory track swabs. Results are positive but the sample is too small. Computations of cumulative probability of identification are based on the assumption that the probabilities of identification at different steps are uncorrelated.",
