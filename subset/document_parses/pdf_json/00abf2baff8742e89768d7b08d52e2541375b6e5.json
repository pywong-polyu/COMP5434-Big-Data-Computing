These protocols are based on using pointof-care (POC) glucose testing and, therefore, are inherently limited because of the infrequency by which POC is performed. In the noncritical care setting, where most patients are hospitalized, POC is recommended to be performed four to six times per day (8) , leaving extended intervals of time where hypoglycemia may occur undetected. Hospitalized patients with diabetes may also experience altered mental status secondary to underlying medical conditions or medications with sedating properties, resulting in an inability to recognize and/or report symptoms of hypoglycemia to the nursing staff. Furthermore, busy hospital environments and increased nursing workload can lead to decreased patient monitoring and surveillance. Overall, these hospital-related factors place patients with diabetes at risk for undetected and severe prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures, coma, arrhythmias, increased length of stay (LOS), or death (4, 9, 11) .",

Compared with POC, CGM systems measure glucose levels every few minutes, increasing surveillance during these otherwise extended time intervals. With the ability to set low glucose alerts, CGM systems can be used to prevent hypoglycemia. However, compared with the outpatient setting where CGM use is growing, use of CGM devices in the hospital setting is still considered investigational (12) . This is partly due to the lack of proven benefits from randomized controlled clinical trials, especially in the noncritical setting. Another major limitation relates to current CGM system design, which is intended for outpatient use. In the inpatient setting, the CGM receiving device would need to be placed at or near the patient's bedside, posing a logistical challenge because nursing staff would need to frequently enter the patient's room to view the glucose values or hear the audible alerts (13) . This would be an impractical method to monitor large numbers of hospitalized patients with diabetes.",

This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to explore the benefits of RT-CGM devices using GTS in patients with diabetes in this environment. In this article, we present results from a planned interim analysis conducted as required by the institutional review board (IRB) for safety monitoring, which included evaluating differences in hypoglycemia between the two groups. Similar to what has occurred with many trials nationally, the study was halted shortly after the interim analysis was completed because of safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as per IRB and data safety monitoring board recommendations.

After randomization, Dexcom G6 CGM systems (Dexcom, San Diego, CA) were placed by the study team members. Participants randomized to RT-CGM/ GTS had an iPhone at the bedside that transmitted glucose values to an iPad at the nursing station. A detailed description of GTS has previously been published (14, 19) . In short, GTS consisted of three components: a Dexcom CGM device, an iPhone, and an iPad (14) ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Using Dexcom software applications, glucose values were sent from the sensor/transmitter through Bluetooth to an iPhone located in the patient's room (serving as an intermitting routing device). These data were further transmitted, using a commercially available Internet network, to an iPad located at the nursing station. Both the iPhones and the iPads were supported by research funds; no personal devices were used in this study. In this group, low-glucose alerts were set to ,85 mg/dL on the iPad at the nursing station. Similar to cardiac telemetry, nursing staff were educated to notify the patient's assigned nurse to initiate the hypoglycemia preventive action if he/she was unavailable when a glucose value ,85 mg/dL was observed or an audible alert was heard because it is impractical for the patient's assigned nurse to consistently remain near the iPad. Nursing staff were requested to obtain a POC for hypoglycemia alarms as permitted and to provide at least 15 g of carbohydrates (15-16 g using glucose tablets/glucose gel/juice) for impending hypoglycemia. Nurses were instructed to give another 15 g if inadequate response in the glucose value occurred. Although the focus of our study was to prevent hypoglycemia and not hyperglycemia, high-glucose alerts were set at 400 mg/dL because we believed that it would be unethical to turn the high alerts off.",

Secondary outcomes were percentage of time spent in hypoglycemic range ,70 mg/dL and hypoglycemic event rates (defined as number of hypoglycemic events/ patient/day). Additional secondary outcomes included differences in clinically significant hypoglycemic events per patient (defined as CGM glucose values ,54 mg/dL for .15 min) and percentage of time below range (TBR) ,54 mg/ dL. We also examined whether there was any difference in nocturnal hypoglycemic events per patient (defined as hypoglycemic events ,70 mg/dL or clinically significant hypoglycemic events ,54 mg/dL occurring between midnight and 6:00 A.M.) and prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia (defined as hypoglycemia ,70 mg/dL or clinically significant hypoglycemia ,54 mg/dL for .120 min). Although our trial was not focused on improving hyperglycemia, a secondary outcome was to evaluate whether there was increased hyperglycemia by preventing hypoglycemia. To evaluate this, we calculated the percentage of time above range (TAR) .180-250 mg/dL and TAR .250 mg/dL as well as time in range (TIR) 70-180 mg/dL (23).

We believe that the proposed intervention of using RT-CGM/GTS, along with a simplified hypoglycemia prevention protocol, could serve as a useful tool to modify existing institutional hypoglycemia prevention protocols. A strength of our study was evaluating RT-CGM/GTS in the general wards, a setting where glucose monitoring is more limited (four to six times per day), in contrast to the ICU, where glucose values can be intensively monitored and checked hourly, if needed (19) . Results from this analysis did not reveal a reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia with use of RT-CGM/GTS, a condition that can lead to severe hypoglycemic events (33) . The lack of a statistically significant difference in nocturnal hypoglycemia may be attributable to the fact that a common cause of hypoglycemia in the hospital setting is meal interruptions (15) . This is most likely to occur during the day when procedures or imaging studies are usually performed, when patients may receive prandial insulin and are unable to complete their meal. Additionally, we may have been underpowered to meet significance for nocturnal hypoglycemia. With a larger sample size, this trend of less nocturnal hypoglycemia in RT-CGM/GTS use may meet statistical significance.",

Although our study population included mainly male patients, we believe that our findings can be extrapolated because there are no known sex-specific differences in the incidence of inpatient hypoglycemia or in the prevention of hypoglycemia with CGM use. Additionally, we evaluated the use of the RT-CGM/GTS in patients considered to be high risk for inpatient hypoglycemia versus all admitted patients with diabetes. We focused on this subgroup of patients because we believe that this population would most likely benefit from the proposed hypoglycemia prevention interventions. We also did not evaluate whether use of RT-CGM/GTS can improve hyperglycemia. Because both groups had insulin increased on the basis of POC, it was not surprising that there was no improvement in normoglycemia or hyperglycemia. However, current ongoing studies will evaluate whether RT-CGM/GTS use can reduce hyperglycemia in the non-ICU setting (NCT03877068, ClinicalTrials.gov). Finally, we did not collect satisfaction surveys focusing on use of GTS; future studies are needed to evaluate nursing satisfaction.",

This may be due to the minimal amount of carbohydrates used (i.e., 15 g for glucose between 70 and 85 mg/dL), which increases blood glucose sufficiently to prevent clinically significant hypoglycemia without causing significant hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Reduction in hypoglycemic events with GTS may be expected to reduce TAR as a result of decreased posthypoglycemic rebound hyperglycemia (secondary to counterregulatory hormones), a benefit that we did not observe in our study. Mechanistic studies are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.",

The nonsignificantly higher number in the RT-CGM/GTS group is likely secondary to POC testing following hypoglycemia alarms. This occurred 41 of 80 times after alarms were detected. Scheduled premeal/ bedtime POC obtained immediately before the alarms were not accounted for, and in these cases, perhaps nurses were not compelled to repeat POC before intervening given the recent measurement. This study was conducted in a busy clinical environment and not in a research facility with the benefit of having an individual assigned nurse. Therefore, POC may have been bypassed to avoid delays in treating a symptomatic patient or when the busy workflow did not permit it (i.e., caring for another, more severely ill hospitalized patient or transporting a sick patient to radiology for imaging).",

We believe that widespread dissemination of these findings in the context of this health crisis could be important. During this emergency, providers have implemented inpatient use of CGM devices, which is still considered investigational. RT-CGM/GTS may be beneficial in this environment, although there is a lack of efficacy data about RT-CGM use in the hospital. In this article, we report that the use of RT-CGM devices through glucose telemetry can reduce inpatient hypoglycemia effectively. RT-CGM/GTS as a method of glucose monitoring could reduce the need for frequent entry of staff into patient rooms (typically four to six times daily to check POC). This would additionally reduce personal protective equipment utilization and decrease risk of exposure and transmission between patients and hospital staff. Finally, by reducing time that nursing staff spend checking POC, the extra time could be reallocated to taking care of patients who have more emergent and critical needs. It is estimated that each POC test requires 5 min on average to perform (25, 34) . This benefit, which under normal circumstances would alleviate overburdened nursing staff, is now underscored as a result of the pandemic crisis.",
