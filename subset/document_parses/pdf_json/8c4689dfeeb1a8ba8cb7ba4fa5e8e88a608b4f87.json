South Africa has the largest burden of HIV worldwide but also has a growing burden of non-communicable diseases; potentially leading to uncommon disease combinations. Information about the prevalence of multimorbidity and factors associated with it can assist in healthcare planning and targeting groups of people for interventions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity by age and sex, as well as factors associated with multimorbidity in people 15 years and older. This study analyses the nationally representative 2016 South African Demographic Health Survey. The sample included 10 336 people who participated in the Adult Health questionnaire and approximately 7 961 people who provided biomarkers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to measure the association of multimorbidity with age, sex, living in an urban or rural area, education level, wealth level, employment status, body mass index, current alcohol or tobacco use. All analyses were conducted using STATA 15. Multimorbidity was present in 20.7% (95% CI: 19.5%-21.9%) of participants; in 14.8% (95% CI: 13.4% -16.3%) of males and 26.2% (95% CI: 24.7-27.7%) of females. Multimorbidity increased with age; with the highest odds in the 55-64 years old age group (OR: 24.910, 95% CI: 14.901-41.641, p < 0.001) compared to those aged 15-24 years. The odds of multimorbidity was also higher in young females compared to young males (OR: 2.734, 95% CI: 1.50-4.99, p = 0.001). Possessing tertiary education (OR: 0.722, 95% CI: 0.537-0.97, p = 0.031), being employed (OR: 0.813, 95% CI: 0.675-0.979, p = 0.029) or currently using alcohol (OR: 0.815, 95% CI: 0.686-0.968, p = 0.02) was protective against multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is prevalent within the South African population, with females and older adults being most affected. However, multimorbidity is also observed in younger adults and most likely driven by the high prevalence of HIV and hypertension.",

South Africa has a very high HIV prevalence and it is not uncommon that people living with HIV also develop other chronic conditions. Given this HIV burden, information is needed on the prevalence of multimorbidity to plan for more responsive healthcare services. This information is valuable for planning purposes as health service delivery could be made more efficient around common disease clusters to the benefit of those living with multimorbidity. Knowing who is most affected by multimorbidity (i.e. determinants or factors that are common in those affected) can also be used to design interventions to target those individuals. While multimorbidity research has been emerging in the country for the past decade, few studies have reported the prevalence of multimorbidity and factors associated with it in a consistent and comparable manner [18] . The authors conducted a systematic review of multimorbidity prevalence studies in South Africa and found significant heterogeneity in the study designs as well as the estimates of prevalence [18] . Of the studies included [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , the prevalence of multimorbidity ranged from 3 to 87%. In addition, the factors associated with multimorbidity were disparate and at times contradictory. Among the factors that were occasionally associated with multimorbidity in South Africa were: age, being female, locality, education level, body mass index (BMI) and marital status.",

National surveys represent a largely untapped resource that could shed light on multimorbidity in the general population. This is especially true for LMICs such as South Africa where limited information exists about multimorbidity. The DHS project, primarily funded by the United States Agency for International Development has conducted more than 230 nationally representative comparable household surveys in more than 80 countries since 1984 [28] . The DHS collects data on a range of topics such as fertility, contraception, maternal and child health, HIV, malaria and domestic violence [28] . For many countries, the DHS is an important source of information for policy making, monitoring and evaluation and as the country's public health evidence base [28] . In terms of multimorbidity, the DHS collects information on self-reported health conditions and biological markers. This paper presents a secondary analysis of national survey data from the SADHS 2016. The survey is nationally representative with the aim of providing up-to-date estimates of demographic and health indicators such as information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, contraceptive use, nutrition, child mortality, aspects of child health, exposure to the risk of HIV infection, behaviour and health indicators [29] . The SADHS 2016 also collected information on anthropometry, anaemia, hypertension, HbA1c levels and HIV among adults 15 years and older.",

Various studies have used this technique when doing secondary data analysis [32] . Estimation of multimorbidity included: self-reported diseases (e.g. bronchitis/ COPD, heart disease, high blood cholesterol, stroke, TB in the last 12 months), biomarker disease (e.g. HIV, anaemia, high blood pressure) and a combination of the two (i.e. diabetes). Disease variables were coded as binary (disease absent '0' or disease present '1'). An index variable was created where for each individual, the number of disease conditions present was counted. If there was information about a disease condition missing, this was counted as \"no disease present\". The disease index variable was further categorised to create another variable, the Multimorbidity Index. This variable categorised individuals into either having \"no multimorbidity\" (no disease or only one disease present) or \"multimorbidity present\" (two diseases or more present).",

[20] used the 2007/2008 World Health Organization Study on global AGEing (SAGE) and adult health and found a prevalence of 63.4% in adults over the age of 50 years. Most of these studies included self-reported diseases and physically measured hypertension. Self-reported diseases are likely to be underreported as people may be unaware that they have a disease. The DHS physically measured more diseases compared to the National Income Dynamic Surveys and World Health Survey (i.e. HIV, diabetes and anaemia) which may explain its ability to detect higher levels of multimorbidity. The number of disease conditions included in each study also varied. The Garin et al. [20] study was restricted to adults over the age of 50 years and included a larger number of disease conditions (e.g. depression, cognitive impairment, edentulism and obesity as a disease condition) and therefore reported higher prevalence of multimorbidity. A recent analysis of Wave 2 SAGE (2014/ 2015) [47] of adults aged 45 years and older, included fewer disease conditions than Garin et al. [20] (7 vs. 12); reported a multimorbidity prevalence of 21%. Another discrepancy to note is that the 2016 DHS was more recently conducted than the other national surveys.",

            "text": "In terms of factors associated with multimorbidity, an increasing age was associated with being multimorbid. This follows trends in reporting in international [39] and the South African literature on multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is often associated with older adults, especially in high income countries [48] due to shifting demographic trends whereby people are living longer, ageing and developing chronic diseases of lifestyle. However, our study had an interesting finding in observing that multimorbidity was present in 10% of young adults between the ages of 20-29 years. This is most likely attributed to the high prevalence of single disease such as HIV, anaemia and hypertension in South Africa. HIV is known to affect younger adults in South Africa. A South African national HIV prevalence survey indicated that 7.9% of people (4.8% of males, 10.9% of females) aged 15-24 years were HIV positive in 2017 [49] . Also, the prevalence of hypertension in South Africa is thought to be increasing. In young South Africans, hypertension is frequently associated with having a family history of the disease (suggesting a genetic component) and obesity or metabolic syndrome [50, 51] . In this study, approximately 32% of people with HIV under 30 years of age, also had hypertension (S3 Fig in S1 File) . This has implications for young people in that they will have to be on lifelong treatment for both diseases.",

However, a systematic review of education levels and multimorbidity in Southeast Asia found the association was inconsistent [53] . This study found that being employed decreased the odds of multimorbidity. Similar results were found in an analysis of social determinants and multimorbidity in South Africa [46] . Yet, this could also be interpreted to mean that healthier people are more likely to be employed. In a systematic review of multimorbidity and its impact on workers, multimorbidity was found to have a negative impact on work, worsening absenteeism and lowering employability [54] . The wealth index was not significantly associated with multimorbidity. The relationship between wealth and multimorbidity in this study may be unclear as the diseases included may have different patterns according to the individual disease. For example, HIV could be associated with being in a lower wealth quintile, while cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes could be associated with being in a higher wealth quintile. The same argument could be used to explain the findings on BMI. This study indicated that having a high BMI could be associated with multimorbidity but the findings were not significant. High BMI has been identified as associated with multimorbidity in other studies [55] . However, the inclusion of HIV and anaemia could mean that people with lower BMIs were also prone to being multimorbid. An interesting finding was that alcohol use was associated with decreased odds of multimorbidity. A study of binge drinking among adults in the United States found that binge drinkers tended to have lower levels of multimorbidity [56] . They related these findings to the 'sick quitter' hypothesis whereby adults stop drinking due to interactions with prescribed medications [57] .",

More studies are also needed to determine whether the trends in multimorbidity are changing in the country. For example, to understand whether policies aimed at diseases such as HIV and hypertension have helped to decrease multimorbidity.
