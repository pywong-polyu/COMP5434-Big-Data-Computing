We also injected universal syntactic dependencies to improve the performance of the model further. The Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components of the voice assistants available today are heavily dependent on language models for various tasks. The generic language models such as BERT and RoBERTa are useful for domainindependent assistants but have limitations when they cater to a specific domain. For example, in the shopping domain, the token 'horizon' means a brand instead of its literal meaning. Generic models are not able to capture such subtleties. So, in this work, we retrained a distilled version of the BERT language model on retail domain-specific data for Walmart's voice shopping assistant. We also included universal dependency-based features in the retraining process further to improve the performance of the model on downstream tasks. We evaluated the performance of the retrained language model on four downstream tasks, including intent-entity detection, sentiment analysis, voice title shortening and proactive intent suggestion. We observed an increase in the performance of all the downstream tasks of up to 1.31% on average.",

Such assistants have become even more important due to COVID-19, helping users adopt different modes of shopping which are safer as compared to in-store shopping. These voice assistants, along with shopping, help users navigate through various tasks such as customer support, search and product tracking. A voice assistant is driven by an underlying NLU engine consisting of various Natural Language Processing models such as Intent Detection, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Title Compression and Contextual Intent Detection (Zhang et al. 2020; Ojamaa, Jokinen, and Muischenk 2015) . These models heavily rely on Language Models such as ELMO (Peters et al. 2018) , BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) , RoBERTa , and Albert (Lan et al. 2019 ). However, these models, trained Copyright \u00a9 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. solely on generic English data, have their shortcomings. Many domain-specific tokens diverge from the meaning associated with them in the general English domain. For example, the token horizon widely differs from its usage in the public domain to more of a brand name in the retail space. Additionally, the queries received by voice assistants are comparatively shorter, have grammatical inconsistencies and other idiosyncrasies. Thus in this work, we retrain the DistilBERT model on a mixture of Retail data and Chat logs, allowing it to be integrated into the NLU engine of Walmart's voice assistant.",

Instead of using the standard context, they implemented syntactic contexts derived from dependency parse trees. The authors parsed sentences and generated word contexts for a target word w with modifiers m 1 ,.,.,..m k and head h. Furthermore, they considered contexts (m 1 , lbl 1 ).....(m 1 , lbl 1 ), (h,lbl h 1 ) where lbl is the form of the dependency between the head and the modifier, whilst lbl 1 is used for marking the inverse of this relationship. The authors trained the model on English Wikipedia, with dependencies labelled using the implementation of the parser described in (Goldberg and Nivre 2012) . This lead to a vocabulary of about 175,000 words, with approximately 900,000 different contexts. In their experiments, they showcased that the earlier SKIP-GRAM models generated more topic-oriented embeddings, whilst incorporating dependency-based contexts encoded more functional characteristics.

Komninos and Manandhar (2016) used dependencybased word embeddings and observed an increase in the performance of tasks which were driven by the syntax of the input text. These results achieved by the authors motivated us to experiment with dependency-based word embeddings for our syntax dependent downstream tasks. We hypothesize that this form of explicit introduction of information to the model would help the model perform better. Additionally, since the dependency embeddings do not require any form of hand labelled data, it naturally lends itself to the retraining (which comprises of large unlabelled corpora). Moreover, no human expertise is required to incorporate the same in the downstream tasks. We thus inject dependencybased word embeddings to provide external syntactic context to the model. We propose a novel technique for injecting dependency-based embeddings into the two-layered Dis-tilBERT model in our experiments using a single-layered transformer encoder. The transformer encoder follows the standard architecture described in Vaswani et al. (2017) . An example of the injection process, along with the extended Text classification and Sequence tagging task is showcased in Figure 1 .",

An illustration of the same can be seen in Figures 2 and 3 . We measure the distance between tokens using Euclidean Distance. The diagrams clearly showcase that there have been notable changes in the representations generated by the retrained model. The above stated changes in the embeddings occur for multiple reasons. Tokens which in the general domain stand for different concepts are realigned according to the domain specific corpus (especially for brand names). For example tokens asian and paints in Figure 3 are placed close to each other (1.769 units) by the retrained DistilBERT model compared to the original DistilBERT model (4.588 units). This realignment results from the high frequency of the occurrences of the above stated tokens in their domain specific contexts. The model goes through the corpus adjusting to the new usages of the tokens in their peculiar contexts and is able to achieve the above. Secondly, the model also places highly queried product n-grams such as running shoes quite close to each other in Figure 2 (0.873 units) whilst the original model places the tokens at a distance of (3.317 units). The model observes the tokens in the above n-grams placed in close proximity to each other in the training corpus. Many such other subtle changes caused due to the retraining process but difficult to infer visually also lead to the generation of fine grained contextual embeddings catering to retail.",

We utilized a small-sized corpus and limited infrastructure to generate these retail-specific contextual embeddings. We evaluated the retrained model on multiple downstream tasks deployed in goal-oriented dialogue systems and observed an increase in performance. Additionally, we also conducted a visual evaluation of the embeddings generated by the retrained DistilBERT model. Moreover, we proposed a novel architecture incorporating dependency-based word embeddings into the DistilBERT model and saw an improvement in the performance on sequence tagging downstream tasks.",

The two, four layered DistilBERT consists of 39.2 and 53.4 million parameters whilst the DeDBERT comprises of 51.2 million parameters. However, the DeDBERT model outperforms the two-layered DistilBERT and in particular the four-layered DistilBERT model. Despite, lower number of parameters compared to the four-layered model the DeDBERT model performs better showcasing that the model does not just gain performance due to the increase in the parameters from the transformer but can benefit from the explicit knowledge provided by the dependency-based embeddings. Moreover, the DeDBERT model converges faster than its counterparts with lower inference time compared to four-layered model.",
