This is a retrospective observational study done in outpatient department of tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, west India from 1st May 2020 to 1st August 2020 on patients who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and having olfactory dysfunction and/or taste disorders. In study population, anosmia and ageusia occurred in 88% and 83.33% respectively. In control population, anosmia and ageusia occurred in 93% and 85.71% respectively. The mean duration of anosmia was around 2 weeks and 3 weeks for study and control group respectively. In study population 94.6% recovered from anosmia, whereas in control population 64.3% recovered from anosmia. Anosmia gradually improved to hyposmia. In the study population 94.3% hyposmia patients showed recovery, while in control population 85.2% showed recovery. Ageusia collaborated with the duration of anosmia. Recovery from taste dysfunction was 88.6% and 63.9% in study and control population respectively.",

            "text": "Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . Corona virus causes respiratory tract infections. The severity can be mild like common cold, or can be even lethal, like SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019). COVID-19 disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province and later caused a worldwide pandemic [2, 3] . The virus mainly spreads by close contact via small droplets produced while coughing, sneezing and talking [4, 5] . Bioaerosol transmission occurs while doing intubation, tracheostomy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Fomite transmission is also possible [4] . The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although spread is possible even before symptoms appear [4] . The incubation period is 5 to 6 days but may range from 2 to 14 days. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces. The patient may be totally asymptomatic or present with flu like symptoms like fever, cough, sneezing, fatigue and shortness of breath. Blood investigations often reveal lymphocytopenia. Ground glass appearance is commonly seen in HRCT of chest. The disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death [6] [7] [8] [9] . Number of patients who were affected by COVID-19, presented with anosmia and ageusia [14] . Otolaryngologists and health care staff are at high risk of COVID-19 infection, hence appropriate protective and hygiene measures are of utmost importance [10, 11] . The risks seem to be more high in the field of rhinology, neuro-oncology and endoscopic endonasal surgery [12, 13] . In administrating the health crisis, early identification of paucisymptomatic patients with anosmia and ageusia is emerging as a crucial factor in order to interrupt the transmission chain of the disease. In few cases these minor and nonspecific symptomatology can represent the first and only manifestation of the coronavirus disease.",

All patients were informed about the test. The patients were asked to place an index finger over one nostril to block it (for example, right index finger over right nostril). They were then asked to sniff repeatedly and inform when an odour is detected and recognized with both eyes closed. The test odour was brought up-to within 30 cm or less of the nose. No auditory clue was given. The same process was repeated with the other nostril. Smell sensation was intact when patient detected the odour. The degree of smell sensation gave an idea if the patient had anosmia or hyposmia. All the study group who were under home quarantine were explained the procedure and they were advised to repeat this test every 4 days and the recovery was assessed.",

This test was repeated with 1%, 0.1% and 0.01% sugar solutions, rinsing the mouth and wiping the tongue before testing each solution. This gave an approximate taste threshold for sugar.

These recognize the basic tastes like sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. The key receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 inside the host cells is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2). ACE-2 receptor is expressed in multiple organs like lungs, heart, kidney, intestines, buccal cavity, brain etc.",

            "text": "When olfactory and or taste dysfunction related to COVID-19 improves spontaneously with the routine COVID-19 treatment, then specific treatment may not be required. But when impairment persists beyond 2 weeks, treatment should be considered. The efficacy of available treatments for patients with COVID-19 related olfactory and or taste dysfunction is unknown, however treatments may potentially be helpful in such conditions. Olfactory training involves repeat and deliberate sniffing of a set of odorants (commonly lemon, rose, cloves and eucalyptus) for 20 s each at least twice a day for at least 3 months. Studies have demonstrated improved olfaction in patients with post-infectious olfactory dysfunction after olfactory training [40] . Olfactory training can be considered for patients with persistent COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction because this therapy has low cost and negligible adverse effects. Oral and intranasal corticosteroids used to reduce any inflammatory component in patients with postinfectious olfactory dysfunction. However, because of safety concerns, the administration of systemic corticosteroids for the routine management of acute COVID-19 is not recommended [40] . Patients who were using intranasal steroids before developing COVID-19 (example, for allergic rhinitis), can continue their medications. Other medications that have shown promising result in post-infectious olfactory dysfunction include intranasal sodium citrate, which is thought to modulate olfactory receptor transduction cascades, intranasal vitamin A, which may act to promote olfactory neurogenesis and systemic omega-3, which may act a neuro-regenerative or anti-inflammatory [40, 41] . Intranasal vitamin A and systemic omega-3 serve as adjuvant therapies in olfactory training.",

Hence, it is very important to consider olfactory and taste dysfunction as part of the screening process for COVID-19 that can in turn help to improve case detection and further curtail the spread of the virus. All patients with olfactory and taste dysfunction should be trained to do smell and taste training because that helps in faster selfrecovery over time. It is very important to obtain olfactory and gustatory testing data on patients with confirmed COVID-19 testing, to provide a quantitative data on the incidence and severity of these sensory functions. Finally, more studies are required to understand the mechanism of olfactory and taste dysfunction with respect to coronavirus infections and also the status of the nasal mucosa in postcovid patients.",
