A teacher, a principal, and a university professor in the United States offer intertwined perspectives on sharpened understandings that call for transforming our daily practice of education and everyday curriculum. The article includes four interrelated threads that underlie everyday curriculum but take on fresh meanings and urgent callings in a time of crisis: life and death, interdependence and collaboration, inequality and equity, and community beyond separation. Throughout discussions, storytelling and examples of how teachers and school leaders have responded to the difficult situation are also provided. Covid-19 is taken as a wake-up call to deepened understandings, heightened awareness, and relational interventions, so that the landscape of curriculum can be reimagined and recreated.",

William Pinar (1992) contended that \"the concepts and realities of death need to be integrated in everyday conversation, in everyday curriculum, not treated as exotic topics of extreme anxiety\" (p. 99). We seldom discuss death with schoolchildren, with the good intention of protecting them from confronting pain and sorrow. But children already experience loss and death, and when they are able to grieve in the loving company of their teachers and classmates, they are less likely to be stuck in fear and more likely to make new meanings and embrace life in a fresh way. After all, \"there is life amid death, life in death, life from death\" (Pinar 1992, p. 94) . Outside the official curriculum, teachers who connect curriculum with the lived experience of students take the initiative to bring such an important part of life into focus for students.",

A Japanese elementary teacher, Mr. Kanamori, in the documentary Children full of life (Kaetsu 2003) , taught students to mourn loss and emerge from it in a life-affirming manner. Linda Skinner (Castle, Beasley, and Skinner 1996) worked with children to express their feelings towards the Oklahoma City bombing through the arts and activism, connecting students' activities with different academic subjects. These teachers all demonstrate the pedagogical wisdom of leading children to work through loss. In all these cases, tragedies happened and teachers took on an ethical responsibility to help their students grieve the loss through multiple means, rather than choosing not to make any pedagogical response. Moreover, these teachers had already built strong connections with their students, and they guided students, with care and compassion, to engage in difficult conversations when situations required this curricular commitment.",

Children encounter such symbolic losses on a daily basis, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic: physical separation from family and friends, loss of the freedom to move around, or loss of the learning space. There is a delicate fragility in holding such conversations about loss, and it is important that opportunities be provided for children to grieve-but as invitations for engagement, not requirements to meet. In such a difficult space, students may have the chance to explore the profound significance, even sacredness, of human life in a multiplicity of lived experiences, social contexts, political landscapes, and interpersonal relationships, thus opening doors to other meaningful concerns that intersect their lives.",

This capacity is also related to teachers' ability to work through their own loss. During this pandemic, educators are suffering from multiple layers of loss, not the least of which is the loss of their teaching self. For instance, teachers are required to learn new online platforms and systems and engage in meaningful dialogues with students, but many have little to no practice in online teaching. They are disoriented, much like their students without previous experience in online learning, who are confused.",

They express their feelings of regret and guilt, feelings of failure or insufficiency, as they attempt to teach from home in ways that no longer feel like teaching or serving their students, at least not like they could when they were in their classrooms. William Doll's approach to disturbance and chaos (Treuit 2012) is helpful in dealing with loss: \"By their nature, open systems need challenges, perturbations, disruptions-these are the sine qua non of the transformative process\" (as quoted in Wang 2016, p. 25) . His conceptualization of perturbation and disequilibrium as necessary for transforming an open system helps us confront the pandemic in a different way.",

Is it possible that a sense of losing their teaching self helps teachers understand their students better than before, since learners, by definition, must deal with confusion and uncertainty in their studies? No doubt, teachers' emotional work is necessary here for them to live with perturbation (Britzman 1998) . Rather than pushing back against discomfort, accepting its difficulty makes it easier to learn other modes of relationships and ways of communication that can be educative. In some cases, technology facilitates connections: video chatting, texting, and emailing students opens new lines of communication and relational opportunities (Nowell 2014) . Teachers have also found creative ways to offer psychological presence to students, and they have sharpened their sensitivity to students who need support. In a time of loss, confusion, and disequilibrium, we can discover new avenues for remaining open to the transformative possibilities swirling within and around us.",

Can it open up creative and life-sustaining potential, or shut it down due to newer forms of repression, control, and regimented accountability imposed by authorities? As school leaders and teachers are in the midst of this unfolding drama, the space leaders hold open for teachers and students should serve the immediacy of their living experiences, the now of all they are living and doing. It should also be a space in which we, as members of a school community, are able to recognize and honor our human frailty, and to honestly acknowledge our societal brokenness. Our everyday curriculum should explore important issues of life and death, not only individually but also collectively and cosmically, so that the individual body is connected to the communal body and the planetary body, rich in grace and benediction. Such a curriculum is open to life, to living, and holds great promise for the emergence of awareness, insights, and relationships.",

A community is often perceived as the sum of individuals rather than being grounded in a sense of interconnectedness. However, during the pandemic, the coronavirus has touched the lives of many people from all walks of life, not only locally but globally. Its impact, although received differentially-which we will discuss next-makes the interconnection of life visible in an embodied, materialized, and shocking way. For instance, the virus does not respect the manmade boundaries of town, city, state or province, and country, but spreads wherever it will. We cannot rise above the most vulnerable populations, and our own health is at risk when others are struck down by the disease. What the pandemic exposes is precisely a \"relationality that is neither exclusively of myself nor you, but is to be conceived as the tie by which those terms are differentiated and related\" (Butler 2004, p. 22; italics original) .",

And second, that connection is more vital to our health and happiness than we might care to admit\". The dual priorities of going inward for clarity and going outward to claim connections should inform our everyday life and education. As air pollution reportedly decreased from the reduced human activity during the lockdowns, it is clear that there is an interconnection between humanity and the natural environment that we must acknowledge. Unfortunately, school curricula and academic studies are often structured in separate disciplines without organic connections. Interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, embodied, storied, and experiential curriculum and teaching hold the promise of interweaving different forms of knowledge and highlighting the meaning of interdependence, through the shared lives of teachers and students. Any activities that are beneficial for connecting the body and the mind, the self and the other, and culture and nature can contribute to creating a curriculum of interdependence.",

In the global context, shifting the primary focus away from the individual means challenging ethnocentrism and closed-minded versions of nationalism. The official curriculum of American exceptionalism is a good example to deconstruct (Loewen 1995) . Pandemic-related vulnerabilities and suffering in the United States are similar to those of other nations, and the United States is definitely not doing better than others in containing and curbing the coronavirus. A sense of exceptionalism above all else tears apart the web of interconnectedness and easily projects shadows-in a Jungian sense (Jung 1953 ; Wang 2019)-onto others.

Honoring the intersections of these stories leads to acknowledging the interconnectedness and interdependency that exists in educational and curricular contexts, but which we may not have previously seen with such clarity. Storytelling takes on the \"intergenerational task of opening, protecting, and cultivating the free spaces\" (Jardine 2012, p. 4) in which teachers and students can explore difficulty together. This pandemic presses us as educators to reconsider and reimagine our educational and communal interconnectedness, which greatly depends upon the interwoven narratives of students, teachers, and school leaders.",

The necessity for social distance caused by the pandemic initiated a \"punctuated\" (Treuit 2012, p. 135 ) point for schools, where a new beginning happened rapidly and unexpectedly. This elicited a variety of individual responses from principals, teachers, parents, and students who had to deal with the trauma and transition quickly to a new platform. For teachers, a sudden change in the content delivery and technology of learning can create frustrating and even overwhelming conditions. Parents, many of whom are working from home, must now also homeschool their children. Within these destabilized adult worlds, students have to quickly learn online platforms not always used in everyday lessons, while they must also adapt to more independent learning in their daily routines. Many students falter or become stalled because distance learning is not adequate to meet their needs. At times, parents blame teachers and teachers blame the system, while students blame their parents, teachers, and the system. All members of the educational community can attest to the living reality of William Pinar's (2012) statement that \"we are teaching [and learning] in a state of emergency\" (p. 72). Though originally stated to contest accountability, standardization, and the negative treatment of teachers, it is so very applicable to today's crisis. In this emergency, the shared frustrations can also reveal our need for one another's compassion. When we realize that blaming others and issuing shadow projections do not work to relieve our burdens, and when we learn to hold tensions within the self and accept difficulty (Butler 2005) , we look to one another for mutual learning and support, and unexpected forms of collaboration and working together emerge. For instance, younger teachers who are more familiar with online technologies begin to help some veteran teachers who need support. Students-digital natives-have begun offering advice on the use of technologies and encouraging their teachers to attempt new learning. Parents also begin to understand the difficulties inherent in teaching children.",

We can see that the thread of interdependence goes in all directions and challenges hierarchy and competition. We also see that in our everyday education, teachers learning from one another can become more reciprocal, and teachers also can learn from students.

For example, in the school district where Naomi works as a teacher, students with computers and access to the Internet within their homes quickly transitioned into online learning and engaged with the content that was delivered. In contrast, children without home computers were asked to drive or walk to their school and borrow a Chromebook. Some children share a Chromebook with siblings and have access to the Internet for only one hour a day, when the Internet bus (a roving Wi-Fi hotspot) parks in their neighborhood.",

Teachers fear for their most vulnerable students, knowing that their absence from the school building reduces their learning opportunities and diminishes essential nurturing relationships, and that even if these students have online access, their suffering will not be reduced. Students lament the purposelessness of doing homework in a world turned upside down.

He argued that the value of the market and technology should be secondary to the value of \"greater diversity-the relationally concrete enhancement of mutual contribution to sustainably shared welfare\" (p. 223).

Can the radically shifting and uncomfortable space that educators are experiencing nurture new visions of community that are not so easily seen in everyday patterns of relationships? What does it mean to build a community when educators' usual means of communicating with their students are disrupted? Can a sense of belonging that transcends our physical separateness still be possible? If teachers become strangers to themselves, what can they do to navigate a complex, confusing, chaotic realm while also helping their students navigate such a realm?",

Online platforms help teachers keep interacting with students but add filters to pedagogical engagements. The flexibility of time, space, and place may make teaching and learning available in the asynchronous world of digital learning, but it can also make us feel like exiles cast away from the communal learning experience of the classroom. With all that is gained in continuing to provide education through video conferences, media platforms, and digital classrooms, there is human loss, relational diminishment, and psychological complexity. Because the social distancing came at the end of the academic year, most teachers had already had three-quarters of a year with their students to build a sense of community, without which online teaching would be even more difficult. These paradoxical experiences may help us recognize more clearly the relational and communal elements of teaching and learning that enrich us (Wang 2016; Miller 2005; Noddings 1984) , and to cultivate and renew them more energetically when we are able to return to classrooms in the future.",

Naomi lived through intense fear, anxiety, and sadness when the husband of a teacher in her school died, the first death in her city due to Covid-19. Sadly, he died alone. Imagine the struggles that teacher and her family endured in isolation, forced to self-quarantine, dealing with the shock of their loved one's death. Concurrent with this profound personal loss, the teacher kept teaching through distance learning and was present for her students while she parented her own grieving children. At the same time, many people within that large school must have retraced their steps to the last time they were in close contact with that teacher, and then counted forward to determine the day on which they could say they were not infected. The students and their parents were concerned as well, despite district communications in an attempt to calm the school community. Stories of grief, fear, and courage in such a strange time for any community are deeply intermingled and have a profound impact on the emergent shape of a community. Can a compassionate community (Guberman 1996) be built given the pervasive fear of community spread of the virus?",

School personnel, parents, and students seek creative ways to celebrate milestones like graduating from high school. Teachers improvise, using video messages of encouragement to recognize their students' progress and effort. In some cases, district curricular and grading guidance are open to the interpretation of each teacher, so teachers have more flexibility than before. Teachers are living with their strange selves in a weird time, and we are rallying to educate. We have not abandoned our moral obligations to students and responsibility to teach, and our steadfastness must be part of the curriculum story of community building.",

The school community is at risk of fracturing under external pressures. Some educational authorities respond by issuing waivers and suspensions of accountability protocols and normal regulations of assessment, while disciplinary arrangements of schools become much looser, which temporarily creates a space where teachers and students can focus on educational experiences. The fact that the cohesion of a school community benefits from the removal of external regulations demonstrates that a compassionate community can be sustained and cultivated without standardized mandates.",

Our shared strangeness, disorientation, and destabilization as school leaders, teachers, students, and parents can suggest divisions, fracturing, and distortions-but equally so, this educational moment may also suggest possibilities for new experiences and expressions of community (Fowler 2006) . It may be possible to resist fragmentation, and instead shift the relational dynamics toward building a community that welcomes the stranger. Butler (2004) pondered: \"My own foreignness to myself is, paradoxically, the source of my ethical connection with others. I am not fully known to myself, because part of what I am is the enigmatic traces of others\" (p. 46). Julia Kristeva suggested that suffering, vulnerability, and weakness can become the bridge for the self to be connected with the (strange) other. In such a community, \"[w]e recognize others, as foreigners, as strangers\" (Guberman 1996, p. 100) . Only by recognizing that the self can be vulnerable and host the unknown other within can one expand the space for connecting with others at a distance. Thus, we might utilize the time and space offered by the crisis in such a way that members of the school community become more aware of the interconnectedness of our lived experiences, our part in shaping the common good, and our intertwined futures.",

Maxine Greene also suggested that \"our diversity should be celebrated and recognized as the essence of our cultural cohesiveness\" (Goodman and Teel 1998, p. 63) . Interestingly, the language of \"war\" is also invoked and used in dealing with the pandemic, both nationally and globally, and yet nothing can be more divisive than a brutal war. It is true that news can be filled with talk about trade wars, cultural wars, the war on drugs, the war on poverty, and the war on terrorism. Hillman (2004) suggested that war has become normalized in our everyday life. However, is not the effort to eliminate the danger of dying on a massive scale across the globe actually the exact opposite of war's desire to eliminate the human enemy, who must die on a massive scale for winning battles?",

Dualist thinking is common in everyday curriculum and still lingers in a time of crisis. Resisting the narrative of fragmentation and division, we might learn to recognize \"unity in what we see as separate\" (Grumet 1988, p. 191 ) and experiment with new forms of engagement that acknowledge the potential for \"relational change and creativity\" (Hershock 2012, p. 28) . In this way we might experiment with holding teaching and learning within a gracious space, working to cultivate new curriculum practices that differ from the individualistic and competitive race with achievers and failures. We need to pursue instead a humane endeavor, which is an aspiration of the human spirit to grow and change and become, an embodied, relational, interdependent and mutually sustaining educational project of adults and children sharing life and creating the world anew.",

Such a new form of relationality suggests hopeful curriculum possibilities for building future generative communities (Smith 2021) . In drawing together the complex and intersecting living experiences of school leaders, teachers, students, and their families, we may find new forms of commitment and relationships that may aid us in our future work to build \"communities and collaborations without hierarchies but also without mandated consensus\" (Miller 2005, p. 82) .
