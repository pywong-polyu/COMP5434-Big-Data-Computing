Despite these unique circumstances, results of several interesting studies in the field of breast cancer (BC) were reported. While overall survival data are still missing, KEYNOTE-355 suggests significant activity of pembrolizumab when added to first-line chemotherapy in metastatic triplenegative breast cancer. TBCRC 048 evaluated the role of olaparib in homologous recombination deficient tumours due to genomic alterations other than germline BRCA1/2 mutations; clinically relevant activity was reported in patients with germline PALB2 and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations. In HER2-positive early stage disease, different strategies of chemotherapy de-escalation are under investigation, but the optimal approach is still not well defined. Updated results from the HER2CLIMB trial show that the thirdgeneration HER2 tyrosine-kinase inhibitor tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine is the new standard-of-care for pretreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic BC with active brain metastases. Results from BYLieve supports the notion that the combination of endocrine therapy with the PIK3Ca inhibitor alpelisib is a reasonable treatment approach in hormone-receptor positive/HER2-negative BC after prior CDK4/6-inhibitor therapy. Finally, the ECOG-ACRIN 2108 trial failed to show a benefit for early surgery of the primary tumour in patients with metastatic BC. R",

The majority of patients had luminal/HER2-negative breast cancer, 37.9% presented with bone-only disease and 53.8% had received upfront chemotherapy. In the overall study population, no difference in terms of OS was observed (HR 1.09; 95% CI 0.80-1.49); in the subset of patients with mTNBC, additional ELT seemed to have a detrimental effect (risk for death HR 3.5; 95% CI 1.16-10.57). Therefore, additional locoregional therapy may not be regarded as a standard component of mBC treatment.",

For now, atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel remains the standard-ofcare in this setting. In early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, trials exploring different de-escalation strategies were presented; the PHERGAIN study evaluating response-adapted treatment is promising, but data on long-term outcomes are still awaited. In HER2-positive metastatic disease, the combination of tucatinib, trastuzumab and capecitabine defines a novel treatment standard for pretreated patients with active brain metastases. Finally, BYLieve supports the notion that the PIK3Ca inhibitor alpelisib is a reasonable treatment option in patients with PIK3Ca mutant luminal breast cancer progressing on CDK4/6-inhibitor therapy.",
