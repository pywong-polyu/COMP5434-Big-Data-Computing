Although tiered medical services have been promoted by the Chinese government since 2015, they have not been ideally implemented for COPD diagnosis and management. Patients and Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study. Eligible COPD patients (n = 648) and physicians (n = 161) were consecutively recruited from 8 hospitals in different tiers in China. COPD characteristics and treatments were compared among hospitals in different tiers. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with airflow limitation, symptoms and acute exacerbation. Results: The PFT rate at first diagnosis was 99%, 69.4% and 29.9% in teaching, second-tier and community hospitals (P < 0.001). Only approximately 10.9%, 1.7% and 9.6% and 21.8%, 6.9% and 32% of COPD patients received influenza or pneumococcal vaccines (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients who did not use inhaled drugs or had irregular inhalation was 2%, 24.6% and 78.8% (P < 0.001). Education level (RR-1 = \u221241.26%, P = 0.007), FEV1%pred (RR-1 = \u22122.76%, P < 0.001), and influenza vaccination in the last year (RR-1 = \u221264.53%, P = 0.006) were all negatively correlated with COPD acute exacerbation (AE). COPD duration (RR-1 = 131.73%, P = 0.009), AE (RR-1 = 151.39%, P < 0.001), and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores (RR-1 = 3.82%, P = 0.019) were all positively correlated with COPD airflow limitation severity. Conclusion: Differences exist in the diagnosis, treatment and management of COPD among different tiers of hospitals in China. Teaching hospitals can manage COPD patients relatively well. There are still some gaps compared with developed countries.",

Hospitals in different tiers are required to undertake the treatment of diseases in different grades. The tiered medical system is an important component of China's medical reform, aiming to rationally allocate medical resources. Public hospitals are integral components of China's health care system, and all public hospitals were graded into three tiers according to the scale of the hospitals, scientific research direction, talent and technical strength, medical hardware and equipment, etc. Community hospitals are primary hospitals that directly provide the comprehensive services of medical treatment, prevention, rehabilitation and health care to the community. Second-tier hospitals are regional hospitals that provide health services across several communities and are regional medical technology centers. Teaching hospitals are medical centers that provide comprehensive medical treatment and have teaching and research capabilities. Patients can select hospitals according to their own condition, and referrals can also be made between hospitals of different tiers. In general, higher tier hospitals are associated with more severe disease conditions. However, this concept has not been ideally implemented for COPD diagnosis and management in China.",

There is no clear restriction in government policy, and only a slight difference in medical fees. Therefore, most patients are willing to go to a better hospital to receive better medical services, which to some extent leads to the waste of medical resources. Under this background, China began to implement the tiered hospital system nationwide. Teaching hospitals are usually medical centers that are mainly responsible for treating critically ill patients and patients with difficult diseases, teaching medical students and leading the development of new drugs and new treatment. Second-tier hospitals, which are in the middle of the three tiers, are often responsible for local medical services and provide treatment for patients with common and chronic diseases. Community hospitals have insufficient medical resources and focus on health consultation, chronic disease maintenance and prevention. Data reveal that there were approximately 2749 teaching hospitals, 9687 second-tier hospitals and 11,264 community hospitals in 2019 in China. 3 Ideally, COPD should be first diagnosed and critical, difficult disease should be treated in teaching hospitals. Common and standardized treatments are performed in second-tier hospitals, and disease maintenance, prevention and education are provided in community hospitals. However, the structure of the disease population exhibits a pattern opposite of this pyramid pattern. In our study, the proportion of patients with COPD AE in the last year was highest in the second-tier group and the lowest in the teaching group, and the same was true for CAT scores. This is not in line with the expectations of tiered hospital system, and there is a gap with developed countries. Combined with the other findings of our study, such as regular medication and PFT complete situation, we infer that this may be related to the limitation of the medical resources and inadequate health education of second-tier hospitals, and the lack of attention or understanding of patients themselves, thus failing to receive fully adequate treatment and rehabilitation guidance. In addition to actual medical resource needs, patients who choose teaching hospitals may also pay more attention to their own health and have better compliance in treatment.",

A metaanalysis including 21 RCTs and 12 observational studies evaluating 51 085 patients showed that home bilevel positive airway pressure and noninvasive home mechanical ventilators were all significantly beneficial to COPD patients with hypercapnia. 15 , 16 Murphy's study 17 showed that among patients with persistent hypercapnia following an AE of COPD, adding home noninvasive ventilation to home oxygen therapy prolonged the time to readmission or death within 12 months. A meta-analysis involving 767 Chinese patients from 14 studies also showed that HNPPV could reduce the mortality of patients with stable and severe COPD (P=0.002) and improve gas exchange, lung function, and quality of life. 18 The reasons for the low acceptance and popularity of HNPPV are as follows. First, HNPPV requires specialized equipment and is more expensive. HNPPV equipment is not yet covered by health insurance in China. Second, some patients complained about the uncomfortable feeling of wearing a ventilator and were unable to obtain assistance in time. Therefore, doctors should not only attach importance to drug therapy but also strengthen education and guidance on pulmonary rehabilitation therapy, including HNPPV. Internet of Things technology can also be used in parameter monitoring, technical guidance, data feedback and other aspects in the long-term HNPPV process. In this way, HNPPV can be more beneficial to COPD patients.",

            "text": "Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination could decrease lower respiratory tract infections, which is the most common cause of COPD AE. 19 In 2016-2017, the median influenza vaccine coverage for individuals with chronic medical conditions in Europe was 44.9%, ranging from 15.7% to 57.1% across the 7 reporting member states. 20 In 2019-2020, coverage of high-risk adults between 18 and 64 years with influenza vaccine was 51.4% in the US. 21 Pneumococcal vaccination coverage among adults between 19 and 64 years at increased risk for pneumococcal disease was 24.5% in 2017 in the US. 22 Our multivariate regression analysis revealed that both vaccines were beneficial in preventing AE and improving symptoms. However, the vaccination rates remain low, approximately 10.9%, 1.7% and 9.6% of COPD patients in the three tiers of hospitals received an influenza vaccine, and 21.8%, 6.9% and. 32% of COPD patients received a pneumococcal vaccine. According to data from Shanghai, China, in the sample of 2,531,227 individuals aged 15 years or older with hypertension, diabetes and COPD, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia and 0.4% for influenza in 2017. 23 In 2014-2015, the pneumococcal vaccination rate was only 0.8% in COPD patients aged 40 years or older in China. 24 In China, adult vaccination is performed only in community hospitals, and doctors have more time to educate patients about the importance and benefits of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination, which partially explains why the vaccination rate in community hospitals is relatively higher than that in teaching and second-tier hospitals. China's low vaccination rate may have something to do with the traditional Chinese concept of \"don't go to hospital unless you are sick\", and Chinese people do not attach great importance to vaccination, except for the vaccination that must be completed after a baby is born. Chinese government has been campaigning hard in recent years to encourage and fund active vaccination. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this concept is gradually changing. At present, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Chinese adults is very high, and vaccination has been introduced to children. It is believed that in the post-COVID-19 period, people will pay more attention to vaccines, and the increase in government fiscal investment in vaccine development, delivery and publicity will also allow vaccines to protect more people.",

In recent years, blood eosinophils have been adopted as a biomarker to predict the ICS response in COPD patients. 27 The IMPACT trial showed that in patients with COPD and a history of exacerbations, triple LAMA+LABA+ICS therapy is more effective than LABA+LAMA in individuals with blood eosinophil DovePress counts of 310 cells/\u03bcL or more than in individuals with counts less than 90 cells/\u03bcL. 28 Without considering eosinophil counts, the triple combination of LAMA+LABA +ICS is as effective as LABA+LAMA in preventing AE in real-world clinical practice 29 and is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in patients with COPD. 30 In our study, the proportions of patients receiving ICS +LABA or ICS+LABA+LAMA therapy were 53.5%, 56.0% and 14.7% in teaching, second-tier and community hospitals, respectively.

Some clinical trial results show that theophylline combined with LABA produces a greater improvement in lung function and symptoms than LABA alone, 31 and low-dose theophylline increases the efficacy of ICS in COPD patients by reducing the incidence of exacerbations. 32 However, other data suggest that for people with COPD at high risk of exacerbation, low-dose oral theophylline plus ICS confers no overall clinical, health or economic benefit. 33 However, GOLD still recommends theophylline or theophylline plus bronchodilators as alternative therapies for some COPD patients.
