Of all the vaccinated HCWs (3235), only two (0.06%) required hospital admissions and none of them required an ICU admission. There was no significant adverse effect reported following immunization and no mortality. COVID-19 infection after vaccination is being recognized in a small subset of people after one or both the doses of vaccine 5, 8 . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently termed the infections occurring two weeks after the full vaccination by an approved vaccine as 'breakthrough infection' (BTI) 9 . Accordingly, in the present study, 76.5 per cent of the HCWs had BTI. Dagan et al 8 suggested that the COVID-19 vaccination was highly effective in preventing severe outcomes after the infection, with lesser hospitalization, severe illness and death. They have further added that the estimated benefit of vaccination increases in magnitude as the time passes. We noted that in a sample of 3235 HCWs in a tertiary care hospital, the PVI was as low as 2.65 per cent after the first dose and 2.63 per cent after the second dose of vaccine among those observed for less than 100 days. This implied that a reasonable level of immunity was achieved after a single shot of vaccine which might get further enhanced with the second dose, in a longer follow up.",

Genomic sequencing can detect the phylogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and hence, more widespread and regular testing is required to monitor the disease's spread and evolution of the mutant viruses 22 . The viral mutants or variants have been classified into variant of high consequence (VOC) and variant of interest (VOI), based on their severity and virulence 19 . Many VOC and VOI have been reported in various nations. In an attempt to simplify their names and to remove the stigma attached to these variants, the WHO has named them as per the Greek alphabets, rather than from the country of their first discovery 23 .
