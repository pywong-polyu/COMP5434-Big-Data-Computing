China, however, is the world's biggest producer of farm animals for consumption and has one of the worlds' largest populations of humans. We conducted a survey of public opinion, in order to better understand Chinese people's knowledge of animal welfare and their attitudes towards measures to adopt to improve it. Most respondents were unaware of the meaning of animal welfare, but it appears that awareness has increased in recent years. The welfare of wild animals was considered particularly important. The effects of good welfare on the taste and safety of food were highlighted and respondents were willing to pay more for food from animals raised in good welfare conditions. Abstract: Food-producing animals make up the majority of animals that humans manage globally, and China has been a major producer and exporter of animal products since the late 1990s. The opinions of the population in China regarding animal welfare are not as well understood as those in Europe. In China, animal welfare as a societal concern is still at an early stage of development. This survey of Chinese attitudes aimed to understand consumer knowledge of and behaviour towards animal welfare, and to determine whether harnessing consumer interests may be a potential future influence on the development of high-welfare agricultural production. Most participants were not aware of the meaning of animal welfare, but the number of those that were aware was higher than reported previously. The welfare of wild animals was rated particularly important compared to other animals. The links between welfare and the taste and/or safety of food were considered to be important, and Chinese consumers reported a willingness to pay more for food from animals produced in good welfare conditions, although the quality of the food was considered more important than the animal suffering. A large majority of the respondents reported that there should be legislation protecting animals and certification of welfare on farms, that animals on farms should be provided with enjoyable experiences and that transportation times should be minimised. Furthermore, most respondents reported that animals should be stunned before slaughter. We conclude that animal welfare is of importance to the Chinese consumer, in particular because of its connection to food quality.",

This may be because these concepts were introduced into Mainland China relatively recently, in the early 1990s [1] . Animal welfare can be defined by how well an animal copes with the conditions in which it lives [2] ; animal rights are predicated on the idea that the rights of non-human and human animals are, fundamentally, the same [3, 4] . However, animal welfare, to a greater extent than animal rights, has attracted increased media attention in recent years [1] .",

The European Commission for Health and Food Safety [5] reported that 94% of Europeans (including those in the UK) consider it is important to protect the welfare of farmed animals. Within the same report, it was further noted that animal welfare was more important to female respondents than male respondents, and also more important to younger respondents [5] . Food-producing animals make up the majority of animals that are managed by humans globally, and animal farming systems are accused of inefficient use of scarce resources, in particular feed, water and land [6] . Intensive animal production has continued to grow at a rapid rate over the last century [7] . The sustainability of the human-food animal relationship (which includes animal welfare) and the broader environment are likely to be at risk if, as anticipated, prices increase as a result of increasingly scarce feed, water, and land resources on which food animal producers rely [8, 9] .",

Chinese livestock industries have experienced a variety of major animal epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, foot and mouth disease and more recently, African swine fever, all of which necessitated large numbers of animals being removed from the supply chain with considerable impact on both the livestock market and animal welfare. Improvement of animal welfare may help to prevent these disease outbreaks [16] [17] [18] . However, it is suspected that there is a fundamental lack of understanding of the importance of animal welfare among the majority of livestock stakeholders in China, leading to an absence of relevant government policies to address this [19] .",

Improving animal welfare has direct benefits for the animals themselves, but also has significant benefits for humans who have livelihoods dependent on animal production, and for the wider community in terms of product quality and disease risk management [20] .",

Of the participants, 73% believed that improving rearing conditions for swine and poultry would improve food safety of meat and eggs, and 54% expressed willingness to pay more for products from welfare-friendly operations. Platto et al. [21] asked Chinese farmers to rate several different priorities for action on farms, for example, provision of better flooring to promote hoof health or better lying areas; the improvement of animal welfare was rated third, with the most important being the farmer's own well-being [22] . In China, animal welfare, as a societal concern, is still at an early stage of development. It did not attract attention from the Chinese general public until the early years of this century [10] . Many factors are recognized as having an influence on the attitudes of people to animal welfare, including culture, religion and gender [23] .",

The first question set was concerned with general attitudes towards animal welfare. The second set asked which group of animals they cared most about. The third aimed to determine the reasons that they felt animals should be cared for, the fourth asked what aspects of welfare needed to be most cared for, using the Five Freedoms [28] as the basis for their choices.

The Chinese government considers it necessary to adopt intensive rearing in order to meet the growing demand for the products of livestock [24, [32] [33] [34] . As has also been shown in other studies, respondents were very sensitive about killing animals and all practices used on the farm [10] . Respondents mostly knew about animal care and welfare from family and friends, and also from the media. This indicates that reporting in the media may have improved since You et al. (2014) [10] claimed that discussion of animal welfare by the Chinese media was poor at that time. Respondents in the current study mostly felt that they lived in harmony with animals, which may be a reflection of the provinces where the survey was conducted, where agriculture in the economy and animal production are important. Current profession may be more pivotal than educational background in approaches to welfare measures and criteria [9] .",

According to research carried out on meat consumption in China, future spending on meat is expected to increase [38] . This nutritional transition is a response to changes in lifestyle and dietary patterns driven by urbanization, globalization and economic growth, and their resulting impacts on nutrition and health outcomes [39] . But there remains significant diversity of diets around the world, reflecting diversity in food production landscapes and ecosystems, socio-economic conditions, cultures and beliefs. Studies of food systems adapted to their local context, and of the associated traditional knowledge built up over millennia, can provide new insights and pathways towards more sustainable food systems [40] . Most respondents said that they would be willing to pay more for high welfare standard products, which was not found in a previous survey in China [10] . If true, this could drive improvements in good practices on livestock farms; 58% of UK customers believe that by paying more for higher welfare products they can influence the welfare conditions of the animals [41] . In another European survey, Bozzo et al. [42] showed that 58.4% of the persons interviewed would pay 20% more than normal for high welfare products, while in this study 35% of respondents were prepared to pay more than 10% extra, which was most likely due to the perceived improved taste of the animal-derived product and effects on the environment. The European Commission for Health and Food Safety [5] reported that a sample population from 15 Member States of the EU considered that animal welfare contributes to a better-quality animal product.",

Interestingly in the current study, wild animals had the highest amount of support from participants: 46% for very important and 39% for somewhat important. This importance attached to wildlife confirms an earlier study in which Chinese respondents did not care much about animal welfare generally [26] but were very concerned about wildlife protection [23, 44] . This was further borne out by the findings of Phillips et al. (2012) [26] that of a range of countries, Chinese respondents scored lowest for animal welfare generally, but highest for the importance of welfare issues among wild animals. That this strength of comparative interest in the welfare of wild animals may have a cultural basis is worthy of further consideration and investigation. It may also be due to an increase in information regarding diseases that can be transmitted from wild animals, which up until recently few people were aware of [45] . Consumers consider farm animal welfare as an attribute of the food quality concept, with more importance given to this than to other attributes [46, 47] . There is evidence from this survey that the Chinese population has responded positively to understanding the reasons why animals should care for, and how animal welfare affects other aspects, such as food safety, in China. The disease burden and use of antibiotics in farm animals is taken very seriously in China by government and could be considered a platform from which to advocate improvements to animal welfare [48] .",

The culture in a country can affect perceptions of animal sentience, which according to several studies [5, 26, 49] will then correlate with the perception of whether practices involving the animal species are considered cruel or not.",

Although those that were aware expressed opinions that were positive towards the welfare of animals, the majority considered the care of animals in China to be poor. The role of the popular media in discussing the welfare of animals seems to have improved recently. The respondents that were concerned for the welfare of animals were concerned for the welfare of all taxa and all types of commercial animal uses. A particularly interesting finding, and one that confirms a previous study, was the higher value placed on the welfare of wild animals than for other types of animal uses. The survey also showed the importance given to the taste of food and the safety of food from farm animals, and any possible link these might have to the welfare of the animals used; respondents reported that they would be prepared to pay more for such food.",

Likewise, the respondents were more urbanised in this study than the population of China as a whole. This may have been due to the use of student questioners rather than professional market research questioners, and also the sites selected to carry out the questioning. Finally, narratives related to the welfare of animals that might have been important but not predicted by the designers of the questionnaire may have been missed. ",
