This has been a major issue for developing ML models for the coronavirus-disease 2019 pandemic where data are highly imbalanced. Conventional approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) which often suffers from poor margin classification. For the first time, we show that contrastive loss (CL) improves the performance of CEL especially in imbalanced electronic health records (EHR) data for COVID-19 analyses.",

Hospital resources such as medication supply and hospital beds quickly became constrained [2 3 ]. Due to the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dearth of relevant data available for research purposes, so electronic health records (EHR) became a valuable tool to study and characterize COVID-19 patients. EHR have already been used in biomedical research for disease and patient clustering, patient trajectory modeling, disease prediction, and clinical decision support, among others [4] . Recent studies discovered important findings to better understand COVID-19 through EHR-based analyses [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

For temporal data modeling and prediction of patient outcomes in particular, deep representation learning (DL) [22] holds promise over traditional ML techniques that require manual engineering of informative patient features [23] [24] [25] . Heterogeneous graph networks are a powerful DL based graph representation technique that have successfully been utilized in EHR-related studies [26 27 ]. These models have a graphical structure that captures the underlying relationships between disparate medical concepts such as diagnoses and lab tests [28] . Further, these graph convolutional models can be endowed with an attention mechanism [29] to automatically identify how important local neighbors in the graph are to a given medical concept [30] . Attention models such as RETAIN provide a detailed interpretation of results and maintain high prediction accuracy by using reversetime attention mechanisms to consolidate past visits [31] .",

Poor generalization of the models is normally due to underspecification [34] . The underlying aspects of EHR data may also limit model effectiveness [35] . Healthcare data sets often have inadequate sample sizes in terms of both small hospitals and rare disease populations and exhibit high class imbalance for key outcomes of interest, such as in rare events, as in the case with COVID-19. Several strategies have been utilized to mitigate these data and modeling challenges including upand down-sampling, pre-training, transfer learning, and federated learning, but each have their limitations for use in EHR research [36] . Other than these methods, the role of loss function has yet to be thoroughly investigated in the context of COVID-19 EHR work, which is the focus of this work. DL models often use cross-entropy loss (CEL) function, but CEL has been shown to potentially have poor classification margins, making the model less generalizable [37] . Recently, supervised contrastive loss (CL) has been proposed to improve the classification performance of CEL [37] . This original CL algorithm used sets of one anchor, many positives, and many negatives to maximize the similarities within the same class.",

These heat maps display similar importance scores in terms of key features and their magnitudes. RETAIN identified lab tests and vital sign features that are considered important by both loss models: pulse oximetry (0.26 for CEL, 0.21 for CL); asparate aminotransferase (0.69 for CEL, 0.72 for CL); blood urea nitrogen (0.12 for CEL, 0.12 for CL); lactate (0.24 for CEL, 0.23 for CL); lactate dehydrogenase (0.28 for CEL, 0.3 for CL).

We observe that using CL can still capture the highly scored features identified inthe full data set (i.e., weigh similar key features). On the other hand, CEL fails to capture some important features. Of particular interest, the importance of pulse oximetry is no longer prioritized in the restricted sample using CL (importance value is 0.09 for CEL comparing to 0.35 for CL). Also, blood urea nitrogen, lactate have lower importance values of 0.02, 0.09 for CEL compared to 0.15, 0.36 for CL.

Most DL-based EHR analyses utilize CEL as part of modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to demonstrate the utility of CL in EHR predictive analyses. We demonstrate the benefit of CL in multiple tasks with imbalanced outcome labels, which is particularly pertinent in the context of COVID-19. We compare the performance of different sequential architectures (RNN and RETAIN) for both CL and the conventional CEL model under two time window horizons. We conduct further experiments for each outcome in a restricted data set of even more imbalanced outcomes and show the benefit of CL is even more pronounced via three separate experimental tasks, namely predictive performance, feature importance, and clustering.",

However, CEL mainly focuses on maximizing the similarity between patient and outcome one-hot representations. Therefore, CL tends to maximize the margins between classes better than CEL. The better margin classification ability of CL lead to higher performance for imbalanced data, for which the classification is difficult due to poor margin classification of CEL in addition to differences in data distributions for each class.",

Second, we only assess two sequential modeling techniques. Another main limitation of our study is excluding several laboratory values due to high levels of missingness, which may impact some of our interpretations. Furthermore, we utilize a specific time sequence modeling representation. Lastly, our work focuses only on one disease usecase. For future studies, other modeling architecture can be assessed to evaluate the generalizability of our CL approach. Also, additional analysis is required to understand feature importance differences between the loss functions and to determine if our CL methodology is applicable to other healthcare data sets. We also plan to assess performance of this strategy for predictive tasks in other diseases. We believe this work represents an effective demonstration of the power of using CL for machine learning work for predictive tasks using EHRs.

Electronic health record (EHR) data are modeled to create patient and event embedding representations which are fed into our contrastive loss (CL) equation. B) Representation Space. CL simultaneously pushes positive patients and event embeddings (i.e., concordant with respect to the outcome of the patient of interest, respectively) away from negative ones. C) Time Binning. Schematic to visualize how we model time sequence.We have two outcome windows (i.e., 24-and 48-hours prior to event) and bin data by 6-hour chunks. D): Selection of Event Timing for Null Outcomes. For patients that do not experience the outcome of interest, we generate a data-driven event time to align against as in C. We compute the mean and standard deviation for the length of time that elapsed from admission for all patients with the affiliated outcomes independently. For patients without an event, we randomly pick a time to use as a reference end point using a Gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation obtained from the positive training data.contrastive loss shown in Eq. 7 C p : patient embedding C e : event embedding u: patient of interest similarity between patients p maximized by loss L or L similarity between patient p and event e maximized by loss L or L",
