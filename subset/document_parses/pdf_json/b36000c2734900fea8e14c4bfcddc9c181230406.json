From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine-cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify inactive cell types and cytokine interactions that may be important following SARS-CoV-2 infection when comparing the cytokine response with other viruses capable of initiating a cytokine storm. Such findings have potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies.

Cytokines are low molecular weight peptides (5-20 kDa) released by a wide repertoire of cell types including immune cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and other stromal cells. They enable coordinated autocrine, paracrine, and even endocrine homeostatic functions to occur within the body [1] . Cytokines exert these effects by binding to specific receptors that are expressed by target cells, which activate downstream intracellular signalling pathways and ultimately result in the expression of genes required for a particular process [2] . Cytokines effectively regulate all physiological processes in the human body ranging from embryonic development, to angiogenesis, to haemostasis, and innate and adaptive immunity. Cytokines are able to achieve such diverse and wide-ranging effects because they exhibit pleiotropy (i.e. a single cytokine can cause different biological effects and can act on different cell types) and redundancy (i.e. a variety of cytokines can activate the same signalling pathways) [3] .",

Although great progress has been made in identifying, characterising, and understanding the targets and functions of cytokines in the human body in health and disease, there is a lack of readily available resources that can computationally model cytokine-cytokine interactions [8, 9] . Hence, we developed a novel biological network resource, CytokineLink. CytokineLink includes 10313 total interactions from 18 healthy human cell subsets and 24 tissue types. With CytokineLink two types of indirect or metanetworks were defined: 1) a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines;",

The effects of infliximab and golimumab (two TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors) and tocilizumab (an IL6 inhibitor) were investigated. The significance of differentially expressed cytokines regulated by TNF-\u03b1 or IL6 following inhibitor treatment was determined using a chi square test of independence, via the chisq.test() R language function. Expression data was downloaded from GEO and analysed using GEO2R. The cutoff for differential expression was a fold-change of 2, with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05. The R scripts used for establishing differential gene expression and the subsequent statistical analysis can be found in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/CytokineLink.

Only the genes falling into the top quintile of expression ranges were considered expressed, both for cytokines and receptors, respectively. From the processed data, 13 cell subsets that are especially important in inflamed ulcerative colitis (out of 51 cell subsets) were selected [18] [19] [20] .

It is a relapsing and remitting condition which can cause significant morbidity to patients. The incidence as well as prevalence of UC has been increasing globally over the past few decades [25, 26] . Although the aetiology of the disease is unclear, complex interactions between multiple genetic risk loci, environmental factors, and the gut microbiota are thought to give rise to dysregulated immune responses in the colon, resulting in chronic inflammation. Whilst UC can be successfully treated through surgical removal of the colon (i.e. colectomy), many patients wish to preserve the function of their colons and avoid the complications of surgery, and hence opt for medical management which aims to induce and maintain remission [27, 28] .",

Nevertheless, approximately 20% of UC patients fail to respond to medical therapies and eventually undergo surgical intervention for their disease [18] . One important reason for this is that certain subgroups of UC patients may possess distinct pathogenic pathways and cytokine signalling networks which are not targeted by the existing armamentarium of biologic therapies [32] . Thus, further disentangling the cytokine signalling networks driving the pathomechanisms in UC patients is a pressing need. Over the past three years, a number of landmark single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have been performed in IBD patients, that have revealed critical and novel insights into the likely cell types mediating the pathogenic processes involved during non-inflamed and inflamed states of the disease [16, [33] [34] [35] . However, these studies did not focus on cytokine-specific intercellular signalling networks. This would be important for better understanding dysregulation of cytokine signalling in UC and revealing potential new therapeutic targets for patients.",

            "text": "On the level of cytokine -cytokine interactions the difference is more apparent, as IL5 and especially IL4 act as hubs, further increasing the connections between the elevated cytokines. The CytokineLink analysis provides a possible mechanistic link to the lack of one of the key anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL12. The low levels of IL12 are comparable to healthy controls in severe COVID-19 patients, while the levels of IL4 are significantly higher in severe patients [38, 39] . We note that the basis of using IL4 to complement the system was based on our previous work involving literature curation. At the time one research article was available that had measured serum IL4 levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. These patients had mild symptoms and therefore low levels of IL4 [40] .Comparing the SARS-CoV-2 specific and complemented network models, there is a missing interaction between basophils and naive B-cells, mediated by the cytokine IL4. IL4 is capable of repressing Th1 responses, including the production of IL12 and IFN-\u03b3 [41] . Thus, the increase in the levels of IL4 in severe COVID-19 patients can offer an explanation for the low levels of observed IL12, through the previously described IL4 -IL12 interaction captured by our model. IL12 is an important stimulator of IFN-\u03b3 and the type II interferon response. This response is critical for leading the innate immune response into the adaptive one and eliminating viral infection. It also has an important role in facilitating the differentiation of naive B cells into plasma cells. In our analysis, we found that IL12 levels remain low in patients with severe COVID-19 likely due to an increase in IL4. IL4 is a potent inhibitor of Th1 responses, including the production of IL12 and IFN-\u03b3. Thus, the diminished IL12 levels in a certain subgroup of COVID19 patients may explain the reason why they experience more severe disease. Further work is needed to investigate this potential causal link [42] [43] [44] [45] .",

In recent years, interest has grown in the study of intercellular interactions occurring between immune cell subtypes [16, [49] [50] [51] . However, these studies had a broader selection of ligand -receptor interactions, and used differential expression and/or marker genes describing the cell subsets to generate their interactions. CytokineLink provides metanetworks built from healthy human consensus expression data, enriched with literature annotation information previously present in separate, unconnected resources. Our methods use the underlying chain of signalling events to generate the metanetworks, and because of this every metaedge can be led back to the exact signalling sequence it was created from, the information content of the generated metaedges matches those of the original signalling events. As such, the interactions in CytokineLink represent a novel, context specific signalling format, allowing for focused analyses involving cell-cell or cytokine-cytokine interactions. Our analyses using the CytokineLink platform highlight the rewiring of cell-cell communication between disease states in a cytokine-centered way, mediated by specific cytokines in UC, a form of IBD, and COVID-19. Similar analyses involving multi-omics data could help researchers shortlist potential therapeutic targets, through the integrated analysis of the expression, proteomic or regulatory status of tracked cytokines [16, 34, 52] .",

Our use case involving elevated cytokines in COVID-19 elucidated how the approach can be used to capture known cytokine -cytokine interactions, and use the data as a starting point for subsequent studies. The advantage and purpose of these cytokine focused metaedges is that they could enable the identification of previously unknown drug targets by focusing on upstream cytokines, especially if direct intervention on a downstream cytokine would be unavailable or not preferable. In addition, it could allow researchers to predict the potential ways an administered drug could alter downstream cytokine responses and the associated cell types involved in intercellular communication.",

RNA enrichment data was downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas to assign cytokines and cytokine receptors to source tissue and cell types. The combination of cytokine -receptor interactions, and tissue/cell -cytokine/receptor interactions was used to generate base networks containing tissue-cytokine-receptor interactions, from which abstracted meta-edges were created. The cell -cytokine associations were further annotated using information from two systems immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. The cell-cell metaedges show the intercellular interactions mediated by the individual cytokines. The cytokine-cytokine edges indicate the potential ways by which the production of a cytokine can alter the production of another, by binding to its receptor carried by a cell type expressing the secondary cytokine. Annotation The systems immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe curate interaction data collated from the literature, between cell types and cytokines, both as sources and targets (i.e. both the cytokines and cells can be actors and can be acted upon). The curated cell -cytokine and cytokine -cell interaction annotations from immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe were included in CytokineLink, assigning literature enrichment to the cellcytokine associations to the underlying edges in the general network the metaedges were created from. In practice, following the example on Figure 1, this means that for every metaedge (e.g. myeloid DC \u2192 memory B-cell) users can see if the cytokine-cell interaction annotations establishing the metaedge (i.e. myeloid DC \u2192 TNFSF13) has been reported in the literature previously. SupplementaryTable 1contains the combined cytokine-cell interaction annotations from the ImmuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe databases.",

The CytokineLink database stores cytokine interactions in two ways. The intercellular interaction meta-edges convey the interactions of the individual cell types and tissues included in the analysis, mediated by enriched cytokines. Cytokine-cytokine meta-edges indicate the potential pathways through which cytokines can affect the production of other cytokines. These two meta-interaction layers place the underlying chain of events in two different contexts using the cell -cell and cytokine -cytokine metaedges, elucidating as to how cytokines are involved in immune responses following infection, or in inflammatory diseases. These metanetworks are a context-specific interpretation of the underlying signalling events, depicting the flow of information mediated by intercellular cytokine communication.",
