Large numbers of people are predicted to become critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome and will require management in intensive care units. High levels of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial impairments can be anticipated. Rehabilitation providers will serve as an important link in the continuum of care, helping move patients on from acute sites to eventual discharge to the community. Likely impairment patterns, considerations for healthcare practitioner resilience, and organization of services to meet demand are discussed. Innovative approaches to care, such as virtual rehabilitation, are likely to become common in this environment.",

However, this is a rapidly evolving literature. The World Health Organization is coordinating the five-treatment arm \"solidarity\" trial, testing remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon \u03b2, and chloroquine.

Rehabilitation is a complex intervention 32 and refers to a longitudinal process focused on minimizing the disabling effect of an individual's impairments, promoting and optimizing functional independence in activities of daily living, and maximizing opportunities to participate meaningfully in society on the basis of any new functional baseline. 32 Rehabilitation is best delivered by specialists in multidisciplinary teams with a broad range of skills to support bio-psychosocial functioning. [33] [34] [35] Existing evidence for effectiveness suggests that multidisciplinary team rehabilitation should start early in the course of hospital treatment, 36 involve patients and family in goal planning as far as possible/practical, 37 and consider holistic bio-psycho-social needs, taking into consideration likely short-, medium-, and longer-term care trajectories. 38 Multidisciplinary team meetings and interactions with patients, families, and between professionals will likely be limited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maintaining active, reciprocal lines communication between a finite number of care providers will be important for effective coordination of care, avoidance of redundancy, and unnecessary duplication of services.

Active mobilization in the ICU has been manualized. For example, Green et al. 39 (2016) suggest that if a patient does not have independent sitting balance and a medical research council power score of less than 3 in the lower limbs, \"phase 1\" mobilization should start with sitting balance practice, use of a tilt table, and muscle strengthening exercises. Those with independent sitting balance and a medical research council power score of 3 or higher can progress to \"phase 2\" mobilization with supported/active weight bearing with exercises including \"sit-to-stand,\" marching on the spot \u00b1 gait aid, eventually moving away from the bed space \u00b1 a gait aid. 39 Early active mobilization is associated with improved muscle strength, better mobility status at hospital discharge, and more days alive out of hospital. 40 A commonly described barrier to active mobilization in the ICU is fear that this may interfere with critical life support devices, such as endotracheal tubes, chest drains, arterial and central venous access lines, and dialysis catheters. 41 However, various studies have confirmed that active mobilization is feasible and safe in these circumstances and consensus recommendations, such as the \"traffic light\" system, 42 can be used to guide the ICU/rehabilitation team in this regard. Rehabilitation providers working in the ICU must know how to identify confirmed cases of COVID-19, as well as those actively under investigation. Rehabilitation providers may have to don personal protective equipment, a practice with which they may have limited experience, 43 and it is important that they are aware of correct donning and doffing guidelines, 44 besides general conservation strategies. Extra planning may be necessary when coordinating patient assessments, so as to avoid having to throw away masks and vizors between patients.",

Proactive administrative support mechanisms may largely offset this challenge, whereby a centralized, coordinated approach can be used by all specialists working in rehabilitation in a given area to cut down on physician administrative time, freeing up clinical capacity. Flexible working hours may be required for some staff, as schools close and childcare needs emerge. 29 Equally important is healthcare provider wellness in the context of an extraordinarily stressful social and work environment. In the United States, rehabilitation physicians are already among the most \"burned out.\" 50, 51 Wellness resources with existing evidence for effectiveness, such as virtual mindfulness-based interventions 52 and/or Schwartz rounds, 53 could be made available to support staff well-being, providing both self-care skills and an important source of social support.",

            "text": "In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual care outpatient episodes may be preferable to face-to-face interactions for multiple reasons. Firstly, to take care of patients, healthcare providers must first themselves be in good health. 56 The healthcare population, physicians in particular, is aging. 57 In the United States, more than 20% of physicians are older than 65 yrs. 57 Many older healthcare practitioners will have their own long-term health conditions and may fear for their safety on exposure to COVID-19 patients. Secondly, from a patient, family, and wider societal perspective, delivering healthcare in settings where groups of people gather such as \"waiting rooms\" is actively discouraged for fear of further community spread. 1 In this context, it is also possible that a healthcare provider may be carrying COVID-19 asymptomatically; in such a case, the healthcare provider may then inadvertently become a \"super spreader.\" 1 Virtual care circumvents these issues and allows personalized consultation and treatment via telephone or live Internet connections, or via prerecorded sessions for more generic materials. 58 In some countries, well-developed, secure virtual care platforms already exist; in others, media such as Zoom, Skype, Facetime, and others may be suitable alternatives. However, virtual care also has many limitations, such as ready availability of equipment, technical malfunctions, potential for inadvertent personal data disclosure, limited scope for physical examination, and the process largely relies on the patient being able to attend to sessions, communicate, and interact accordingly. 59 This may not be possible for many patients. Rehabilitation providers should start to consider the scope and limitations of virtual physical examinations and make patients expressly aware of this accordingly.",

            "text": "A related construct to rehabilitation is prehabilitation. Prehabilitation operates on the premise that those who take preemptive steps to optimize their general health and fitness have better outcomes after the stress challenge of elective surgery. 60 A recent opinion article 61 in the British Medical Journal makes the case for prehabilitation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In brief, the following prehabilitative interventions are recommended: smoking cessation, regular exercise, good nutrition, and stress reduction. 61 Although there is no direct evidence to support prehabilitation in the context of COVID-19, it seems likely that good general health measures such as those suggested will confer benefit to people generally, particularly those with preexisting long-term conditions. 62 In this view, rehabilitation specialists could have an important public health role to play in educating patients and families through provision of evidence based, personalized recommendations for home-based physical activity, 62 nutrition, 63 managing stress, 64 and stopping smoking. 65 Finally, rehabilitation specialists, such as all health professionals, through their extensive contact with patients, also have an opportunity to reinforce the importance of current public health measures designed to stop the spread of COVID-19, namely, effective handwashing, respiratory hygiene, and social distancing. 1 SUMMARY COVID-19 associated critical illness will have dramatic implications for patients, families, and healthcare workers around the world. Healthcare services will have to adapt rapidly to an anticipated surge of cases, and this will place enormous strain on acute services. Rehabilitation professionals will have a critical role in assisting people recover from COVID-19-associated critical illness, make sense of their experiences, help optimize independent function, and facilitate community reintegration. Although COVID-19 is a novel disease, rehabilitation providers already routinely treat patients who experience disability as a result of critical illness generally and ARDS specifically. However, we need to take care of each other in the crisis we face, and being prepared is a major first step in this regard.",
