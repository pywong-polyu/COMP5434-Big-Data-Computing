Deb et al noted that it was a result of an acute immune response but there is no data on immune change or pathological autoimmunity. In this case, there might be an underlying cardiovascular condition and the given vaccine might induce thrombohemostasis alteration. In a previous report, the COVID-19 vaccination can result in increased blood viscosity which might be an important leading cause of myocardial disease. 3",
