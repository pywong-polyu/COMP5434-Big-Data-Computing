In addition, India's relatively young age structure tends to conceal the severity of Covid-19 mortality, which is concentrated in older age groups. In this paper, we present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes. We show that we can model the age distribution of Covid-19 mortality in India and use this modeling to estimate Covid-19 mortality in the country. Our findings point to a death toll of approximately 3.2-3.",

With the emergence of the Delta variant [1] , this wave has been particularly severe and has hit most of the country. It spread in several urban agglomerations such as Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Bengaluru which were among the hardest areas in the country and gradually to more rural areas [2] . However, there is a serious gap between the severity of the crisis reported by local communities and the effect measured by official indicators of contamination and Covid-19 related deaths. The country has officially registered only 459,000 Covid-19 deaths by early November 2021. This number corresponds to a rate of 0.3 per thousand inhabitants, which is twice lower than the world average [3] . Such a low figure contradicts the apparent severity of a crisis. The second wave struck most Indian families across the country and was accompanied by dramatic shortage of vaccines, Covid-19 tests, ambulances, access to health personnel, hospital beds, oxygen, ventilators, drugs and finally, coffins, wood, priests and spots for cremation or burials as widely reported in Indian and international media [4] .",

We use here four independent population samples to reconstruct the impact of mortality. These samples of various sizes and demographic composition relate to official Covid-19 dataset for the state of Kerala, the employees of the Indian Railways, Indian elected representatives, and Karnataka's schoolteachers. They are employed to characterize the age and sex profile of India's Covid-19 mortality and then assess its severity by fitting mortality patterns to the number of deaths reported in these samples. This estimation implies a death tally of about 3.2-3.7 million from March 2020 to early November 2021, a figure about 7-8 times higher than the official numbers.",

Cases of Covid-19 deaths are known to have been specifically underestimated for two main reasons: many deaths go unrecorded for lack of prior PCR test of the deceased; the cause of death is often selectively attributed to comorbidities (diabetes, asthma, etc.) and other apparent factors (heart attacks, etc.) when the WHO recommends suspected cases of Covid-19 to be reported as such [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . More generally, Covid-19 is a source of shame. Families often prefer to hide the nature of the ailment affecting their relatives, ascribing resulting deaths to fevers or other diseases to avoid the social stigma [10] [11] [12] . This embarrassment is also felt at the political level, and Covid-19 figures have been used from the start of the crisis as a political chip to blame national and regional governments for wrong decisions or inaction or even to target minorities [13, 14] . This context provides no incentive at both micro and macro levels to record faithfully and exhaustively cases of Covid-19.",

They are primarily city-based, and apart from their relatively high salaries, they enjoy numerous added benefits such as housing, home staff, specific allowances, traveling and energy reimbursement, access to medical facilities, and pension benefits. This situation was reflected notably by the fact that a vast majority of Covid-19-related deaths among MLAs took place in the most reputed Indian hospitals across the country.

Overall, IR workers may be slightly more privileged than the rest of the population for various reasons: it is a more urban population (following the railway grid) made of permanent employees (public servants) that have in particular access to income security, housing allotment or subsidies, dedicated healthcare system, provident fund, and pension benefits. By definition, this sample does not cover workers from the informal economy. It is also a population that may have been exposed to higher risks of Covid-19 contamination due to the volume of passenger traffic (8.1 billion in 2019-20). As proof, the death rate is twice as high among station masters (2.9 per 1000) as among the rest of the IR staff (1.5 per 1000). But most of the IR staff are not frontline workers but engineers, clerks, mechanics, pilots, and technicians (such as pointsmen or gangmen) who are not in contact with the public. The IR traffic has also been repeatedly interrupted during the pandemic, most notably during the initial lockdown in March-May 2020, during which almost no train ran through India. However, the vigorous vaccination campaign that started in May 2021 among the IR staff has probably reduced subsequent Covid-19 mortality in a significant way [37] .",

We will, however, briefly introduce the readers to the main argument of the reasoning: Covid-19 mortality by sex and age has now been measured in most countries in the world with disaggregated statistics published by national statistical bureaus [40] . Beyond the overall observation that Covid-19 mortality rises with age and is more pronounced among males, the comparison of these mortality curves has highlighted their extreme regularity. Covid-19 mortality above age 20 follows the so-called Gompertz law of mortality (in which death rates can be expressed as an exponential function of age) [41] [42] [43] . As a result of this mathematical regularity, death rates unknown at one given age can be extrapolated from death rates observed at other ages. Another advantage of the Gompertz modeling is its partition of mortality into two main components:",

This difference may reflect measurement issues as well as the composition of each sample. Higher mortality observed among elected representatives (MLA sample) may be attributed to their exposure to contamination since the outbreak of the pandemic due to their continuous interaction with their electorate and the busy election schedule of 2020-21. In comparison, the mortality estimate based on the IR staff may capture a less exposed subpopulation even if frontline workers. The IR estimate gets a first confirmation from the Karnataka sample. This sample recorded 268 Covid-19 deaths among government schoolteachers in the Southern state of Karnataka. The application of the IR mortality patterns to the age and sex structure of Karnataka's schoolteachers yield a preliminary total of 177 deaths. When we correct the latter figure for Karnataka's relatively higher Covid-19 death rate (66% above India's as per official estimates in May 2021), we obtain a final estimate of 294 deaths among schoolteachers based on the IR mortality level. This figure is very close to the 268 deaths reported among Karnataka's schoolteachers and reinforces the consistence of the figures based on the IR sample. Considering all these observations, we keep 3.2-3.7 million as our best estimates by 1 November 2021. This probably represents a lower bound value since our main samples do not cover the most underprivileged sections of India's population, notably rural and informal workers.",
