Human and cat were selected based on their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4 but with high and low S-protein RBD-ACE2 affinity, respectively. 2 In order to determine the pitches for each amino acid, we used the algorithm previously developed to translate RNA code sequences into pitches. 3 This algorithm facilitates the expression of the nitrogenous bases as a short sequence of pitches coded by arbitrary attribution on each of the steps of the diatonic scale",

            "text": "central section (bars 18-92), and third or final coda section with the reoccurrence of the first motif (bars 93-109). The greatest concentration of these motifs (up to 11 times in 23 measures) appeared at the end of the melodic line (bars 81-104). Coincidence in amino acids involved in RBD-ACE2 interactions and melody key residues and in second and third motifs were observed (Video S1).The interaction between RBD and human ACE2 receptor was characterized using a polyphonic perspective by replicating the RBD in the extension of the ACE2 sequence (see Methodology in the Supplemental Information). Within the polyphonic context, we found sequences of unisons, melodic imitations and canonical structures that represent regions of amino acid homology between the compared sequences (Figure S2A). Bars involved in these thematic relations (n = 127) are distributed in three sections throughout the entire ACE2 sequence (amino acids 1-109, 322-433 and 698-end). These melodic imitation relationships were not restricted to the amino acids of the four motifs described above(Figure S1A). However, they coincide with ACE2 measures in the first (Q (caa), amino acids 336, 415, 803), second (G (ggt), amino acids 102, 105, 367, 368, 404, 405, 407, 422, 436), third (Y (tat), amino acids 23, 49, 50, 375, 718, 710, 746) and fourth (N (aat), amino acids 47, 48, 103, 370, 372, 718, 719, 745, 747) motifs. The greatest number of melodic imitations was identified in the first section (bars 1-109), with 42 measures involved. Fragments with a strong imitative component (bars 16-19; 26-32, 41-47, 48-51, 74-78, 101-104, 328-329, 336-338, 367-375, 404-412, 421-426, 714-729, and 795-805 were identified (Figure S2A). The relevant musical motifs in RBS included first motif Q (caa), second motif G (ggt), third motif Y (tat), and fourth motif N (aat) (Figure S1B). These interactions can be viewed and listened in Videos S2-S4. The interaction between RBD and cat ACE2 receptor was characterized applying the same polyphonic perspective used for human ACE2. When compared to human ACE2, fewer musical motivic relations (barely 44 bars involved) were observed with the involvement of only 13 bars in the first 109 bars (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the imitative relationship was sporadic or occasional, and unlike the RBD-human ACE2 interaction where the musical mimics occurred among a range of motifs other than the four delimited motifs in the S chain (Figure S2B), in the RBD-cat ACE2 interaction only the four musical motifs on the amino acids Q(caa), G(ggt) Y(tat) and N (aat) mediate most of the musical imitations. The musical imitations were located for the first motif on bars 325-326, second motif on bars 756-757, third motif on bars 427-428, 637, fourth motif on bars 58-70, 83-85, Melodically there are four motifs that give coherence to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD identified with the amino acids Q (caa), G (ggt), Y (tat) and N (aat). The RBD-human ACE2 interaction showed a high density of melodic-motoric imitations not restricted to these four amino acids although they were highly participating and concentrated between bars 1-109, 323-423 and 698-808. However, in the RBD-cat ACE2 interaction there are hardly any melodic-motivic interactions, which were limited to the four motifs identified in RBD, with the only exception of certain imitations on the musical motif derived from A (gct).These musical imitative components when translated into biological information showed a higher correlation with ACE2 direct contact residues with RBD and sites under positive selection in human when compared to cat protein (Figure 1). Musical imitative components in ACE2 residues in the allosteric cluster were identified in both human and cat sequences (Figure 1).Musical Algorithms Provide Alternative and Complementary Methodological ApproachesThese results using musical algorithms support a stronger RBD-ACE2 interaction in humans than in cats, which identifies cats as susceptible to reverse zoonotic (human-to animal) virus transmission with low risk for human infection.2,4 These results will be correlated with those from other approaches such as changes in binding energy of the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 complex in different host species. 2 However, new virus variants with mutations in S-protein may be more effective in evading immunity, thus increasing the risk for zoonotic virus transmission. 5 The musical algorithms described here provide alternative and complementary approaches to the study of protein-protein molecular interactions with implications in areas such as host-pathogen interactions and quantum vaccinomics.5 The application of these methods can contribute to the analysis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 virus variants generated in both humans and animal hosts with implications for the control of COVID-19 pandemic.
