The location of the nodule coincided with the injection site of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer, Inc., New York City, NY, USA) SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, administered three months before. The nodule was preceded by a pruritic macule which emerged a week after inoculation, and which steadily evolved to the lesion with which the patient presented. The patient had not experienced any side effects related to the administration of the first vaccine dose, which she had received 3 weeks before in the ipsilateral arm. Dermoscopic evaluation of the nodule revealed dotted vessels and shiny white lines on an erythematous background.",

The acute or delayed occurrence of cutaneous pseudolymphoma has been reported at the injection site of Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, 1 quadrivalent human papilloma virus, 3 early summer time meningoencephalitis and tetanus vaccination. 4 Subcutaneous papules, nodules and erythematous patches can be presenting signs of vaccine-associated cutaneous pseudolymphoma. 4 The patient in this case had received various vaccinations throughout her lifetime, including the influenza vaccine on a yearly basis but had not experienced any localized or systemic side effects. It has been proposed that cutaneous pseudolymphoma may represent a reaction to vaccine adjuvants such as aluminium hydroxide. 1 This adjuvant is not found in the Pfizer-BioNtech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. 5 By flagging this unique adverse drug reaction, we hope to broaden physician's repertoire of differential diagnoses when presented with SARS-CoV-2-related injection site reactions.",
