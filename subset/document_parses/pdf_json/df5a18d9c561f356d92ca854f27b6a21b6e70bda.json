In seismically active regions of Southwest China, local rural residents' dilapidated housing with poor seismic performance aggravates the impacts of earthquakes on their mental health. These residents' mental health is difficult to recognize because of the lack of appropriate assessment methods. In addition, rural residents in the area have a low socioeconomic status and cannot access adequate mental treatment. Thus, telemedicine could be an effective approach to assist mental health practice in such areas. However, the lack of telemedicine assessment factors in these areas makes it difficult to complete the correct triage and prioritization of rural residents' mental health quickly and effectively. To provide a foundation for applying telemedicine to assess the risk of mental health problems that rural residents in seismically active regions experience, this paper studied whether the degree of safety of housing can affect mental health. In this study, nine villages near the epicenter of the 2019 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Changning County, China were randomly selected, and 162 valid questionnaires were completed. SPSS statistical software was used to analyze the collected data. First, the satisfaction of rural residents with the degree of safety of housing significantly affected the K6 score and whether they suffered from mental problems. Second, the mental health of rural residents living in reinforced concrete frame structure housing was obviously superior to that of those living in other types of housing. Next, the most significant factor affecting mental health was the degree of wall cracks. Finally, a new approach was developed to assess and prioritize the mental health of rural residents by using degrees of housing safety and smart technology in seismically active regions. The telemedicine assessment approach is expected to be used in the future for mental health evaluation and the large-scale data scoring of rural residents.",

Given their destructiveness and unpredictability, they have caused many human deaths and injuries, inevitably disturbing the mental health of local residents. The mental health problems caused by earthquakes has received considerable attention worldwide. In recent years, many countries, such as Japan (1), Italy (2) , New Zealand (3), and China (4) , have reported that many local residents experienced mental health problems in the aftermath of an earthquake. In China, Sichuan Province is considered a seismically active region. The province is located in Southwest China, bordering the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Frequent earthquakes occur due to the Longmenshan fault zone. Furthermore, many major earthquakes, such as the Wenchuan 8.0 earthquake in 2008, the Lushan 7.0 earthquake in 2013 and the 2019 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Changning County, have severely affected the world. Earthquakes have become the most destructive and frequent natural disaster in this region. In particular, after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the devastating environmental damage and economic losses, coupled with the terrible casualty rate, made the mental problems of the local residents in the area more apparent. A previous study found that 1 month after the Wenchuan earthquake, the initial prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 409 survivors in Qingchuan County was estimated to be as high as 62.8% (5) .",

Therefore, in the areas in which earthquakes occur frequently, under the influence of earthquakes, mental health has a natural relationship with building safety. For example, existing studies have found that after an earthquake, the greater the damage to residents' houses is, the more likely the residents are to suffer from mental problems (6, 7) . Given that Sichuan Province is in an earthquake fault zone, especially after the Wenchuan earthquake, all buildings in Sichuan Province have been required to implement earthquake resistance. In particular, building safety in cities is relatively high. Even in most rural areas, under the strong promotion of the Chinese government, some dilapidated houses were demolished or renovated in conjunction with shantytown renovations. However, these policies do not include all buildings, nor can they prevent all earthquake casualties. In the 2019 Changning earthquake, 13 people were still killed, and 226 were injured. Therefore, compared with urban areas, rural areas face a greater risk of casualties during earthquakes.",

Furthermore, we also found that most local residents were old people who had very limited capacity to obtain earthquake information on the Internet and usually obtained earthquake information from relatives and the government. Therefore, the degree of housing safety could be considered an extremely important factor for these rural residents, and whether the degree of housing safety can affect their mental health deserves further exploration and study.",

Postearthquake experiences (such as homelessness and temporary housing types) have also been reported to be related to the severity and long-term effect of trauma (11) .

In addition, the lack of mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and psychiatric nurses and limited access to and distribution of these services are among the several obstacles in improving rural residents' mental health in seismically active regions of Southwest China. Rural residents also have a low socioeconomic status and cannot afford adequate mental treatment in cities.

First, Southwest China that is mainly mountainous and sparsely populated has a vast area and complex landforms. For example, the area of Sichuan Province is larger than that of Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, the low per capita GDP in Southwest China means that local rural residents are unwilling to pay for the transportation to urban hospitals to diagnose mental problems. And nurses and psychologists are not physically available to help rural residents with mental problems. In telemedicine, these residents can be quickly and conveniently prioritized for treatment by assessing their degree of housing safety, which is easy to extract and judge, thereby obtaining a quick overview of the overall situation. Second, for rural residents, discussing mental health with others is a humiliating and awkward behavior (33) . Consequently, certain telemedicine assessments and prioritization based on degrees of housing safety can avoid the awkwardness and resistance of rural residents. However, how the degree of housing safety affects the mental health of rural residents in seismically active regions is still unclear at present, which leads to the lack of telemedicine assessment factors in this area, and it is difficult to assess and prioritize the mental health of rural residents quickly and effectively.",

The study site was selected for two reasons. The first reason is that a destructive earthquake occurred in this area. The second reason is that the geological movement in this area has been active in recent years, and earthquakes have occurred frequently (34) . In the past 8 years, \u223c270 earthquakes have occurred in Changning County and its surrounding areas. Among these earthquakes, nearly 94 occurred in 2020 (Figure 2) . Thus, it is a typical area with frequent earthquakes. According to the presurvey we conducted, local rural residents believed that shale gas extraction in this region has caused frequent earthquakes in recent years, so they have attached great importance to housing safety. This opinion was conducive to the survey of this study. In 2019, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in Changning County was CNY 17,470, which was categorized as neither poor nor developed in China. Earthquakes notwithstanding, the county is a relatively normal place.",

To accurately judge and evaluate the factors of housing safety and structural forms, six master's in architecture students conducted the field investigation. Before the investigation, they were educated in mental health analysis and housing safety state assessment skills to ensure the consistency of the questionnaire. Ultimately, 182 questionnaires were sent out, and 162 questionnaires were valid. This field investigation was performed in December 2019.",

The Kessler 10 and 6 scales were originally developed to screen for nonspecific psychological distress in serious mental health research. Their reliability and validity have been demonstrated in studies worldwide (36, 37) . We chose the Kessler 6 scale for two reasons. First, Kessler 10 and 6 were proved to have almost the same reliability (36, 37) . Second, during the interviews, using Kessler 6 can improve the validity of the questionnaire because it is shorter and more convenient for communication and accurate expression of questions. Thus, we used the Chinese version of the K6 questionnaire, which has been validated and is thus reliable (38) (39) (40) .",

Third, one-way ANOVA was conducted for the four groups of different housing structure forms and K6 scores, and the chi-squared test was also conducted to determine the association between whether rural residents live in a reinforced concrete frame house and whether they suffer from mental problems. Finally, the degree of housing safety scored by interviewers, the degree of wall tilt, and the degree of wall cracks as independent variables were analyzed by a multiple linear regression to test whether they directly affected the K6 score. Finally, logistic regression analysis was adopted to explore the relationship between the degree of wall tilt and the degree of wall cracks and whether rural residents suffer from mental problems.

The most desirable place for rural residents to live was their current housing that has been renovated, followed by their current housing that has not been renovated (37.0 and 40.1%, respectively).

The highest mean value and standard deviation of the K6 score were for wooden structure housing (mean value = 9.17, standard deviation = 5.718), and the lowest were for reinforced concrete frame structure housing (mean value = 3.73, standard deviation = 4.245). Therefore, the rural residents with the best mental state were those who lived in reinforced concrete frame structure housing whereas those with the worst mental state was those who lived in wooden structure housing. In addition, the K6 score of reinforced concrete frame structure housing was significantly different from those of brick-concrete housing (sig = 0.001) and wooden structure housing (sig = 0.002), while no significant difference was found between the other groups. The results shown in Tables 5, 6 shows no significant relationship between the prevalence of mental problems of residents who have moved into reinforced concrete frame structure housing and those who have not (sig = 0.114). Table 7 shows the Pearson correlation analysis. The table shows the statistical significance of the degree of housing safety scored by interviewers (\u22120.366 * * ), the degree of wall tilt (0.365 * * ), and the degree of wall cracks (0.458 * * ). Strong correlations were found between other factors except the dependent variable, suggesting that multiple linear regression analysis can be adopted. Therefore, we used multiple linear regression analysis, and the results are given in Table 8 . First, no significant linear relationship was found between the degree of housing safety scored by interviewers, the degree of wall tilt, and the K6 score (sig = 0.058 and sig = 0.595, respectively). Finally, the degree of wall cracks significantly affected the mental health of rural residents (sig = 0.000). Table 9 shows that among the two independent variables included, the degree of wall tilt (sig. = 0.117, 95% CI = 0.909-2.360) had no statistical relationship with whether rural residents suffered from mental problems. However, the degree of wall cracks significantly affected the mental health of rural residents (sig. = 0.000, 95% CI = 1.438-3.330), and this factor was a risk factor for mental health (OR = 2.118).",

The results show that the higher the degree of housing safety is, the better the mental status of rural residents, and vice versa. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have assessed the relationship between housing safety and the mental health of rural residents in seismically active regions in Southwest China. This study is relatively representative in the interdisciplinary field of architecture and public health. These findings enable us to propose suggestions for improving housing safety to foster the mental health of local rural residents and develop a new method to assess and prioritize the mental health of rural residents by using degrees of housing safety and smart technology in seismically active regions.",

            "text": "Second, the satisfaction of rural residents with the degree of safety of their housing significantly affected the mental health of rural residents, which also corresponds to other studies. The degree of housing destruction after an earthquake is a risk factor affecting the mental health of residents, as has been shown in previous studies (6, 7) . This provides a meaningful reference for rural disaster prevention in seismically active regions, that is, actively improving housing safety. In addition, further studying and improving the factors affecting health, including psychological and environmental aspects, is necessary to achieve the continuous improvement of public health and maintain social fairness and justice in these areas. Third, the mental health of rural residents who live in reinforced concrete frame structure housing was obviously superior to that of those living in brick-concrete housing and wood structure housing. However, no significant difference was found with the mental health of those living in masonry housing (Figure 5 ). Our analysis found that most of the masonry housing in the survey comprised one-story buildings. Their construction age was relatively new, and they performed well in earthquakes. Thus, residents were satisfied with their living conditions. The brick-concrete structure was different from the wooden structure. Multistory brick concrete housing had the worst seismic performance and the most collapses. Thus, its performance not being as good as that of the frame structure was expected. Existing research shows that the seismic performance of traditional Chinese wooden buildings is excellent (42) . However, the mental health K6 scores of its residents were very poor. Our summary of the interview content shows that the wooden structure houses investigated were old, the oldest of which was nearly 100 years old. These wooden structures had poor living conditions. Previous studies also showed that housing quality significantly influenced mental health status (43) . Reinforced concrete frame structure housing itself has good seismic performance, crack resistance, and durability. These structures received residents' recognition. Thus, reinforced concrete frame structure housing is a better choice but has the disadvantage of having relatively high costs. Overall, a reinforced concrete frame structure is preferred. If the budget is insufficient, one-story masonry housing with reinforcement measures can be considered. In addition, the core finding of the study is that although wall cracks have little effect on the degree of housing safety, rural residents may subconsciously think that the house is unsafe when they see cracks, prompting dissatisfaction, depression and mental health problems (Figure 6) . Thus, if the government needs to improve the mental state of rural residents but is unable to cover all the costs for housing safety improvement, an effective approach is to repair the wall cracks in rural residents' houses. For example, using improved crack-resistance plastering or coating to improve and repair the cracks in the walls after an earthquake can improve the perceived degree of housing safety.",
