            "text": "Background An outbreak of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, including Kawasaki disease (KD), emerged during COVID-19 pandemic. We explored whether Kawasaki-like disease (KD), when associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has specific characteristics. Methods We included children and adolescents with KD criteria admitted in the department of general pediatrics of a university hospital in Paris, France, between January 1, 2018, and May 26, 2020. The incidence of KD was compared between the outbreak and a pre-outbreak control period (January 1, 2018, to April 25). Characteristics of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (KD-SARS-CoV-2) were compared to those of the pre-outbreak period (classic KD). Results A total of 30 and 59 children with KD were admitted during the outbreak and pre-outbreak periods, respectively (incidence ratio 13.2 [8.3-21.0]). During the outbreak, 23/30 (77%) children were diagnosed as KD-SARS-CoV-2. When compared with patients with classic KD, those with KD-SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently of sub-Saharan African ancestry ]) and older (median 8.2 vs. 4.0 years, p < 0.001), had more often initial gastrointestinal (OR 84 [4.9-1456]) and neurological ] manifestations, and shock syndrome .1]). They had significantly higher CRP and ferritin levels. Noticeably, they had more frequently myocarditis ). Conclusions Children and adolescents with KD-SARS-CoV-2 have specific features when compared with those with classic KD. These findings should raise awareness and facilitate the study of their pathogenesis.",

In adults, severe forms of COVID-19 are typically characterized by severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Second, we defined three groups of patients, according to their date of admission in the department of general pediatrics and their results of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Characteristics of patients with KD-SARS-CoV-2 were compared to those of patients with classic KD using univariate analyses.

Patients with KD-SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, were older, and presented more frequently with gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, and manifestations consistent with myocarditis. Biochemical investigations revealed higher levels of inflammatory markers, more frequent lymphopenia and increased ferritin levels. These patients also had a more severe disease course, with more frequent KD shock syndrome and admission in the intensive care unit. Still, patients with KD-SARS-CoV-2 did not develop more coronary artery dilation/ aneurysm.

            "text": "In line with three other studies in which patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome were compared with a control group of classic KD [12, 14, 15] , KD-SARS-CoV-2 patients reported here were older and had more frequently myocarditis and cardiogenic-vasoplegic shock requiring intensive care support than classic KD patients. Levels of inflammatory markers (notably CRP and procalcitonin) were higher, and patients with KD-SARS-CoV-2 had more profound lymphopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia. These characteristics are commonly observed in patients with KD shock syndrome, a severe form of KD similar to toxic shock syndrome, which affects up to 7% of classic KD patients [39] . By analogy with toxic shock syndrome, the multiorgan involvement and hyperinflammatory state observed in MIS-C patients, with particularly high levels of CRP, PCT, and IL-6, may reflect a strong immunological response to a pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 superantigen [40, 41] . The role of superantigens in the pathophysiology of classic KD has been previously suggested [42] . In adults with COVID-19, a cytokine storm syndrome with multiorgan dysfunction correlates with poor outcomes [43, 44] . However, unlike adult patients, children and adolescents with MIS-C have no significant respiratory involvement. The cytokine storm observed in our series of patients with KD-SARS-CoV-2 was associated with several criteria of MAS (e.g., cytopenia, profound hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia, and hyperferritinemia), though not fulfilling all criteria for MAS according to the PRINTO criteria, such as hypofibrinogenemia or low platelet count [18] . This might be due to early treatment with corticosteroids suppressing MAS features, and inadequate performance of the PRINTO criteria for KD, which were originally designed for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated MAS [45] . Further studies investigating the role of viral load, cytokine balance, antibodies, and immune cell response are needed to better understand the reasons for such differences in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection between adults and children.",

            "text": "In our series, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms were also more frequent in KD-SARS-CoV-2 than in classic KD, which likely reflects intestinal and neurological vasculitis, as symptoms quickly resolved after IVIG perfusion. These symptoms were also often observed in MIS-C or PIMS-TS series. In our KD-SARS-CoV-2 series, all children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness. Some authors have hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may be directly involved in MIS-C digestive manifestations by primarily infecting the gastrointestinal tract [46, 47] . However, in classic KD, gastrointestinal symptoms also usually appear before all other KD manifestations [48] . Regarding the patients' ethnic origins, we observed a higher proportion of children of Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean ancestry in the KD-SARS-CoV-2 group, when compared with classic KD, which is consistent with previous findings [12, 28] . Although the incidence of KD is usually 10-to 30-fold higher in Asia than in North America and Europe, no significant increase of KD incidence was observed in Korean children during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite high exposure to the virus [49] . Reports of PIMS-TS in the UK described a substantial rate of patients of Asian ancestry, but mainly from South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) [15, 27] . Also, KD shock syndrome has a higher incidence in Western countries than in Asia [50] . Therefore, susceptibility to KD might involve a combination of environmental factors, infectious triggers, and genetic background that predisposes to hyperinflammation [51] [52] [53] . Whether children and adolescents of Sub-Saharan African ancestry were more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in France deserves further investigations. Overall, these findings confirm that KD-SARS-CoV-2 has specific characteristics compared to classic KD; this is Fig. 2 Comparison of biological features between patients with KD-SARS-CoV-2 and patients with classic KD. Group 1 corresponded to \"classic KD,\" i.e., children with KD admitted between January 1, 2018, and April 25, 2020. Group 2 corresponded to \"KD-SARS-CoV-2,\" i.e., children admitted between April 26, 2020, and May 26, 2020, with positive SARS-CoV-2 (PCR and/or serology) testing. Group 3 corresponded to \"KD-non-SARS-CoV-2,\" i.e., children admitted between April 26, 2020, and May 26, 2020, with negative SARS-CoV-2 (PCR and serology) testing emphasized by the observation that the KD-non-SARS-CoV-2 group was similar in all measured parameters to prepandemic classic KD. This study has several limitations. First, it is a relatively small case series conducted in a unique clinical center. Our findings require confirmation in larger multicenter studies. Second, our results suggest a temporal association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and an outbreak of Kawasaki-like syndrome, but we were not able to formally investigate this association. Other similar series were described in regions severely hit by COVID-19, like the North of Italy, and other large cities with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, London and New York especially. In France, the geographical distribution of cases was similar to the one of all-ages COVID-19 hospitalizations [23] . A study including a control population allowing to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children from the Paris area is needed to reinforce causal interpretation. Third, because KD cases in the pre-outbreak era were less severe, early screening for myocarditis and heart failure was not routinely done in our center, which impeded comparisons because of missing data. Also, two patients who presented with KD in January 2020 were not tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, because the test was not yet available in routine care in Necker Hospital. This might have led to misclassification bias, with reduced statistical power.",

Public health implications are also important. Indeed, even if this outbreak of severe KD-SARS-CoV-2 concerns a relatively small number of children, the fact that it affects more frequently children of Sub-Saharan African ancestry should raise specific concern in areas with a high proportion of children of these origins.",
