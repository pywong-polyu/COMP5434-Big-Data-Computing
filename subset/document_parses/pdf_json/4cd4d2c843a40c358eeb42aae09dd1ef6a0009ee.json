Many observational studies have shown a link between infections and the pathogenesis of disease; however a greater understanding of the role of host genetics is essential. Children from the longitudinal birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, had 14 antibodies measured in plasma at age 7: Alpha-casein protein, beta-casein protein, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, feline herpes virus, Helicobacter pylori, herpes simplex virus 1, influenza virus subtype H1N1, influenza virus subtype H3N2, measles virus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Theiler's virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and SAG1 protein domain, a surface antigen of Toxoplasma gondii measured for greater precision. We performed genome-wide association analyses of antibody levels against 14 infections (N = 357 -5010) and identified three genome-wide signals (P < 5\u00d710 -8 ), two associated with measles virus antibodies and one with Toxoplasma gondii antibodies.

Again, the suggested thresholds were rarely consistent with any of the other thresholding approaches. The inconsistencies observed between the various methods for selecting a threshold, and the fact that most had more genetic signal when a continuous measure was used, suggest that selecting a threshold to define seropositivity might not be the best way to analyse the data. Therefore, in subsequent analyses we use antibody measures as continuous variables.",

We attempted to address this issue by assessing genetic signals at later clinical time points, and replicate the findings in the adult cohort, UK Biobank. Secondly, the poor evidence in some instances of genetic signal replication at different timepoints in the ALSPAC data may be owing to the small sample sizes of some of the measured antibodies. Eight antigens had a sample size of less than 700 individuals at the seven-year clinic which is the time point with the largest sample size for all measured antibodies. An approach to maximise sample size could have been to keep all individuals with antibody levels measured against infections at all clinical time points and remove any duplicate individuals retaining only individuals with antibody levels measured at the latest time point. This approach could increase potential cases as older individuals may be more likely, by virtue of time, to become infected through environmental exposure, however this approach could potentially introduce heterogeneity.",

            "text": "Thirdly, not all infections of interest had measured antibodies in UK Biobank to test for replication, and furthermore there were differences in assays used to measure antibody response between cohorts. Lastly, the interpretation of the genetic signals is difficult to disentangle using association studies as these signals could be related to susceptibility to infection and persistence of the antibodies. For example, studies have shown a reduction in antibody titers to influenza virus subtype H1N1 a year to 18 months after initial vaccination(58-61). In contrast, the two-dose vaccination programme of the measles virus has been demonstrated to produce a sustained protective antibody persistence (62) (63) (64) . In addition, if a genetic effect is shown to be associated with higher antibody levels, is the interpretation that it influences the chance of being infected, or that it influences the antibody response to infection, or potentially that it influences a long-lasting antibody response. To disentangle this challenge better approaches to measuring antibody responses against infection are required, such as the development of reliable uninfected baseline population distributions.",

In addition, in the discovery phase we have identified four potentially novel genetic associations, with rs36020612 showing strong evidence of association with T.gondii in children at the seven-year clinic, and at later clinical time-points. The location of this SNP on GRAMD1B is of particular interest as expression of this gene has been shown to be related to lymphocyte traits. We also found strong evidence of two SNPs (rs506576 and rs28617484) associated with antibodies against measles virus, however we were unable to test for replication in UK Biobank due to data unavailability. Furthermore, we observed strong evidence of replication of the suggestive SNP (rs186721582) associated with Epstein-Barr virus antibodies in UK Biobank, suggesting the genetic effect is stronger in adults. Our study provides a useful resource for future studies looking to use ALSPAC antibody measurements as well as HLA alleles. It indicates that for future use of the measured antibodies in ALSPAC the most appropriate approach is to use the antibody titer measures as a continuous variable.",

Associations linking these loci with their respective antibodies have not been previously reported. Assessing the 26 associations that met a suggestive threshold (P < 1 \u00d7 10 -6 ), the association between rs186721582 and Epstein-Barr virus antibodies replicated in UK Biobank. The associations between rs36020612 and T.gondii did not replicate (P > 5.9 \u00d7 10 -4 ) and antibody data on the measles virus was not available. Stratifying individuals by MMR vaccine status for SNPs associated with antibodies against measles virus at the sevenyear clinic showed stronger signal for individuals with an unknown status(Table 4), with comparable distributions between status. This suggests that antibody response to measles virus is more likely through environmental exposure or could be attributable to issues when using ELISAs such as high background and weak signal intensity leading to stochastic antibody levels, or potentially due to the larger sample size in the 'unknown' group.Replication of the SNPs at several clinical time points in ALSPAC (i.e. five, seven-, 11-, and 15-years) showed no associations observed at age five, but several associations persisted beyond age seven (FHV, H.pylori, HSV1, measles virus, T.gondii). For FHV antibodies, H.pylori and measles virus, the observed associations disappeared at the 15-year time point, which could be attributable to the reduction in sample size, lack of phenotypic variance, and possible false-positive associations identified at the seven-year time point.",

HLA-B*07:02 has also been investigated for its association with EBV and the latent-specific CD8 + T cell response as well as it link to MS(49, 50). However, no current literature has researched HLA-C*07:02 and HLA-DRB5*99:01 in respect to their relationship with EBV. Four HLA alleles at a four-digit resolution were associated with H.pylori antibodies, with HLA-DQB1*05:01 showing the strongest association followed by HLA-DQA1*01:01, HLA-DRB1*01:01, and lastly HLA-DQB1*03:01. All four HLA alleles were unable to be replicated in UK Biobank (P < 5.0 \u00d7 10 -4 ) which could possibly be a result of false-positive associations in ALSPAC at the seven-year clinic, and lack of phenotypic variance. To date, no studies have investigated the association of these HLA alleles and H.pylori in individuals of European ancestry. Studies using other ancestral populations have shown that HLA-DQB1*05:01 strongly increased the risk of gastric cancer in individuals of Mexican descent(51), and similarly in a Chinese population HLA-DRB1*01 was demonstrated to strongly increase in the risk of gastric cancer in H.pylori-positive individuals",
