            "text": "We aim to examine the adequacy of an innovation state-space modeling framework (called TBATS) in forecasting the long-term epidemic seasonality and trends of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Methods: The HFRS morbidity data from January 1995 to December 2020 were taken, and subsequently, the data were split into six different training and testing segments (including 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, and 108 holdout monthly data) to investigate its predictive ability of the TBATS method, and its forecasting performance was compared with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). Results: The TBATS (0.27, {0,0}, -, {<12,4>}) and SARIMA (0,1,(1,3))(0,1,1) 12 were selected as the best TBATS and SARIMA methods, respectively, for the 12-step ahead prediction. The mean absolute deviation, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, mean error rate, and root mean square percentage error were 91. 799, 14.772, 123.653, 0.129, and 0.193, respectively, for the preferred TBATS method and were 144.734, 25.049, 161.671, 0.203, and 0.296, respectively, for the preferred SARIMA method. Likewise, for the 24-, 36-, 60-, 84-, and 108-step ahead predictions, the preferred TBATS methods produced smaller forecasting errors over the best SARIMA methods. Further validations also suggested that the TBATS model outperformed the Error-Trend-Seasonal framework, with little exception. HFRS had dual seasonal behaviors, peaking in May-June and November-December. Overall a notable decrease in the HFRS morbidity was seen during the study period (average annual percentage change=\u22126.767, 95% confidence intervals: \u221210.592 to \u22122.778), and yet different stages had different variation trends. Besides, the TBATS model predicted a plateau in the HFRS morbidity in the next ten years. Conclusion: The TBATS approach outperforms the SARIMA approach in estimating the long-term epidemic seasonality and trends of HFRS, which is capable of being deemed as a promising alternative to help stakeholders to inform future preventive policy or practical solutions to tackle the evolving scenarios.",

            "text": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonosis as a consequence of the infection with several different families of Hantaviruses, which are predominantly carried and transmitted by the natural reservoir of rodents and can be exposed to humans via the urine, droppings, or saliva of virus carriers. 1 The clinical manifestations of HFRS are characterized by different degrees of fever, bleeding headache, abdominal pain, and acute kidney damage. 2 The Hantaviruses are distributed globally yet varied greatly in different regions. 3 In Asia, the HFRS-causing pathogenic agents predominantly include Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), and Amur virus (AMRV); whereas in Europe, mainly comprising Puumala virus (PUUV), Sochi virus (SOCV), and Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV). [3] [4] [5] HFRS is currently found in more than 70 countries, but it is mainly endemic in Asian and European continents, especially in China, Russia, and Korea. 1, 3, 4 Among them, China is always hit the hardest country with HFRS in the past, accounting for around 70-90% documented case notifications throughout the world each year. 6 HFRS still poses a major public health concern in China because of its ongoing epidemic in 28 of 31 provinces, with approximately 10,000-30,000 case notifications annually, 7, 8 resulting in case-fatality rates (CFRs) from 1%-14%, contingent on which virus is causing the HFRS. 1, 4 In China, the reported HFRS cases are predominately associated with the causative pathogens of HTNV and SEOV, 9 and the HFRS-causing HTNV accounts for around 70% of the number of case notifications. 8 Since the 1990s, a considerable reduction in the HFRS incidence has been witnessed, attributable to the implementation of such comprehensive interventions as effective rodent control, environmental management, improvement of people living standards, and vaccination in China. 5 However, HFRS seemingly signals a recurring risk in China in recent years owing to its continued rise in case notifications and the extension of geographical distribution to 31 provinces across China. 5, 8, 10 Basic to any development of prevention and control measures is an accurate quantitative analysis for the secular epidemiological trends and seasonality of diseases. Therefore, it is essential to make a long-term estimation for the timing, extent, and duration of HFRS by use of a forecasting model with good reliability and strong robustness.",

            "text": "There are a large volume of published researches that developed different mathematical techniques to analyze and estimate the upcoming epidemics of infectious diseases for different forecasting aims. The common forecasting tools include autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, 11 exponential smoothing (ES) methods, 12 generalized regression neural network method, 13 autoregressive distributed lag method, 14 grey approaches, 15 back-propagation neural network technique, 16 generalized linear regression models, 17 support vector machine regression method, 18 and autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) method. 19 The above-mentioned methods may provide a satisfactory result in their respective prediction domain. However, on the one hand, these models are often well suited for performing a short-term forecast as they are under either linear or nonlinear assumption, 11 which may limit their ability to be generalized in that a long-term ahead forecast can often offer informative clues in the decision-making process in practice. On the other hand, the existing predictive methods typically conduct a successful forecast for a simple time series (eg, single seasonal time series), and yet it is difficult to handle the complex time series with multiple seasonal periods, highfrequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality, and dualcalendar effects. 20, 21 Importantly, it has been demonstrated that HFRS shows bimodal seasonal patterns in many countries such as China, 6,10 Russia, 4 and Korea, 22 which may lead to an inaccurate forecasting result for the upcoming epidemics of HFRS using the common predictive methods. At this time, the advanced innovation state-space modeling framework by combining Box-Cox transformations, Fourier series with time-varying coefficients and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) error correction method (called TBATS) is tailored for extraction with the information included in a complex time series described above. 21 Furthermore, the TBATS approach can not only be used to deal with the linear issue but can handle some types of non-linearity based on Box-Cox transformations, 23 whilst allowing for time-dependent dynamic seasonality, 24 which enables this advanced method to have the potential to make a long-term forecast. Moreover, the TBATS approach also has a powerful ability to decompose a complex seasonal time series into constituent latent subseries, 21 which fails to be done by the aforementioned common methods. In the past, the advanced TBATS model has been used to nowcast and forecast the flow time series in water distribution systems, 25 the demand for the electric energy, 26 and spatiotemporal variations and characterization of benzene, 23 and the resulting results indicated that this advanced method could produce a relatively high forecasting accuracy in these fields. However, there is no study to use this advanced method to analyze and evaluate the long-term epidemiological trends and seasonality of HFRS. Considering the attractive performance of the TBATS approach and the epidemic patterns of HFRS in China, the primary goal of this study is to describe and forecast the long-term epidemic trends and seasonality of HFRS with the advanced TBATS method.

Thus, we retrospectively took the monthly HFRS incidents and population data between January 1995 and December 2020 from the internet-based NNIDSS and the Statistical Yearbook of China, respectively. Finally, a total of 312 observations covering 26 years were gathered. Often, to build an effective and stable method, preferably 100 observations or more are expected to be adopted. 30 In this study, we aim to conduct a long-run forecast for the HFRS epidemics. To this end, we split the whole data into six different training datasets and testing datasets (ie, the forecast horizons included 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, and 108 data) so that a series of experiments were performed to validate the generalization and the forecasting robustness of the methods.",

The ARIMA method is introduced to make a forecast by mining the intrinsical attributes and inherent rules of time series data. 31 HFRS frequently has notable seasonal effects, 2,10 and hence the seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) method should be adopted. In this method, the seasonality of HFRS was thought of as the predictors and the monthly HFRS incidence as the response variable. The SARIMA method is composed of three parts: 28 the \"AR\" signifies the autoregressive approach, the \"I\" denotes integration, and the \"MA\" refers to the moving average approach. The basic notation of this method can be written in the form of SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q) s , where p is the orders of AR, d is the orders of integration, and q is the orders of MA, (P, D, Q) correspond to the seasonal components of the above three parameters. 28 In creating the best SARIMA method, the most key step is to search for its suitable parameters. Currently, most software programs allow an automatic selection of the most appropriate parameters. The \"Expert Modeler\" in SPSS software provides an elegant way of choosing the preferred parameters of the SARIMA method. 32 Of all the plausible parameters, those that maximize the R-square (R 2 ) and stationary R 2 , and minimize the Normalized Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (NBIC) were first selected. 33 Subsequently, the t-test was used to investigate the statistical significance of the identified parameters. 29 Next, autocorrelogram, partial autocorrelogram, and Ljung-Box Q test were applied to the residuals to investigate whether the produced forecasting errors behaved like a white noise series. 29 Once the method passed all the required tests, it can be said that the selected parameters are suitable and adequate. Finally, a forecast into the next periods can be done with this best approach.",

To do this, researchers pay more attention to linear homoscedastic approaches but consider some types of non-linear patterns with Box-Cox transformations, in view of the complexity by extending non-linear ES approaches to deal with the complex time series described above, and the BATS(p, q, m 1 , m 2 ,\u2026, m T ) method was hence introduced, herein B signifies the Box-Cox transformation, A signifies the ARMA model, T and S signify the trend and seasonal patterns in the target series, respectively. The parameters include the orders (p and q) of the ARMA approach and the seasonal periods (m 1 ,\u2026, m T ). Albeit the BATS method is successful in modeling multiple seasonal periods in the target series, it fails to address the non-integer seasonality issue and needs to estimate a considerably large number of parameters since the initial seasonal patterns separately include m 1 + m 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + m T parameters, resulting in too many values when the target series contains high-frequency seasonal components. To deal with the problems raised above, researchers made a further generalization of the BATS method by introducing a novel trigonometric representation of seasonal behaviors based on the Fourier series. By doing so, this new method can significantly not only cut the number of parameters that need estimation but can model the non-integer seasonality in the time series. 21 This advanced modified method can be denoted as TBATS (\u03c9, p, q, \u03c6, {m 1 , k 1 }, {m 2 , k 2 },\u2026,{m T , k T }), herein k i represents the corresponding number of Fourier terms used for each seasonality, \u03c9 signifies the BoxCox parameter, and \u03c6 refers to the damping parameter that facilitates the trend extrapolation of the model when the trend pattern is dampened. 23 Additionally, the use of trigonometric functions also helps the TBATS method to decompose a complex time series into secular trend, seasonality, and error components. 25 ",

In searching for the best TBATS method, appropriate parameters of the orders (p and q) of the ARMA method must also be selected. Fortunately, these two values can be determined by use of the automatic ARIMA algorithm to the forecast errors under the model with optimal k i combination above. 36 If the identified method with ARMA component gives lower AIC compared to that without ARMA component, this model would be retained; otherwise, the ARMA component was not included in the model. After a series of attempts, it was discovered that the TBATS (0.27, {0,0}, -, {<12,4>}) specification was expected to be the preferred model for the forecast of 12 holdout periods because there was a lower AIC value of 5012.207 in this TBATS model than in others, and the resulting key parameters, statistical checking and constituent latent subseries are illustrated in Table S7 and Figures S6  and Table S7 and Figures S6, S8 -S12. Subsequently, a prediction into the upcoming HFRS epidemics was able to be achieved based on these best TBATS versions (Figure 4 and Tables S1-S6). Table 2 summarizes the measurement metrics testing the predictive accuracy on different datasets under the best SARIMA and TBATS approaches, and the resulting data pinpointed that the advanced best-fitting TBATS methods presented notably lower values of MAD, MAPE, RMSE, RMSPE, and MER over the best-fitting SARIMA methods, with improvements of at least 18% and at most 88% in the accuracies for analyzing both the short-and longterm trends, although the forecasting accuracy displayed a slight decrease with the increase of holdout periods (Table 2 and Figure 4 ). Considering the advantage of the TBATS method in the estimation of the HFRS epidemics, we re-constructed the best-performing TBATS (0.286, {3,0}, -, {<12,4>}) model based on the 26 entire years of data to nowcast and forecast the HFRS morbidity into 2030 accordingly, and seemingly projecting a plateau of around 90,120 (95% CIs: 25,358 to 244,667) cases, with monthly average 751 (95% CIs: 211 to 2039) case notifications in the next ten years ( Figure 5 ).",

            "text": "study, for the first time, focused on the exploration of the utility and adequacy in nowcasting and forecasting the long-term epidemiological trends and seasonality of HFRS, and its predictive accuracy level was compared with the most versatile SARIMA method in the field of time series modeling. 11, 13, 16, 33 It was discovered that the advanced TBATS methods get a more clear perspective of capturing the dynamic dependency structure in the spreading of HFRS over the SARIMA methods in a series of modeling experiments. What's more, the long-term forecasting results to emerge from the advanced TBATS method remained reliable and robust with the increase of prediction time windows, despite a slight rise in the values of measurement metrics, including MAD, MAPE, RMSE, RMSPE, and MER. By contrast, the SARIMA model has been unable to analyze and capture the long-term trends of HFRS after 60-step ahead predictions as it produced a MAPE value (which is frequently computed to assess the forecasting accuracy level, a forecast with MAPE value greater than 50% is considered unacceptable 45 ) greater than 50% in both 84 and 108 holdout periods, further providing evidence that the SARIMA method is valid for assessing short-or medium-term trends. 46 Our recent work suggests that the Error-Trend-Seasonal framework (ETS) technique has many attractive applications in analyzing the long-run temporal behaviors. 33, 46 Accordingly, we further established the ETS approach based on the HFRS incidence data to nowcast and forecast its epidemics, and the resulting results indicated that the TBATS method is also more useful and robust for describing the long-term trends of HFRS than the ETS technique, except that in 60-step ahead forecast (Table S8) . Also, we used the HFRS incidence data in Liaoning province and Shanxi province (which were hit the hardest with HFRS in the past decades in China) to validate the forecasting reliability of TBATS model. The remarkable results to emerge from these data suggested that the advanced TBATS method still generated a higher forecasting accuracy compared to the SARIMA model (Table S9) . As a result, the advanced TBATS method is able to be recommended as a promising and powerful alternative to analyze the long-run trends and seasonality of HFRS in China. In the meantime, this advanced TBATS approach also provides a serviceable aid for directing the present intensity and type of public health measures. 47 For instance, if the temporal patterns of HFRS were to start to recede, while this advanced method assessed a marked upward tendency, intimating that the current interventions would be at work in containing the epidemics; otherwise, the present measures required to be optimized. Time series forecasting is a useful aid for forming hypotheses to understand the epidemic behaviors of different diseases and to estimate their spreading dynamics, and thus favoring the establishment of a quality control system. 33 The SARIMA method has been the most popular time series forecasting tool to analyze the morbidity, mortality, and prevalence of infectious diseases (eg, HFRS, 40, 41 Human Brucellosis, 48 COVID-19, 33 hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), 28 Syphilis, 49 dengue, 50 Dysentery 51 ) over the last years because of its simple structure, fast applicability, relatively high prediction accuracy, and potential to interpret the target series. However, as evidenced by the findings from our study and others, the SARIMA method is only appropriate for analyzing short-or medium-term trends and cannot deal with the nonlinear information in a complex time series due to its linear assumption. 13, 16, 52, 53 Instead, the advanced TBATS method was developed by adding the trigonometric representation of seasonal components based on Fourier series to the traditional BATS approach, which allows it to not only deal with all of the complex time series but also to handle both linear and non- linear components, 23, 25 whilst accommodating a dynamic seasonal patterns over time, 25 and hence leading to its usefulness and flexibility in analyzing the long-term trends and seasonality of time series. Given its attractive applications of the TBATS method and our previous work, 53 it appears that the importance of this advanced method as a powerful forecasting tool is expected to be emphasized in analyzing the long-term temporal levels of HFRS in other regions or other communicable diseases, and yet validation needs to be done. Besides, some new advanced statistical techniques (eg, bayesian structural time series technique, 37 flexible transmitter network, 54 the optimized theta method, 55 and age-structure mathematical model 56 ) are also recently demonstrated to have the potential to make a long-term forecast for the time series. As a result, what is now required is work focused on the comparisons of the forecasting accuracy between the TBATS approach and the above-mentioned models. Different from prior studies that reported a re-emerging risk in the HFRS morbidity in China, 5, 6, 8, 10 our study indicated an evident reduction in the numbers of HFRS cases over the 26 years of data (AAPC=\u22126.767, 95% CIs: \u221210.592 to \u22122.778; t= \u22123.278, p=0.001), consistent with the epidemiological trends reported in several countries in Asia, 57 and yet in disagreement with that in Russia. 4 This discrepancy may be related to the different causative agents, geographical environments, social economy, preventive measures, and public awareness. In China, many enhanced prevention and control measures, including effective environmental management, elimination of rodents, vaccination, publicize education, improvement of the living and working environments, along with rapid urbanization and mechanization of farming, have favored the decrease in the HFRS-related morbidity and mortality in the past. 58 Importantly, such an epidemiological trend would be predicted to continue in the ten years to come under TBATS model. Besides, it was noted that HFRS showed a cyclical fluctuation with 3-5 years since 2008, in agreement with the findings in previous reports, 59, 60 which also indicated that periodic outbreak is an important epidemiological feature in the HFRS incidence, albeit these studies reported a longer time window of 7-12 years. 59, 60 It seems that several possible reasons contribute to the changing epidemiology in the HFRS incidence in recent years; one may be associated with the effects of climate variability, responsible for many emerging or re-emerging ",

Besides, the predicted HFRS morbidity also showed the same seasonal pattern as that during 1995-2020 ( Figure S13 ). Our seasonal profile concurs well with previous findings from Russia 4 and South Korea, 66 also in line with that in most provinces or cities from across China (eg, Changsha city, 60 Heilongjiang province, 67 Anqiu city, 7 Zibo city, 68 Shanxi province, 69 Zhejiang province 70 ). We surmised that different climatic features and etiological factors contributed to this difference in the amplitude of peak activities. In China, it was discovered that the HFRS-causing HTNV can occur throughout the year, and yet the majority of them became infected with HTNV in fall and winter; by contrast, the HFRScausing SEOV is mainly reported in spring. 6, 10 The main natural reservoir hosts of the above two causative factors are predominantly spread by the striped field mouse (A. agrarius) and brown Norway rat (R.norvegicus), respectively. 8 Weather factors (eg, temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, precipitation) have been shown to have a great influence on the population dynamics of the main natural reservoir hosts of HTNV and SEOV, 8, 62, 64, 71 and the effects of temperature and relative humidity on HFRS was demonstrated to show a U-shaped curve, 64 this fits well with the bimodal seasonal distribution present in spring and winter in the HFRS case notifications.",

Nevertheless, this work also suffers from certain shortfalls. First, underreporting and under-diagnosis of HFRS cases may be inevitable in passive surveillance, notwithstanding the well-monitored data quality under mandatory reporting in China. Second, we noted from Tables S1-S6 and Figure 5 that the resulting predicted 95% CIs visibly broadened with the increase of the forecasted time windows, despite its high forecasting accuracy and robustness of the TBATS method. Thus, the model should be updated in time by including new series to ensure its forecasting reliability level. Third, from Figure S6 we can see that the forecasting potential of the TBATS model may be further improved, despite its high forecasting accuracy. Therefore, further work needs to be performed to establish whether the predictive ability of the TBATS model can be improved by combing this model and neural network techniques. Fourth, the current findings from this study reflect how well the TBATS method estimates the longrun seasonality and trends of HFRS in China, whether it is valid for analyzing the long-term trends and seasonality in other countries or other communicable diseases, additional studies are required to investigate. Finally, the multivariate TBATS method may provide a higher forecasting accuracy. However, we are unable to do this owing to the unavailability of such a TBATS model with regression covariates and HFRS-associated factors in this study.",

Besides, under current interventions, it is challenging to eliminate the HFRS epidemics in the next ten years considering the resultant forecasts of around 90,120 (95% CIs: 25,358 to 244,667) cases, with monthly average 751 (95% CIs: 211 to 2039) case notifications in the ten years to come using the TBATS method, intimating that additional or comprehensive prevention and control measures must be formulated to tackle this evolving scenario.",
