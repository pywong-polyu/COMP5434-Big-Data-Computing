AGEP is usually associated with medications, especially aminopenicillins, diltiazem, and antimalarials like hydroxychloroquine [1] [2] [3] . However, it has also been connected to certain viral infections including cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus [1, 2] . As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to dominate headlines, many reports are coming forward with associated skin manifestations, including petechial rashes, vesicles, chilblains, and urticaria [4] [5] [6] . This report is of a case of AGEP following treatment with cefepime for a urinary tract infection in a 78-year-old man who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but had not undergone hydroxychloroquine treatment.",

An AGEP validation score was developed by the EuroSCAR study group that includes the following diagnostic criteria: fever (>38\u00b0C), acute pustular eruption, blood neutrophilia (>7,000 neutrophils/\u00b5L), spongiform subcorneal or intraepidermal pustules on skin biopsy, and spontaneous resolution of the pustules in less than 15 days [3] . The histological features of AGEP are characterized by subcorneal pustules, mild spongiosis in the surrounding epidermis, and superficial mixed infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and occasional eosinophils [2, 3] . The main differential diagnoses for AGEP are pustular psoriasis and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Pustular psoriasis is typically associated with a personal or family history of psoriasis, and typically has a slow onset. DRESS is typically associated with a longer latent period of 2 to 6 weeks [2] . In our patient, the lack of personal history of psoriasis, acute onset, and resolution after discontinuation of cefepime, as well as the histologic features of eosinophils in the mixed infiltrate, helped to distinguish AGEP from pustular psoriasis and DRESS. Based on the EuroSCAR criteria and histologic findings, our patient fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for AGEP.",

Studies suggest that AGEP is a T cell-mediated neutrophilic inflammatory response, involving drug-specific T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), Th17 cells, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines [2, 3, 8] . Th17 cells produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-22, which play an important role in host defense by recruiting neutrophils and macrophages to infected tissues [8] . One report noted patients with AGEP had a markedly higher percentage of Th17 cells when compared with healthy controls [8] . There may also be a genetic component to the development of AGEP through mutations in the IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL36RN) gene [9] . However, patients with AGEP and IL36RN gene mutations are more likely to have lip/oral involvement, which was not seen in our patient [9] .",

            "text": "In COVID-19, the antiviral immune response is crucial to eliminating the invading virus, and researchers are finding that pro-inflammatory subsets of T cells (including Th17 and other CD4+ T cells, as well as CD8+ T cells) are likely responsible for the severe immune-related injury to various organ systems [10] . It is thought that a robust and persistent immune response may lead to an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, causing damage to host tissues [10] . Reports have shown that, in the later stages of COVID-19 infection, cytokine storm is likely a major cause of disease progression [6, 10] In addition, the elderly tend to exhibit chronic low-grade inflammation which develops from the continual production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, thereby lowering the threshold to develop cytokine storm during COVID-19 infection [11] . Since AGEP usually develops 24 hours after cephalosporin use, we theorize that our patient's vigorous immune response to COVID-19 infection, combined with cefepime use, may have contributed to the delayed development of AGEP. As information regarding the manifestations of COVID-19 continues to be discovered, it is possible that cutaneous manifestations were initially overlooked. In our patient, it is likely that cefepime induced the manifestation of AGEP. However, it is possible that the development of AGEP was multifactorial. We theorize that the combination of cephalosporin exposure, genetic predisposition, and the production of pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines induced a vigorous immune response leading to the delayed development of AGEP. It is our hope that sharing this case may be of benefit to providers when dealing with rashes during this pandemic.",
