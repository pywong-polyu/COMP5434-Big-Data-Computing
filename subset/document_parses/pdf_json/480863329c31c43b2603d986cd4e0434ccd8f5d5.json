Inexperienced workers should be partnered with more experienced colleagues. Such 'buddy' systems help to provide support, monitor stress and reinforce safety procedures. The efficacy of peer interventions does not come from having a single trauma-informed or trained staff member, but from a camaraderie and sense of common fate that can emerge from a shared experience of trauma.",
