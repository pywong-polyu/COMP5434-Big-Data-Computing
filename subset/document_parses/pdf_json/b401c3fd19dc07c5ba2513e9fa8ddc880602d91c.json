To prevent the overuse of broadspectrum antimicrobial therapies, such as carbapenems, we assessed the performance of screening for intestinal carriage of HLAC-E in addition to ESBL-E to predict 3GCR-E (ESBL-E and/or HLAC-E) presence or absence in respiratory samples in ICU, and to evaluate its potential impact on carbapenem prescription.",

Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated for the screening for intestinal carriage of ESBL-E, HLAC-E and 3GCR-E (ESBL-E and/or HLAC-E) as predictor of their absence/presence in respiratory samples.

NPVs were 98.8%, 98.0% and 96.6% for ESBL-E, HLAC-E and 3GCR-E, respectively. Over the study period, empirical antimicrobial therapy was initiated for 315 episodes of respiratory infections: 228/315 (72.4%) were associated with negative intestinal carriage screening for both HLAC-E and ESBL-E, of whom 28/228 (12.3%) were treated with carbapenems.

Empirical antimicrobial therapy (EAT) is a challenge for ICU physicians. Early antimicrobial therapy is recommended especially in case of sepsis or acute respiratory failure [3] and its appropriateness can only be validated a posteriori when sample cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing are known. The choice of an EAT is, therefore, difficult and there is a trade-off to find between large-spectrum, which may promote antimicrobial resistances and narrow-spectrum therapy, which may result in treatment inadequacy. Because of frequent long hospital stays, previous antimicrobial exposure, or presence of other individual patient risk factors of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, broad-spectrum antibiotics are often used, in accordance with the latest recommendations on the management of patients with HAP and VAP [4] . The dramatically increasing occurrence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCR-E) leads to increased use of carbapenems [5] , with serious adverse effects such as an increase of antibiotic selective pressure [6, 7] .",

Regarding the screening for HLAC-E intestinal carriage, we report here a prevalence of 9.0% and an NPV of 98.0% in our population. The prevalence of HLAC-E intestinal carriage remains poorly described [18] [19] [20] . The reported prevalence of HLAC-E intestinal carriage in ICU patients was 8.9% and 10.8% for Poignant et al. and Thi\u00e9baut et al. studies, respectively, which is in line with our observations [18, 19] . In our study, the rate of HLAC-E respiratory infections in HLAC-E carriers was 20.3% (14/69), a rate close to that reported by Poignant et al. (16.8%) [26] . Thus, negative testing for HLAC-E would be a strong advocate against targeting HLAC-E in the management of suspected HAP. Despite the presence of several MDR pathogens risk factors, as a long length of stay in ICU (median of 31 (15-48) days), and high probability of previous antimicrobial therapy, the NPV of 3GCR-E detection remains high (96.6%).",

This ensures that the selected episodes were considered as relevant HAP by physicians in charge. Thus, we evaluated the impact of this dual screening for situations in which EAT was deemed necessary. Due to the high NPV of 3GCR-E \"Potential Carbapenem overuse\", defined for patients with suspected pneumonia and without ESBL-E intestinal carriage, was identified in more than 10% EAT. Of note, despite recent studies confirmed that cefepime could be used to treat HLAC-E infections [27] [28] [29] , this was not part, at that time, of our local protocol, and is probably responsible for an overestimation of potential carbapenem overuse. Conversely, \"Potential inappropriate EAT\", defined as an EAT which was not effective on the resistance pattern reported in intestinal carriage was identified in more than 10% of EAT.",

Due to the high prevalence of P. aeruginosa in our respiratory c\u00e9f\u00e9pime. e Potential carbapenem overuse and inappropriate EAT were determined by comparing EAT administered to EAT suggested by rectal carriage samples, this approach could be debatable. Therefore, we further explored respiratory samples of patients negative for ESBL intestinal carriage. Of 23 patients with ESBL-E(\u2212)/HLAC-E(+) intestinal carriage, 8 patients had P. aeruginosa in the respiratory sample, and all of them were susceptible to ceftazidime or cefepime. Of 228 patients with ESBL-E(\u2212)/HLAC-E(\u2212) intestinal carriage, 40 patients had P. aeruginosa in the respiratory sample, and 39/40 were susceptible to ceftazidime or cefepime. This observation is particularly of interest, because cefepime can cover most AmpC-producing and AmpChyperproducing Enterobacterales, and is indicated as an EAT for clinically suspected VAP for double antipseudomonal/Gram-Negative coverage [4] . Moreover, in the presence of septic shock, studies have shown that therapy based on antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins combined with aminoglycosides is a safe option to improve appropriateness of empiric antimicrobial therapy [30] [31] [32] . Therefore, coverage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be achieved without the prescription of carbapenem, even in case of septic shock.",

However, it should be noted that the incidence of HLAC-E carriage may not have been profoundly influenced by our local ecology. Indeed, regarding HLAC-E acquisition, length of stay and antibiotic-related alteration of the anaerobic flora play a major role compared to cross-transmission [33] . Therefore, HLAC-E carriage and infections depend mostly on the mutant selection from endogenous intestinal microbiota and not on cross-transmission that depends on the bacterial ecology of a given ICU.",

Especially for HLAC-E (which is most of the time a vertically transferred mutation-promoted overexpression of normally low-level expressed ampC gene), knowing that the same species have colonized both intestinal microbiota and respiratory tract would have strengthened the value of intestinal carriage screening to predict the risk of detecting HLAC-E in respiratory samples.
