            "text": "Introduction COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is causing an unprecedented global pandemic, resulting in nearly 1 million deaths since late 2019. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA viruses first identified over 70 years ago. 1 CoVs received considerable attention in 2003 when the etiologic agent of severe adult respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was identified as a CoV. 2, 3 The CoV genome encodes for 4 main structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), as well as other accessory proteins that facilitate replication and entry into cells. 4 The spike proteins, consisting of S1 and S2 subunits, cover the surface of CoVs and serve as entry proteins for infection. 4 Spike proteins first attach to the cells by binding to glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate (HS) and a2,3 and a2,6 sialylated N-glycans, which further facilitate the interaction with entry receptors and membrane fusion with host cells. 5, 6 SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 as its entry receptor, which is widely expressed on lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs. 7 COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads predominantly by respiratory droplets. 8 Clinical manifestations are manifold, ranging from asymptomatic infection to multiorgan failure and death in 2% to 10% of patients. 9 Most symptomatic patients complain of a flu-like illness consisting of fever, cough, nasal congestion, fatigue, and myalgia. A small percentage of patients develop more severe symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. Refractory thrombosis, 10 thrombotic microangiopathies, 11, 12 antiphospholipid antibodies, 13, 14 stroke, 15 seizures, respiratory failure, 16 renal failure, 17 and myocardial infarction are well-described complications of COVID-19 but occur in a minority of patients. It remains unclear why only a small subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients acquires such severe endothelial damage affecting multiple organs. associated with severe COVID-19 infection have led to the hypothesis that excessive complement activation may be responsible for the end-organ damage, but the mechanism is unclear. 12, 18, 19 Indeed, complementopathies, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (CAPS), share many clinical features with severe COVID-19 infection. 20, 21 Preclinical data have also demonstrated a role for complement activation in CoV-mediated disease. Gralinski et al evaluated the activation of the complement system in a mouse model of CoV. 22 Relative to C57BL/6J control mice, SARS-CoV-infected C3 2/2 mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung. Transgenic animals lacking C3 also had reduced inflammatory cells in the large airway and parenchyma, improved respiratory function, and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines or chemokines in the lung and periphery. Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-CoV infection in mice have severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Increased concentrations of C5a and C5b-9 (terminal complement complex), activation products resulting from cleavage of C5, were detected in sera and lung tissue in the infected mice, respectively. 23 In humans with COVID-19 pneumonia, C5b-9, C4d, and mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 are found in the microvasculature of the lung, and COVID-19-associated skin lesions exhibit colocalization of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the cutaneous microvasculature. 24 A prospective cohort study of 150 patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome found a high incidence of pulmonary emboli (17%) despite prophylactic anticoagulation. 25 Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits, but not N protein or spike protein from a more benign human CoV (OC43), are potent activators of the alternative pathway of complement (APC), and that C5 and factor D inhibitors prevent complement-mediated damage.",

            "text": "As an erythroblast cell line, TF1PIGAnull does not express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (supplemental Figure 5) , which makes it a good model for the study of spike protein-glycosaminoglycan interaction. 29 Several groups have proved that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to HS but not a2,3 or a2,6 sialic acids by microarray. 30, 31 Additional research showed that there are 3 HS-binding sites on the spike protein: 1 located inside the RBD of S1, 1 located in S2, and another 1 located at the S1/S2 cleavage site. 32 Soluble HS has been shown to effectively block the binding of viruses that use HS on cell surfaces, therefore we hypothesized that this would also be true for SARS-CoV-2. 33 Both S1 and S2, but not HCoV-OC43, bind TF1PIGAnull cells (supplemental Figure 3) , however, S1 and S2 binding was significantly blocked by free HS (Figure 5A-B) . Treatment with sialidase, which removes all a2-3-, a2-6-, and a2-8-linked sialic acid residues, did not result in any decrease in spike protein binding (supplemental Figure 4) . These results confirm that HS is required for spike protein binding to cell surfaces and are consistent with recently published microarray data. 30, 31 Factor H decreases C3c and C5b-9 deposition caused by S1 and S2 spike proteins Apart from virus interaction, HS on cell surfaces is also important for binding factor H, a negative regulator of the APC. 34, 35 Thus, we hypothesized that S1 and S2 may be disrupting factor H binding or activity on the cell surface. We saturated the HS sites Figure 4 . Serum level of factor Bb increases upon NHS activation by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in the presence of cells. Serum Bb concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after incubation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 with NHS in the presence and absence of TF1PIGAnull cells in APC-specific buffer. (A) S1 and S2 proteins significantly increased the Bb concentrations in serum when cells were present. Incubating NHS with S1 and S2 in the absence of cells did not significantly elevate serum Bb concentration from the baseline NHS level. (B) Increased Bb level in the cellular phase was completely blocked by 1 mM factor D inhibitor but not by anti-C5 antibody. All experiments were repeated 3 times. Unpaired Student t test P values indicate statistical significance (*P , .05, **P , .01, NS, not significant).",

Both S1 and S2 subunits activate the APC, but only in the presence of cells, demonstrating that APC activation is occurring on the cell surface and not the fluid phase. Structure resolution of the RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit shows a small positively charged region that may bind to negatively charged HS. 39 Our findings confirm that both spike protein S1 and S2 subunits bind to HS, but counter previous speculation that SARS-CoV-2 N protein activates the lectin pathway. 40 Although SARS-CoV-2 N protein shares some structural similarity with the N proteins from SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-CoV, it may not necessarily have the same ability to bind mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 and activate the lectin Figure 5 . SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind to HS and interfere with factor H function. Coincubating 5 mg/mL His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with 2 mg/mL HS solution completely blocked the binding of S1 subunit (A) and S2 subunit (B) to TF1PIGAnull cells. Supplementing NHS with 10 mg of purified factor H protein significantly inhibited C5b-9 (C) and C3c deposition (D) triggered by 20 mg/mL S1 in APC-specific buffer. Addition of 10 mg of purified factor H also significantly inhibited the S2induced C5b-9 deposition (E) and C3c deposition (F) in APC-specific buffer. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.

CCP 1-4 and CCP 19-20 bind to C3b, CCP 6-8 bind HS, and CCP 19-20 bind HS and sialic acids. 44, 45 Several human diseases, such as aHUS, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), HELLP syndrome, and CAPS, are associated with genetic variants that affect factor H function. 20, 46, 47 Shiga toxin from enterohemorrhagic E coli also leads to endothelial damage and has been shown to bind to CCP 6-8 or CCP 18-20 of factor H and impair regulation of the APC on cell surfaces. 48 Germline variants affecting CCP 19 and 20 in factor H predispose to aHUS and polymorphism in CCP 7 is found in up to 35% of patients with AMD. 49, 50 Interestingly, a history of AMD was recently reported to be a leading risk factor for intubation and death in COVID-19 patients. 51 Our binding assays ( Figure 5 ) suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind cell-surface HS, preventing factor H from achieving its optimal conformation to accelerate decay of the APC C3 convertase ( Figure 6 ). Our rescue experiments also show that addition of purified factor H to serum decreased C3c and C5b-9 deposition on spike proteintreated cells, suggesting factor H as a key player in the APC activation by the spike protein.

Increased levels of C5a and soluble C5b-9 are detected in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. 52 Patients with COVID-19 also develop renal failure and some have biopsyproven thrombotic microangiopathies. 11, 17 Thrombosis that is only partially responsive to anticoagulation (resistance to heparin treatment and thrombosis that develops despite appropriate prophylactic anticoagulation) is common in COVID-19 and characteristic of complementopathies, 53,54 such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, 55 cold-agglutinin disease, 56 and CAPS. 20 In addition, HS is a binding partner for antithrombin III, which could further increase hypercoagulability in COVID-19 and may explain the heparin resistance that is frequently encountered in these patients ( Figure 6 ). 57 HS also interacts with many extracellular proteins, including fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor b, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, and extracellular superoxide dismutase, 58 suggesting a broad influence by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",

            "text": "Our data may explain why only a minority of COVID-19 patients develop life-threatening multiorgan failure. Complement-driven diseases such as aHUS, HELLP, and CAPS often have underlying germline variants that impair the ability of endothelial cells to protect themselves from complement-mediated injury in the setting of a complement-amplifying condition such as pregnancy, cancer, autoimmunity, or other inflammatory states. 28, 59 A recent proteomics study by Shen et al with a machine learning model confirmed that complement proteins are actively involved in the acute phase of virus infection, including complement 6 and complement factor B, properdin, and carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain. 60 Thus, it will be important to determine whether patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19 harbor variants in complement-regulatory genes. Already, a history of AMD, a disease associated with a common factor H variant, was identified as a major risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. 51 Our data also have therapeutic implications for COVID-19 and raise the prospect for targeted therapy. Multinational randomized controlled trials of the C5 monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab (phase 3, NCT04369469), are already enrolling patients; however, our data demonstrate that C5 inhibition will prevent C5b-9 accumulation but not upstream complement activation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Dense C3b deposition can lead to breakthrough from C5 monoclonal antibodies. 61, 62 Thus, complement inhibitors that bind upstream of factor H may be more specific and effective. 27, 63 ",

(B) Both SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 led to marked increase of C5b-9 depositions in APC-specific buffer. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 N and HCoV-OC43 S proteins showed minimal C5b-9 increase in APC-specific buffer. All experiments were repeated 6 times.
