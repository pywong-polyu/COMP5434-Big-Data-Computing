Results: There was a significant difference in patients' hope levels with respect to marital status and educational background (P < 0.05), and there was a significant difference in resilience scores depending on gender and family economic situation (P < 0.05). In the present study, the hope levels and resilience in the patients were moderate, with an average score of (34.93 \u00b1 5.45) and (69.36 \u00b1 15.52), respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between the hope level and the resilience score in these patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In patients with severe COVID-19, the higher the hope level, the higher the resilience score.",

It is highly infectious, with high incidence and a wide social impact, and it has led to a high degree of social panic. As there is no effective treatment targeting the etiology, 1 patients are still uncertain about whether they can really recover from it, whether they will experience sequelae, and whether they will suffer a reoccurrence or infect others. Therefore, mental health problems are common in patients with COVID-19 and need to be solved. Hope is a positive internal support force that can help individuals to face and solve difficulties with a positive attitude. It can alleviate the negative emotions felt under acute stress and enable patients to regain social functions, which is of great importance. 2 Resilience is one of the core features of positive psychology. It can help humans to cope with bad moods, negative psychological states, and major life pressures, and it can increase an individual's comfort and happiness. 3 It has been confirmed that there is a correlation between hope levels and resilience, and hope levels can predict resilience in patients. 4 However, it has not yet been reported whether the hope level in a patient with COVID-19 is correlated with resilience or whether there exists an interaction between the two factors. The aims of the present study are to investigate what is currently known about the correlation between hope levels and resilience and to look into the correlation between these two factors in more detail so as to provide a reference for mental health intervention in patients with COVID-19.",

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with mental and psychological disorders and (2) patients who could not complete the questionnaire because of their critical condition. Two survey methods were used, a mobile phone questionnaire or an on-the-spot questionnaire, and they were uniformly filled in within 24-48 hours of admission. All the patients in the present study voluntarily participated in the investigation and signed informed consent before the investigation. Unified guidance was used to explain the method of filling out the questionnaire. For those unable to do so by themselves, the investigator read it out to them and filled it out on their behalf. When reviewing the questionnaire, the investigator checked carefully that the questionnaire was complete. If there were any missing items, the patient was asked to fill it in. The completed questionnaires were collected in within a set time frame. A total of 56 questionnaires were sent out, and 56 valid questionnaires were returned. There were no invalid questionnaires, so the effective recovery rate was 100%.",

The hope level in married patients was higher than that in divorced or widowed patients, which is consistent with the research results of Qianqian et al 10 . This might be because divorced or widowed patients could not face the disease with a positive attitude without the care and emotional sustenance of a spouse. The higher the educational background, the higher the hope level, which was consistent with a study done by Hou XM. 11 Patients with a high educational background were better able to obtain information concerning the onset and progress of the disease, along with the therapeutic conditions, so they were more likely to have hope as the disease progressed. A high educational background could also help patients shift their attention. The resilience scores in male patients were higher than in female patients, which was consistent with the results of domestic research. 12 Compared with male patients, female patients were more prone to adopt avoidance strategies when facing negative events, while male patients were more inclined to choose positive coping strategies to solve the problems. The resilience scores in patients with a better family economic status were higher than those in patients with family economic difficulties, which was consistent with the relevant research results concerning burn patients. 13 Although the nation proclaimed a free-ofcharge policy to reduce the financial burden on patients, for low-income patients, isolation treatment resulted in their being unable to work, which impacted their financial situation.

The total scores of resilience in patients were (69.36 \u00b1 15.52), which were also in the medium and high range. These results can be related to the current national attention and care being given to patients with COVID-19. After the outbreak of the pandemic, there were many medical teams assisting Hubei and working throughout the province. The government introduced a policy of free treatment for patients with COVID-19 and also provided a guarantee of food and accommodation for Wuhan residents, arranging isolation sites for those discharged from the hospital. All these actions made patients feel they were receiving practical support from society, and this enhanced their sense of hope. However, the hope level in COVID-19 patients was still lower than that currently reported in patients with cancer [15] [16] [17] and did not reach a high grade. The total resilience score was higher than in patients with cancer 18 and chronic disease, 19 but it still did not reach a high grade. These findings might be correlated first with the fact that the patients included in the present study were all severe cases. Second, since COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, there is no specific drug treatment at present, and the long-term treatment effect is not clear, meaning patients may lack confidence in the prospect of treatment. Moreover, the patients entered a special medical isolation environment after admission, separated from their relatives, and this could easily have led to their feeling nervous or anxious.",

These results were consistent with those of Solano et al 20 who conducted a cross-sectional survey in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and breast cancer. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between hope level and resilience. Herth 6 put forward the hope theory, in which hope was regarded as the internal driving force for patients to overcome disease. Patients with high hope levels and a positive and optimistic attitude were more motivated to overcome difficulties and find ways to relieve stress. Resilience is a process of dynamic development and change. When individuals are in a dangerous and dynamic external environment, they can still have the ability to adapt to the environment. 21 Hope can be regarded as a psychological protection factor. When facing a sudden epidemic, patients with high hope levels always keep a positive and optimistic attitude and believe that they have the ability to solve difficulties and work through adverse situations, and they have confidence in the future. These positive attitudes help them to take measures to deal with various problems and adapt to their current environment, which can lead to high resilience benefits.",

Thus, it can be seen that, in the face of the disease, when patients with COVID-19 regard the pressure as a challenge and take positive action to fight the disease, their resilience can effectively improve. For example, during the period of isolation treatment, if the patients actively seek help from the medical staff and family members, they will receive more love and care, which will help them to reduce COVID-19 injury to their self-esteem and emotions, reduce the sense of selfdiscrimination, and rebuild their trust. In addition, during the treatment and rehabilitation period, patients can join the volunteer team and actively help nurses to undertake some life care within their capabilities. From this, they can gain a sense of achievement and improve their functional status. Medical staff should take improving hope levels as a starting point, implement targeted cognitive psychological interventions for the patients, encourage the patients to face up to the disease, help them find confidence in overcoming it, and improve resilience. In addition, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 should be invited to publicize the curative effects, actively cooperate with the medical staff, improve the curative effect, and thus help other patients to face the future.",
