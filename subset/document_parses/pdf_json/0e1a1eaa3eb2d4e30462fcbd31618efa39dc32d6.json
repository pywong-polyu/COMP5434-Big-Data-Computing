Hypotension and a drop on central venous saturation (Table 2) led to milrinone 0.75 mcg/kg/min and dobutamine 20 mcg/kg/min requirement. On 10th POD endotracheal intubation was required. The patient experienced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple complications: shock requiring vasopressors, secondary bacterial pneumonia, hemothorax, catheter-related bloodstream infection and pneumothorax due to barotrauma. A CT scan performed on 34th POD revealed bilateral ground glass opacities, bilateral pneumothorax and consolidation (Figure 1B). He had no thromboembolic events (TEE).After 48 days of LVAD implantation, he was free from mechanical ventilation (MV) and inotropes. He was discharged from the intensive care unit after 51 days and from the hospital after 199 days of hospitalization. After discharge, left ventricular dysfunction persisted but RV function improved.
