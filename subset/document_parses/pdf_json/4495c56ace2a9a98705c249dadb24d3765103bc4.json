Amidst growing concern over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates, it is especially important that news coverage of suicidal behaviour adheres to recommended standards for the responsible reporting of suicide. Using a set of dimensions based on international media guidelines, we analysed the quality and content of all UK news reports of possible COVID-19 related suicides and suicide attempts in the first four months of the pandemic (N=285 reports of 78 individual incidents published in print and online newspapers between 16 th March and 12 th July 2020). The majority of news reports made an explicit link between suicidal behaviour and the COVID-19 pandemic in the headline (187/285, 65.5%), and portrayed this association as strong and direct (n=196/272, 72.1%), mostly based on statements by family, friends or acquaintances of the deceased (171/285, 60%). The impact of the pandemic on suicidal behaviour was most often attributed to feelings of isolation (78/285, 27.4%), poor mental health (42, 14.7%) and sense of entrapment (41, 14.4%) as a result of government-imposed restrictions. Although rarely of poor overall quality, reporting was biased towards young people, frontline staff and relatively unusual suicides (including those involving a celebrity, murder-suicide and violent methods) Also, to varying degrees, reports failed to meet recommended standards; for example, 41.1% (117/285) did not signpost readers to sources of support, a quarter (69, 24.2%) included examples of sensational language and a third provided over-simplistic explanations for the suicidal behavior (93, 32.6%). While news reporting has improved compared to earlier coverage of suicide in the UK, it is essential that careful attention is paid to the quality and content of reports, especially as longer-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic develop.

The highly publicised deaths of the actor Robin Williams (Fink et al., 2018) and of the German national football team goalkeeper Robert Enke (Koburger et al., 2015) are examples. News reporting of suicide is disproportionately focussed on deaths of young people and on females relative to their actual involvement in suicide (Marzano et al., 2018) . Young people are also most susceptible to the influence of news reports on suicidal behaviour (Gould et al., 2014) . This is particularly concerning as suicide rates in young people have increased substantially in recent years, at least in the UK (Bould et al., 2019 ; Office for National Statistics, 2020).",

They were also much more likely to signpost readers to help and support (7.5% in 2012-13 versus 58.9% in the current study). These are key recommendations in international media guidelines. The relative lack of method-related imagery in the reports is also a positive finding, as is the paucity of 'photo galleries' and textual links between different suicides during the early phases of the pandemic. This may reflect the fact that Samaritans provided specific COVID-19 and suicide briefings to the media early on in the pandemic (Samaritans 2020b ). However, there remains room for improvement in these and other aspects of reporting, not least the omission of sensational language and over-simplistic explanations (observed in at least a quarter of possible COVID-19 related suicide reports) and the placing of suicide stories in less prominent positions within print media (also a well-established recommendation in relevant guidelines, but not the case in one in ten of the stories we analysed).",
