By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalisations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that school closures contribute to a reduction in the growth rate approximately 7 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible. However, school reopening can contribute to statistically significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. In all regions, a combination of low classroom occupancy and robust test-and-trace measures were in place. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies.",

This question is not only motivated by the goal of protecting the younger generations; it is also known from other respiratory diseases that, because younger people tend to have more prolonged and physical contacts among themselves [3] , they pose a greater risk of infection to each other as well as being likely to introduce the infection to their respective households and so can drive the epidemic [4, 5] . Consequently, school closure is often one of the first measures considered when non-pharmaceutical interventions are needed [6] . However, during the COVID-19 pandemic it has often been implemented concurrently with other measures, making it difficult to assess its individual impact [7, 8] . Many of the challenges inherent in quantifying the impact of closure remain when policy-makers subsequently turn to the reopening of schools. Reopening presents a myriad of further questions, such as the ages of those returning, the physical circumstances and timing of their return, and the necessary conditions which must be met on a community level before a return can be deemed safe enough. For new or emerging infections, answers to these questions require new efforts to establish an age-stratified understanding of the infection and transmission dynamics [9, 10] .",

            "text": "Earlier work exists concerning the effectiveness of school closure as a means of controlling the spread of COVID-19, with mixed conclusions depending on the studied age group, country, and modelling assumptions [6] [7] [8] [9] [11] [12] [13] . These sought to estimate the impact of school closure on nationwide transmission levels, be it for instance a reduction in the 1/34 peak number of cases or the timing thereof. The challenges and questions related to school reopening have also been addressed from a theoretical or modelling perspective of scenario planning [14] [15] [16] , estimating the number of new or severely ill cases resulting from school reopening. These use varying assumptions of the underlying community transmission, and consider various scenarios of the ages and timing of students returning to school. While such models are valuable means of quantifying the expected impact of measures without increasing the risk of exposing the wider community to infection, their inclusion of other interventions is necessarily limited. The times surrounding school closure and reopening have seen a myriad of other non-pharmaceutical interventions being implemented. Through social contact patterns, observed changes in community transmission are the result of non-trivial, underlying interactions between current interventions. We believe our work fills an important knowledge gap in the literature by addressing the context of school interventions alongside other measures, and the de facto impact of schools in a broader framework of non-pharmaceutical interventions. School closure and reopening not only affect transmission occurring on school premises; they also affect (and are affected by) community transmission, transmission within households with young children, and wider measures taken to monitor and curb an outbreak. In addition to the well-being of children, school interventions also impact a nation's workforce via the time dedicated to childcare. It must be remembered that the observed effects of these interventions are a product of underlying testing, reporting, and isolation (or other physical or social distancing) measures.",

Ours is a data-driven approach which seeks not to establish the individual role of schools interventions on outbreak management, but instead assesses their impact in the context of wider societal interventions. Specifically, we wish to examine roles in transmission played by a) the different age cohorts of students, b) the timing of the school interventions (closure and reopening), and c) the background or community incidence. We hope these results can serve as a series of lessons learned from nations which have already reopened schools. For school closure, we address these questions by estimating the time between intervention and a response being observed in the recorded data, as well as the changes in the growth rate pre-and post-intervention. For school reopening, we track the growth rate in cases over the intervention timeline and search for correlations between these interventions and changes in the growth rate.",

            "text": "We consider four countries: Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden due to their geographic proximity, demographic similarities, and the relative timing and scope of their interventions to allow for a better comparison. We distinguish between countries with medium-to-high (Germany and Sweden) and low (Denmark and Norway) levels of community transmission on the basis of daily COVID-19 cases, rather than cases per capita [17] . This is motivated by the feasibility of testing, tracing, and isolating cases, which need not scale with population size. At the time of school closure, we saw the following cumulative cases: 800 (Denmark) , 6500 (Germany), 1100 (Norway), and 1400 (Sweden). By the time schools started reopening, the total cases had risen to: 7000 (Denmark) , 158000 (Germany), 7200 (Norway), and 19400 (Sweden on the day German schools first reopened). Only German states with at least 50 cases at the point of school closure, and at least 10 days of non-zero daily cases prior to closures, have been selected for analysis. We considered hospital admissions as the primary data source in our analyses, where the numbers were available and sufficiently large to do so. All studied countries expanded their hospital surge capacities to accommodate patients to a sufficient degree that we are not aware of instances of COVID-19 patients being turned away. Since clinically ill patients are unlikely not to present themselves for treatment at hospital, admissions data are a practical measure of community infection and, unlike confirmed cases, are not as susceptible to variable testing rates in the wider population. However, by studying only a subset of the entire population, the data will be biased toward older and sicker individuals which may for example lengthen the delay from an intervention to a visible signal in the data. Confirmed cases were used in situations where hospitalisation data were not available or insufficient to reliably infer the effect of interventions -this was particularly relevant in the case of school reopening, which has predominantly been recommended in communities with significantly reduced daily incidence (and hence hospitalisation) counts. Although we do not correct for variable testing rates in the confirmed cases, we have sought out data sets where there was 2/34 evidence of consistent and thorough testing. However, we acknowledge this was a challenge for most countries in early March. We document the number of tests carried out and comment further on the reliability of confirmed cases as representative of the community epidemic in the Supplementary Material (S3, Testing data). Consistent test numbers for both Germany and Norway around the time of school reopening (see Supplementary Material, S3) suggest that the confirmed number of cases is less prone to biases than earlier in the pandemic. We are therefore less concerned about using these data streams in a reopening context.",

Given other interventions were implemented after school closure and their effect is hard to disentangle, it is implicitly assumed that the inversion of epidemic trend from growing to declining is not solely a result of school closure. Therefore, the analysis of the impact of school closure is restricted to data before the peak in reported cases or hospital admissions. Denmark reopened schools quickly enough following sweeping nationwide interventions that hospitalisation data could still be used, though we cross-checked these findings by analysing confirmed cases. Official estimates at the time suggest a delay from infection to hospitalisation of 10 to 14 days [18] . Official Norwegian estimates suggest this same delay to be 14 days [19] . As Norwegian hospitalisation data were too sparse to reliably infer the effect of school reopening, daily confirmed cases were analysed instead. In Germany, daily confirmed cases are reported specifically for students under 18 in schools, kindergartens, holiday camps, after school clubs, etc. as well as for the staff working in these facilities.

This includes any associated changes in behaviour (e.g. parents not accompanying children to school or working from home due to caring responsibilities), as well as all other interventions (if any) occurring on the same day, which cannot be disentangled from school closure. The impact is assessed by comparing differences in the growth rate of cases or hospitalisations before and after the intervention. Rather than na\u00efvely comparing the growth rate at different points in time, we follow a more sophisticated procedure with the aim of separating the decrease in growth rate due to interventions implemented before school closure, and the impact of school closure itself. This is achieved by generating a counterfactual projection of daily cases or hospital admissions, which accounts inasmuch as possible for events prior to, but excluding, school closure, and identifying when there is a clear deviation between the real data and such a projection. We then compare the growth rate observed in the real data and in the modelled counterfactual at the time when this deviation is detected, and interpret this difference as the likely impact of school closure.",

However, fitting a model to data from the earlier part of the epidemic is extremely challenging since the observations are generally scarce, noisy and coloured through various reporting issues, in particular systematic ones, such as a strong weekend effect. Fitting a simple compartmental model without accounting for these factors will result in parameter estimates that are systematically biased [20] . These inaccuracies in parameter estimates propagate to any projection drawn from the model. Mitigating this model discrepancy in the fitting process is an area of active research; see [21] for a recent review. Generating a counterfactual projection using a compartmental model, without compensating for such discrepancies, will erroneously understate or overstate the effect of the intervention.",

We then use a two-step approach for fitting an ODE 3/34 model and correcting for the discrepancy between model and data as follows. In the first step, a selection of sample trajectories are generated via Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) fitting of the ODE from the first day of data until 5 days after school closure. In a second post-processing step, a Bayesian regression model is then trained on the same data used to fit the ODE model, while using the sampled trajectories as the covariates (inputs). Essentially, the regression model attempts to capture the structural part of the discrepancy between ODE simulations and the observed data (predominantly, potential deviation from exponential growth and weekend effects). We formulate this regression model as a Gaussian process (GP) with a Negative Binomial likelihood. Once trained, the regression model is used to project the trajectory of cases for the time period following the 5 days after school closure. This projection is then treated as the desired counterfactual.",

The time window from school closure to response date defines the lag time (Table 1 , column 2), which runs from the date of closure (acting as the zeroth day) up to but not including the response date. The growth rates are obtained as point estimates (see following description of the instantaneous growth rate) at the time of school closure, for the observed data (r obs pre , Table 1 , column 3), and at the response date for both the modelled (r mod post , Table 1 , column 4) and the observed data (r obs post , Table 1 , column 5). The relative changes in the estimated growth rates between modelled and observed data at the response date can be used to assess the impact of school closure. The observed growth rate at the time of school closure can be used to cross-check the growth rate in the modelled data; these could be significantly different if the impact of interventions prior to school closure had a strong effect on transmission which the GP was able to capture in the counterfactual projection.

We therefore consider a method whereby the growth rate can be quantified following successive changed measures. A smoother \u03c1(t) is applied to the data over time t, such that the instantaneous growth rate is \u03c1 (t) (cf. a constant value in a phase of pure exponential growth or decline). It is assumed that the daily new confirmed cases (or daily new hospital admissions) c(t) grow or decay exponentially, with noise added to account for small case numbers, i.e. c(t) \u221d e \u03c1(t) . To estimate \u03c1 (t) we adapt a General Additive Model (GAM) from the R package mgcv, using a Negative Binomial family with canonical link [25] . Smoothing is achieved using default thin plate regression splines. Where case numbers are sufficiently high, and there is a clear weekend effect in the reporting of data, a weekend effect has been accounted for in the GAM by the addition of a fixed effect on those days of the week. Specifically, we add a quantity \u03c9 d for each day of the week d \u2208 [1, 7] , such that cases follow c(t) \u221d e \u03c9 d +\u03c1(t) . Setting \u03c9 d = 0 for all but two days yields a weekend-specific description, and \u03c9 d = 0 \u2200 d recovers the GAM with no day-of-week effects. This method has previously been used in [22] .",

Despite no official nationwide closing of primary or secondary schools in Sweden, there were local closures in response to outbreaks within the community. There is no evidence of a sustained reduction in the growth rate within a time period attributable to school closures ( Figure 2 ). It is notable, however, that the limited closures in Sweden were imposed in the absence of large-scale social restrictions. This indicates that school closures affecting older students without more widespread social interventions are unlikely to have significant national effects, and that school closures are most effective when implemented concurrently with other interventions. It is notable that there was an increase in weekly testing between March 30 th and April 6 th , which may have contributed to the apparent limited reduction in growth rate during this time. However, this falls outside of the time window in which we would expect to see a response attributable to school closures.",

Where an age group appears over multiple dates, the return of students in this age group took place in different states. We present a summary of the overall national trend, as our data only distinguish between staff and students on the national scale. On three occasions the recorded cases were inconsistently reported, and values were imputed using cases reported on preceding and proceeding days. Our findings do not change significantly upon exclusion of these data points. We contrast these demographically specific findings by comparison with national hospital admissions. Daily cases Instantaneous growth rate Figure 3 . Confirmed cases in staff (red) and students (blue) in schools, kindergartens, holiday camps, and other educational facilities for under-18s (age distribution not known) in Germany. Left shows daily new confirmed cases, and right shows the instantaneous growth rate (shaded regions are 95% confidence intervals). Solid vertical lines indicate when students returned to school, and dashed lines indicate other changes to public measures. In April and early May with small numbers of primary school or exam students returning, there was no notable difference between the incidence among students and staff. Accounting for the lag time, the incidence among students was higher than that of staff following May 18 th . Instantaneous growth rate Left shows daily admissions, and right shows the instantaneous growth rate (shaded regions are 95% confidence intervals). The continuing decline in admissions suggests that the return of younger (and exam) students did not present a statistically significant impact on the general hospitalised population. It is worth bearing in mind that hospital admissions lag further behind than confirmed cases. Additionally, since very few young people have been hospitalised, an additional generation time of 6 days [27] may need to be added to this lag to account for students infecting older age groups.",

This work does not claim to have achieved this; however, the consistency of the signal across regions with different intervention timelines suggests a distinct effect of school closure on the subsequent growth in cases. The consistently lower post-intervention growth rates in German states when compared to the modelled scenarios with no interventions (see Table 1 ) suggests that school closures contributed to reducing the epidemic growth rate. School interventions were typically followed by a response in the data approximately 7 days later (corresponding to approximately 1.2 generations). Table 1 shows that this lag time was comparable across states which closed schools at different times. High school students sitting their final examinations under social distancing does not appear to have significantly impacted case numbers. Sweden implemented partial school closures which affected students aged 16 or above. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this intervention affects the later daily incidence within the expected time frame. These findings are consistent with earlier works suggesting that school closure in isolation is insufficient to prevent the 12/34 spread of COVID-19 [6, 8, 11] . The evidence for the impact of school closures on growth rates in Norway and Denmark is more limited. While there was a reduction in growth rate of hospitalised cases after school closures, it has not been possible to link this effect with school closures.",

Since, to our knowledge, no stringent restrictions were introduced to compensate for the additional transmission risk due to school reopening, a lack of signal in the growth rate after reopening would be indicative that schools do not contribute substantially to community transmission. From our analysis, the reopening of schools to younger year groups and exam students in Germany, Denmark and Norway has not resulted in a significant increase in the growth rate. The return of all students (up to age 16 in Denmark) does not appear to have increased transmission in Denmark and Norway. However, the added return of most (primarily older) students in Germany has increased transmission among students, but not staff. It is unclear whether older students transmit more, or if physical distancing is practically unfeasible in classrooms at high capacity. The distinction between the impact of younger and older students is echoed in other modelling studies [14, 15] . Although our findings cannot be interpreted as causal links between individual interventions and changes in national case numbers, they represent a realistic assessment of the effects of school reopening in their natural context of wider societal interventions.",

For instance, continued low incidence following the return of younger students does not imply that such a measure is inherently safe, but may rather be a result of the successful implementation of a complete system of monitoring and interventions jointly with low daily incidence, as observed in Denmark and Norway. In many instances, the students were spread over more classrooms, with greater levels of physical distancing from each other and teachers, conditions which are not always practically feasible. Caution is warranted surrounding the return of older students, in particular regarding the likely increased number of crowded classrooms, as well as their added impact to community transmission. The correlation with community transmission is particularly clear in Germany, with confirmed cases increasing among students, and the halted decay in hospital admissions on the national level. While all three countries seem to be effectively managing transmission, the volatility of new German hospital admissions warns that a failure in control, or a sudden spike in cases, will likely have a stronger effect in Germany than it would have in Denmark or Norway. Key to this observation is the aforementioned delay before which the ripple effects of school reopening will travel from students to the general population.",

The available tools, procedures, and protocols for identifying and reporting cases have all changed over the course of this pandemic. Hospitalisations only capture those cases sick enough that they require medical attention, and is thus a biased representation of transmission towards the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Furthermore, there are differences in reporting due to personal judgements from individual doctors and nurses. For example, the correct classification of nosocomial cases has been unclear in many cases. Similar challenges arise for patients admitted to hospital for a different treatment, but who also happened to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 with mild symptoms. Confirmed cases are strongly biased by testing; both the availability of the tests, their logistical deployment, and the laboratory capacity to analyse them. Further biases are present in the populations these are offered to: front-line healthcare staff, essential workers, care home residents, etc. This is further complicated if the allocation to various groups changes over time. Another bias in the data is what makes the general public eligible for a test: the number and severity of symptoms, their age, known recent contacts, and so on. If tests are only offered to symptomatic cases, the results will be biased away from younger people, as we know they are disproportionately likely to be asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic.",

The first step consists in fitting a simple SEIR-type ODE-based compartmental model, using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Because we assume a constant transmission parameter, with the possible exception of a transient initial phase when the initial numbers propagate through the compartments, the model trajectories are characterised by exponential growth and cannot account for the impact of interventions prior to school closure (potentially deviating from exponential growth), nor for weekend effects. Therefore, in a second post-processing step we use a posterior sample of these trajectories as inputs to a Bayesian regression model that is in turn fitted to the same data. This post-processing step captures at least part of the discrepancy between the data and the smooth simulated ODE trajectories. For this regression model, we use a latent Gaussian process (GP) with a Negative Binomial likelihood.

Reassuringly, we find that extending the minimal lag time by a day, thereby further limiting the 24/34 attribution of any response to school closures, does not significantly change the lag time. This alleviates some concern that 5 days, being solely the mean of a distribution of incubation times, is insufficient for the method to adequately capture the pre-intervention trajectory. Expanding the sensitivity analysis to even longer minimal lag times is not meaningful: most lag times in the manuscript are 7 days, and by training the GP up until this point, any resulting lag times would likely be forced to be even longer. This amounts to forcing a signal, rather than searching for possible variability in the signal within a reasonably expected range. The effect of this can be seen in North Rhine-Westphalia.",

We encounter a similar limitation with Bavaria. In Figure S10 , the data points from the 22 nd to at least the 25 th of March are very close to the boundary of the 75% credible intervals of the GP. Although a visual inspection confirms that an 8 day lag time is consistent with a change in the data, small changes to the minimal lag can bring those observed points to fall just inside the boundary. When a 12 day lag time is analysed for Bavaria the relative reduction in the growth rate is 72%, which is consistent with the other German states. The effect of interventions is consistently impacted in the state: either a smaller reduction the growth rate is seen compared to other states, or a similar reduction is obtained, but after a longer duration of time.",

This is not equivalent to the total number of tests carried out in Germany, as not all laboratories provided this type of data; however, it can be used as an indication of general testing trends. There is a weekend effect occurring in the testing data for Germany, with lower relative testing occurring on March 7 th -9 th , 14 th -16 th and 21 st -23 rd . No corresponding change is seen in the positive test ratio, indicating that case numbers were likely consistent across these periods. As such, any fall in confirmed cases over these periods can likely be attributed to reduced testing, rather than a response to intervention. Ignoring the weekend effect, the number of tests carried out across the period between March 17 th and 27 th was fairly stable. As most school closures in Germany occurred on March 16 th , we can expect the confirmed cases over this period to provide a reasonable representation of the underlying epidemic. Daily testing data for Germany are not available after March. As such, it will be necessary to consider the weekly testing totals, which are made available through the RKI. Figure S5 shows the weekly testing numbers for Germany, along with the weekly positive test ratio. Note that weekly testing data for Germany are released every Wednesday. Figure S5 .

Denmark displays two clear increases in testing capacity between March 23 rd and 30 th and again between April 13 th and 20 th . The increase in late March, combined with a relatively high positive test ratio, indicates that confirmed cases during this period might not be a suitable metric. Similarly in Norway there was a large increase in testing in the week commencing March 16 th , very close to the date of school closures. As such, for both Norway and Denmark it will be necessary to consider hospitalisations as a metric for assessing the dynamics of the epidemic. The weekly testing figures for Sweden are highlighted in Figure S8 , along with the positive test ratio for the same period. Testing rates around the time of school closures (March 18 th ) were generally increasing, with a large increase occurring during the week beginning March 30 th . This increase was accompanied by an increase in positive test ratio, indicating an increasing capability to identify and test infected individuals, or a change in testing policy.

While the lag times are not identical, sensitivity analysis (see Table S2 ) suggests that these lag times overlap. Furthermore, it is reassuring that there does not seem to be a fixed date following school closures when a response is seen. Were this the case, we would expect Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg to have a lag time which was 3 days shorter than North Rhine-Westphalia. This suggests a signal in both data sets following school closure. Clearly it would be unrealistic to assume school closures to be wholly responsible for the observed fall in cases, but the above-detailed correlations suggest that they may have partially contributed to the overall effect.",

As such it is not possible to attribute the observed change in hospital admissions solely to school closures. It is notable, however, that the observed reduction in hospitalisations is comparable in Denmark and Norway; both countries which simultaneously targeted schools and non-essential businesses. For completeness, we fit the GP model to daily hospitalisations ( Figure S14 ). However the short training period for the model resulted in a wide credible interval for this projection. Furthermore, as with Denmark, the proximity of school closures to the point of peak incidence makes it difficult to adequately assess either the lag time or the change in growth rate occurring after closures. As such, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the data.",

We ran NUTS with 2 chains for a total 1000 iterations, where we discarded the first 500 iterations as burnin (warmup). We set a target acceptance rate of 0.98 for NUTS during the warmup phase iterations. As with the SEIR model fit, the GP model is trained with data up to 5 days after school closure.",
