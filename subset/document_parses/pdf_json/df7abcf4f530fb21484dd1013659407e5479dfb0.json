Elective surgeries were immediately suspended, outpatient clinics closed, and efforts to expand hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients were emphasized by the American Medical Association and American College of Surgeons. 1, 2 Amongst all levels of trainees within medical education, fellows represent a group that has been the most detrimentally affected by changes made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited fellows were required to fulfill additional COVID-related clinical duties while the decrease in non-COVID patient volume prompted concerns for meeting case-volume requirements for board eligibility. Meanwhile, the collective response and precautionary measures of hospitals nationwide precipitated large-scale furloughs, pay cuts, and institutional wide hiring freezes, which directly affected fellows who were apt to enter the job market. [3] [4] [5] There are currently no published data regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on fellow trainees. As we have observed in the past few months, the pandemic is ongoing with possibilities of future surges. This study investigates the perspectives and concerns of fellows, so programs may modify their curricula and requirements in support of their current and future fellows.",

Our institution responded to the March 2020 surge by closing outpatient clinics, canceling all elective and urgent surgeries, and directed a coordinated effort across all residency and fellowship programs to form COVID-response teams and provide medical intensive care unit (ICU) support. Each fellowship program responded differently with some initiating full deployment to the medical ICU, some rotating a fellow to a designated position and team, some becoming part of a COVID procedural team, and others integrating their call pool with the medical or general surgery residency program to provide staffing relief. Each fellowship program shouldered a differing range of COVID-related responsibilities, resulting in variable departures from their normal fellowship-based education or tasks.

In order to maintain anonymity, the only demographic information inquired was gender, fellowship type, and whether the survey participant was in their final year of training. Fellowships were separated into surgical, medical, critical care, and procedure-based subspecialty types to determine if there were differences in experience following pandemic-related changes. A surgical subspecialty was described as one where most of the work was done in the operating room (eg, surgical oncology, gynecologic oncology, orthopedic surgery, or urology). A medical subspecialty was described as one where most of the work was done in an inpatient ward or outpatient clinic (eg, general cardiology, rheumatology, and inflammatory bowel disease). A critical care subspecialty was described as one where most of the work was done in a critical care unit (eg, pulmonology critical care, surgical critical care, neurology critical care, and anesthesia critical care). A procedurebased subspecialty was described as one where most of the work was procedural (eg, interventional cardiology and interventional gastroenterology). Descriptive statistical methods were used to calculate frequencies and percentages of the survey response data. Intergroup differences between fellowship types were measured using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test with Bonferroni adjustment. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows version 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA).",

            "text": "In response to the pandemic, our institution rapidly adopted web-based platforms for didactics and supplemented procedural volume with video-based education, similar to strategies employed across the country. 6, 7 The results of our survey demonstrate that fellows perceived virtual lectures, conferences, and journal clubs as the most important aspect of their curriculum during the COVID-19 pandemic mirroring a recent systematic review by Dedelia et al which describes the efficacy of videoconferencing in the dissemination not only of didactics but also interdisciplinary learning. 8 Fellows are uniquely affected by changes during this pandemic as they are at the culmination of many years of training, solidifying clinical or procedural skills, and securing job appointments in the setting of widespread limitations on elective procedures and hiring practices. 1, 2, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The first pandemic wave brought significant financial uncertainty to many institutions, preferring to implement hiring freezes in order to avoid employee layoffs in the future. 13 Approximately half of the 25 (53%) fellows graduating and seeking employment felt that they will not be able to find a desirable job had COVID-19 not happened. Furthermore, since there were no wide interspecialty differences, the struggle of job placement during the pandemic is likely one shared by fellows across all specialties. Amongst those interviewing, many describe changes to the interview format including a transition to virtual interviews, which was felt to be inferior to in-person interviews. The recent and rapid adoption of this technology for trainee recruitment and hiring has had variable success. Virtual interviews offer certain advantages such as decreased travel expenses, 14 and several medical and surgical programs have published their transition toward virtual interviewing, many of which offer a positive experience with this new format. [14] [15] [16] [17] Still, several other studies report trainees did not feel they were able to convey themselves effectively compared to an in-person interview. 18, 19 The business sector has been a longtime proponent of virtual interviewing and has been refining its use for several years. A 2015 report from Futurestep, a company specializing in professional talent recruitment, polled 700 industry executives and found that nearly 75% of their companies used real-time video platforms to interview candidates with positive feedback from candidates. 20 Virtual interviewing will likely continue and undoubtedly improve as we continue to brace for further COVID-19 surges. Several tips for video-based interviewing learned from the business world that fellowship programs can educate on include (1) preparing your background for simplicity and ensuring adequate lighting and minimal echo, (2) testing your technology ahead of time, (3) dressing professionally, (4) practicing and preparing simple responses as clarity and brevity transmit better over video, (5) monitoring your body language and positioning, and (6) the camera should be at eye level and eye contact should be maintained by looking at the camera, not by focusing on the video screen below. 21 Our study has a number of limitations. These results are from a single institution which may limit generalizability. Further, California has experienced subsequent waves of variable severity which has further affected fellows in a manner that is not captured in this survey. The changes to normal practice, including the transition to video-based educational conferences and video-based interviews, will likely carry through to the future. Future studies are needed to explore the long-term effectiveness of these changes as they pertain to fellow recruitment and subsequent employment. Still, our study characterizes the dramatic impact the first COVID wave had on a generation of new and graduating fellows that will continue to shape the clinical landscape.",
