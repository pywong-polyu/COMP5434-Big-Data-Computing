            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the most significant public health threat worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 usually have pneumonia concomitant with local inflammation and sometimes a cytokine storm. Specific components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus trigger lung inflammation, and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs exacerbates this process, although much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study of lung type II pneumocyte cells (A549) demonstrated that ORF7, an open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, induced the production of CCL2, a chemokine that promotes the chemotaxis of monocytes, and decreased the expression of IL-8, a chemokine that recruits neutrophils. A549 cells also had an increased level of IL-6. The results of our chemotaxis Transwell assay suggested that ORF7 augmented monocyte infiltration and reduced the number of neutrophils. We conclude that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 may have specific effects on the immunological changes in tissues after infection. These results suggest that the functions of other ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 should also be comprehensively examined.",

Subsequently, cells translate the structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) of SARS-CoV-2 in the cytosol [13, 14] . The structural proteins include nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, and the NSPs include 16 NSPs from the ORF1ab [15] . There are at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab, ORF2 (S protein), ORF3, ORF4 (E protein), ORF5 (M protein), ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, ORF9 (N protein), and ORF10 [15, 16] .

ORF6, ORF8, and the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 inhibit these IFN-activated antiviral pathways, and this inhibits the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) [18] .

Innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, are the first cells to respond when there is an infection in the lungs [29] . In particular, infection of pneumocytes leads to massive infiltration of monocytes into lung tissues [30] , although there appears to be limited infiltration of neutrophils during SARS-CoV-2 infection [31] [32] [33] . During the early stage of viral infection, cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, CCL2, CCL7, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1) have essential functions in the recruit-ment of immune cells, defense against the infection, and promotion of inflammation [34] . We therefore used qPCR to determine the expression of cytokines and chemokines in ORF7-expressing A549 cells compared to control cells (Figure 2(a) ). The results demonstrated that IL-6, CCL2, and IFN-\u03b2 had higher expression in A549-ORF7 cells (all P < 0:01); IL-1\u03b1, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 had lower expression in A549-ORF7 cells (all P < 0:01); the two groups had no differences in the levels of IL-1-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 (both P > 0:05); and CCL7 and IL-10 were undetectable.",

Lymphocytes, T cells, and B cells were less abun-dant and scattered in the lungs of these patients [30, 32, 39, 41] , but there was increased infiltration by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils [42] . After infection of the lungs, macrophages and neutrophils function as the first defense of the innate immune system, and these cells phagocytize pathogens and produce cytokines and chemokines that attract other immune cells [29] . The early recruitment of immune cells determines the local immune response and can even cause more widespread inflammation, such as a cytokine storm. Our present work examined the influence of ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 on innate immunity. Our major result is that expression of ORF7 in type II pneumocytes (A549 cells) increased the level of CCL2, decreased the level of IL-8, and increased the migration of primary monocytes but decreased the migration of neutrophils in vitro.",

Our results indicated that ORF7 has a specific function in the immune response to coronavirus infection. Monocytes produce IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, CCLs, and VEGF, and these molecules have critical roles in cytokine release and recruitment of other immune cells [43] . IL-6 and IL-1 are proinflammatory cytokines and the predominant inducers of the cytokine storm [43, 44] . Additionally, IL-6 can activate macrophages, which produce more cytokines and chemokines [43] . Neutrophils are also produced early in response to infection, and neutrophil chemotaxis in humans is usually mediated by factors such as IL-8, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and complement C5a [45] . Neutrophils, like macrophages, produce a range of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, ILs, GCSF, MCSF, and GMCSF) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) [43, 46] . Thus, neutrophils have direct antipathogen effects (phagocytosis) and indirect antipathogen effects (stimulation by cytokines). Macrophages and neutrophils thus play critical roles during the acute phase of pneumonia following viral infection. ",

This suggests that ORF7 may accelerate the progression of local inflammation after viral infection. Our in vitro studies also found that ORF7 downregulated the expression of IL-8. This suggests that ORF7 may block the migration of neutrophils. Greater neutrophil infiltration of the lungs could exacerbate the cytokine storm and worsen the patient's condition due to lymphopenia [56] .",

Even though this mutation was in the S protein, recent research reported the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies in mice [58] .

For example, the genomic RNA sensor system triggers the innate immune reaction, stimulates the translation of other proteins from the genome or subgenome of the virus, and may thereby increase lung injury. Consequently, appropriated animal models can be employed for the determination of ORF7 in vivo in the future. Additionally, the effect of ORF7 on the microenvironment of the lung should not be considered alone. Instead, there should be a systematic examination of the impact of all factors and their interactions on lung inflammation.",
