In consultation with member states, PAHO conducted a study in October 2014 to identify nursing research priorities related to health systems and services in the Americas as set forth in the Strategy for Universal Access to Health and Universal Health Coverage (Resolution CD53/5, Rev. 2) [1] . These priorities were published in 2015 [2] with the expectation that they would guide and support nursing research focused on health systems and services across Latin America. For that study, a systematic literature search was conducted to identify the research priorities and related topics. Initially, a list of 444 topics was generated and evaluated by the PAHO/WHO Collaborating Centers on Nursing and Midwifery, using a consensus method. The topics were then further narrowed to those Open Access *Correspondence: th2696@cumc.columbia.edu of greatest relevance by coordinators of graduate programs from 12 Latin American countries and 122 experts in nursing and public health research from 12 countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Portugal and Uruguay). The final priorities were reviewed and finalized in consultation with Ministries of Health in PAHO member states. These priorities were organized into 14 subcategories within the following six major categories: (1) Policies and education related to nursing human resources;",

To foster a common agenda, it was recommended that a national policy on research for health be formulated that involved multisectoral participation, articulation, and coordination. Since then, LAC countries have strengthened their national research priorities and are working to develop more consistent approaches to the integration and translation of research that can inform health policies [5] . However, addressing gaps between evidence and policy related to human resources for health and the need to set research priorities and broaden acceptance and use of scientific evidence in informing practice and policy remain important priorities for Latin American countries [6] . To that end, PAHO has been working since 2013 to strengthen and expand the roles and responsibilities of nurses in primary health care systems, including increasing their involvement in research. Strategic Directions for Nursing in the Region of the Americas, a PAHO/WHO initiative launched in 2019 [7] , highlighted the cross-cutting importance of research and reinforced the need to enhance the translation of research to practice as well as to forge alliances between Ministries of Health and their various stakeholders to support the establishment of a research agenda and set research priorities.",

Health research in LAC countries is conducted primarily by academic researchers. Although there is a good deal of diversity in research capacity and use of evidence, especially within the scope of health systems and services within and across LAC countries, there remains a great need to expand nursing's capacity to conduct research and to disseminate and use research findings [10, 11] , as well as to build knowledge connections from an intersectoral perspective, with actions that allow integration of the health sector with other sectors, such as education, work and economy.",

            "text": "Most respondents reported conducting or using nursing research focused on nursing education (competencies and curricula), nursing roles, and nursing interventions to improve individual and/or population health outcomes. To a large, but lesser extent, respondents reported conducting or using research related to evidence-based nursing practice. Research on health systems' organization and structure was the topic familiar to most study respondents, whereas conducting research or being aware of nursing research that examines health policies, the impact of nursing on public health, nurse migration, and information technologies were least often reported. These findings suggest that some rebalancing of research is needed, with perhaps less focus on education and roles and more focus on health policy, public health, information technology, and especially nurse migration. If nursing curricula included foundational content about the importance of policy, and if advanced education related to policy were available to nurse leaders who can and should influence policy [11] , the profession would no doubt be better prepared to address global health challenges such as social, racial/ethnic and sexual/gender inequalities and health inequities [9] . Moreover, by increasing the number of doctoral programs more nurses would have the specialized knowledge and skills to address social determinants of health, human resources for public health, and innovation in health. However, doctoral programs must have the resources, including qualified faculty, to train professionals who have strong skills in statistics, research methods and critical thinking and are capable of conducting rigorous and socially relevant research [14, 15] . The fact that 36% of respondents reported conducting research to identify effective interventions in improving individual health and/or population health (and about 50% reported that they used or knew about this research) is one of the most encouraging findings from the survey. It is noteworthy that research on issues related to migration was barely explored among respondents, indicating that this topic is ripe for expansion in the coming years. Understanding nurse migration is of even greater importance given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems, including its impact on the nursing workforce. Understanding the labor market; issues related to attractiveness, working conditions and retention of nurses; and the capacity of educational systems to address the shortage of bedside nurses and the importance of the clinical and academic nursing workforce in addressing this, are critically important in Latin America and in most parts of the world [16] .",

To expand doctoral nursing programs in Latin America, in 2017 PAHO conducted a study and developed an action plan [11] and has since been working with universities and representatives of ministries of health and education in the region to increase investments in doctoral nursing education and to encourage greater cooperation and collaboration between universities and between countries.",

Despite the expansion of peer-reviewed scientific nursing journals, the production and dissemination of research findings continues to be concentrated in a few countries. Not surprisingly, Brazil leads Latin America in the number of nursing journals and the production of nursing research largely because it has the greatest number of nursing programs that offer graduate degrees (master and doctoral) for nurses. One of the reasons for Brazil's success is that graduate programs in the country are supported by the Ministry of Education without cost to students.

Second, the study was cross-sectional, so it is not possible to determine whether or how much impact initiatives to increase nursing research in Latin America has had. Third, to encourage participation, we opted to make the survey anonymous. This precluded collection of more information about the participants and characteristics associated with engagement in nursing research-as well as the possibility of follow-up. Fourth, based on written in responses to the option \"other, please specify, in the question about educational level, it appears that some respondents did not understand the question. Thus, it is possible that other questions may not have been clear to respondents-a factor that may also have led to some bias in the findings.
