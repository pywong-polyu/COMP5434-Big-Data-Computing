Women are particularly impacted by both episodic and chronic pain with higher prevalence and a greater level of pain-related disability compared to men. Midlife is a critical period for women during which the frequency of pain complaints begins to increase. Although pain is known to be influenced and controlled by sex hormones, it has not been widely recognized as a symptom of the menopausal transition outside of the menopause research community. The recent thematic series in this journal has specifically highlighted pain related conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, migraine and abdominal pain for which the significance among midlife women is not typically recognized. The studies presented in this thematic series present a small fraction of relevant, understudied questions regarding pain and its impact on women in midlife. Addressing the gaps in knowledge will require longitudinal studies that consider the emergence of pain symptomatology in relation to midlife trajectories of other symptoms and health determinants, as well as further study of new and emerging therapies.",

More than 10% of American adults experience some level of daily pain, and nearly 40 million (17.6%) experience severe levels of pain annually [2, 4, 5] . The prevalence of pain increases with age, in part due to the increasing prevalence of medical conditions which cause pain, such as arthritis and diabetes [6, 7] . Thus, the public health burden of pain is expected to increase dramatically with the demographic shift of the U.S. population to older ages. Furthermore, poorly controlled episodic pain can transform into chronic pain disorders (defined as 15 or more days of pain per month for 3 or more months), which are associated with significant disability and morbidity [2, 4, 8] .",

Midlife women experience increasing prevalence of chronic pain symptoms (aches and pains, headache, genitourinary pain) even in the absence of newly diagnosed chronic conditions [18, 19] . Though the significant burden of pain symptoms in midlife women has long been recognized, few studies have addressed the epidemiology and mechanisms of pain in midlife women. Particularly lacking are longitudinal studies of pain trajectories across midlife. The critical need to fill this knowledge gap is underscored by the fact that the highest increase in opioid prescribing and opioid related overdose mortality has been among women in their 40s, 50s and 60s [3, 20] .",

Many studies are based on pain clinic populations which have well defined pain phenotypes but lack adequate consideration of important midlife characteristics including the M.T. Conversely, most studies of the M.T. include detailed hormonal and biomarker data but not specific characterization of pain symptoms. With the exception of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) and the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study, no longitudinal studies have examined changes in pain related complaints across the stages of the M.T. Another limitation in the field is related to challenges to adequately capturing pain complaints and operationalizing them as pain disorders within population based studies. As pain complaints are common in a high percent of the population, it is important to parse out not only the frequency but also the intensity of pain and interference of pain with activities of daily living [29] . Further, accurate and reliable characterization of pain complaints is complicated by temporal variations. Ascertainment of complaints multiple times per day, over multiple days may be required to optimize characterization of pain symptoms. Emerging methods that apply mobile technology such as smart phone apps are a promising strategy that should advance the study of pain mechanisms [29, 30] .",

The recent thematic series in the journal Women's Midlife Health (WMHL) specifically highlighted pain related conditions that while common and troublesome in midlife women are not typically recognized by the broader medical and research community as particularly burdensome at this time of life. Two of these articles are reviews that focus on rheumatoid arthritis [31] and migraine [32] , pain causing conditions that can occur in either sex at any age. While not typically considered causes of midlife pain symptoms, both disorders tend to have a female predominance that peaks in midlife. These reviews indicate that although both conditions have been linked to hormonal changes in women there is not a clear understanding of the specific mechanisms that play a role in their pathophysiology and presentation. Symptom presentation of both rheumatoid arthritis and migraine appears to change with fluctuating hormonal states, and both generally improve in high and rising endogenous estrogen states (pregnancy) and worsen with hormonal fluctuations during the M.T [31, 32] . Nevertheless, treatment of both joint pain and migraine headache with exogenous estrogens has shown inconsistent results [33] [34] [35] .",

Although migraine is typically recognized as a leading pain condition in women during the reproductive years, the review by Pavlovic [32] emphasizes that migraine prevalence and symptom frequency peak during midlife. The hormonal regulation of migraine has been recognized since ancient times, although primarily with respect to the prominence of peri-menstrual attacks [37] . However, midlife and the M.T. in particular create a specific challenge for women with migraine as fluctuating hormonal cycles decrease the predictability of attacks. As noted in the review, this has important consequences for treatment and quality of life. Migraine treatment in midlife women is further complicated by the fact that treatment with exogenous estrogen containing compounds is controversial given that migraine has been associated with increased stroke risk [38, 39] . Consequently, strict guidelines limit use of estrogen containing contraceptives in women with migraine older than 35 years of age [40] . Given that cardiovascular risk rises in midlife and that many women are unable to tolerate or have unmet needs in migraine treatment, new emerging therapeutic approaches for migraine are particularly relevant for this age group.",

Despite the small sample size, this is an important treatment study, which adds to our growing understanding of treatment-related brain changes associated with headache recovery in women with migraine.

The authors assessed how changes in severity of abdominal pain change in relation to age, stage of the M.T., perceptions of stress and to both hormonal and stress related biomarkers. The Seattle study is uniquely poised to address this question, as it is one of the few established longitudinal cohorts of women that followed several hundred women for over two decades while they transitioned from the late reproductive phase of life into the postmenopausal years. The study has previously examined back and joint pain showing that they were predominantly related to age, but not to MT-related factors [43] . Consistent with the literature, the Callan et al. manuscript reported decreases in abdominal pain with increasing age [42] . They extended prior work showing that estrogen and testosterone are associated with lower severity of abdominal pain [42] , while anxiety and perceived stress were associated with higher severity of abdominal pain.",

Further work is needed to examine both racial and ethnic disparities as well as socioeconomic factors related to the presentation of pain symptoms, and to diagnosis and management of pain disorders. Access to treatment in midlife women is of utmost importance given the pervasiveness and burden on a population level and the under-recognition in clinical practice [6, 8] . Furthermore, the treatment interruptions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are exacerbating these problems and creating a need for novel therapy alternatives using emergent technologies such as telemedicine. Incorporation of these new modalities into treatment plans of midlife women is of particular urgency [44, 45] .",

In addition to development of traditional therapeutics, more holistic approaches are needed for effective study and treatment of pain in midlife women. Further, efforts are needed to better understand environmental and occupational risk factors for pain and interventions to ameliorate them. Finally, the association of pain with significant opioid related morbidity and mortality in midlife women [3, 20] , suggests the need to better understand how pain symptomatology and its response to treatment change in midlife. Increased research regarding sex differences in response to treatment is essential. This will not only improve pain treatment for women but will further our understanding of the pathophysiology of pain. This increased knowledge may have ramifications for both sexes throughout the lifespan.",
