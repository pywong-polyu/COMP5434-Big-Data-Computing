The analysis reveals a lack of information among users and the spread of misinformation with regard to COVID-19 and vaccination. Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination.",

BMC Public Health (2022) 22:846 December 2020. Since May 2020, the COSMO COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring project has been investigating the willingness of the population in Germany to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Their surveys show that the proportion of those willing to be vaccinated has steadily declined since the beginning of the survey, falling from 79% in mid-April 2020 to 48% in mid-December 2020 [2, 3] . It again increased to 57% at the end of December 2020 [2, 3] . At the beginning of March 2021, the vaccination readiness of the respondents was 68% [4] . As of mid-December 2021, 70.9% of the population in Germany are fully vaccinated [5] . 61% of those still unvaccinated report that they do not want to get vaccinated and 26% remain hesitant. Only 13% of those vaccinated plan to receive a vaccination shot in the near future [5] .",

The COSMO COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring shows that confidence in the safety of the vaccines used is the most relevant factor for a positive attitude of the population towards vaccination. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated is higher among older individuals, individuals whose families generally support vaccination, and individuals who are worried about infection [8] . A German telephone survey on the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination also revealed that belonging to a population group at high risk for a severe course of COVID-19, a previous COVID-19 diagnosis and the expectation of severe complications are important factors associated with positive attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccination [9] . Concerns about potential side effects were identified as one of the reasons for refusing vaccination [9] . According to a study by Taylor et al., perceived low benefits, concerns about potential long-term consequences, criticism towards financial interests of pharmaceutical companies and a preference for natural immunity against COVID-19 were also associated with low willingness to get vaccinated [10] .",

The search terms were not combined using operators. The keywords were entered in the search field of the respective platforms one by one. Relevant posts in German language were extracted into a text document. Posts in closed groups were not included. Data was extracted until a saturation effect could be observed. Inclusion criteria aside from the aforementioned keywords were: the posts had to be written in German language and had to report hesitancy or refusal with respect to the COVID-19 vaccination. The data included posts created from January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021. This time frame roughly covers the period from the first reports of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 up to the general availability of vaccines against COVID-19 in Germany. This period includes the initial stages of the development of the respective vaccines, their approval and introduction in Germany through specialized vaccination centers and the subsequent extension of the vaccination strategy to also include vaccination through general practitioners and family physicians. The beginning of May 2021 also marked the end of the prioritization of specific vulnerable groups for receiving the Vaxzevria \u00ae vaccine, the first widely available vaccine against COVID-19 in Germany [11] . Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are the most widely used freely accessible social media forums in Germany, and accordingly the highest numbers of posts are available on these sites, therefore these social media forums were selected [12, 13] . Moreover, social media are frequently used communication channels to disseminate both high-quality information and misinformation [14] .",

Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. For example, information provided by the Robert Koch-Institute in the Frequently Asked Questions section on the topic of COVID-19 and vaccination (as of 28/12/2021) is not barrier-free and is available neither in simple language nor in major foreign languages spoken by immigrants in Germany [21] . Information from the Federal Ministry of Health regarding questions and answers on COVID-19 vaccination is available in sign language, simple language and English (as of 28/12/2021). However, information materials in other languages frequently spoken in Germany, such as Turkish or Russian, are missing [22] . The Federal Ministry of Health also refers to the Paul Ehrlich Institute for information on potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccination, which are not easily comprehensible by laypersons [23] . This demonstrates the need for more low-threshold and target group-specific communication addressing laypersons as well as people who are not fluent in German. One approach to address these aspects is a comprehensive booklet on COVID-19 vaccination which was jointly published only recently by the Federal Centre for Health Education and the Robert Koch-Institute and which is available in several languages (https:// www. bzga. de/ infom ateri alien/ impfu ngen-und-perso enlic her-infek tions-schutz/ 3537/ das-impfb uch-fuer-alle-1/). In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination. Betsch et al. confirm our findings by noting that even a short visit to a website with vaccine-skeptical content can influence the perception of vaccination risks and the willingness to get vaccinated. Consequently, perceived health risks from vaccination may increase and the intention to get vaccinated as well as perceived risks in case of non-vaccination may be reduced [24] . While the German government has recently introduced laws to address hate speech and misinformation in social media, the effectiveness and impact of these laws have yet to be evaluated. These findings emphasize the relevance of low-threshold, accessible, transparent and quality-controlled information on COVID-19 and vaccination. A low perceived benefit of the vaccination and a low subjective risk of getting COVID-19 can also be counteracted by providing laypersons with easily understandable and transparent information about the etiology as well as the course of the disease and possible sequelae of an infection such as Long-COVID.",

Still, because of the novelty of COVID-19, its tremendous impact on societies all over the world, the widespread use of mRNA vaccines as a new type of vaccines and discussions about mandatory vaccination as a strategy for the long-term management of the pandemic, further insights into individuals' perception about COVID-19 vaccines are warranted. The aforementioned strategies aiming to promote COVID-19 vaccination uptake need to be further strengthened and evaluated with regard to their effectiveness.

Instead, our study should be understood as an extension of previous findings by including the specific perspective of social media users. In addition, no socio-demographic data such as age or sex could be included in the analysis, as these were not available. We also restricted our search strategy to keywords identified in the posts. Future research could also include hashtags and other types of identifiers to increase the comprehensiveness of the extracted information [36] . Furthermore, it should be taken into account that our focus was only placed on three frequently used social networks. We also could not examine changes in attitudes and perceptions over time due to the high number of users with only single posts related to vaccine hesitancy. Finally, when interpreting and comparing our findings to other studies, it is important to keep in mind that only posts from the period January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021 were included in our analysis. COVID-19 vaccination has been available in Germany since December 2020.

Accordingly, vaccination services should be offered at the lowest perceived cost possible, so that the personal cost-benefit assessment is in favor of COVID-19 vaccination. Consequently, vaccination must be easily accessible and without much bureaucratic effort in order to promote the willingness to be vaccinated. For example, the 47th wave of the COSMO COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring recommends a focus on vaccination in the workplace and in the educational sector [37] . In addition, target group-specific education about the disease and its long-term consequences could promote vaccination readiness and acceptance. Education about the importance and benefits of vaccination, such as protection against severe courses of the disease, protection of others and gradual return to normality, can also have a positive impact on vaccination attitudes [37] . Further studies of diverse groups of people and minorities in Germany are recommended in order to also reach those who avoid the topic of COVID-19 and the corresponding vaccination. The findings regarding the reasons for rejection can be used as a basis for future decisions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for possible future crises to address the build-up of mistrust and the generation of misinformation with appropriate counter measures. In this respect, also the information on vaccination should generally be made available in several languages to address the spread of misinformation.",
