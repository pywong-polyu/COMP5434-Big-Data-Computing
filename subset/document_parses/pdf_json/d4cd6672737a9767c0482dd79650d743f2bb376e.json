Targeting the nucleoprotein N of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in order to inhibit its association with viral RNA could be a strategy to impeding viral replication and possibly other essential functions associated with viral N. The antiviral properties of naproxen, belonging to the NSAID family, previously demonstrated against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV2 was shown by molecular modeling. In VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, naproxen inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2 induceddamage. The benefit of naproxen addition to the standard of care is tested in an on-going clinical study.",

In that context, drug repurposing is a priority.

Viral nucleoproteins are unique to the virus and no equivalent of these proteins are found in the host cell, which makes them attractive targets for potential antivirals [12] [13] . Moreover, the viral nucleoprotein is an important diagnostic marker of infection with SARS-COV and /or Influenza A [14] [15] . SARS-CoV-1 virions contains multiple copies of the N protein (ca 1000 copies) located inside the particle, thus N is one of the most abundant structural proteins in CoVs 16 . Through its interaction with the coronavirus membrane (M) protein, the N protein drives virus assembly and budding. N binds to the long viral RNA genome to form a virion core comprising a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that assumes a long helical structure. The RNP is important for replication and transcription in which the N protein also plays a critical role. Interactions between N and the non-structural protein-3 are also important for replication. In addition to its role in different aspects of the viral cycle, the N protein not only highjacks cellular processes, including the progression of the host cell cycle and apoptosis, but also modulates the immune response, by for example inhibiting the interferon response 17 .",

This contrast with the nucleoprotein of Influenza A virus which has a single aromatic residue (Y148) within its RNA binding groove in which naproxen ( Figure 1J ) was shown to bind, making electrostatic (blue arrow) and hydrophobic interactions (red arrow) with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C-terminal domain (Sup. Figure 1E , F. Naproxen stabilized this \"non -natural\" interface as found in the crystal structure for the designed ligands by Hou et al 13 . Figures 1L, O and M, P and Sup. Figure 1H , E indeed show that naproxen can also bind at this interface in both MERS-CoV and SARS-Cov-2, respectively, but an additional binding site in SARS-CoV-2 monomer was also identified (Sup. Figure 1F ). Supplementary Figure   1A -D shows that naproxen binds at the interface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of N proteins, to account for the hydrophobic interactions of its aromatic core with usually aromatic residues (\uf070 -stacking) and methyl group of the methoxy group with hydrophobic apolar residues and polar and/or electrostatic interactions via its carboxylate moiety. Accordingly, the following order of free binding energies of ",

This reduction in viral titers correlated with naproxen inducing a protective effect of the bronchial epithelium integrity, as shown by Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), considered as a surrogate of epithelium integrity. TEER values in both naproxen groups were comparable to those of the uninfected and untreated control (Fig. 2C , lower panel) and significantly higher than those of the untreated control (Fig. 2C , lower panel). The antiviral effects of naproxen in reconstituted human bronchial epithelium are consistent with the IC50 value determined in Vero E6 cells. However, the lack of antiviral effect of naproxen on nasal epithelium is puzzling. The viral load is usually lower in the nasal cavity as compared to the lungs 16, 24 . The nasal epithelium is an important portal for initial infection, and may serve as a key reservoir for viral spread across the respiratory mucosa and an important locus mediating viral transmission. The number of host cells as pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages permissive to viral entry is higher in the lungs than the mucous cells in the nasal cavity. Moreover, recent interactome analysis support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially hijacks host proteins available in lung tissue, and N targets stress granule protein G3BP1, an essential antiviral protein which is known to induce innate immune response 7 .",

Using this model, this differential antiviral effect between airway sites was observed for naproxen in this work and for remdesivir in a recent report that indicates an antiviral effect mainly observed in the lower respiratory tract of non-Human primates 23 . It is interesting to note that naproxen is found very protective against viral-induced damages at 48 h post-infection in the reconstituted bronchial epithelium ( Figure 2C and Figure 4 in 23 ) . Therefore, we speculate that the lack of naproxen effect in nasal epithelium as opposed to its antiviral effect in pulmonary epithelium could be associated with differential expression or activity of host factor(s), and/or with slower replication kinetics in the nasal vs pulmonary epithelia.

This is exactly what is observed in SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1K, N and supplementaryFigure 1C-K). The recently published structure of MERS-CoV N terminal domain and the SARS-Cov-2 N-terminal domain were crystallized as a dimer of dimer, which offers a potential site for naproxen at the interface of the dimer 13 in addition to a binding site on one monomer of the protein. These two sites are shown in Sup.",

This suggests a similar affinity of naproxen for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, similar or slightly lower affinities of naproxen for SARS-CoV-2 than naproxen affinity for Influenza A virus based on a free energy calculation of (\uf044G= -30 Kcal/mol). Taking together, this work suggests naproxen binding in the N-terminal domains of SARS-CoV-2 N protein and likely to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV N in similar binding modes. It is likely that this binding would impede viral RNA binding to N as naproxen binding sites on the N-terminal domain of N are found in the RNA binding groove. Competing with N binding to RNA would repress replication and decrease the level of RNA produced by the virus. The experimental quantification of the viral RNA by RT-qPCR tests this hypothesis in the below antiviral assays.",

Their corresponding selectivity index were 17, 129 and 89, respectively and CC50 values found to be 36 \u00b5M and in the > 100 \u00b5M range. Here, the selectivity index determined for naproxen for SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells is SI > (19 \u00b1 3) \u00b5M.The IC50 of naproxen for SARS-CoV2 compares well to IC50 = (25 \u00b1 7) \u00b5M and SI = 64 of naproxen determined for Influenza A at the same MOI = 10 -2 . These values are consistent with the determination of the free energies of naproxen binding to N. We cannot exclude additional putative naproxen binding sites of naproxen in the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 or in the unstructured serine-rich domain that could enable naproxen to further interfere with N functions. In addition to the antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrated here, naproxen also exhibited antiviral properties in cellular and rodent models of Influenza A and B6,10, 26  . Naproxen also inhibited the replication of the unrelated Zika virus 27 . Therefore, from three unrelated single-stranded RNA virus, we suggest that naproxen could present broad-spectrum antiviral properties. Moreover, the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection when compared to oseltamivir alone in a phase IIB/III clinical trial 11 .Conclusion:We suggest in this study that one of the NSAIDs, naproxen, has a direct antiviral activity on SARS-CoV2 byits effect on the nucleoprotein-mediated replication and possibly via other functions of N, as inhibition of interferon 17 . Indeed, the cellular assays demonstrated subsequent inhibition of viral replication by naproxen, with recovery of intact pulmonary epithelium protected from the pandemic virus. These very encouraging results prompted us to test in a clinical trial, named ENACOVID, the effect of addition of naproxen on the standard of care in severely-ill patients.

Experimental: Modeling: The following X-ray structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have been used: N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 : 6VYO 20 , SARS-CoV-1: 1SSK 21 , MERS-CoV: 6KL2/ 6KL5 13 ; The Influenza A nucleoprotein PDB 2IQH was used as a comparison 28 . The binding protocol and subsequent MD are described in the Supplementary data. Material: Naproxen was purchased from Sigma (reference N5160) Virus: All experiments involving the manipulation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, using appropriate protocols.

Electronegative potentials are colored red while electropositive potentials are colored blue. A large electropositive cleft is visible on each protein, pointed with a green arrow; it maps the putative RNA interaction sites. (E.F.G.H.) Main chains flexibilities are approximated as crystallographic b-factors, with main chain ribbon diameter proportional to b-factor value; red is highest b-factor while blue is lowest b-factor. Most mobile elements are identified by a red asterisk (*); they group on one external side of the protein, facing solvent. Mobile elements of highest bfactors are proximal to electropositive surfaces, supporting an interaction scenario where (1) RNA docks onto an electro-complementary surface before (2) the protein conformation is induced into the N-RNA complex of highest stability.

            "text": "The binding mode of naproxen for the protein structures was assessed in a two-step protocol. First, the binding site was defined by blind docking to the whole protein using the docking program AutoDock Vina 34 . The docking space was defined visually in order to encompass the proteic model with a 2 \u00c5 margin at least as a tetragonal box. Three replicas with the default scoring function Vina 29 were performed to check the convergence of the experiment. The relevance of the binding sites identified by blind docking was confirmed by the cavity detection algorithm of Discovery Studio version 2020, which detected similar sites. A site-docking was then performed using Libdock with energy minimization using smart minimizer (Discovery Studio version 2020) to more precisely identify the naproxen binding mode. In this docking, three replicas were also applied but on a restricted space, encompassing the cavity where the ligand was blind docked. For each protein, the most representative pose of naproxen (i.e. the pose more often found) was selected. The resulting protein-NP complexes were finally refined by a molecular dynamics simulation using the CHARMm force field35  and the standard dynamic cascade protocol of Discovery studio version 2020. The free energies of naproxen binding to the various structures were evaluated using implicit Distance-dependent dielectrics solvent model found in Discovery Studio version 2020. Dose-response antiviral evaluation in Vero E6 cells Multi-well 6 plates were seeded with VeroE6 cells 24 h before infection (day -1). On day 0, 90%-confluent wells were washed twice with PBS and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. One hour after infection, the inoculum was removed and cells were subsequently treated with the indicated dilutions of naproxen in DMEM. DMEM was used as mock-treatment control. Plates were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hpi and stored at -80 \u00b0C for viral RNA extraction with the QiAmp viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) and titration by RT-qPCR as described elsewhere 21 . Drug 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and selectivity index (SI) values were calculated using the Quest Graph IC50 calculator (AAT Bioquest). Evaluation of antiviral activity in reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE) MucilAir TM reconstituted HAE were obtained from Epithelix SARL (Geneva, Switzerland) and maintained in air-liquid interphase with specific culture medium in Costar Transwell inserts (Corning, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After two washes with warm OptiMEM medium (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific), apical poles were inoculated with a 150 \u03bcl dilution of virus in OptiMEM medium at a MOI of 0.1. OptiMEM was used as mock-infection control. One hour after viral infection, MucilAir TM culture medium containing or not (untreated) specific dilutions of naproxen in were applied through the basolateral poles. Treatments were repeated at 24 hpi. At 48 hpi, HAE cells were harvested in RLT buffer (Qiagen) and total ARN was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent titration by RT-qPCR. Variations in transepithelial electrical resistance (\u0394 TEER) were measured using a dedicated volt-ohm meter (EVOM2, Epithelial Volt/Ohm Meter for TEER) and expressed as Ohm/cm 2 .
