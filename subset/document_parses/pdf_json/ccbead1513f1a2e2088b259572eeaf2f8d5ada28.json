This paper discusses questions as to whether and under what conditions government-ordered or privately claimed compulsory licensing can contribute to controlling the pandemic. The existing obstacles and conflicts under the current legal framework, such as a lack of international harmonization and a lack of coherence between patent law (compulsory licensing) and pharmaceutical law (data protection), are outlined and discussed. A possible solution could lie in a modernization of relevant legal provisions to create an internationally harmonized balance between the public interest in using important patents in the present and in future emergency situations and the interest of patent owners and data and market exclusivity holders in allowing exemptions within clearly defined limits. The article concludes with a discussion of conditions that may influence possible solutions.",

For instance, in Germany, the 'Act on the Protection of the Population in the Event of an Epidemic Situation of National Importance' (hereinafter 'Epidemic Protection Act') of 27 March 2020 opened the possibility of limiting the owner's exclusive use of a patent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Epidemic Protection Act supplements and concretizes the already existing 'Act on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in Humans' (hereinafter 'Infection Protection Act'), under which the Ministry of Health is authorized to issue use orders for certain patents under Sec. 13 of the German Patent Act ('government use'). The Federal Ministry of Health itself or a subordinate authority commissioned by the Ministry may take measures or commission third parties to do so in order to ensure the supply of medicinal products as well as active ingredients, starting materials and excipients therefor, medical devices, laboratory diagnostics and auxiliary agents (Sec. 5(2) No. 4 Infection Protection Act). In Sec. 5(2) No. 5, the government use is referred to these products mentioned in No. 4.",

There is no doubt that an enormous demand exists for medicines against COVID-19 -above all for vaccines that have already been approved or will be approved in the foreseeable future. Especially during the Corona pandemic, patent law has been in the focus of research-based biotech and pharmaceutical companies as an incentive and as a way of protecting investments through exclusive rights, on the one hand, and as a possible hindrance to access to affordable medicine due to existing patents on the other hand. 1 Tensions and international pressure for the 'abolition of certain IP rights' have increased. 2 In view of the ongoing discussion across a wide area of tension, i.e. between general, vague criticism of vaccine manufacturers, political constraints and the legal framework, this article will shed light on the background, identify weaknesses in the current legal system with an international dimension and discuss possible solutions to the currently existing fragmentation and lack of coherence by applying objective criteria for international harmonization.",

A substance patent claims the product as such, i.e. providing absolute protection independent of the use of the substance. This means that Gilead can in principle make exclusive use of any application of the substance, for example for the purpose of COVID-19 treatment. If the Chinese patent specifically targeting COVID-19 treatment is granted, however, a situation of mutual blocking may arise due to the dependency: 19 Gilead, as the owner of the substance patent, could exclude the exploitation of the Chinese indication patent; whereas the Chinese owner, if and insofar as its use patent was granted in the given country, could prevent Gilead from using Remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment in that country. A way out could be found with the help of cross-licensing; this, however, remains subject to successful negotiations and agreements between the concerned parties. But even in such situations, legislative possibilities can be used if necessary, such as para. 2 of Sec. 24 Patent Act in Germany: the granting of a compulsory license to a license seeker is facilitated if the patent holder cannot use its younger invention without infringing the older patent; whereas a compulsory license normally requires the license seeker to prove a public interest, which is difficult to establish, it is then sufficient for the owner of the younger dependent patent to demonstrate an 'important technical progress of considerable economic significance'.",

Further, specific to the U.S., U.S. Code 28 \u00a7 1498, which dates back to wartime emergency laws, permits exemption from patent infringement when required by the state. Historically, \u00a7 1498 has only been exercised to force price reductions for drugs to which there is no alternative in emergency situations, as once in 2001 at the time of the anthrax attacks. There are currently no plans for compulsory licensing legislation specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.however, refer to note 51 citing the U.S. Defense Production Act. 6 Under s 104 of the Israeli Patent Law, the patentee is even barred from appealing this order. 7 art 71 Brazil Patent Act. 19 This scenario only applies to countries where second medical use patents -or as in the case of EP patents 'medical use-limited product claims'are allowed.",

Ultimately, by way of the compulsory license, the price was lowered from an originally approximately four-fold amount to the same level as internationally available -against the patentee -who strongly criticized the compulsory license order. The U.S. government also invoked warning statements. 23 The case also illustrates potential problems if an appropriate negotiation solution cannot be reached: without full information about the product, the local producer was forced to redevelop it by reverse engineering and to acquire part of the active ingredient from a foreign generic company.",

The user operating without an agreement with the inventor/applicant would risk having his compulsory license application ultimately rejected by the court and having to stop further development. This situation does not create incentives for third parties. It is rather demotivating in view of the fact that the development of an active drug, even more so in the case of a vaccine, is time and resource consuming. It is therefore unlikely that a third-party developer, without having reached an agreement with the applicant, would take the risk of a claim for injunctive relief if the third parties' claim for a compulsory license eventually fails. On the other hand there is possibly only a vague hope or prospect that the critical requirement of proving 'public interest' might eventually be acknowledged in (possibly time-consuming) court proceedings. The motivation is further diminished by the fact that the user could at best acquire a non-exclusive license. Both in the case of a governmental use order and in the case of a compulsory license, the patent owner and other entitled parties, like already affiliated licensees, retain their rights of use. Further, in the case of a government order, the use must be solely for the intended purpose, i.e. for the purpose of public welfare.

Although relevant countries have corresponding national legal norms, there is a lack of international harmonization. On an international scale, a compulsory license obtained in one country is of limited use. Reasonable exploitation is therefore hampered by the need to obtain compulsory licenses separately in each individual country where parallel patents of interest exist. For instance, while a European patent of interest will be granted centrally by the European Patent Office, compulsory licensing needs to be pursued in each EP member state where the patent is valid, based on respective national laws and procedures. However, successful COVID-19 therapy needs unrestricted international application. Without internationally harmonized efforts, it would make little sense for the use of patented inventions to be mandated or approved for use in some countries but not in others. Such an uncoordinated fragmentation of compulsory rights allocation is detrimental to the meaningful development of a COVID-19 medicament. The development of a medicament is expensive, and probably no company or investor will afford risking an expensive development if in the end the marketed territory could be limited to a single or a few countries only and be denied in other countries.",

Factual requirement criteria: Public interest, alternatives, know-how and manufacturing capacity Compulsory patent licenses, regardless of whether granted by government order or by private claim, represent a significant encroachment on the property right protected by the respective national constitutions. For this reason, the use of such licenses has been extremely rare in the past. 28 In the draft law on the Epidemic Protection Act recently introducing Sec. 5(2) No. 5 in Germany, it was clarified that the effect of the patent can be restricted pursuant to Sec. 13 Patent Act in order to ensure the supply of products in the event of a crisis and, for example, to be able to manufacture vital actives or medicines. 29 The requirement of a public interest in the case of a private law claim for a compulsory license must be assessed by weighing all circumstances relevant in the individual case and the mutual interests. The license seeker must personally be in a position to want to use the invention commercially, but also to be capable of using it. 30 And it is precisely this 'ability' that can pose a problem in the case of complex vaccine developments. The license seekerand in this respect also the person entitled under government use -must want to and be able to use the invention from a technical point of view; the fact that he merely wants to distribute (not manufacture or import) objects made according to the invention is not sufficient. This problem will likely not arise in the future in the case of classical active substances, but it will arise in the case of vaccines with their complex technical manufacturing steps.",

In Europe, marketing authorization procedures are not governed by the Patent Act, but by a lex specialis specifically provided for this purpose -in Germany, the Arzneimittelgesetz (hereinafter 'Medicines Act'). If a COVID-19 medicament has already been approved, it would be in the public interest to use the clinical data already available by means of a more rapid generic approval. 37 However, in Europe the first owner of the market approval is entitled to 10 years of data protection according to the '8 \u00fe 2' rule. 38 That the prior data protection holder can be judicially obligated ('sentenced') to agree to the use of the data can be denied. Neither the Medicines Act nor the Patent Act are, in their current form, likely to provide a legal basis for this. 39 There is no The prerequisite is that the generic medicinal product has the same composition in terms of type and quantity and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product. The applicant only has to prove the bioequivalence of the generic drug by appropriate bioavailability studies. 38 cf the German provision in s 24b (1) Medicines Act: 8 years of data exclusivity, 2 years of market exclusivity since initial approval; market exclusivity may be extended for an additional year if approval of a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit is granted within the initial 8-year period. 39 The lack of coherence of compulsory licensing on the one hand and data exclusivity on the other hand in Europe has already been discussed elsewhere, mainly motivating the use of compulsory licensing for price regulation, see legal link between the data protection and a compulsory license under patent law. Also, the owner of the initial market approval and the patent owner of the corresponding patent-protected invention may personally be different parties. From these considerations it becomes apparent that data protection under pharmaceutical law represents a further barrier to a possible compulsory use by third parties. Indeed, in 2016 the issuance of a compulsory license was considered by the government of Romania for the hepatitis C medicine sofosbuvir, but could not be pursued because EU data exclusivity would expire only in 2024. This is in agreement with the position of the European Commission, which, in a response to an inquiry seeking clarification on whether data exclusivity would apply in case of an emergency compulsory license for the flu medicine Tamiflu within the European Union, acknowledged that 'the Community pharmaceutical acquis does not currently contain any provision allowing a waiver of the rules on data exclusivity and marketing protection periods'. 40 This problem should therefore not be overlooked when calling for compulsory licenses for pandemic control.",

Substantial uncertainties are likely to arise on the issue of the justification for a compulsory license, particularly in the area of COVID-19 vaccines. At present, it is unlikely that there is a shortage of alternatives, and meeting demand is more likely to be a problem of manufacturing, supply capacity and complex supply chains. Without agreement with and expertise from the originator, compulsory measures are unlikely to help. Patent stacking, which can be found in the field of vaccines, and above all the collision with data protection under pharmaceutical law represent further obstacles. Against this background and without further safeguards -such as prior agreement with the originator or the marketing authorization holder -a third party interested in compulsory use is unlikely to expose itself to the risk of having invested, in the end to no avail, the considerable costs and resources required.",

Patents can be contributed to this MPP, which allows third parties -optionally under agreement of license payments -to test and develop already patented active substances for efficacy against COVID-19. Another movement is for right holders to voluntarily surrender or offer to license IP rights, so-called 'Voluntary Pledges'. 43 However, despite all the good will and reputation enhancement of the donating companies and academic institutions, it is obvious that these IP rights are at best tools and approaches with uncertain expectations of efficacy.

On the one hand, there is the lack of international harmonization in Europe and elsewhere to determine compulsory uses or licenses uniformly in a single procedure.

These should include a fair financial reward for the originator when its patented invention under compulsory use contributes to people's health and society's benefit. As noted, the originator's costs for conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials and for obtaining market approval could be reimbursed: in case of a waiver or inapplicability of the 8 \u00fe 2 rule, cost sharing and/or adequate remuneration could be based on audit calculations of the real expenditure. 48 On the other hand, for the government use or compulsory licensing as such, it is questionable whether the risk of non-profit rulings can provide an acceptable motivation for substantial investments into anti-pandemic research from the outset, especially if a classical, easier-to-use active drug compound is at stake. A careful (re)consideration of proposals for remuneration in case of non-voluntary use of patents in the medical field, which have been provided by the WHO/ UNDP, 49 is warranted. This should not exclude a consideration of profitable rewards for the originator in compensation of a government use or compulsory licensing of its patented invention. Justification of profit-based remuneration in case of non-voluntary use of patents is reasoned by mitigating public health risks and avoiding (further) economic damages by the provision of groundbreaking innovations against a fundamental crisis. As can be seen in the current COVID-19 pandemic, even if only the cost aspect is to be considered, the economic damage to be recovered is immense, and therefore the public could afford financial support for the recovery of a functioning economy with the help of a patented innovation concerned.
