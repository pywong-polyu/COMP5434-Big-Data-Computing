However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood 1,5-7 . We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states-containment and outbreak 8 . These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number 2,9-11 . Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination 12-15 . As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries 16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points 17 .",

These interventions involve case isolation, contact tracing, testing and quarantine, reduction in the number of contacts by social distancing, and behavioural changes oriented to reduce transmission-e.g., mask use and spatial distancing 2,10,18 . As a general rule, both observed dynamics and model projections indicate that the implementation of strong interventions significantly reduced the total number of infections compared with uncontained outbreaks 2, 3, 6, 7, 19, 20 . The effectiveness of NPIs may consequently determine two alternative states: one of disease containment (R e <1) and another of disease outbreak (R e >1) 2,9-11 . However, these two states were observed among regions with similar strengths of NPIs and through time in countries, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms guiding the impact of NPIs in COVID-19 dynamics 1,4-7 .",

This feedback loop connects the saturation of NPIs with the Allee effect, a central concept in population biology that explains the fate of several populations at low numbers 12, 13 . Indeed, the Allee effect involves a positive feedback between population abundance and population growth rate, which may determine a transition from a negative to a positive growth rate at a given abundance threshold 12, 13 . In disease dynamics, this is interpreted as an epidemic breakpoint, a tipping point below which the outbreak tends to diminish (R e <1), but above which the outbreak grows (R e >1) 8 . However, this phenomenon is not captured in the many variants of SIR and logistic models widely used for the analysis and forecasting of COVID-19 dynamics 2, 3, 6, 7, 19, 23 . Here we aim to fill this gap, formalizing the connection between saturating NPIs and disease dynamics. We show how the saturation of NPIs induce a positive feedback in disease dynamics, from which abrupt transitions in spread rate are expected after a threshold in the number of infected individuals is crossed. Finally, we look for traces of this footprint in actual data from the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, as observed in COVID-19, sub-exponential dynamics grow linearly with the logarithm of time 7 , as described by the relationship log(Ct)=\u00b5\u00b7log(t). We use this time scale to visualize our simulations, where the parameter \u00b5 describes the disease dynamics. The SIR model without the NPI-Allee effect presents a consistent trend with minor changes fueled by the stochastic effects of imported cases and super spread events (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Figs. 1) . On the other hand, when the NPI-Allee effect is considered, we observe a qualitative transition in the dynamics: from a slow rate of case accumulation to a markedly larger one, suggesting that these random events may determine the surpass of a tipping point from containment to outbreak. We fitted a segmented regression to examine the differences in dynamics with and without NPI-Allee effect (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig 1) . Both simulations present breaking points and may look similar when this point is rapidly reached. In order to further explore their difference, we plotted the relative increment of the slope after the breaking point (\u00b52/\u00b51) as a function of the initial slope (\u00b51) for both kinds of simulations ( Fig. 2a and 2c) .

Similarly, the relaxation of NPIs has to be done in attention to the epidemic threshold for avoiding outbreak resurgence. The idea of relaxing interventions and then returning them to former levels if the number of infected individuals increases may be futile after the tipping point. NPIs may be relaxed cautiously following the decrease in the number of infections with attention to potential tipping points (Fig.1d) , a context where early warning indicators become crucial. These indicators were related to systems resilience and increased trajectory variance 17 , but more specific indicators for diseases under NPIs management are probably required. For example, in a contained state of the disease, the fraction of reported infections with no epidemiological link (not detected by the tracing system), and the time between individual exposure and quarantine should decrease through time. A systematic increase in these indicators may be an adequate early warning signal that containment could be compromised.",

Based again on the relationship log(Ct)=\u00b5\u00b7log(t), we fitted a segmented regression and contrasted its performance with a linear fit without a breaking point. Almost all of the observed dynamics were better described by a segmented relationship, suggesting that breaking points are a common phenomenon in COVID-19 dynamics (Fig. 2; Extended Data Figs. 2, 3, and 4). Further, the segmented model provides an excellent description of the dynamics of cumulative cases of Covid-19, with an average R 2 of 0.99 across U.S. counties and countries (Extended Data",
