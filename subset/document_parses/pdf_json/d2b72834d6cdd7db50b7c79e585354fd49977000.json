Government space agencies as well as private space sectors are extensively endeavouring for a better space enterprise. Focusing on the inspiration to reach Mars by robotic satellite, we have interpreted some of the significant mission parameters like proportionality of mission attempts, efficiency and reliability of Mars probes, Impact and Impact Factor of mass on mission duration, Time lag between consecutive mission attempts, interpretation of probe life and transitional region employing various mathematical analysis. And we have discussed the importance of these parameters for a prospective mission accomplishment. Our novelty in this paper is we have found a deep relation describing that the probe mass adversely affects the mission duration. Applying this relation, we also interpreted the duration of probe life expectancy for upcoming missions.",

Additionally, the duration for the operational probe is considered from the date of launch to the date of operation as of 1st May 2020 of this current calendar year. The data gathered were plotted against the period from the 1960s to the 2020s and various mathematical techniques (Linear, Logarithmic, and Polynomial Regression Analysis) were performed to show predictive trend curves for all parameters. We also have interpreted the probe life expectancy curve that is capable of determining the lifespan of upcoming probes with respect to their mass.

Polynomial regression analysis and curve fitting method were executed against these ratios to obtain fine curves shown in Fig.1 .

In this region, the probes start to decay after either accomplishing its mission target or losing its function. Similarly, the region below the duration curve is the active region where the probe starts its mission, accomplishes the goal, shows greater performance, and the incapability of functioning well. Performing various mathematical interpretation techniques, we obtained 2 line, 3 power, 3 polynomials, and 13 logarithmic regression equations shown in table-2. And its plotted graphs were shown in appropriate sections. From overall observations, the relationship of the impact factor and impact of mass on mission duration greatly promises for a durable mission. The interpreted duration for future missions from this analysis is uncertain in data accuracy. However, we can roughly approximate the duration. The essential step is to reduce the probe mass and the probe masses ranging between 200 kilograms to 1000 kilograms suit best for the mission reliability. Then coming to the transitional region graph shown in Fig.8 , the degradation line is supposed to be above the duration curve, it is because the resultant curve obtained shows the progression of mission duration over years from the regression analysis. So, it ultimately suppresses the degradation curve to lie under the duration curve. Further the efficiency we estimated as per the acquired data is tentative and can vary from probe to probe. Because the exact efficiency can be counted as per the data and results returned by the probe either from orbit or the planetary surface (On Mars) to the ground (On Earth). Moreover, the reliability of the mission is assessed based on the number of degradation and duration. It is supposed to be considered depending on the rate of physical tolerance (space environmental factors) and the internal maintenance of components (efficient feasibility of technological components and circuitries).",
