KEYWORDS: hyperspectral imaging, SARS-CoV-2, antisense oligonucleotides, hafnium, dark-field microscopy E arly identification of infectious diseases is critical in alleviating the transmission of disease by increasing selfisolation and timely care. When COVID-19 exploded onto the global stage in December 2019, public health authorities first deployed measures that were used to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, including symptom-based case identification and eventual isolation and quarantine monitoring. 1\u22123 This preliminary strategy was justified by several correlations between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 causative virus SARS-CoV-2, including strong genetic correlation, transmission mainly by respiratory droplets, and the occurrence of lower respiratory symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath of both infections emerging within 5 days of exposure. 1, 4 However, amid the deployment of identical control measures, the trajectories of the two epidemics have shifted drastically in different directions. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people in one year and continues to spread rapidly across the world. 5 One of the other reasons for the virulent spread of COVID-19 is its closeness with the influenza virus regarding its clinical presentation, transmission mechanism, and seasonal coincidence. 6 Since both are respiratory viruses, they can have a variety of overlapping symptoms. While certain symptoms are slightly more connected with one virus than the other, a clinical decision cannot be made based on the symptoms to rule in or out either illness. A biosensor is therefore urgently required to selectively detect and distinguish COVID-19 and influenza viruses.",

            "text": "The crucial factor in the rapid transmission of COVID-19 is the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract, even among both asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients. 7, 8 For example, SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) peaks at 0.7 day before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission occurs early in the process of infection. 9, 10 Additionally, the VL kinetics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 as well as VL between asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic COVID-19 patients have no reported differences. 11, 12 The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that about 16% of individuals with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and can spread coronavirus, although other statistics suggest that 40% of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is attributed to carriers with no signs of the disease. 13 In contrast, people with asymptomatic cases of influenza typically have lower quantitative VL of secretions from the upper respiratory tract than from the lower respiratory tract and a shorter length of viral secretion than those with symptoms. 14\u221216 Therefore, the asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the Achilles' heel of the currently deployed public health strategies to mitigate this pandemic, and hence an ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 biosensor is an immediate requirement for the classification among asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. 1, 17 Currently, most screening techniques require sampling of body fluids such as nasal fluid, saliva, or blood, followed by nucleic acid-based testing to identify active infections or bloodbased serological identification of past infections. Although they are highly sensitive, nucleic acid-based diagnostics may require samples gathered several days postexposure for unambiguous positive detection. 18 For example, in most individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, the most used and reliable test for diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, where the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab as measured by the cycle threshold (Ct) becomes detectable as early as day 1 of symptoms and peaks within the first week of symptom onset. 18 Moreover, a \"positive\" PCR outcome indicates only the identification of viral RNA and does not generally mean that a viable virus is present. 18 This could potentially lead to missed asymptomatic cases. Therefore, the ability to perform practical real-time COVID-19 screening is extremely crucial in assessing the risk and monitoring pathogen presence in the community.",

We have utilized herein a hyperspectralbased nanoimaging technique (HyperSENSE) for rapid multiplex detection and to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that has gained a lot of attention in the past decade from both the academic and industrial world due to its capability of providing spatial and physicochemical information on the investigated species. 19\u221223 The hyperspectral microscopes can capture images that contain one full spectrum of the reflected light in each pixel of the image, identifying the spectral response of the nanoparticles and confirming their presence and the way they interact with biological samples. In this study, we used hyperspectral imaging in combination with microscopy to examine the unique scattering signature spectra of molecularly targeted nanoprobes. We hypothesized that the spectra attained from nanoprobes will be highly specific for the metals used for derivation of the nanoparticles and can be potentially used to indicate hybridization or binding events. Due to the differences in sample scattering, it will be also feasible to differentiate the nanoprobes when individual pixels are selected in an area of interest from pixels where the probes will be interacting with the viral nucleic acid.",

In this work, a hyperspectral imaging technique based on the scattering of light was used for the estimation of the viral RNA concentration. The goal of this study was to propose a hyperspectral imaging-based technique for biosensing. To the best of our knowledge, this is an unexplored area, and our study established here that a reflectance scattering-based system can successfully be used for detecting a very low level of viral nucleic acid in biological samples. Here we introduce a hyperspectral imaging-based platform that can be used to diagnose a multitude of diseases. The potential for the development of a point of care (POC)type device can easily be envisioned; however this was out of the scope of the current work.

            "text": "Design of Antisense Oligonucleotides for Targeting Pathogen's RNA. To selectively target the pathogen's RNA, we have chosen to design antisense oligonucleotides. These ASOs are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences that can specifically recognize and bind to their target complementary RNA strands. We designed a pair of ASOs that is highly specific and sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 N-gene (Supplementary Data 1). 17, 23 The methodology behind the design of ASOs has been mentioned in the Materials and Methods section. Briefly, the target binding energies and binding disruption energies were carefully compared to select the ASO sequences specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene. Further, to initiate nanoparticle aggregation in the presence of the target RNA, only the ASOs targeting closely following regions in their target sequence were selected. Separately, to expand the applicability of the current HyperSENSE system for the multiplex detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, we have also utilized two ASOs, 24, 25 which target the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A H1N1 virus. Table 1 shows the ASO sequences specific for SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A H1N1 which have been used throughout this study. Design, Synthesis, and Validation of Hyperspectral-Responsive Nanoprobes for the Selective Detection of Viral RNA. Hyperspectral-based imaging techniques possess the ability to capture spectral information for multiple wavelengths at each pixel in an image. 23, 26, 27 This capability offers the ability to discriminate, with precision, different nanomaterials and differentiate them from biological materials. 28, 29 Nanoparticles are an excellent candidate for sensor construction due to their photophysical properties. 23, 30 Our current sensor platform relies on one such important parameter, in which the aggregation among nanoparticles will induce a change in their light scattering. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is capable of identifying individual nanoparticles in pure suspensions and in the presence of biological samples by their intrinsic scattering spectra without the use of any additional labeling agent. The technique therefore will be ideal for detecting metallic nanoparticles with unique spectral scattering signatures and achieve highly sensitive nondestructive molecular detection. In this study, we investigated two types of nanoparticles for constructing the biosensor. Hafnium nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized to test their sensing performance. While AuNPs are widely used for biomedical and biosensing applications, 17,23,31\u221233 HfNPs remained unexplored, especially for sensing purposes.",

Initially, the target RNA sequences, ASO1-and ASO2-conjugated HfNPs and AuNPs, were energy minimized. The sequences considered for theoretical calculations are represented in Table S1 , and the corresponding energy-minimized structures are shown in Figure S1 . The ASO-conjugated nanoparticles were then docked with their target RNA sequences in Autodock 4.0 software, and the respective geometries are shown in Figure S2 . It was understood that the ASO1conjugated nanoparticles stabilized their target RNA sequences better than the ASO2-conjugated nanoparticles plausibly due to improved hydrogen bonding among the participating nucleotides. HfNPs ( Figure S3 ), ASO-conjugated HfNPs ( Figure S4 ), and AuNPs ( Figure S5 ) and the corresponding docked geometries were further considered for the calculation of HOMO and LUMO surface maps, and the energy gaps between them were calculated (Figure 1a\u2212d) . From the comparative HOMO\u2212LUMO surface energies, it has been found that the binding of ASO-conjugated nanoparticles with their complementary target RNA sequences leads to a decrease in band gap (Table 2) , and hence it has been anticipated that the binding would increase in absorption wavelength (Figure ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article S6), which might be followed by an increase in hyperspectral scattering.",

The ASOs are amino-modified at the 5\u2032 end in the case of HfNPs, while they are thiol-modified for AuNPs. The surface chemistry of the nanoparticles was suitably altered for the conjugation with ASOs, and the detailed protocol has been described in the Methods and Materials section. The performance of Hyper-SENSE was first investigated toward the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and for that, each of the HfNPs and AuNPs was conjugated to ASOs specific for SARS-CoV-2. Each particle has been conjugated differentially where AuNPs-P 1 and HfNPs-P 1 are the nanoparticles conjugated to ASO1 and AuNPs-P 2 and HfNPs-P 2 are the nanoparticles conjugated to ASO2, respectively. Equal amounts of the AuNPs-P 1 and AuNPs-P 2 were mixed to form the testing particles, AuNPs-P mix . The same was carried out to make a hafnium testing solution, HfNPs-P mix . The enhanced dark-field hyperspectral imaging (EDF-HSI) of the HfNPs-P mix ( Figure 1e ) and AuNPs-P mix (Figure 1f ) after the addition of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA reveals that HfNPs-P mix exhibits higher light scattering when compared to the corresponding AuNP derivative and, thus, better HSI response. Further, we found that HfNPs-P mix outperformed AuNPs-P mix in terms of the peak shift in the hyperspectral signal associated with the addition of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as shown in Figure 1g . The significant increase in the shift of the hyperspectral peak of HfNPs-P mix compared to AuNPs-P mix , which significantly corroborates with the theoretical findings, motivates us to utilize HfNPs as a sensing probe to construct the sensor platform.",

The strategy adopted for highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials using the HSI chip is depicted in Figure 2 . The chip consists of HfNPs conjugated to a selective antisense oligonucleotide (ssDNA probes), which recognizes the target sequence. The hybridization of the ssDNA probes with its complementary sequence causes the aggregation of the HfNPs, which can be detected by HSI. HSI is a sensitive technique that analyzes a wide spectrum of light to obtain information that is not available when imaging with primary colors (red, green, blue). A shift in the HSI peak can be observed due to the aggregation of nanoparticles and the formation of large entities of various sizes. Hyperspectral imaging of the HfNPs conjugated to the ssDNA probes (HfNPs-P mix ) has been recorded instantaneously upon addition of the test sample in order to obtain the sensor response of the tested sample ( Figure 2a ). The use of HfNPs serves the purpose of amplifying the HSI signal upon the hybridization of the ssDNA with its target. Next, in order to perform further analysis, the image is divided into numerous regions of interest. The HSI image of any specific spatial location represents a collection of hundreds of images at different wavelengths. Thus, each pixel has hundreds of intensities, which can be seen as a continuous spectrum of light ranging from the visible range to the near-infrared (NIR). The amount of target RNA present in the sample can be determined based on the shift in the hyperspectral peak ( Figure 2b ). The investigation of the HSI of HfNPs-ssDNA probes may therefore be beneficial in detecting the DNA/RNA hybridization events.",

            "text": "Construction of Each Component of the HyperSENSE Platform for SARS-CoV-2 Detection. Once the sensitivity of the HfNP-based probes has been validated, HfNPs were used to construct the sensor platform. First, we evaluated the stability of the HfNPs using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique under different conditions. Figure S7 depicts the hydrodynamic diameter of HfNPs in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), water, and viral transfer media (VTM). In addition to that, the stability of HfNPs was studied at two temperatures, i.e., 25 and 65\u00b0C. As evident from the results, the size of HfNPs did not significantly change among the three mediums. This confirms the stability of the HfNPs in different mediums, where no medium-induced aggregation was observed. Increasing the temperature from 25\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C does not show a significant effect on the size of the HfNPs, confirming the stability of the particles ( Figure S8 ). Based on our observation, the highest contrast in hyperspectral imaging is associated with the highest particle concentration. The concentration of 1 mg/mL was found to be the maximum that can be suspended in the solution without the formation of large aggregates; therefore we utilized this concentration for conducting our sensing studies. HfNPs were prepared and surface modified to have carboxylic acid moieties on the surface for their functionalization with ssDNA probes. ssDNA designed for SARS-CoV-2 detection was then conjugated to surface-modified HfNPs as shown in Figure 2c and Figure S9 , where HfNPs-P1 and HfNPs-P2 are the nanoparticles conjugated to ASO1 and ASO2, respectively. NMR spectra indicate the presence of pentose sugar (deoxyribose) protons; this proves the successful conjugation of ASOs with HfNPs ( Figure S10 ). We hypothesized that in the presence of the target sequence the hybridization of the ssDNA probes leads to the aggregation of the HfNPs, which can be detected using ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article HSI (Figure 2d ). The HfNPs/ssDNA ratio plays a significant role in the sensitivity and the sensor response. Thus, to evaluate the effect of the ssDNA concentration on the sensor performance and to find the optimum HfNPs/ssDNA ratio, Figure 3 . Computational analysis of HyperSENSE to find the predominant spectral signature and its workflow. (a) The hyperspectral imaging will be captured of the sample mixed with HfNPs-P mix . (b) Region of interest (ROI) including the particle clusters will be used to generate the spectral library. (c) Spectral angular mapping (SAM) algorithm will be used to map the spectral library and define the spectral signature location using a color code. (d) Zoomed-in image of (c) where the spectral signature represented by the green color is predominant in this image. Thus, the ROI (containing the green color) will be used to obtain the HyperSENSE spectral output. (e) The obtained hyperspectral image from the selected region of the predominant color. The peak shift with respect to the HfNPs-P mix spectrum will be used for COVID-19 diagnosis and viral load detection. ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article two different concentrations of the ssDNA probes (i.e., ASO1 and ASO2) have been investigated, low-density and highdensity probes. Figure 2e depicts the shift in the hyperspectral peak of the two HfNP systems upon the addition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Although a high density of ssDNA conjugated to particles means a higher aggregation response, the shift in the HSI peak does not follow the same trend. We found that a low ssDNA probe density exhibits the maximum change in the HSI peak, whereas the particles with a high probe density exhibit the highest scattering intensity. The nanoparticles with a high probe density exhibit a high light scattering in which the signal captured using HSI leads to detector saturation and also exhibited a low change in the hyperspectral peak as a response to the target RNA compared to the low probe density. Thus, we use the HfNPs with a low density of ssDNA probes to construct the sensor array. Computational Analysis. The computational analysis of the captured images involves the following steps as explained in Figure 3a \u2212e. First, a representative spectral library from the collected images was assembled. These images will comprise a collection of the spectra presented in the captured image. Second, the spectral angular mapping (SAM) algorithm was applied to generate the hyperspectral mapping image by assigning each pixel in the image to its reference spectrum. SAM is a powerful algorithm used to determine the spectral similarity between two spectra and match the pixel to the reference spectrum. SAM calculates the angle between the two spectra (i.e., the reference spectrum and the spectrum in a certain pixel) by treating each of them as a vector. The equation for calculating the spectral angle is given by where n is the number of bands, t is the pixel spectrum, and r is the reference spectrum. Thus, it compares the angle between the reference spectrum vector and the spectrum vector at each pixel in the image. The closest match to the reference spectrum is associated with the smaller angle, whereas an angle higher than the set threshold represents an unclassified pixel. Each color represents one spectrum, and pixels with the same color have the same spectrum or their spectra are closely matching ( Figure S11 ). Next, the dominant spectrum that has the highest distribution percentage among the image pixels will be ",

The reference spectra used as input for the SAM algorithm are shown in Figure S11c . The color codes are shown in Figure S11d . The variation in the spectrum found in the image during the mapping presumably is attributed to the heterogeneity of formed clusters when bonded to the target RNA. Several clusters with various sizes and nanoparticulate contents may form because the ASOs are covering the surface of the HfNPs, and this may lead to variation in the hyperspectral signal. However, this variation will not affect the sensor sensitivity and specificity as demonstrated by the functional performance of HyperSENSE with clinical samples. This is attributed to the robust computational workflow used in the data analysis. Our computational algorithm compensates for the limitation that may arise due to the variation in the hyperspectral signals by considering the dominant spectrum and use it for further analysis. It is worth mentioning that the system has 60\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 magnification capabilities. The hyperspectral imaging was recorded at a 1.5 nm spectral resolution in the visible to NIR wavelength range from 400 to 1000 nm to allow the detection of minute pixel-to-pixel spectral differences in a hyperspectral image. A quartz halogen aluminum reflector lamp with 75% power was used as illumination source. The hyperspectral image was captured using a CCD camera, and the data were processed using ENVI software. Figure 3h illustrates the mapping of the negative COVID-19 sample using the spectral library collected from the assigned ROI. Figure 3g shows that the spectral signature with a peak at \u223c632 nm (represented by the green color) is predominant in the HSI of the COVID-19 positive sample. However, the negative sample has a predominant spectral signature with a peak of \u223c553 nm (represented by brown color) (Figure 3i ). The spectral signatures from both positive and negative COVID-19 samples are shown in Figure 3j . These spectra represent the output of the HyperSENSE sensor and can be further used to diagnose COVID-19 and quantify the viral load in the test sample. It is worth mentioning that the saturated pixels were eliminated and were not included during the analysis. This was achieved by excluding the pixels with any saturation or peak clipped signal. Therefore, any pixel that contains a saturated signal will be labeled as an unclassified pixel. The image analysis involved in HyperSENSE was done computationally starting from the spectral library mapping to the selection of the dominant spectrum and finally to the calculation of the peak shift with an estimated time of only a few minutes.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 Sensing Performance of HyperSENSE. We used the HyperSENSE sensor and recorded its response at a very low concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, by measuring the shift in the HSI signal. The EDF-HSI before and after the addition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to HfNPs-P mix has been displayed in Figure 4 . The data show a prominent shift in the HSI signal upon the addition of RNA, revealing the aggregation of the HfNPs conjugated to ssDNA probes. The addition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at different concentrations leads to the formation of HfNPs of various sizes. Figure 4a \u2212c depict the EDF-HSI of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA ranging from 0.09721 yM to 97.21 fM. This hybridization of the ssDNA probes with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA resulted in an obvious red-shift in the HSI signal even at a low concentration of 0.09721 yoctomolar (yM). The EDF-HSI before and after the addition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with 0.09721 yM to HfNPs-P mix is displayed in Figure 4e ,f. Using the same procedure with the unmodified HfNPs, the shift in the HSI signal is barely detectable at the same copy numbers. The calibration curve of the HyperSENSE (0.09721 yM to 97.21 fM) showed the shift in HSI signal to be linearly proportional to the log 10 (RNA copy number) with R 2 = 0.884, Figure 4g . Although nonlinear regression provides more flexibility in terms of the curve shape, linear fitting is preferred to generate a standard curve. 35, 36 It is simpler to implement the linear curve in the final prototype with low computational cost and can be generated using a smaller number of points. A linear standard curve is also better in the long run when developing a prototype from the HyperSENSE technology. This can be attributed to the simplicity of back calculating the concentration of an unknown sample using the linear equation when compared to another formula, e.g., quadratic. Linear fitting of the standard curve was performed on the HyperSENSE response toward serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA samples. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.09721 yM. Based on the IUPAC guidance of a 3:1 signal-to-noise ratio, the limit of detection of the HfNPs-P mix system was determined to be 0.09721 (\u223c0.1) yM. The LOD of the sensor has been calculated using the formula LOD = 3.3S Y /slope, where S y is the standard deviation of the response. Linear fitting of the standard curve was performed on the HyperSENSE response toward serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA samples. Figure 4h depicts the hyperspectral signal in the absence and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 0.09721 yM.",

            "text": "The aggregation of the HfNPs due to the hybridization of the ssDNA with their target RNA leads to the formation of large entities, which explains the shift in the hyperspectral peak. The formation of large entities and HfNP clusters has also been shown by ZetaView, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and EDF-HSI measurements as shown in Figure 5 . The hydrodynamic diameter measurement ( Figure  5a ) indicates that the hydrodynamic size increases significantly with the addition of RNA from COVID-19 positive samples (confirmed by RT-qPCR with a Ct number of 22.1), while no substantial difference in hydrodynamic size was found after the addition of MERS-CoV viral RNA. EDF-HSI further supports these findings of the formation of large entities upon the addition of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA as shown in Figure 5b . TEM images of the HfNPs-P mix in the absence (Figure 5c ) as well as in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 5d ,e) also support our hypothesis regarding the formation of HfNP clusters due to the recognition of the target RNA. When the system was tested using SARS-CoV, influenza A H1N1, and MERS viruses, no significant shift in the HSI signal has been observed and no large entities were formed, as shown in Figure  5f \u2212h, when compared to clinical SARS-CoV-2 RNA ( Figure  5i ), indicating good selectivity. Our technology does not rely on the size or the shape to estimate the concentration of the virus RNA. Instead, we are relying on reflectance-based spectral signatures to measure the viral RNA concentration. HfNPs were found to have an anhydrous diameter of \u223c5 nm when observed under TEM. If few particles of the individual particles are close to each other, they will appear as one cluster under the light microscope due to its low resolution, even though in reality they are apart. Therefore, we did not rely on the particle size as a parameter, but instead, we relied on the spectrum obtained from each sample to estimate the viral genetic material concentration. Utilizing the reflectance spectral signature addresses the limitation that may arise due to the poor resolution of the light microscope when investigating nanoparticles.",

To further evaluate the clinical performance of the developed HyperSENSE kit, a blinded study was performed using 66 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (48 COVID-19 positive and 18 negative samples), and the results were benchmarked with an FDA-approved COVID-19 RT-qPCR kit. The RT-qPCR detection kit we employed in this study is FDA-approved LABGUN and Applied Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit. These are designed as three target kits (ORF, N1, N2) to confirm the COVID-19 ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article diagnosis. Figure 6a ,b show the representative hyperspectral imaging of the HfNPs-P mix after the addition of confirmed positive and negative COVID-19 clinical samples. The confirmed COVID-19 positive samples induce the aggregation of the HfNPs due to the specificity of the conjugated ssDNA, which can be seen as a bright large entity shown in Figure 6b , whereas no significant aggregation was observed upon the addition of the negative COVID-19 samples, as shown in Figure 6a . Upon observing the hyperspectra of the large entities' spatial location, the positive sample exhibits a significant peak shift, compared to the negative samples ( Figure 6c ). Figure 6d illustrates the individual values of the hyperspectral peak shift obtained from the system as a response to the 66 clinical samples with their corresponding Ct values. The HyperSENSE output was found to be linearly proportional with the Ct number, where the curve X intercept is >40 Ct number, confirming the test sensitivity. The shift obtained in the case of the negative sample is significantly low, and thus the positive COVID-19 cases can easily be distinguished from the negative ones with high accuracy (Figure 6e ). The confusion matrix of the classification of the clinical samples as compared to the gold standard methods is shown in Figure 6f .",

The data show a significant right shift in the reflectance hyperspectral signal in the presence of its target (i.e., H1N1 A), whereas no obvious shift in the spectra was observed in the case of the off-target viruses including SARS-CoV, H1N1MD, and SARS-CoV-2, whereas the H1N1 B spectrum exhibits a shift from the unbound one to the left, which can be easily distinguishable from H1N1 A. This can be eliminated by removing the values below zero by applying a thresholding technique to the sensor data. This will also help in discriminating H1N1 A from H1N1 B samples. This confirms that the test does not have any cross-reactivity toward other viruses. Specificity describes a biosensor's ability to differentiate between target and nontargeted biological entities in a sample. Therefore, the specificity of the HyperSENSE was found to be 100%. Minimal aggregations were observed in the case of H1N1 B, whereas no significant aggregation was observed in the case of other samples, as shown in Figure 7f \u2212i. Our data obtained from the HyperSENSE platform confirmed the excellent sensitivity and specificity of the biosensor toward COVID-19 detection even at a very low concentration. But we realized that the RNA extraction step can add an extra burden toward the real-time detection of the pathogens, as it can be a time-consuming and laborious ",

The updated HyperSENSE workflow for SARS-CoV-2 detection using direct clinical samples is shown in Figure 8a . The sample will be collected from the patient in VTM and then passed through the NAP-10 column for RNA extraction. This process takes around 2 min only. Next, the extract will be mixed with HfNPs-P mix and imaged using the hyperspectral imaging system. The data will be further analyzed to identify the shift in the light scattering to assign the sample as either positive or negative COVID-19. The updated HyperSENSE workflow has been validated using 33 clinical samples obtained from patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the state of Maryland and Florida as diagnosed by RT-qPCR. The 33 samples were processed as shown in Figure 8a , where the as-collected nasopharyngeal swab samples in VTM passed through the NAP-10 column and mixed directly with the HfNPs-P mix and were imaged using the HSI system. The positive predictive agreement and negative predictive agreement of the Hyper-SENSE assay are \u223c100% (33 out of 33) relative to the RT-qPCR results (Figure 8b ). The threshold of the peak shift value has been selected to maximize the two-class separation as shown in Figure S13 . The peak shifts obtained from the 33 clinical samples tested using HyperSENSE of the two groups (positive and negative COVID-19) were found to be significantly different (Figure 8c) , and representative images of EDF-HSI of both confirmed positive and negative cases are shown in Figure 8d ,e. Figure 8f shows the individual outputs of HyperSENSE from 99 samples tested using two protocols of sample prepreparation (RNA extraction, direct sample). The confusion matrix of COVID-19 diagnosis using HyperSENSE of all the tested clinical samples is shown in Figure 8g . The test achieves 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy while providing low LOD. Apart from the strong interaction between the HfNP-P mix and the target RNA, the HfNPs being a strong light-scattering agent also contributes to the high sensitivity of the HSI. It was observed that the HyperSENSE sensor has a limit of detection of 0.06 copy/liter, i.e., 0.09 yM, representing the highest sensitivity described so far for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.",

From a theoretical perspective, HyperSENSE can be designed to detect any pathogen as long as we know the sequence of the target nucleic acid. By this, HyperSENSE outperforms the antigen-based tests in rapidly responding to an outbreak of infectious diseases. Further, the synthesis of ssDNA is low cost and scalable when compared to animal antibody production. Therefore, the HyperSENSE scalability and mass production is much easier when compared to antibody-based diagnostic kits.",

Next, 5.625 mL of ethanol and 1.875 mL of sodium hydroxide (75 mM) were added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred at 65\u00b0C for approximately 10 min until it is homogeneous. Next, 375 \u03bcL of water was added dropwise to form the microemulsion. Finally, 0.8071 g of hafnium ethoxide was added, and the reaction was allowed to run to completion overnight. The particles were washed three times with methanol and dried in a vacuum oven to be used for the next step. To tune the HfNPs' surface functionality, 250 mg of HfNPs was reacted with 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane in 35 mL of toluene at 110\u00b0C.

Briefly, the test sample were mixed with the HfNPs-P mix in 1:1 ratio, and 5 \u03bcL of the mixture was drop cast onto a glass slide and covered by a coverslip. The sample was then imaged instantaneously. An enhanced dark-field illumination system (Cyto-Viva, Auburn, AL, USA) has been used to capture the HSI images throughout this work. The tungsten\u2212halogen light source is used as an illumination system, which has been attached to an Olympus microscope for image capturing. The scattering light was consolidated with either a 60\u00d7 or a 100\u00d7 oil immersion Olympus objective. For the hyperspectral imaging method, the scattering signal was transferred by a narrow slit and was then separated by the gratings into the spectrograph and collected by a CCD (PIXIS-400BR, Princeton Instruments). Based on the hyperspectral data set, the spectrum of scattering at each pixel can be obtained using the CytoViva software program (ENVI 4.8). Collecting a spectrum from a particular area involves two main processes. First, identifying the region of interest (ROI) and building the hyperspectral image by normalizing the hyperspectral signal to the dark current image. Second, the 1D hyperspectral signals were collected from the HSI at certain ROIs and stored to form a spectral library. The SAM algorithm is used to generate mapping images to determine the predominant spectral signature. The spectra of the predominant region were then further analyzed to identify the peak value. Next, the peak shift of the sample with respect to the signal from bare HfNPs-P mix will be identified as an output parameter. Spectral data were analyzed using Origin software to identify the peak and the peak shift in the case of each sample. Around 16 ROIs have been processed for each sample.",
