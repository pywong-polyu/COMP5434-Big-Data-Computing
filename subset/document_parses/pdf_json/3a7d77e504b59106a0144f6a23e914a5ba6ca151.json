            "text": "Background: Adverse perinatal outcomes are the major cause of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and long-term physical and psychological consequences. Contradicting evidence across studies was reported about the impact of grand multiparity on adverse perinatal outcomes. Older literature reported increased incidence of perinatal complications in grand multiparas, but, recent reports failed to support this finding. In addition, there is a paucity of comparative studies on perinatal outcomes. Thus, the study aimed to compare the perinatal outcomes in grand multiparous (GM) and low multiparous (LM) women who give birth in North Shewa Zone Public Hospitals, Ethiopia, 2021. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was done among 540 (180 GM and 360 LM) women from January 1 to March 30, 2021. The data were collected using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire through interviews and reviewing patient charts. SPSS version 25 was used for data analysis. The data were entered using Epi-Data version 4.6. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was applied to test for model fitness. The statistical significance level was declared at a p-value of \u22640.05. Results: In this study, the prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes was 14.1% (95% CI: 10.9-17.2). Stillbirth/IUFD (33.3%) and low APGAR score (60%) were frequently occurred complications in grand multiparas. Nevertheless, meconium aspiration (26%), admission to NICU (65.2%), macrosomia (61%), and prematurity (52.2%) were higher in low multiparous women. Age above 35 years (AOR (CI) = 2.61 (1.23-5.53)), rural residence (AOR (CI) = 8.31 (3.05-22.6)), being a government employee (AOR (CI) = 0.19 (0.05-0.69)), lack of antenatal care (AOR (CI) = 9.76 (3.03-31.5)), and previous pregnancy complications (AOR (CI) = 3.10 (1.63-5.90)) were significant predictors of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, parity did not show a statistically significant association with perinatal outcomes. Conclusion: Maternal age, residence, occupation, lack of antenatal care, and previous pregnancy complications were significant associates of perinatal outcome. There was no statistically significant difference in perinatal outcome between GM and LM women. Socioeconomic development, good antenatal care, and early identification and treatment of complications are needed regardless of parity.",

            "text": "The adverse perinatal outcome remains the major challenge to the public health sector in both low-and-middle-income countries. Prematurity, low birth weight, stillbirth, and congenital malformations constitute some of the common adverse birth outcomes. 1 Globally, an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths occurred each year, one in every 16 seconds. Ninety-eight percent of these deaths occurred in low-and middle-income countries and 75% in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. However, over 40% of stillbirths could have been prevented through highquality antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care, and timely access to emergency obstetric care. 2 One of the significant risk factors for these deaths was grand multiparity. 3 Grand multiparity is the delivery of five or more live births and stillbirths after the age of viability. The term was first introduced in 1934 by Solomon as \"the dangerous multiparas\". The author described it as dangerous because pregnancy complications and maternal mortality increased steadily from the 5th to 10th pregnancy. 4 However, recent reports fail to support these findings.",

This study also found a higher prevalence of stillbirth (38.9%), low APGAR score (51.9%), and low birth weight (40.7%) among grand multiparous women, while a higher risk of meconium aspiration (9.8%), need for resuscitation (14.7%), and macrosomia (57.4%) among low multiparous women. 1 Contradicting evidence across studies was reported about the impact of grand multiparity on adverse perinatal outcomes. In Tanzania, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and low APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration) scores were significant among neonates born to grand multiparous women. 10 Grand multiparity was also found to increase the risk of neonatal admission to intensive care units 11 and fetal macrosomia. 12 Compared to low multiparas, neonates of grand multipara are at higher risk of low birth weight 13 and stillbirth. 3 Contrarily, in Uganda, the risk of stillbirth declines with increasing parity. 14 Similarly, a comparative cohort study in the same country found no difference in fetal outcome between grand multiparous and low multiparous women. 15 Besides, a systematic review and meta-analysis finding showed that grand multiparity did not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. 16 Further in South Ethiopia, parity showed an insignificant difference in perinatal outcomes. 1 Hence, in the absence of clear and consistent evidence, classifying grand multiparous women as a highrisk group would raise the socioeconomic burdens to families and health systems as well as physical and psychological stress to the mother and her families.",

Since 2000 impressive progress has been made. Maternal and child mortality due to complications during delivery has reduced by half, and half (48%) of women now give birth in a facility. The key interventions were preventing or treating the most important causes of child mortality -in particular essential immunizations, malaria prevention and treatment, vitamin A supplementation, birth spacing, scaling up family planning, training health extension workers, early and exclusive breast feeding and improving socio-economic conditions. In addition, over 38,000 health workers, 16,000 health posts, and more than 3000 health centers have been constructed to increase access to essential services. However, low utilization of maternal health services, ensuring timely arrival, and service quality at facilities remains a challenge. These conditions have been exacerbated as the health extension programme struggles to meet the demand for routine quality healthcare and to respond to drought, conflict or disease outbreaks, including COVID-19. 21, 22 To achieve the sustainable development goal (SDG) 3.2 determining the adverse perinatal outcomes have a higher advantage in reducing severe neonatal morbidity, mortality, and long-term complications along with good maternal and neonatal health continuum of care.

However, stillbirth/IUFD and low APGAR scores were higher in grand multiparous women. On the other hand, meconium aspiration, NICU admission, macrosomia, and prematurity were reported higher in low multiparous women. This finding was consistent with the studies done in Tanzania, 3,10 Hawassa, 1 and Jimma. 23 A comparative study in Nigeria was also found a higher proportion of perinatal mortality among grand multiparous women, indicating the need for meticulous care to these mothers during pregnancy and delivery. 24 Further, parity was not found to be a statistically significant factor for adverse perinatal outcomes in Southern Ethiopia. 1 On the contrary, in Uganda, the risk of stillbirth declines with increasing parity. 14 Besides, a significant association between grand multiparity and adverse fetal outcomes was reported in other studies. 15, 25, 26 These differences might be due to variation in study design, setting, socio-economic status, and possible confounders, ie, adverse outcomes attributable to chronic disease. Adverse birth outcomes in the previous studies might be also attributed to low health service utilization of grand multiparas. Additionally, accessible and quality prenatal care differences in study subjects could explain the inconsistencies. This study confirmed a significant association between antenatal care visits and birth outcomes. Lack of antenatal care (ANC) increased the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes by ninefold. This was consistent with the studies done in Wag Himra Zone 27 and Southern Ethiopia. 1 Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis study indicated that mothers who attended at least one ANC visit were more likely to give birth to an alive neonate that survives. 28 Prenatal care follow-up allows the women to access information related to danger signs of pregnancy, birth plan, and place of delivery. It also helps to early identify and treat complications/diseases, ie, HIV/AIDS, syphilis, hypertension in pregnancy, and malaria. Moreover, women attending prenatal care are more likely to have a skilled birth attendant and hence their newborns will have access to basic essential newborn care and neonatal resuscitation. Thus, further improvement of the quality of antenatal care and mobilization of pregnant women to the new WHO recommended focused ANC care is needed to reduce adverse birth outcomes and achieve sustainable development goals.",

They are also less likely to deliver in comprehensive hospitals that have specialized NICU and emergency obstetric care as this is found in more urban areas.",

Government employees were 81% less likely to develop adverse birth outcomes compared to self-employed. The possible explanation might be that government workers are more likely to be educated and stay aware of the latest pregnancy information by regularly checking updates. In Italy, educated mothers had reduced odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, and respiratory distress. 34 Similarly, in Northwest Ethiopia, mothers who had no formal education were three times higher to have adverse perinatal outcomes. 18",

Further, this study does not include adverse perinatal outcomes after 24 hours of birth.",

Parity showed an insignificant association with perinatal outcomes. Reproductive age women should work and improve their economic status to reduce the burden of adverse perinatal outcomes. All pregnant women should attend at least four antenatal care visits starting before 12 weeks of gestation. Additionally, health care providers should early identify and treat complications during antenatal care through good history, physical, and laboratory examination. Skilled birth attendants, ie, midwives, nurses, doctors, health officers, and health extension workers should give attention to both low and grand multiparous women during labor and delivery for their different adverse perinatal outcomes. Particularly, giving attention to grand multiparous women would have a paramount benefit to reduce stillbirth. Further, researchers are recommended to perform longitudinal studies to establish a causal relationship. ",
