However, there are challenges including shortage of sample collection swabs and transport medium. Saliva has been recommended as a simple, low-cost, non-invasive option. However, data from different populations and settings are limited. Here, we showed that saliva could be a good alternative sample to diagnose COVID-19 patients. Pair of NPS-saliva samples was collected from 152 symptomatic; confirmed COVID-19 patients, and compared their positivity rate, viral load, and duration of viral shedding. From 152 patients, 80 (52.63%) tested positive and 72 (47.37%) were negative for SARSA-CoV2 in NPS sample. In saliva, 129 (92.14%) were tested positive and 11 (7.86%) were negative on the day of admission to hospital. The overall percent agreement of RT-PCR result of Saliva to NPS was 70% (196/280). A comparison of viral load from 72 NPS-saliva pair samples on day of admission shows saliva contains significantly higher viral load (P < 0.001). In conclusion, saliva has higher yield in detecting SARS-CoV2, and COVID-19 patients show higher viral load and prolonged period of viral shedding in saliva. Therefore, we recommend saliva as a better alternative sample to NPS to diagnose COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic 1 . As of March 15, 2021, there were 119,956,955 conformed COVID-19 cases and 2,655,280 individuals were killed globally. In Ethiopia 175,467 individuals were diagnosed to have contracted SARS-CoV2 infection, out of which 2550 were died due to the disease 2 . In recent years, several viruses associated novel respiratory infections have been emerging-such as-the 2009 pandemic influenza virus A(H1N1), the avian influenza viruses A(H7N9) and A(H5N6), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus 3 . The latest pandemic, novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China 4 . At present, in order to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, the world depends on the PCR based detection of viral RNA in various body fluids. Reports show there is high degree of variability in detection rate of SARS-CoV2 RNA among the different body fluids. For example-Wenling Wang et al. 5 used bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and detected SARS-CoV2 RNA in 93% (14/15) samples, in sputum they detected in 72% (72/104) of the samples; nasal swabs 63% (5/ 8), in fibro-bronchoscope brush biopsy 46% (6/13), pharyngeal swabs 32% (126/398); in feces 29% (44/153), in blood 1% (3/307), and they found in none out of 72 urine samples. Another similar study detected SARS-CoV2 RNA in 16 of 88 (18.2%) throat swab samples, 38 of 63 (61.3%) sputum samples, 89 of 175 (50.9%) nasopharyngeal swab samples, and 17% (28/165) feces samples 6 . The WHO recommended the simultaneous use of acute phase infection upper and lower respiratory tract samples 6-8 . Specifically, nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), and nasal or throat swabs/washes are recommended for diagnostic detection of viral RNA 7,9 . More often, nasopharyngeal specimens are considered the optimum specimen type in common clinical practice and in many surveillance studies for the diagnostic testing of respiratory infectious viruses 10 .

On the other hand, sputum or other lower respiratory tract samples are suggested to have contained a higher viral load in some patients, which will facilitate for easy identification of viruses. However, many patients with respiratory viral infections do not have sputum production or cannot expectorate good quality sputum. Besides, the collection of tracheal or bronchial specimens involves invasive procedures that are associated with significant discomfort and risk to the patient and pose a risk to healthcare workers 3 . In addition, acquiring NPS samples is not as easy as obtaining other types of samples, such as saliva, as it is very irritating for the patient contributing to the collection of suboptimal samples, particularly when the samples are obtained by less experienced personnel. More importantly, the procedure for obtaining NPS samples causes coughing in most patients, that may lead to the production of airborne particles containing the infectious virus and increase the risk of transferring to the health care worker 3, 13, 14 . Saliva is seldom used for the detection of respiratory viruses as it is believed to have lower sensitivity compared with other respiratory tract samples. However, saliva can be easily obtained from patients without any invasive procedures 3 . A study reported that the detection rate of respiratory viruses in saliva is comparable with that of NPSs. The detection rate of respiratory viruses in NPSs was 77.5% (183/236), and in saliva samples it was 76.3% (180/236) 11 .",

This is in concordance with the recent decision of the US Food and Drug Administration that approved the use of saliva samples to test SARS-CoV2 RNA 18 . Not only that saliva is preferred over NPS because of its high positive rate of detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA but also saliva permit self-administered sample collection, which reduces the exposure of health care workers to nosocomial infections. The patient can collect its saliva at home; this further reduces the need for health care workers and waiting times for sample collection, ensuring small number of patients in clinical settings and thus helps to reduce further virus transmission.

Briefly, 50 \u03bcL proteinase K, and 200 \u03bcL lysis buffer were mixed with 200 \u03bcL NPS and/or saliva samples. Then, the lysed samples were heat inactivated on dry heat block at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by the addition of inhibitor remover and subsequent washing. Finally, the NA was eluted in 50 \u03bcL molecular grade water preheated at 72 \u00b0C.RT-PCR for the detection of viral RNA.To detect SARS-CoV2 RNA, we used the detection kit [Realtime Fluorescent RT-PCR kit for detecting 2019-nCov), BGI Biotechnology (Wuhan) Co.Ltd, China]. The detection targets and fluorescent reporter combinations of the kit are: a specific target in the ORF1ab region, which is reported by FAM, and the internal control (IC) is reported by either by VIC or HEX25 . The cycle threshold (Ct) value from RT-PCR analysis was used as a proxy measure of virus load. The cut off value for positive test is \u2264 38; and any value greater than 38 is regarded as negative test. Finally, the amplification reaction mixes for both experiments were run on Agilent Technologies Stratagene, Max3005P RT-PCR system according to the protocol provided by the manufactures.",
