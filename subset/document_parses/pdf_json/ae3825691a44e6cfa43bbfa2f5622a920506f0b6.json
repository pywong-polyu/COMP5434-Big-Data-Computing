Since the mid-1990s, international efforts to combat this problem expanded significantly, driven by the involvement governments, international financial institutions and non-governmental organisations. The objective of this article is to use Michel Foucault's work in a critical analysis of the international fight against corruption. This analysis is centred on Foucault's concept of governmentality, as well as his notions of knowledge, power and ethics. The primary focus is on the role played by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Transparency International in the proliferation of international anti-corruption discourse and practices. Furthermore, South Africa will be used as a case study to unpack the historical and contextual factors that play a role in the legitimisation of corruption. As will be shown in this assessment, without adequately understanding the local factors that stimulate corruption and the other societal characteristics that serve to compound its pervasiveness, internationally driven anti-corruption initiatives have limited scope for success. Corruption will persist where there is a lack of resonance between international anti-corruption ideals and local norms, values and ideologies.",

It has been reported that corruption exacerbates inequalities and that it is the poor who bear the brunt of its impact. As a result, there is scarcely any government that is not involved in fighting corruption in one way or another. There are countless organisations, institutions, civil society and religious groups, academics and private sector actors involved in studying corruption and fighting its prevalence (Sampson, 2010) . Even though corruption has been a persistent problem throughout history, the international fervour that currently surrounds the fight against corruption is a relatively recent development. The origins of the international anti-corruption movement can be traced back to the 1990s, when a wave of anti-corruption discourse swept over the international scene. Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm (1995, p. 1 ) called this the \"corruption eruption\"; referring not to an increase in the levels of corruption but rather to a marked increase in the attention and discourse centred on corruption.",

This turned the global attention toward corruption, and together with the engagement of key international organisations and NGOs, created the foundation for the emergence of the international movement against corruption.

Governmentality will be broken up into a three-pronged analytical framework, consisting of knowledge, disciplinary power and ethics. Firstly, in terms of knowledge, the focus will be on the transformation of corruption into a quantifiable problem of economics during the 1990s and the role played by Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in enabling this development. Secondly, the economic quantification of corruption opened the door for anti-corruption to become a disciplinary field of intervention for International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and other international actors. This enabled organisations like the World Bank and the IMF to exert increasing levels of influence and control over the states that they engage with, which often goes beyond fighting corruption alone.",

The concept of corruption has also come under scrutiny for being overly ambiguous and indeterminate, which has enabled stakeholders to align the concept with their specific goals and ideologies, rather than fighting the problem at hand (Everett et al., 2006, p. 7) . According to Pertiwi and Ainsworth (2020) the concept of corruption is assumed to be \"stable, clear, universally applicable and self-evident\". This assumption has been widely questioned for being business centric and based on western ideologies, norms and values (Bratsis, 2003 , p. 17, Brown & Cloke, 2004 , p. 289, De Maria, 2010 , p. 117, Pertiwi & Ainsworth, 2020 . Bracking (2007) also follows this line of criticism and argues that the international anti-corruption campaign is centred on the dissemination of Western policies, ideologies and governance structures from the developed to the developing world.",

The term goes further than the contemporary concept of government and refers to \"any form of activity that aims to shape, guide, or affect the conduct of some person or persons\" (Tremain, 2005, p. 8) . Rose and Miller (2010, p. 281 ) explain that governmentality refers to: \"a domain of strategies, techniques and procedures through which different forces seek to render programmes operable, and by means of which a multitude of connections are established between the aspirations of authorities and the activities of individuals and groups\".",

Not all these themes were specifically linked to governmentality by Foucault, but it is nonetheless relevant to use these concepts in analytical assessment of the anti-corruption industry. Firstly, what will be important is the role that anti-corruption knowledge played in the emergence of the anti-corruption industry. For Foucault, knowledge is central to the operation of power and is key to the \"activities of government and to the very formation of its objects, for government is a domain of cognition, calculation, experimentation and evaluation\" (Rose & Miller, 2010, p. 273) . Anti-corruption discourse underwent a significant change in the 1990s as economic analysis became central to the way international actors endeavoured to understand and mitigate corruption. This economic quantification and the role played by Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is the focus of \"The Construction of Anti-corruption Knowledge\" section.",

Most notably, the involvement of the World Bank and the IMF increasingly enabled the use of anti-corruption as disciplinary tool, often used to further objectives that go beyond fighting corruption alone. The international fight against corruption is much broader and involves many additional state and non-state actors but focussing on these two organisations will serve as an important reference point of the disciplinary practices of the broader anti-corruption industry.",

For Foucault, the manifestation of power in society does not take the form a hegemonic force that dominates and subjugates all in its wake (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983, pp. 184, 192) . Individuals play an integral role in their relation to dominant forms of knowledge and disciplinary practices. Foucault (1983, pp. 208, 209) states that the goal of his work has not specifically been to analyse power, but rather to analyse the different modes through which human beings have been transformed into subjects. Thus, the governmentality of the fight against corruption should not only involve globalised discourses and the practices of power, but also the way these interplay with local perceptions of corruption, local discourses, moralities, policies, ideological perspectives and cultural and historical contextual factors.",

South Africa is a pertinent cases study, given its immensely complicated history, with a host of different cultural and ideological points of reference. The country had its first democratic election in 1994 after an extended period of institutionalised racial segregation, which was preceded by colonial rule (Southall, 2006, pp. 67, 68; Van Vuuren, 2006, p. 22) . South Africa has a \"progressive\" constitution, with many western institutions and anti-corruption frameworks, but nonetheless has struggled with pervasive corruption (Majila et al., 2014, p. 220; Pityana, 2010) .

Gupta et al. (1998, p. 29 ) also argued that corruption has a direct impact on poverty and income inequality by exacerbating unequal educational opportunities and \"perpetuating unequal distribution of asset ownership\". A World Bank study found that: \"lower levels of corruption were seen to be statistically associated with lower levels of income inequality\" (Chetwynd et al., 2003, p. 9) . Chetwynd et al.

It was not that academics and economists were blind to the economic ramifications of corruption before 1990s; rather it was that changes in the anti-corruption discourse allowed for the reformation of the institutional and governmental treatment of corruption. Similarly, the behaviours that scientists and psychologists defined and codified in the eighteenth century were not newly discovered phenomena. It was that new interpretations, definitions, discourses, classifications and medical and psychological treatments were introduced for managing existing behaviours. As such, what was newly discovered were not novel anomalies, but novel interpretations; interpretations that opened the door for significant governmental and institutional intervention. Foucault (1974, p. 49) states of discourse that it is about the \"practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak \u2026 Discourses are not about objects; they do not identify objects, they constitute them and in the practice of doing so conceal their own invention\". What Foucault is interested in is the connection between what he sees as the practices of power and the discourses that seek to uncover and reveal truth (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983, p. 177) . For Foucault (1975, p. 27) , power and knowledge are inseparable. The very revelation of sex as a society-wide medical phenomenon allowed the issue to become enmeshed within the practices of power and therefore subjected to governmental administration and management (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983, p. 178) .",

Both types of punishment were distinctive punitive practices, constituted by specific discourses and disciplines, promoted and propagated by governmental mechanisms aimed at achieving different societal outcomes.

In other words, the governmentality of anti-corruption industry denotes the correlative relationship between anti-corruption knowledge, the disciplinary processes employed by key actors in the industry, as well as the ways individuals orient their own position in this context. Foucault's notion of technologies of the self refers to the methods employed by individuals to adapt their behaviour in accordance with prevailing discourse, moral codes, norms and values (Foucault, 1985, p. 28 ). More specifically, it refers to the way moral codes are appropriated, how individuals are invited or incited to adjust their behaviour in accordance with such codes and the actual practices they employ in order to become ethical (28).",

South Africa serves as a good case study because of its complicated history, its relatively recent democratisation and its diversity in cultural and ideological characteristics as well as the fact that corruption is currently a central element in the country's public and political discourse. South Africa was subjected to 350 years of colonial rule characterised by dispossession, violence and institutionalised racial discrimination (Southall, 2006, p. 68) . In 1912, the Land Act was implemented, which allocated 87% of South Africa's agricultural land ownership to 13% of the population (Van Vuuren, 2006, p. 22 ). The apartheid system ensured that a monopoly of resources and political and economic power rested in the hands of the white minority, which was used to suppress of the rest of the population (Van Vuuren, 2006, p. 2) . This established a pattern of inequality that is still highly prevalent today, with South Africa facing a myriad of socio-economic problems, including widespread poverty, inadequate service delivery, high levels of violent crime, corruption, social instability and political upheaval (Ikejiaku, 2009, p. 451) .",

There is certainly credence to this argument, but one needs to delve deeper to understand why corruption has been so prevalent in South Africa.

In applying the concept of governmentality, it is important to unpack the historical character of corruption in South Africa and shed light on how this has impacted the prevalence of contemporary corruption.

The fact that this transition was peaceful was a remarkable achievement, but the government that the ANC inherited had to be fundamentally restructured for a democratic South Africa. The institutions, departments, projects and state structures of apartheid South Africa were constructed with the purpose of monitoring, controlling and suppressing most of the South African population. South Africa's intelligence services, for example, operated outside parliamentary oversight or bureaucratic controls, with slush funds for clandestine operations that had little central oversight and no public scrutiny (Hyslop, 2005, p. 784) .",

This favoured the appointment of political allies, instead of experienced experts from the previous regime or from other political affiliations (776).

The TRC's mandate was to bear witness to human rights violations during the apartheid era and offer reparation and rehabilitation to the victims. Importantly, corruption was outside the mandate of the commission and the financial crimes of the apartheid era were not directly addressed (Carranza, 2008, p. 313) . This means that many individuals who benefitted from past financial injustices were never held accountable.",

Bruce (2014, p. 57 ) echoes this position and explains that the prevalence of corruption serves to highlight that many of the ANC and government officials do not endorse the South African constitution in its entirety, which is simply \"one of a number of moral and intellectual points of reference\". Another important value for the ANC is organisational loyalty, which is, according to Hyslop (2005, p. 783) , a \"value that transcends all others\". This value was embedded in the new government, which has made it difficult for the ANC to denounce corruption and patronage within its own ranks (Hyslop, 2005, p. 783) .",

In this context corruption can be rationalised because of the disadvantages still suffered by black South Africans and may be \"tacitly accepted by many within the elite as a means to reverse historic racist inequities\" (Bruce, 2014, p. 57) . Many public officials do not see corruption and broader development goals as mutually exclusive (57). For Southall (2006, p. 80) , political shortcuts can be perceived as morally justifiable, and aligned to addressing racial imbalances, even if these shortcuts are illegal. Similarly, Chipkin (2013, p. 219) states that corruption can be justified as aligned to the long-term ideal of creating a \"black middle and capitalist class\". On the other side, a possible lack of opportunities for employment, education and in business might lead some white South Africans to feel \"unfairly disadvantaged by affirmative action\" and thereby serve to rationalise their own engagement in corruption (Bruce, 2014, p. 57) . This is where the discussion links back with governmentality and Foucault's work. South Africa recently accepted a loan from the IMF to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been reported that President Ramaphosa provided assurance that \"anti-corruption measures would be set up to deal with criminals eyeing the Covid-19 funds is what convinced the International Monetary Fund to give SA a R70-billion ($4.3 billion) Covid-19 emergency assistance loan\" (Sowetan Live, 2020). Furthermore, the IMF senior representative in South Africa, Montfort Mlachila, stated that the IMF supports the president's announcement to \"intensify anti-corruption actions\" and that the government has \"put in place preventive measures to ensure that the procurement of supplies and services is transparent, competitive and cost-effective\" (Sowetan Live, 2020).",

As stated previously, for Foucault, individuals do not simply accept rules, norms, values and moral codes in a passive way. Individuals play an active role in grappling with, accepting and in some cases rejecting the norms and values that they are confronted with (Foucault, 1985, p. 28) . The global anti-corruption campaign depicts anti-corruption as a moral imperative, but there is insufficient consideration given to how individuals are expected to incorporate these prescripts into their own moral frameworks, given the complexity of the contextual factors as discussed above.",

Public officials in South Africa will often accept that their behaviour is unprocedural, but this is justified on a moral basis due to the unfairness and inequality that persists in the South African economy (223).

This goes far beyond acknowledgement that corruption is entrenched or systemic and should involve more than mere emotive proclamations about the moral imperative of fighting the cancer of corruption.

The quantification of corruption as a problem of economics enabled the fight against corruption to become an internationally driven field of intervention centred on eradicating a globally relevant problem. This enabled organisations like the World Bank and the IMF depict their involvement as neutral, value free, non-political, while the solutions proposed by these organisations are inherently political. As discussed above, it is precisely at this point where international anti-corruption ideals may be insufficient in providing the ethical framework to override already entrenched ethical perspectives. Corruption is a complex reflection of a diverse array of different global and local societal dynamics, and any anti-corruption intervention will need to recognise and develop programmes that can respond effectively to this complexity.",

By applying the concept of governmentality, it is evident that international anti-corruption knowledge serves to justify and perpetuate the policies and practices of the anti-corruption industry. The World Bank and the IMF are key actors in this industry, but these organisations are not one-dimensional hegemonic actors blindly driving the global implementation of neoliberal policies. Rather, these organisations are complex and characterised by internal flux, policy changes and developments in the global political economy. The fight against corruption is one component of a broader international disciplinary drive aimed at managing uncertainties, mitigating risks and instilling a normalised framework of governance globally. Importantly, anti-corruption discourse allows the international actors involved in the industry to depict their involvement as neutral, value free, non-political and motivated by fighting a universal problem, while in reality, the solutions proposed by these organisations are inherently political and ideological. The problem is that the ideological objectives that permeate the anti-corruption industry is obfuscated, blurred and hidden under layers of technocratic discourse.",

The very acceptance and rationalisation of corruption are tied to a myriad of historical and societal factors, one key component of which is its justification by individuals on moral grounds. To override this justification, the international actors involved in fighting corruption need to do more than simply acknowledge that this moral complexity exists. In terms of Foucault's ethical framework, for the fight against corruption to be successful, it needs to resonate with individuals, and they need to have the freedom to develop their own ethical justifications for defining corruption, and importantly, for fighting corruption within their communities, companies and governments.",
