Research has shown that only 10% of patients maintain \u226510% weight loss after 1 year. 7 Therefore, an acceptable intervention that can elicit significant, sustainable weight loss for patients with NAFLD would be advantageous. Low-energy diets (LEDs) have proven to be a viable treatment strategy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 8 enabling significant weight loss, with high levels of adherence and low levels of attrition in those patients with overweight or obesity. 9 Furthermore, long-term weight loss maintenance in people with obesity has been associated with structured meal patterns with the absence of comfort eating. 10 A randomised controlled trial of a LED delivered in primary care involving patients with T2DM (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT)) reported that 24% of patients lost \u226515 kg, and mean body weight reduced by 10 kg at 1-year follow-up. 11 It has been speculated that people with NAFLD might be less likely to engage with weight loss intervention due to NAFLD having a lesser symptomatic burden and perceived health risk when compared with T2DM. 12 Despite the LED approach being used to actively reduce liver volume and fat prior to bariatric surgery since 2004, it had never been formally assessed as a treatment strategy for NAFLD until recently. [13] [14] [15] Our study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of delivering a LED to patients with clinically significant NAFLD and found that it is a potential treatment option, with 34% of patients maintaining >10% weight loss at 9-month follow-up and 51% and 68% maintaining >7% and >5%, respectively. 13 A recent systematic review synthesised qualitative studies investigating participants' experiences of undertaking a Very low energy diet (VLED) achieved using total meal replacement products. The authors reported that VLEDs are well accepted by users and motivations to uptake included health-related outcomes and body image/appearance. Findings indicated that adherence was facilitated by rapid weight loss, group support meetings and ease of using the meal replacement products. Barriers to adherence were summarised as temptations and social occasions, and these were overcome by avoidance and distraction strategies. 16 Similarly, a recent qualitative analysis of the Doctor Referral of Overweight People to a Low Energy total diet replacement Treatment (DROPLET) study reported that participants' continuing relationship with the counsellor was an important part of adherence, in addition to the structured nature of the intervention. 17 However, the acceptability of a LED to a population of patients with clinically significant NAFLD has yet to be qualitatively explored.",

Following discussion, the same researchers agreed a preliminary group of themes/subthemes. One researcher (JS) repeated this process with the remaining 20 interview transcripts and both researchers agreed a final set of themes and subthemes that best represented the data set following discussions. Disagreements were resolved by revisiting interview transcripts, discussing the text segments and when required asking the views of a third research team member (KH). Supporting direct quotes from patients were applied to the agreed thematic labels. The quantitative data analysis has been described in detail elsewhere. 13 Briefly, primary and secondary data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (V.24; IBM, New York, New York). Continuous data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk's test, and data are presented as means\u00b1SD, unless otherwise stated.

The most salient facilitator to uptake was the desire to achieve rapid weight loss to improve liver-related and diabetes-related health and to prevent liver disease progression. Patients explicitly emphasised that they would not have been so willing to take part if the weight loss strategy offered was gradual over a longer period of time and that speed and magnitude of weight loss were of equal importance. While the level of weight loss achieved exceeded the expectations of participants, it also served as a facilitator to adherence beyond the initial stages of the VLCD intervention. Importantly, health rather than body image was the motivation for weight loss, highlighting the importance of communicating the specific health benefits of the LED in the context of NAFLD tailored to individual patient needs to promote uptake. While it is possible that patients reported health as the primary motivator for engaging with the intervention due to the overall aims and the setting of which it was based (hospital), they did report associations between weight loss and improved quality of life. Therefore, it is probable that patients were, in part, motivated to engage with the intervention due to health concerns. Future research should aim to explore in more detail why patients reported health as a motivator to uptake and to establish whether this was a consequence of the study being conducted in a hospital setting, or driven by information provided by HCPs. Interestingly, 67% of patients offered this intervention were enrolled within 6 months from a single centre, compared with an uptake rate of 20% reported by the DiRECT trial. 20 Although it is possible that our participants benefited from the widespread media coverage of Open access the LED to achieve improvements in diabetes-related health, which may partly explain the greater uptake rate. Similarly, recruitment methods differed with our intervention being delivered in secondary rather than primary care. Encouragingly, findings suggest that patients with NAFLD are as motivated as patients with T2DM to engage with a LED intervention. It was previously thought that this might not be the case with a lot of patients with NAFLD being asymptomatic.",

            "text": "Factors associated with continued engagement with the intervention included accountability to the staff providing support. Patients highlighted that attending regular appointments with personalised feedback encouraged engagement. The number of appointments that patients attended was significantly associated with percentage weight loss achieved. Similarly, desire to receive positive reinforcement, specifically from their consultant, was very apparent and promoted adherence. Consultants promoting/endorsing the LED to patients also facilitated uptake. Despite the vast majority of participants reporting accountability to clinicians providing them with support, we did not specifically enquire about participants taking personal responsibility for adhering to the intervention, therefore this should be explored in future work. However, given the reported usage of self-management strategies to facilitate adherence to the intervention, it is likely that participants did feel a sense of accountability to themselves. With health being the primary facilitator to uptake, it is likely that this was also a facilitator to adherence, yet not explicitly reported. Future research should explore this in greater depth. The structured nature of the LED was reported to make adherence easier for the majority of patients. This finding supports other published research that has evaluated the use of a LED in people with obesity. 17 21 This removed the decision-making process around food choices and was practically useful for work and some social events. Again, this finding supports previous studies. 17 Outside of appointments, practical support from friends, family members and work colleagues was reported to be a salient facilitator to adherence, specifically to overcome temptation. Many patients reported that they might not have completed the LED without the support they received at home-one patient dropped out specifically due to the lack of family support to complete the LED. Early and significant weight loss was consistently reported to be linked to adherence, that is, those who achieved the greatest weight loss during the first 1-2 weeks were more likely to complete the intervention and this was reflected in the qualitative and quantitative data generated. This highlights the importance of providing intensive support during the early stages of the intervention to maximise weight loss and longer-term adherence to the intervention. This was also a finding of the DiRECT and DROPLET studies. 17 22 As well as facilitators to uptake, engagement and adherence, a number of barriers were identified and generally resulted in patients dropping out of the intervention. These included irregular working patterns, in particular shift work. There is limited research evidence that has explored the impact of shift work on adherence to a LED. Therefore, it is not fully understood what it is about the LED that makes it unsuitable to shift workers, particularly when the meal replacement products used can be transported and consumed at any time. Shift work creates barriers to attending follow-up appointments where support is provided and this was reported in the current study. Therefore, our interpretation of this finding is that inability to attend appointments to receive support is a barrier to adhering to the LED. However, the suitability of the LED with shift workers should be explored further, particularly when considering the number of shift workers in the general population and the propensity of shift workers to be diagnosed with symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. 23 While the LED was acknowledged to be flexible and easy to use in the workplace, the feedback and support provided during appointments were active intervention ingredients that impacted positively on adherence. Therefore, patients reported that the inability to attend appointments meant that they did not receive the emotional, practical and social support received by others. As such, it is possible that they did not acquire new self-regulation skills to overcome difficulties. Two other barriers were reported by a minority of patients and as such were considered to be unsubstantiated by the entire group. For example, two patients with physically demanding jobs reported feeling that the meal replacements did not provide sufficient energy requirements, that is, they experienced greater tiredness and fatigue than usual and this impacted negatively on adherence. Specifically, they reported that they felt tired at work and consequently struggled to carry out their usual activities. They reported that these feelings often led to consumption of food and/or drink while completing the LED in order to gain more energy. While family members and friends were considered to be a facilitator to adherence, they were also reported by one participant as a barrier by introducing temptation to foods. To overcome reported barriers, patients employed multiple behavioural regulation strategies including: behavioural goal setting, planning, food avoidance, including self-distraction and planning for difficult social situations. These strategies were positively reinforced during appointments which helped to embed them into the everyday lives of patients.",

For example, it has been reported that physicians play a crucial role in the advocacy of lifestyle behaviour change interventions and their endorsement enhances uptake and adherence. 24 This highlights the importance of the clinical team being knowledgeable and appropriately trained to effectively promote interventions and to provide positive ongoing reinforcement. It is also important that the messages communicated to patients about the potential benefits of interventions are consistent among clinical team members. Previous research has described the shared views of patients and clinicians with regard to the need for more information relating to their NAFLD diagnosis. 12 25 Specifically, it was reported that the lack of engagement with lifestyle behaviour change may be a consequence of lack of awareness about NAFLD. In the context of this study, clinicians and patients expressed a preference for structured weight loss plans and patients expressed a desire to spend more time with a healthcare professional/clinician in order to gain a greater understanding of what NAFLD is and the role of lifestyle in disease management. Once this is achieved, it could be supported by a referral to specialist tier 3 weight management services where multidisciplinary teams use the LED regularly as part of their toolkit. Although effective pathways of referral would have to be established within NAFLD clinics.",

However, advice regarding weight loss for patients with NAFLD is often vague and unstructured and this was a finding of our previous work. 25 26 As such, clinicians may benefit from training to improve the information they provide to patients to maximise the likelihood of behavioural change by targeting facilitators of behavioural intention including outcome expectancies and risk perceptions. 25 26 Generally, awareness of NAFLD is low, even in populations at highest risk, 27 28 therefore it is likely that knowledge about the role of weight loss on prevention of progression of NAFLD is lacking. Educating patients on the benefits of lifestyle change in the context of NAFLD management may improve uptake and adherence to a LED and other weight loss approaches. However, effectively educating patients on the benefits of lifestyle behaviour change to initiate and maintain weight loss relies on clinician advocacy. While education and information provision is not the primary method to drive motivation to change and other factors such as engagement with self-care, increasing this could serve to increase uptake and adherence to interventions.",

This finding has been reported previously in the context of a LED and T2DM. 29 A further suggestion from patients was for clinicians to provide a summary of key clinical outcomes (eg, weight, BMI, blood pressure and HbA1c) to take home from each appointment to further increase motivation to adhere. This would help facilitate self-monitoring, subsequent self-management and allow patients to communicate progress to family members and friends or other healthcare professionals involved in their care. Personalised feedback throughout interventions is an evidenceinformed strategy, particularly useful when paired with guidance on how to elicit further improvements. 30 It came through in this study as vitally important to maximise engagement and adherence.",

In order to better understand the acceptability of the LED and barriers to engagement and adherence, it is important that this study is repeated with a more diverse cohort in terms of ethnicity and age. Furthermore, these data largely describe motivators, barriers and facilitators of participants over the initial 8-12 weeks of the intervention and does not adequately address long-term factors associated with weight loss maintenance. Although a proportion of participants approached to take part in a follow-up interview who declined reported using similar strategies during the maintenance period and as such did not feel that they had anything further to add. Future studies should aim to identify why patients refuse to take part in the intervention and explore specific barriers and problem-solving strategies for those who dropped out due to work commitments.",

            "text": "Interviews were primarily conducted following completion of the LED intervention. While a small number of interviews were conducted at the 9-month follow-up time period (n=4), we acknowledge that the data obtained were likely insufficient to adequately report on factors associated with maintaining long-term lifestyle behaviour change and this remains a challenge for the majority of people embarking on a LED intervention. Barriers to sustaining lifestyle behaviour change are multifactorial and include factors relating to individual financial circumstances, availability of social support and physical and psychological well-being. 31 However, our primary aim was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the LED for achieving 10% weight loss and identify factors Open access associated with these aims, and in this regard we did achieve our aims. Future work should include an in depth exploration of the factors associated with longterm adherence in the NAFLD population. Given that the majority of patients declined a follow-up interview due to other commitments, including work, future studies could offer a remote means of interviewing and use strategies to emphasise the importance of better understanding barriers to long-term adherence. It could be argued that the frequency of communication between patients and members of the research team could have been a facilitator to adherence and it would be difficult to replicate this intensity of communication routinely in clinical care. Furthermore, the rapport developed between patients and members of the research team may have reduced the likelihood that patients reported negatively on the intervention. However, a second member of the research team not involved in intervention delivery assisted in the conduct of interviews to help overcome this issue. Similarly, lapses in adherence to the intervention may have been under-reported due to self-preservation bias. 32 Patients who did not complete the intervention (n=3) were invited to be interviewed but did not consent. Therefore, these data reflect only the opinions of those who completed the intervention. Of those interviewed, not all achieved 10% weight loss (some achieved more, others less), therefore it could be of interest to specifically interview those who did not achieve this weight loss target to investigate whether the barriers and facilitators reported were similar to those who met the weight loss target. For the current study, analysing data relating to a subgroup of patients in this way would likely have required a larger number of patients to achieve data saturation and as such produce findings that are considered trustworthy. Furthermore, it would be beneficial in a future study to interview those who declined participation in the intervention. Finally, all patients within this study were Caucasian, and the views of patients from other ethnic groups were not explored. However, the sample interviewed was representative of those who took part in the intervention study, therefore future studies should aim to explore to increase uptake of a more representative NAFLD group.",
