It appeared that some higher educational institutions and a certain part of their students were almost ready to go online as these institutions had been developing their online platforms thus integrating traditional face-to-face classes with computer-assisted learning as well as integrating massive open or shared online courses into their curricular. At the same time, many other universities and institutes proved to be absolutely unprepared to shift online as they and their students had neither their own educational environment and online resources developed by their teaching staff nor any experience of working in an external online environment and choosing courses appropriate for their educational purposes. It turned out that most existing online courses could not be successfully used for implementing into most universities curricula and for teaching a majority of technical students as they simply reproduced the traditional classroom learning process and missed all advantages and opportunities afforded by online learning environments. The authors objective for this research in progress is to identify the key features and describe structure, content and assessment specifics of an academical online course for technical students. This paper provides tips on how to organize the course content into a proper structure stressing what types of teaching materials could be uploaded to the educational platform and goes into its assessment specifics. In a long-term perspective the authors aim to design, develop and introduce a modern and progressive constructivist learning environment for teaching business English in technical universities.",

The research was qualitative, data collection continued for over ten weeks and is still in progress. Two mechanisms for collecting data were employed: observations of structure, content and assessments tools employed in these courses & short interviews with course participants (both teachers and students) from SSUSSE and SSTU. Both mechanisms considered the categories that are often used to evaluate online courses in terms of course organization: Course Overview and Introduction; Learning Objectives (Competences); Assessment and Measurement; and so on [11, 19] .",

Soon after online learning emerged as a learning approach, certain advantages became apparentsuch as flexibility, alleviation of overcrowded classrooms, increased enrollment, reduced cost, and increased profit [4, 5] . In almost forty years that passed after this memorable event, online education has changed greatly. As long ago as in 2001, Taylor identified five generations of distance education development and assumed that the latter, fifth, generation, 'the intelligent flexible learning model', that had just begun to take shape would include Internet-based access to resources, easily accessible online interactive multimedia, and computer-mediated communication using automated response systems \u2026\" [17] . In a few years other researchers expressed hopes that online learning would soon transform education from instructor-centered to student-centered, where students had more responsibility for their learning [14] . Now we still hope that it would really happen one of these days as most online courses still aim at pouring content into student minds rather than supporting students in making that knowledge their own through practice and experience [16] .",

Active learning, defined as any teaching method that engages students in the learning process, requires students to complete meaningful learning activities and to think about what they are doing [14] . Online education, in its turn, is a different medium for teaching and learning, and therefore requires a different approach and even a different pedagogy [8] .",

Making sure that assignments are always due on the same day of the week and modules always begin on the same day of the week also helps.

Effective video lectures need to engage directly with the online learner.

Using peer reviews in online courses enhances student learning and allows students the opportunity to read a variety of student writing, learn from each experience, learn by providing feedback, and develop their writing skills in the process. Peer-reviewing is one of the keyways to test the achievement of complex learning outcomes, such as critical thinking or academic writing skills. Reviewees here benefit from the reviewers' comments, which improves their understanding of the subject and vice versa.
