            "text": "The global cruise industry has experienced persistent growth dynamics over the last two decades, with an impressive rebound after the 2008 financial crisis, unlike commercial shipping. Globalization, restructurings, mergers and a diverse bundle of travel and tourism services to cater for different passenger profiles have boosted robust revenue and profitability growth. Major cruise companies deploy ambitious investment plans to expand and renew their expensive fleet with larger modern vessels of high value. The mix of funding sources to finance these capital-intensive projects is critical and exerts a direct impact on the cost of capital. The paper contributes a rigorous corporate financial performance evaluation in the cruise sector and attempts to shed light on managerial financial efficiency, capital structure options, solvency conditions and corporate value dynamics. A sample of leading cruise companies, jointly holding a dominant market position, is incorporated to empirically investigate and assess their financial, accounting and stock market performance, based on convenient financial ratios and established market metrics. The detrimental impact of the recent coronavirus pandemic on the cruise sector is also discussed. This original study attempts to bridge the relevant research gap, as past literature remains surprisingly thin on this critical topic. A set of challenging and innovative contributions is delivered for the financial performance of major cruise companies, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, in support of efficient managerial implications and recommendations.",

            "text": "Cruise tourism business is a form of traveling for leisure purposes that involves an all-inclusive holiday on a cruise ship. According to UNWTO, cruise tourism includes 'a wide range of activities for travelers in addition to its traditional function of providing transport and accommodation'. The cruise industry is the fastest growing sector of the travel industry, with demand estimated to grow at 7.0% per annum over the past decade, and cruise passenger surpassing the threshold of 30 mln. in 2019 (CLIA, 2020; Wondirad, 2019) . At the same time, the business is seen to be extremely volatile and ever more highly capitalintensive. Newbuilt cruise vessels can cost multiples in value compared with commercial ocean ships, estimated at $1.3 bln. per vessel, accommodating up to 6000 passengers, albeit at lower operating unit costs (Dowling, 2006; Lester & Weeden, 2004; Wood, 2004) . Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the cruise industry has experienced extensive restructuring, following a wave of failures and consolidations. Larger holding cruise companies acquired smaller peers that continued operating as 'brands' withing the new business ventures though, serving repeat customer loyalty and offering diverse quality and service levels.",

Few earlier studies investigate, selectively, topics such as, the translational partnership organization of the industry (Hall & Braithwaite, 1990) ; cruise impact on and implications for regional and local market development (Hobson, 1993) ; cruise market globalization trends (Wood, 2000) ; cruise strategic capacity investments (Byung-Wook, 2005; Wie, 2005) ; cruise line and passenger challenges (Veronneau & Roy, 2012) ; cruise line supply chains and logistics (Daly & Fernandez-Stark, 2017; Veronneau & Roy, 2009 , 2011 Veronneau, Roy, & Beaulieu, 2015) ; fund raising approaches for newbuilding cruise ships (Kiziellewicz, 2017; OECD, 2007) ; and mergers, acquisitions and restructurings (Charlier, 2004; Hobson, 1994) ; inter alia. This study focuses on the financial performance evaluation of the global cruise business and attempts to fill this research gap in the field by contributing a set of challenging and innovative findings, as well as managerial implications and recommendations. To the authors' best knowledge, this appears to be the first attempt to investigate in depth the critical issues of managerial efficiency, profitability, and growth prospects, financing sources and capital structure, leverage, solvency, and value creation dynamics in the context of the global cruise industry. Initially, a concise overview of prevailing key developments and trends in the cruise business over recent years is provided. Subsequently, critical key financial metrics and performance indicators are estimated and evaluated over time and against major peer competitors for a sample of leading cruise players.",

To this end, in a broader context, a core set of seminal reference papers investigate key managerial decisions on funding source options (debt and/or equity), capital structure mix priorities, (weighted average) cost of capital (WACC) shifts, and share price volatility, inter alia, as well as their interrelated implications for investment decisions and overall corporate financial performance (e.g., Baker & Wurgler, 2002; Donaldson, 1961; Hovakimian, 2006; Kisgen, 2006; Modigliani & Miller, 1958 , 1963 Myers, 1984 Myers, , 2001 Myers & Majluf, 1984) . It remains an innovative, challenging and fruitful empirical task to investigate the financial implications of these decisions and evaluate the managerial efficiency and financial performance of major global cruise companies, as depicted and reflected on the evolution of critical and widely established financial ratios and metrics. Indeed, these issues are not seen to have been investigated yet in the relevant empirical literature. Nevertheless, they remain important for a highly capital-intensive sector, such as the cruise industry, taking, indicatively, into consideration that the cost of a newbuild cruise vessel can now surpass the $1.0 bln. threshold (CLIA, 2020) .",

However, a fundamental strategic shift is seen in global cruise business over time (Garin, 2005) . Whereas in earlier days, cruise shipping services were mainly targeting higher net-worth luxury customers at substantial price cost, the industry has gradually diversified to demonstrate market segmentation and to attract massively average-income cruise passengers of different age and social profiles. This trend has been supported by attractive cruise service packages at reasonable prices, as massive newbuilt vessel capacity has resulted to extensive economies of scale benefits. Broadly, cruise shipping is perceived as a 'customer's market', shaped by shifting consumer tastes and trends. Cruise passengers appear to increasingly prefer 'paying more for experiences than for possessions'.",

Obviously, this should have direct implications for this cruise company's optimal capital structure mix and its cost of funding. The investigation of these issues in the context of cruise companies remains a challenging and innovative task. To the authors' knowledge, this appears to be the first empirical study tackling these issues in the cruise industry. This research interest is further reinforced and justified considering that the global cruise industry is a highly capital-intensive business with consistent investment expansion plans under development over the last decades, associated with substantial funding requirements. As noted earlier, most cruise companies plan to expand and upgrade their fleet and have already placed a massive newbuilding orderbook under play. The incorporation of luxury facilities and high-end technological advances and services drive unit vessel prices even higher than $1.3 bln. (CLIA, 2020).",

            "text": "Managerial financing decisions have direct implications for the cruise company's capital structure mix, its cost of capital and, eventually, shareholder value creation and growth prospects. The capital structure mix refers to the percentage weights of equity and debt, reflecting the respective capital source contribution to form the company's total invested capital. As the cost of equity and cost of debt differ, modifications in the capital structure mix also affect the company's overall cost of capital. These focal issues have generated steaming debate among academics and market practitioners over time. A summary of major finance theories on capital structure is now provided and subsequently explored briefly in the context of the cruise business. Modigliani and Miller (1958) , first, postulate the capital structure irrelevance approach. Assuming perfect markets and absence of taxes and bankruptcy costs, the capital structure mix is irrelevant because firm market value is determined by the company's earning power and the risk of its underlying assets. Modigliani and Miller (1963) incorporate, subsequently, the tax effect on capital cost and firm value. In this case, firm value increases with leverage due to tax shield benefits. Interest on debt capital is an acceptable deduction from the firm's income and thus decreases the firm's net tax payment. Assuming potential tax benefits, debt financing can result to lower cost of capital. Trade-off theory, furthermore, argues that the optimal level of debt is where the marginal debt benefit is equal to its marginal cost (Myers, 1984) . Debt financing up to a certain level contributes interest tax shield benefits, offsetting financial distress costs. A firm can attain an optimal capital structure by adjusting debt and equity weights, thereby balancing tax shield benefits and financial distress costs. Myers and Majluf (1984) postulate the pecking order theory, based on earlier research by Donaldson (1961) , and argue that (assuming perfect capital markets) management prefers internally generated funds rather than raising external funds. A company should prefer internal funding first, then issue debt, and finally, as a last resort, issue equity capital. Firms with higher profit and growth opportunities would use less debt capital (Myers, 2001) . If a firm has no investment opportunities available, profits are retained to avoid future external financing. Information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders and separation of ownership can explain why firms avoid capital markets.",

As the resulting effects on capital structure are persistent, this indicates that current capital structure is strongly related to historical market values. Capital structure is perceived to be the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market. It is argued though, that market timing does not exert material effects on the firms' capital structure in the long run (Hovakimian, 2006) . The credit rating-capital structure (CR-CS) hypothesis is proposed as an extension of the existing trade-off theory of capital structure (Kisgen, 2006) . Capital structure decisions are expected to adjust along the relevant benefits and costs associated with shifts between different credit rating levels. When a firm is closer to a rating shift, it may issue less debt compared to the alternative of being far from a credit rating shift.",

A company with positive prospects can proceed to raise capital using primarily debt rather than equity, so to avoid ownership dilution (transmitting negative signals to market players). Debt signaling (company announcements of funding with debt) is typically seen as positive news. However, a high debt exposure bears enhanced bankruptcy risks, and increases shareholders' financial risks, thus a higher return on equity is required. To conclude, companies must assess their optimal funding mix at which the marginal benefits of debt equal the marginal costs incurred. The optimal capital structure mix is associated with that combination of equity and debt financing that results to a lower cost of capital, supporting robust value creation prospects.",

At the same time, the company's cost of capital is the expected return to both stakeholders (owners and lenders) and represents investors' opportunity cost of taking on the risk of investing their funds into the company. More specifically, cost of equity is the required rate of return on common stock of the company. It is the minimum rate of return which a company must earn to keep its common stock price from declining. Cost of equity is estimated using alternative models (including, dividend discount model (DDM) and capital asset pricing model (CAPM)). After-tax cost of debt represents the after-tax rate of return debtholders require to earn until debt maturity. Cost of debt is calculated by assessing the yield to maturity of the company's bonds and other loan instruments. If no yield to maturity is available, the cost of debt can be estimated using the instrument's current yield. After-tax cost of debt is included in WACC calculation because debt offers a tax shield (i.e., interest expense on debt reduces taxes and this is incorporated in the cost of debt calculation).

Contrary to most commercial shipping market segments that experienced abrupt and persistent revenue declines since the outbreak of 2008 global financial crisis, cruise shipping has seen a robust resistance and relatively rapid recovery. In 2019, Carnival recorded cruise revenue at $20.8 bln. Gross profits exhibit an upward trend for all three cruise players, especially for the market leaders, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is considered as a critical indicator of operational profitability and is defined as income after operating expenses have been deducted and before interest payments, taxes, depreciation, and amortization have been deducted. This profit component is to compensate subsequently for debtholder claims (interest payments), State claims (taxes) and, lastly, shareholder claims (dividends), with the latter ones perceived as residual claimants, bearing highest risk levels. The leading cruise companies exhibit modest EBITDA and Net Income shifts over 2016-2019. According to a market motto, 'if gross profit is not there, there will be no net profit' as well. Gross profit margin is calculated as the ratio of gross profits to revenue. Assuming a cruise company investing in a sector that exhibits a high gross profit margin but not making bottomline net profits may be a striking indication of a mismanaged case. Corporate restructuring and operational tuning may be required to turn the business into a profitable venture. Broadly, the level of gross profit margin depends directly on how a business is organized and the other costs it must support. For instance, after gross profit calculation, a cruise company still must pay operating expenses, financial, tax and other expenses. Subsequently, a cruise company must have robust net profits to distribute an attractive return (dividend) to shareholders. In case a cruise company can effectively control operating expenses, it can remain profitable with a lower gross margin ratio. Broadly, a higher gross profit margin is preferred, as it indicates efficient processes and offers flexibility to have money left over to spend on other business operations.",

Plausibly, in case a company carries no debt, its equity and total assets will be the same, hence, ROE and ROA would also be the same. However, if that company takes on financial leverage, ROE will rise above ROA; this relates to the balance sheet equation, since equity equals assets minus liabilities. Thus, by taking on debt, a company increases its assets, due to the cash that comes in. But since equity equals assets minus debt, a company decreases its equity by increasing debt. In other words, when debt increases, equity shrinks; since equity is ROE's denominator, then ROE, in turn, gets a boost. At the same time, when a company takes on debt, total assets (ROA denominator) increase; hence, debt amplifies ROE in relation to ROA. ROE, however, weights net income only against owners' equity and does not provide any feedback on how well the management uses funding from borrowing and issuing bonds. If ROA is sound and debt levels are reasonable, a strong ROE is a solid signal that management is efficient at generating returns from shareholders' capital. On the other hand, if ROA is low or the company bears a heavy debt, a high ROE may be misleading as to the company's growth prospects.",

On the contrary, a TIE less than T. Syriopoulos, et al. Research in Transportation Business & Management xxx (xxxx) xxxx 1.0 reflects a company that cannot meet its interest obligations on its debt. Companies with weak TIE ratios may face difficulties in raising funds for their operations. A better TIE ratio implies the company has enough cash after paying its debt to continue investing in the business. However, management should be careful to avoid a very high TIE ratio in case this is due to an unnecessarily conservative stance towards debt and/or absence of policies to take full advantages of debt facilities. Plausibly, a company's capital structure mix has a critical direct impact on TIE ratio. The leading cruise companies are seen to follow a careful approach towards debt financing and to maintain robust solvency positions over 2016-2019 (Table 16) . Carnival exhibits a consistently attractive and stable debt-to-equity ratio, at 0.78 in 2019. This is obviously in line with the higher equity component apparent in its capital structure mix. The same holds for Carnival's solvency position, displaying a comfortable operating profitability position to meet its interest payment obligations, with TIE ratio at 14.4 in 2019. Royal Caribbean and Norwegian are exposed to higher debt financing with a debt-to-equity ratio at 1.49 and 1.57, respectively in 2019. Whereas TIE ratios for Royal Caribbean and Norwegian are well above 1.0, at 5.3 and 4.3, respectively in 2019, these ratios still lag considerably behind Carnival. Broadly, the debt-to-equity and TIE ratios of leading cruise companies reflect balanced financing strategies with manageable debt exposures and adequate solvency positions. This comes in contrast to the typically heavily indebted commercial shipping companies (Syriopoulos, 2007 (Syriopoulos, , 2010 .",

Indicatively, Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian cruise share prices declined sharply at $7.97, $24.36, and $8.40 , respectively, as the virus burst (April 2), recording losses by 70-80% from the beginning of the year (share prices at $51.31, $134.65, and $58.83, respectively, on January 2).

Surprisingly, to the authors' best knowledge, relevant studies remain extremely thin on this topic. This paper intends to partially fill this research gap and to offer a set of innovative contributions and managerial recommendations. Cruise companies have shown a consistently dynamic growth performance over recent years, rebounding impressively after the 2008 financial crisis impact. Cruise revenue and profitability are seen on a solid upward trend, diverging from commercial shipping companies. Critical financial performance indicators, such a ROE, ROA and ROIC ratios, are consistently high, reflecting efficient managerial investing, operating, and financing decisions. The leading cruise companies have ambitious and highly capital-intensive investment plans under development, with active newbuilding orderbooks for vessels of larger carrying capacity, expensive technological advances, and modern facilities to cater for diversified cruise passenger needs, complying at the same time with strict environmental conditions. As major international banks are seen to exit ship lending, a critical question remains as of potential alternative capital sources to finance these investments, assuming that cruise vessel construction costs typically range from $0.5 bln. to over $1.5 bln. The capital structure of the leading cruise companies demonstrates a balanced and healthy debt-equity mix, with dept-to-equity ratios and solvency ratios performing impressively.",

Research in Transportation Business & Management xxx (xxxx) xxxx Having said that, cruise business has in fact faced hard times and global crises in the past but managed to recover convincingly, demonstrating tough resilience, adaptability, and flexibility. This virus crisis, however, appears to be quite different. The critical question remains as to when the cruise industry is going to return into business operations again (Calder, 2020) . Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to that yet, as there are many uncertainties to make rational forecasts for the entire 2020. Fears are that this crisis will affect cruise revenues for a long time, particularly in the Asian region, as this is a dynamic market of growing importance for the cruise industry in recent years (Moussali & Tsekoura, 2020; OMR Global, 2020) . Obviously, these adverse implications are anticipated to have a tremendous financial impact on all cruise players, inducing downward adjustments in investment, financing, and profitability projections. However, it is for small cruise players that the implications are expected to be even more painful, forcing inevitably several of them to exit the market or to be taken over.",

Based on recent UBS bank estimates (Panetta, 2020) , around 76% of the passengers whose cruises were cancelled due to pandemic have opted for a credit for future trips instead of a refund. Furthermore, based on a recent CLIA survey, 82% of cruisers indicate their interest in booking a cruise for their next vacation. Despite multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 and uncertainty over when sailing will reconvene, several reports record increased bookings for 2021 in comparison to 2019. This reflects a persisting interest of cruise passengers in continuing pursuing cruise travel and tourism services in the future, though it may be harder to convince first-time cruisers (Giese, 2020; Panetta, 2020) . At the same time, as most countries continue to fight against COVID-19 effects, the virus impact is anticipated to challenge the business model of several industries (McKinsey, 2020c) . For the time being, there does not seem to be a clear timeline for the restart of cruise operations. To gain customer support after travel restrictions will have been lifted, companies consider promotion campaigns at reduced cruise package prices for 2021, to compete and revitalize cruise demand. In any case, the assessment of the post-COVID-19 impact on the global cruise business can be more accurately evaluated after the pandemic is over. This could well lead to a challenging follow-up empirical study. ",
