Myoglobin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most severe complications of RM. Based on our previous research, exogenous biological renal support alleviates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in elderly mice. This study aimed to determine whether exogenous biological renal support promotes renal recovery from RM-induced AKI and to preliminarily explore the mechanisms involved.",

Mice were divided into three groups: the control group (in which mice were injected with sterile saline), the RM group (in which mice were injected with 8 mL/kg glycerol), and the parabiosis + RM group (in which recipient mice were injected with glycerol 3 weeks after parabiosis model establishment). Blood samples and kidney tissue were collected for further processing 48 h after RM induction. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted via Gene Ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and clustering analysis.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Exogenous biological renal support provided by parabiosis can improve renal function in RM-induced AKI by suppressing the complement system; decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death; and promoting tubular cell proliferation. Our study provides basic research evidence for the use of bioartificial kidneys to treat RM-induced AKI. Keywords: parabiosis model, exogenous biological renal support, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, bioinformatics analysis BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a clinical syndrome characterized by breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers and release of their contents into the circulation (1, 2) . It can be caused by many factors, such as trauma (3, 4) , heat exposure (5) , endurance running (6) , drugs (7) , and viruses [such as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)] (8) (9) (10) . Myoglobin (MYO)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most severe complications of RM (11) . MYO and its oxygen-carrying moiety heme play a key role in the development of AKI. AKI can cause renal tubular obstruction and renal vasoconstriction and can directly activate oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and macrophages, thus injuring proximal tubular cells (12) (13) (14) .",

However, RRT is a non-specific treatment method that removes blood solutes; it cannot regulate inflammation or promote repair of damaged renal tubules. Moreover, previous research has shown that RRT does not significantly reduce mortality or improve renal repair in AKI patients, while artificial biology methods can reduce mortality in patients with AKI (15) (16) (17) . Mouse parabiosis models have been established that involve a shared circulatory system; the linked mice share circulating antigens and do not exhibit adverse immune reactions (18, 19) . Such models have been used in several physiological studies on various topics, such as kidney hypertension (20) , hematopoietic stem cell migration (21) , neurodegenerative disease (22) , and lymphocyte trafficking (23) .

Animal models established using intramuscular glycerol injection with consequent myoglobinuria are closely related to the human syndrome of RM. RM-induced AKI is a major related adverse event and has been shown to be closely related to oxidative stress, renal inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation (14, (27) (28) (29) . In our study, the Scr and BUN levels in the RM group were significantly higher than those in the parabiosis + RM and sham groups. Sham mice did not show any significant tubular damage. RM mice showed tubular brush border loss, cast formation, tubular dilatation, and tubular necrosis accompanied by increased acute tubular injury scores. Parabiosis + RM mice showed significantly improved renal histological injury. To analyze the role of exogenous biological renal support, we used proteomic analysis to identify key proteins and key pathways. The results showed that compared with the mice in the RM group, the mice with exogenous biological renal support exhibited increases in proteins associated with extracellular, nuclear, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and plasma membrane localization in kidney tissue and serum. Pathway functional enrichment analysis identified suppression of complement system activation; attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death; and increased proliferation. We further confirmed these effects with in vivo experiments.",

MYO-induced renal toxicity plays a key role in RM-induced AKI by activating the complement system and increasing oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and cell death (11) (12) (13) . The characteristic clinical symptoms of RM are elevated serum CK and MYO levels (1) . Our results showed that the levels of CK and MYO were not significantly different between the RM and P_RM_R groups (Supplementary Figure 7) . Possible reasons are as follows: on the one hand, the blood exchange rate between parabiotic mice is not high (only 8% is exchanged each day), and the amount of blood exchanged at 48 h after RM is established is limited; on the other hand, previous research has indicated that a number of biological systems are activated following muscle extract infusion and that these systems may be more important than the nephrotoxicity of MYO in the pathogenesis of renal injury (33) . In addition, a recent study performed on critically ill patients showed that although MYO clearance was higher in the intervention arm (subjected to continuous venovenous hemodialysis with a high-cutoff dialyzer) than in the control arm (subjected to continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration), there were no differences in hospital mortality, 28-or 90-day mortality, adverse events, or severe adverse events between the groups (34) . Our research results show that the effects of exogenous biological renal support are not entirely attributable to MYO clearance, but that this support strategy can alleviate AKI by suppressing complement system activation; decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death; and promoting tubular cell proliferation.",

Whether exogenous biological renal support can effectively regulate the ferroptosis pathway needs further assessment via bioinformatics analysis and verification in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the proteomic analysis results show that metabolic signaling pathways are involved in this process and that metabolic reprogramming may be an important part of kidney regeneration and repair. Therefore, additional study is needed to explore the mechanism. Furthermore, exogenous biological renal support has multifaceted effects on the recovery of renal function, and the effects of key pathways or proteins cannot be independently verified with parabiosis models; these effects should be further examined in single mouse models of RM.",

(A) Anesthesia and skin preparation. Semicircular markings were made on the lateral abdomens of both the donor and recipient. (B,C) The skin and subcutaneous tissue were separated, and then the marked skin was cut to expose the subcutaneous muscle. (D-F) The chest muscle flap of the donor mouse was isolated and then sutured to the chest of the recipient mouse. The abdominal muscles of the two mice were connected with 3-point interrupted sutures. (G,H) The outer skin of the two mice was sutured. Successful surgery relied on the establishment of a shared blood circulation, which required a minimum 1-to 1.5-cm 2 area of isolated chest and abdomen muscle flap. Supplementary Figure 2 | Confirmation of shared blood circulation after parabiosis.
