Here, we quantitatively evaluate changes in ambient NO 2 , O 3 , and PM 2.5 concentrations arising from these emission changes in 11 cities globally by applying a deweathering machine learning technique. Sudden decreases in deweathered NO 2 concentrations and increases in O 3 were observed in almost all cities. However, the decline in NO 2 concentrations attributable to the lockdowns was not as large as expected, at reductions of 10 to 50%. Accordingly, O 3 increased by 2 to 30% (except for London), the total gaseous oxidant (O x = NO 2 + O 3 ) showed limited change, and PM 2.5 concentrations decreased in most cities studied but increased in London and Paris. Our results demonstrate the need for a sophisticated analysis to quantify air quality impacts of interventions and indicate that true air quality improvements were notably more limited than some earlier reports or observational data suggested.

Such methods cannot explain the observed severe pollution events during the lockdowns in some cities (15) (16) (17) . Comparisons of pollutant levels in 2020 with previous years may assume that air pollutant emissions have not changed over the past few years, which is often not the case, particularly in those cities where clean air policy actions are in place (14, 18) . Furthermore, air pollutant emissions change substantially from winter to spring; thus, a direct comparison of air pollutant concentrations before and during the lockdowns could also give unreliable results. Venter et al. (9) developed statistical models (regression) to estimate the impact of lockdowns on air quality in several countries. However, the performance of the regression was often limited with correlation coefficients as low as 0.2. He et al. (19) applied a \"difference-in-difference\" approach, which may provide a more accurate estimate of air quality improvement; this method assumes that the control cities are not subject to any impacts.",

To do this, we optimized a weather normalization technique based on Grange and Carslaw (13) and Vu et al. (14) to decouple the effects of meteorology from short-term emission changes on surface air quality monitoring data in 11 global cities that were subjected to extensive lockdown measures. The deweathered data allow us to quantitatively evaluate the real-world changes in air quality due to the lockdown measures in these cities (see Materials and Methods). These selected cities cover a range of air pollution climates, from highly to less polluted and from PM 2.5 -to NO 2 -dominated pollution. Data were divided into roadside, urban background, and rural sites to better understand the impacts of road traffic and urban emissions on air quality changes.",

Deweathered PM 2.5 at roadside sites in 2020 increased slightly during the lockdowns by +1.0 \u00b1 7.2% in London and +0.2 \u00b1 9.1% (P dew ) in Paris but decreased with changes (P dew ) ranging from \u22122.8 \u00b1 1.3% in New York to \u221237.8 \u00b1 4.8% in Los Angeles (table S2) . A similar trend is also observed in the deweathered PM 2.5 at urban background and rural sites ( Fig. 5 and fig.  S2 ). An obvious decrease in deweathered PM 2.5 at urban background sites during the same study periods was also observed in 2016-2019 in some cities but not in others ( Fig. 3 and auxiliary data table S1).

For example, a larger decline in P dew for deweathered PM 10 at roadside sites than that at urban background sites is observed in Beijing, Madrid, London, Paris, and Berlin (table S2) , potentially reflecting a coarse particle source from road traffic (e.g., non-exhaust emissions) (23) . Furthermore, in Los Angeles and Delhi, the decline in deweathered PM 10 is significantly larger than that of PM 2.5 whether at urban background or rural sites (table S2) , implying a reduced contribution of coarse particles to PM 10 .",

Observed daily average NO 2 concentrations are much higher than the deweathered ones during some periods. Our estimated NO 2 decline in Wuhan due to lockdown effects is much lower than that estimated by Le et al. (15) , who reported up to 93% reduction in NO 2 in Wuhan during the lockdown. If we look at the observations only, we can indeed see >90% decrease from the peak concentration before the lockdown began to the lowest one afterward (Fig. 2) , but this is mainly due to changes in meteorological conditions, not emissions. The observed PM 2.5 also exhibited remarkable meteorologically driven variability regardless of cities or site types and sometimes differed by more than a factor of 3 when compared with deweathered concentrations (Fig. 5 and  fig. S2 ). In general, major differences are apparent between the observed and deweathered results when the meteorological conditions change substantially over the study period. For example, the changes in observed and deweathered PM 2.5 at urban background sites in Beijing before and after the lockdown began were +19.2 \u00b1 108.6% (P obs ) and \u221219.3 \u00b1 9.6% (P dew ), respectively. In this case, emission reductions and the unfavorable meteorological conditions drove changes of approximately \u221219.3 and +38.6% in the observed levels, respectively, leading to an overall +19.2% increase in PM 2.5 . Our results demonstrate that meteorological variations, rather than emission changes on the scale of those occurring during the COVID-19 lockdowns, dominate short-term variability in air pollutant concentrations, which is consistent with previous studies (12, 14, 20, 24) . Apart from deweathering, detrending the \"business-as-usual\" changes is also crucial in estimating real changes attributable to interventions (i.e., lockdowns). In the \"business-as-usual\" scenario, air pollutant emissions (both anthropogenic and natural) and, thereby, concentrations may change from winter to spring, whether there is a lockdown or not (see 2016-2019 data in Fig. 3) . For example, a general increase in deweathered O 3 is observed from winter to spring in 2016-2019 in all the studied cities (Figs. 2 and 3 and fig.  S1 ). Such an increase reflects changing photochemical steady-state partitioning from NO 2 to O 3 (Northern Hemisphere cities moving into spring with increased solar radiation intensity and day length), alongside wider increases in photochemical ozone formation, enhanced by increased emission and chemical reactivity of VOCs.",

In some cities, there are considerable variabilities in P dew in 2016-2019 (Fig. 3) . This may be partly due to specific events such as holidays around the lockdown dates, leading to a decrease in air pollutant emissions for a particular year. In this instance, the absolute value of P dew in 2016-2019 could be slightly overestimated, and thus that of the P* underestimated.

Note also that anthropogenic air pollutant emissions reduce year by year, such as in London and Beijing, as a result of clean air policy actions and vehicle fleet evolution (14, 18) . Thus, the approach widely used in the literature to estimate the lockdown effects by subtracting NO 2 during the equivalent periods in earlier years from that in 2020 (6, 7, 11, 15) may also overestimate the effects attributed to the lockdowns (Fig. 3 and Table 1) .",

            "text": "The deweathered NO 2 showed a sudden decrease after the lockdown began in most of the cities (Fig. 2 and fig. S1 ). Detrended NO 2 at urban background sites declined the most in Delhi (\u221251.0 \u00b1 5.2%), Madrid (\u221235.2 \u00b1 21.3%), and Wuhan (\u221233.9 \u00b1 7.3%) ( Table 1) . A given reduction in NO x emission, and hence NO x abundance, is expected to lead to a smaller reduction in ambient NO 2 levels, as the fast NO x -O 3 photochemistry shifts the NO 2 /NO x ratio in favor of NO 2 . The fact that the NO x changes are larger than those of NO 2 supports this argument (tables S1 and S2). A substantially larger decline in NO x and NO 2 was observed at roadside than at urban background sites, suggesting that the decline in NO 2 during the lockdowns is largely driven by changes in road traffic as the dominant source of NO x in urban atmosphere (16) . Mobility data from Google Maps (https://google.com/covid19/mobility/) suggest that traffic volumes reduced by 60 to 80% in the cities considered here. However, this mobility decrease does not correspond directly to the same reduction in road traffic-related NO x emissions. For example, in London, although private car use reduced by about 80%, heavy good vehicles (HGVs) on the road only reduced by 30 to 40%. It is possible that if the change in the number of HGVs, which account for a smaller percentage of total vehicle population but a large proportion of vehicular NO x emissions (26, 27) , is small, then the changes in total road traffic emissions of NO x may be much smaller than expected. Decreases in activity levels from other combustion sources, such as power plants and industry (22) , may have contributed to the decline in NO 2 , at least in some cities, as shown by the small decline in SO 2 in some cities ( fig. S4 ). Such changes are difficult to quantify, but the much smaller (and absence of any sudden) changes in SO 2 compared with NO 2 (Fig. 2 and fig. S2 )-as indicated by the increase in SO 2 /NO 2 ratio in Wuhan, London, Paris, Rome, and Delhi (auxiliary data table S1)-suggest that reductions in NO x emissions from stationary sources were less than those from traffic emissions. This is consistent with Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. that in Europe and the United States, electricity use reduced by 9 and 5%, respectively. Note also that domestic emissions may have increased with an increase in people working or studying from home. We recognize that our methodology is unable to attribute the actual changes in emissions on a sector-by-sector basis. This could be revisited in the future when emission inventories for the spring 2020 lockdown period are developed and evaluated against observations. O 3 is a secondary pollutant, and its variation is driven by several factors. Dominant among these is the NO x -O 3 photochemical steady state. The decrease in NO (tables S1 and S2) led to reduced O 3 titration, through which reductions in traffic-related NO emissions translate directly into increases in O 3 , relative to the prelockdown period; the time constant for this NO x -O 3 interaction in daylight is of the order of minutes. The fact that deweathered O 3 increased suddenly after the lockdown began and that changes in deweathered NO were more pronounced than those in NO x and NO 2 , particularly at roadside sites ( fig. S1 and table S2 ), support this well-understood atmospheric chemistry (28) . This effect-of a reduced urban decrement in O 3 -will be partially offset by reductions in primary NO 2 emissions from traffic and, on a much longer time scale (hours to days, rather than minutes), by net O 3 production. Under an extreme condition, if all traffic-related NO x emissions are assumed to be NO, O x would remain unchanged in response to lockdown-driven changes in traffic (but NO 2 would decrease, and O 3 would increase). In reality, primary NO 2 emissions from road traffic decreased during the lockdowns, so O x should fall. Detrended O x fell slightly at roadside and urban background sites in most of the cities (Table 1 and table S3) .",

Deweathered PM 2.5 reduced after the lockdowns began at urban background sites in most of the cities, including Wuhan, Rome, New York, Los Angeles, and Delhi ( fig. S2 ). This could be explained by (i) the expected reductions in primary emissions of PM 2.5 and its gaseous precursors (e.g., NO 2 , SO 2 , and VOCs) during the lockdowns and (ii) limited change in the formation rate of secondary aerosol as shown by the small variation in PM 2.5 /CO ratio ( fig.

It also increased in Beijing after the lockdown began, although for a shorter period. One possible explanation for this unexpected result is that enhanced secondary aerosol formation overwhelmed the reduced primary PM 2.5 emissions. In Chinese megacities, secondary particles typically contribute to >50% of PM 2.5 mass (31, 32) . In London, secondary aerosols contribute roughly half of PM 2.5 at roadside sites, increasing to ~90% of PM 2.5 at rural sites, with the contribution lying between these values at urban background sites (33) . Such contributions are even larger during pollution events (15, 16, 31) . Thus, changes in PM 2.5 are often driven by variations in secondary aerosols, particularly during pollution events. In Beijing, Sun et al. (34) noted that primary aerosol decreased by 30 to 50%, while secondary inorganic aerosol and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) increased by 60 to 110% and 52 to 175%, respectively, during the early periods of the lockdown in 2020. The fact that substantial increases in PM 2.5 /PM 10 (Paris) or PM 2.5 /CO (London; fig. S5 ) ratios accompanied the increase in deweathered PM 2.5 (Fig. 5 and  fig. S2 ) also supports the greater role of secondary aerosol during the study period in Paris and London. Zhao et al. (35) suggested that SOA formation depends nonlinearly on the ratio of VOCs to NO x ; reduction in NO x emissions may lead to increased production of SOA given imbalanced emission abatement of NO x and VOCs. Le et al. (15) indicated that multiphase chemistry and enhanced atmospheric oxidative capacity drove haze events in China during the lockdowns. Huang et al. (16) also suggested that increase in oxidative capacity during lockdown in China/Beijing caused the observed air pollution events; however, the changes in deweathered O x levels (P dew ) at urban background sites are rather small: Beijing (\u22121.1 \u00b1 2.0%), London (+4.2 \u00b1 0.8%), and Paris (+2.1 \u00b1 0.6%) (table S2).",

In theory, the RF models should have normalized the impacts from longrange transport by including back-trajectory clusters. However, the model may not be able to perfectly reproduce secondary formation processes arising from long-range transport if there were limited cases to learn from, especially as such events tend to be episodic in nature. In this case, the model will treat pollution events arising from long-range transport as if there are higher emissions; this attribution will be retained during deweathering. This will cause uncertainties in the model. More observational data and modeling are needed to fully understand the phenomenon of increases in PM 2.5 in London, Paris, and Beijing during the lockdowns. However, it is clear that a small reduction in primary PM 2.5 emissions (e.g., from vehicular emission changes during lockdown) could be readily overwhelmed by enhanced secondary formation and/or PM 2.5 transported from more polluted regions.",

Thereafter, the deweathered PM 2.5 did decrease more significantly (P dew = \u221227.0 \u00b1 18.7%). Similarly, in Beijing, the deweathered PM 2.5 decreased 2 weeks after the lockdown began, so overall P dew is negative (\u221219.3 \u00b1 9.6%). These results suggest that if the reduction in emissions of gaseous precursors is sufficiently large, it should eventually lead to an overall decline in PM 2.5 .

However, the detrended percentage decline (i.e., attributed to lockdown effects) in NO 2 is mostly below 30%. This is lower than the expected decline, partly due to the 8 of 10 NO x -O 3 photochemical steady state (converting NO to NO 2 ), alongside seasonal effects, and partly due to the still important emissions of NO x from stationary and mobile pollution sources. Detrended O 3 increased in most cities. This adds to the complexity of air pollution control, considering the potentially adverse impacts of O 3 on human (37, 38) and environmental health, including crop yields (39) . PM 2.5 exhibited a more complex response to the lockdown measures. PM 2.5 did not show an immediate decline to the lockdown measures except in Wuhan, Rome, and Los Angeles, even at the roadside sites. This is not too unexpected considering the relatively small contribution of road traffic to primary PM 2.5 in most of the cities studied here and a large contribution from secondary sources (16, 31) . In China, much of the recent decrease in PM 2.5 came from the reductions in residential solid fuel use and industrial activity rather than traffic emissions (18, 40) . Nevertheless, a decrease in deweathered PM 2.5 is observed in most of the cities.",

            "text": "Eleven cities were selected to ensure coverage of contrasting pollution climate: Beijing and Wuhan in China, Milan and Rome in Italy, Madrid in Spain, London in United Kingdom, Paris in France, Berlin in Germany, New York and Los Angeles in the United States, and Delhi in India. Of those, eight are capital cities. Wuhan was added because it was the first city where COVID-19 was reported and lockdown was first imposed. Milan was included because it is in northern Italy, one of the most seriously hit areas after Wuhan. In the United States, New York was the most seriously affected city, whereas Los Angeles was reported to have observed a greater decline in air pollution levels (43) . All the study cities have been significantly affected by COVID-19 and implemented stringent lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Such measures were first implemented in Wuhan from 23 January 2020 and then 2 days later in all provinces in China (including Beijing). Tightened restrictive measures were implemented from 23 January 2020 in northern Italy, 13 Site-specific hourly concentration of six criteria pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , CO, and SO 2 ) and other auxiliary pollutants (NO and NO x ) from December 2015 to May 2020 were obtained from websites of local or national environmental agency or accredited third parties (table S4) . In most cases, data from multiple stations for each site type are available. The NO 2 concentrations reported from local governments, typically performed by the widely used molybdenum conversion/chemiluminescence method, may slightly overestimate true NO 2 levels due to conversion of other labile N species to NO in the convertor stage. This problem is usually small for polluted urban sites but is larger for rural sites where overestimates of 17 to 30% have been reported (44) . This is due to the conversion of NO x from primary sources to secondary nitrogen compounds during its transport toward more rural locations. Hence, concentrations reported as NO 2 contain a small proportion of other NO y species, and the \"true\" NO 2 levels would be lower than those officially reported, particularly at rural locations. We note that such uncertainties are effectively \"built in\" to monitor NO 2 with respect to regulatory standards. NO x and NO data were obtained in cities where those data were publicly available. Data were usually downloaded from official sources, which are validated by the authorities. For those cities where data were not available from recognized official sources (i.e., Los Angeles and New York) at the time of access, we obtained the air quality data from the \"OpenAQ\" platform (https://openaq.org/). Data from Los Angeles were downloaded from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) later (after the data analyses were done here), which were then compared with those from OpenAQ. We found that the site-specific data in Los Angeles from OpenAQ are highly correlated (slope = ~1, intercept = ~0) with those from USEPA. Air quality monitoring stations were selected to cover roadside, urban background, and rural sites when possible, and the site types were based on official classifications and maps. The downloaded data were screened and cleaned when necessary, following established methods (24) .",

In addition, hourly data for boundary layer height, total cloud cover, surface net solar radiation, and total precipitation at the selected sites were downloaded from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset (ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1979 to present). For each site, 72-hour back trajectories at an hourly resolution were calculated using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The starting height was set as 100 m to ensure that the receptor was aloft but remained within the boundary layer throughout the study period. The back trajectories were then clustered into 12 clusters using the Euclidian distance by \"openair\" R package (https://CRAN.R-project. org/package=openair).

Although these stations were built to represent the specific environment of the city (i.e., roadside, urban background, and rural), there may be some variabilities in the concentrations of air pollutants at different stations of the same type. This could cause potential uncertainties in our analyses if to represent the whole city. In this study, wherever possible, we used data from multiple stations for each site type (table S4) , which reduced this uncertainty. Where only one station is available for a site type, the data may be subject to more influence from local emission sources. Therefore, what we reported here should be treated in the context of the site availability (see table S4 ). Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that our analyses focus on the high-resolution temporal variations, and thus, the trend will be broadly representative.",

Here, we applied a machine learning-based RF algorithm to decouple the effects of meteorological conditions. To do this, we first build an RF model for each pollutant and for each year (December to May). The RF model-based weather normalization technique was introduced in Grange et al. (12) . Briefly, the RF model was built independently for each period (December 2015 to May 2016, December 2016 to May 2017, December 2017 to May 2018, December 2018 to May 2019, and December 2019 to May 2020), each pollutant, and each site type within a city. Seventy percent of the original data were randomly selected to build the model, which was then evaluated with the remainder (30%) of the dataset. Model performance for each pollutant and each time period (i.e., 2016-2020) is illustrated in fig. S6 . Similar to Grange et al. (12, 13) and Vu et al. (14) , the perform ance of the models is usually very good, much better than that of regression models (9) . The weather normalization was conducted using the \"rmweather\" R package, available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/ packages/rmweather/index.html.",

Vu et al. (14) modified the default method to investigate the seasonal variations in trends for comparison with trends in primary emissions, by only resampling the weather variables (not the time variables). Specifically, weather variables at a specific hour of a particular day in the input datasets were generated by randomly selecting from the historical weather data (past 30 years) at the particular hour of different dates within a 4-week period (i.e., 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after that selected date). The two methods are fit for their own purposes but were not used here because (i) Grange et al. (12) normalized the diurnal and seasonal variations of the primary emissions, which is unrealistic in the real world, and (ii) although Vu et al. (14) provided diurnal and seasonal variations of the primary emissions, this is inappropriate in detecting short-term emission interventions because the normalized concentrations for a particular hour of a Julian day were not comparable with those from the different hour of a different Julian day, considering that they were resampled from different weather datasets, which would be affected by different seasonal weather conditions.",

The improved method is more suitable for tracking emission changes. The input features for the model included time variables (i.e., Unix time, Julian day, day of the week, and hour of the day), meteorological data from surface observations (i.e., temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure), meteorological data from ERA5 reanalysis dataset (i.e., boundary layer height, total cloud cover, surface net solar radiation, and total precipitation), and air mass clusters based on the HYSPLIT back trajectories. The day of week and air mass clusters were categorical variables, while all others were numeric. Following Vu et al. (14) , the parameters for the RF models are as follows: a forest of 300 trees, n_tree = 300; the number of variables that may split at each node, mtry = 3; and the minimum size of terminal nodes, min_node_size = 3. For every weather normalization, the explanatory variables were resampled (excluding the time variables) without replacement and randomly allocated to a dependent variable observation.
