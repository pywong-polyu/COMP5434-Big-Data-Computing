This study aimed to explore the views of stakeholders on policies to protect URAS well-being in Thailand. This study conducted a mixedmethods approach comprising both in-depth interviews and Delphi survey. The interview findings revealed six main themes: (1) the government position on URAS; (2) opinions on Thailand becoming a party of the 1951 Refugee Convention; (3) NGOs on health promotion for URAS; (4) options on health insurance management for URAS; (5) working potential of URAS; and (6) uncertainty of future life plans for URAS. The Delphi survey showed that URAS should have the right to acquire a work permit and be enrolled in the public insurance scheme managed by the Ministry of Public Health. Moreover, the ideology of national security was more influential than the concept of human rights. The ambiguity of the central authorities' policy direction to take care of URAS creates haphazard legal interpretations. The Delphi survey findings suggested the need for a more inclusive policy for URAS, however actual policy implementation requires further research on policy feasibility and acceptance by the wider public.",

Approximately 68% of refugees globally originated from five countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Thailand faced a huge influx of refugees from Myanmar because of the conflict between ethnic groups and the Myanmar government. To date, there are nine temporary shelters for almost 100,000 refugees [10] . Apart from sheltering refugees along the border, Thailand is a host country for urban refugees and asylum seekers (URAS). The majority of URAS live in the capital city, Bangkok, approximately 5000. The well-being of sheltered refugees shows tangible advancement as it is relatively straightforward to implement a policy in a well-defined geographical space. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the International Rescue Committee, provide additional humanitarian assistance in the shelters. In contrast, the health of URAS in Thailand has not been widely discussed in most policy dialogues [11] . In addition, almost all URAS live scattered across the city, creating difficulty in identifying a main responsible agency to take a pivotal role to protect the health of URAS at the utmost. A greater understanding about necessary health policies that support the health of URAS has important public health implications as URAS are necessarily involved with Thailand's quest to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). The Thai government has set a clear direction for UHC where 'all people' on Thai soil must have their health protected. This is stipulated in many policy documents such as the Border Health Plan of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) (2017-2521) [12] and Strategies for National Health Insurance Development of the National Health Security Office (2017-2521) [13] .",

For Thai interviewees, the interviews either took place face-to-face in the workplace of the informant, or, during a telephone interview, in a private room. For URAS informants, we used face to face interview at the office of Bangkok Refugee Center (BRC). BRC is the main NGO under the patronage of UNHCR. The main function of the BRC is to provide legal support and counselling for URAS. The BRC staff also assisted the research team to recruit URAS who could serve as the informant for the study. However, the BRC staff did not present themselves during the interview with URAS. Only the researchers and URAS informants presented during the interview in BRC private room. A purposive sampling was used to identify key informants and additional informants were identified by snowball selection.

The total number of 37 interviewees consisted of nine representatives from NGOs with work experience on URAS, five representatives from the MOPH, five independent academics, four healthcare providers in public health facilities where URAS usually visited, four policymakers from the National Health Security Office (NHSO), Ministry of Labor (MOL), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), and Ministry of Interior (MOI), three representatives from international development agencies, and seven URAS from six nationalities (Afghani, Iraqi, Pakistani, Somali, Sri Lankan, and Vietnamese), Table 1 . For the quantitative strand, a Delphi survey was exercised. We invited the informants from the prior in-depth interviews to take part in the Delphi survey. However, only thirteen informants agreed to participate (four NGO staff, three policymakers, two representatives from international development agencies, one academic, and one healthcare provider). The survey began by circulating the questionnaire via an electronic mail to these thirteen participants. We then collected their responses and sent the questionnaire back to them for another two rounds. In the later rounds, the participants were able to view the group's responses. Two participants dropped out in the later rounds. This meant, finally, eleven participants completed the three-round survey. Once the survey was completed, we then re-interviewed or had an informal discussion with some interviewees to triangulate the survey results against the survey responses (and vice versa) and to assess if any additional themes would emerge. The data were collected in the office computer with password protection. Only the principal investigator could access the interview data. The linkage between the interview and the Delphi survey is visualized in Figure 1 .",

If there were any contradictory issues between the two coders, a consultation with a public health expert of the filed would be performed. The manual coding was performed. Microsoft Excel was used to store the quotes. We presented a coding tree in Supplementary File S2. The interview data were triangulated with the field note and policy documents if needed. Before the final report was published, the researchers arranged a stakeholder meeting on 17 August 2020 to ask for feedback or comment on the findings.

Therefore, a more practical approach for UN agencies and NGOs is to comply with the local government. However, this approach has a setback as most of the NGOs' (or even UNHCR's) activities usually end up with a humanitarian relief for URAS (or any activities that make URAS more \"resilient\" with the status quo health system) as it is less disputable compared with shaking the structural problems or recognizing URAS as part of the society on equitable grounds with the nationals [19] .",

Whether Thailand will become a party of the 1951 Refugee Convention or not may not be so important, what may be more important is to have a clear stance on the Thai government's responsibility to take care of URAS.",

Moreover, the Thai government should learn from international experience, especially from countries that accepted a refugee influx while refraining from the 1951 Refugee Convention. Janmyr raised the case of Lebanon as an example of a country that is not a party of the 1951 Refugee Convention, but is hailed by the international community for its generosity towards refugees as probably hosting the highest number of refugees in the world in proportion to its population size [25] . Lebanon already has human rights obligations towards refugees on its territory by virtue of membership of the United Nations and its ratification of a number of core human rights instruments [25] . Another interesting issue is the URAS right to work and eligibility to be enrolled in public health insurance in Thailand. For the right to work, Brown et al. suggested that the lack of legal instruments to allow URAS to work legitimately has caused URAS to face a greater risk of being arrested or detained [26] .",

Most of this study's interviewees, including those who participating in the Delphi survey, indicated that the right to work should be implemented as soon as possible with no critical disagreement from the wider public.

According to Elsouhang et al. possessing health insurance was significantly associated with increased utilization of medical services among Iraqi refugees in the United States of America [33] . In the Thai context, the financial difficulties that URAS face are not just a matter concerning the work performance of an individual, but these also intertwine with the legal design of a system that does not allow URAS to work legitimately. Moreover, the inclusion of URAS in public health insurance schemes may benefit not only URAS, but the health system as a whole. A substantial volume of literature shows that the exclusion of non-national populations (such as migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers) from official primary health care might save costs early on, but this effect might be lost as costs are shifted to healthcare providers in secondary care or community settings [34] . Again, the promotion of the right to public health insurance for URAS is interlinked with the affordability of insurance, which is also linked to the right to work. It is also linked to the regulation of the state which needs to be clearly specified in laws or official state regulations in order to avoid haphazard interpretation by local healthcare providers [35] .",

Those who were detained in detention centers and those living in the temporary shelter areas along the country border were excluded. A discussion on policies to take care of the health of these populations necessitates a more extensive review on the relevant laws and perhaps requires a wider range of interviewees (including police and state prosecutors). Secondly, the issue of healthcare for URAS is relatively sensitive. According to research ethics, in the fieldwork, the researchers needed to disclose their own work status as persons working with the MOPH, which may have created an unfavorable feeling among the URAS interviewees. For example, some URAS might feel uncomfortable disclosing their life stories or unpleasant experiences with state officials to the researchers. In contrast, state official interviewees may have tended to answer the interview questions in a way that tried to meet the researchers' expectation (social desirability bias). However, the researchers addressed these issues by using methodological triangulations (such as contrasting the interview findings with the review on policy documents). Lastly, suggestions from the interviews or Delphi survey (for instance, the provision of rights to employment and public health insurance enrollment) does not mean final consensus from policy experts and of course does not mean that these suggestions can be implemented without societal disagreement. In reality, to implement such policies, there needs a much wider consultative process from all angles of the political sphere. Further studies that explore policy feasibility for URAS are of great value.",

The right to legitimate employment and public insurance enrollment are issues that should be implemented soon in order to improve URAS's livelihoods. Further studies that examine the feasibility of implementing these proposals and the extension of studies to cover refugees and asylum seekers from non-urban settings, such as detainment centers or sheltered areas, are recommended.
