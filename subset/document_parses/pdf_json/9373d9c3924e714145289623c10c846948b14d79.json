The extrapulmonary effects and modes of transmission gained attention when the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reported from the United States had gastrointestinal (GI) complaints of nausea and vomiting followed later by diarrhea and patient's fecal specimen tested positive on day 7 of illness. 2 Initial studies reported lower rates of GI symptoms such as diarrhea of 1 to 3.8%.

Once attached to the spike protein (S), the viral genome enters the cells, uses human cell machinery, and produces multiple viral particles to be released to infect other cells. To contain the virus, the immune mechanism steps in and a disproportionate immune response leads to flooding of the alveoli with fluid and damaging the epithelium of the alveoli hampering oxygen exchange resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. 4, 5, 11, 12 A large epidemiological data of 72,314 cases from China 13 showed an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%.

Both biopsy of small intestine and rectal swabs have been detected to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. 21 The mechanisms postulated for causation of diarrhea in COVID-19 infection are: (1) direct virus entry through ACE-2 receptor causing malabsorption, unbalanced intestinal secretion, and activated enteric nervous system; (2) direct/indirect damage to the intestinal epithelium by inflammatory response 22 ; (3) antibiotic and/or antiviral drugs-induced intestinal dysbiosis; (4) virus-induced disorders of the intestinal flora 23 ; (5) \"gut-lung axis\" disturbances wherein respiratory flora alteration affects the digestive system by immune regulation. 24 The evidence of shedding of the virus through feces is another definitive proof of GI involvement and a potential route for transmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 79, "end": 82, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 83, "end": 86, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 87, "end": 89, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 154, "end": 156, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 556, "end": 558, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 688, "end": 690, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 936, "end": 938, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1492, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology"}, {"text": "The commonly encountered GI symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia.

The correlation between severity of disease and GI symptoms is dubious. Some studies such as those by Fang et al 25 and Guan et al 3 found no difference in the digestive symptom rates between the critically ill and the nonsevere cases. On the contrary, Wang et al 27 recorded higher rates of GI symptoms among ICU patients (anorexia 66.7% vs. 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs. 0%) compared with the less severe cases.

However, theoretically, IBD portends an enhanced risk of infection by two mechanisms: (1) the virus receptor, ACE-2, has increased tissue concentration in the inflamed mucosa of active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. 39 Moreover, the serine protease level, the key primer to activate S-protein is 10 times higher in patients with IBD than others. 40 Both these factors contribute to enhanced viral attachment to the host cell and thus, increased infection and (2) IBD patients who are already on immunosuppressive medications may be at a higher risk of infection. In fact, active disease with thiopurines has been shown to increase the infection potential. 41 Of late, International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) opined that vedolizumab and ustekinumab do not increase infection risk, while thiopurines, antitumor necrosis factor agents, and tofacitinib might pose debatable risk. 42 Another factor due to the COVID-19 effect is the lack of the regular OPD services. Impaired compliance with discontinuation of medications has led to reports of disease exacerbation. This is more likely to happen in India, wherein majority of the patients hail from poor socioeconomic background with lack of proper awareness or social support. In a questionnaire survey by Bai et al, 43 among 123 IBD cases, 18 (14.4%) had exacerbation and 70.4% stated that COVID-19 impacted their scheduled follow-up. Probably, the advocacy of the facilities of \"tele-medicine\" would be able to untangle a part of this complex sociomedical issue. Thus, with inadequate data of increased risk for IBD subgroup, 42 longer clearance time for certain drugs, such as thiopurine, 44 increased risk of disease flare on stopping IBD medications 45 and poor hospital/clinic backup for chronic cases, 46 it is tricky to ensure best management for active disease. Real-world data on the actual outcome of patients with IBD and COVID-19 infection are lacking. An international registry (SECURE-IBD) 47 has been formulated for this purpose, and as of now, the initial data show that of the 580 patients registered, 70% were treated on OPD basis, while 30% required hospitalization and 5% required ventilator support with 3% mortality. Thus, not only the infection rate but also the severity is similar for IBD cases compared with non-IBD. 48 Multiple societies have come up with guidelines for the management of IBD during this COVID-19 pandemic.
