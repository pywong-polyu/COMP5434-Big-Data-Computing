Data Augmentation techniques improve the generalizability of neural networks by using existing training data more effectively. Standard data augmentation methods, however, produce limited plausible alternative data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been utilized to generate new data and improve the performance of CNNs. Nevertheless, data augmentation techniques for training GANs are underexplored compared to CNNs. In this work, we propose a new GAN architecture for augmentation of chest X-rays for semi-supervised detection of pneumonia and COVID-19 using generative models. We show that the proposed GAN can be used to effectively augment data and improve classification accuracy of disease in chest X-rays for pneumonia and COVID-19. We compare our augmentation GAN model with Deep Convolutional GAN and traditional augmentation methods (rotate, zoom, etc.) on two different X-ray datasets and show our GAN-based augmentation method surpasses other augmentation methods for training a GAN in detecting anomalies in X-ray images.",

One of the main reasons for poor CNN performance and overfitting on training data remains limited-sized datasets in many domains such as medical imaging. Improving the performance of CNNs can be achieved by using the existing data more effectively. Augmentation methods such as random rotations, flips, and adding various noise profiles have been proposed [4, 5] as some methods of augmentation. Typical data augmentation techniques use a limited series of invariances that are easy to compute however (rotation, flips, etc.), limited in the amount of new data they can generate.",

Data Augmentation GAN (DAGAN) [13] was able to improve the performance of basic CNN classifiers on EMNIST (images of handwritten digits), VGG-Face (images of human faces) and Omniglot (images of handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets) datasets by training DAGAN in a source domain and generating new data for the target domain. There has not been any study on data augmentation using GANs for training other GANs. The challenge with using a GAN to augment data for another GAN is that newly generated images with the trained generator of the GAN follow the same distribution as the training images, and hence there is no new information to be learned by another GAN that is trained on the original images combined with the newly generated (augmented) images.",

We showed that a trained IAGAN model can generate new X-ray images, independent of image labels, and improve the accuracy of generative models. We evaluated the performance of IAGAN model by training a DCGAN for anomaly detection (AnoGAN) [22] and showed improved results in classifying pneumonia and COVID-19 positive cases with improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. We showed our trained IAGAN is able to generate new domain specific data regardless of the class of its input images. This allowed for an unsupervised data augmentation, in the case of not having labels for a subset of the images in the dataset. By training the same DCGAN model on the augmented data using traditional augmentation methods and generating new data using another DCGAN for the task of augmentation, we showed the ineffectiveness of these methods in successful augmentation of data for training a generative model compared to our IAGAN for detecting pneumonia and COVID-19 images. At each iteration , as input, the generator (G) takes a Gaussian noise vector and a batch of real training image . By encoding the input images using convolution and attention layers to a lowerdimensional representation, before concatenating this representation of the image with the projected noise vector (concatenation happens after goes through a dense layer and non-linearity), we aim to not only use the full image representation using the discriminator, but also get a lower representation of images fed through the generator for better generalizability of G in generating images. The dual input to the generator also allows the trained generator to use images from different classes and generate a broader range of images to augment our specific training data class. The use of attention layers in GANs (Fig. 2 ) has shown to capture long-range dependencies in the image [24] where simple convolution layers focus on local features restricted by their receptive field, self-attention layers capture a broader range of features within the image. The attention layer uses three 1 \u00d7 1 convolutions. 1 \u00d7 1 convolution helps to reduce the number of channels in the network. Two of the convolution outputs, as suggested by Fig. 2 , are multiplied (matrix multiplication) and fed to a softmax activation, which results in producing the attention map. The attention map acts as the probability of each pixel affecting the output of the third convolution layer. Feeding a lower-dimensional representation of an input image allows for the trained generator to use images from different classes to produce similar never-before-seen images of the class it was trained on.",

After calculating two anomaly scores for each test image, one calculated by each AnoGAN, the sum of two anomaly scores was assigned as the final anomaly score for the test image. The idea is that the AnoGAN trained on normal images will result in lower anomaly score for normal images during test while AnoGAN trained on pneumonia images results in lower scores for pneumonia images. In both networks, the COVID-19 images produce higher anomaly scores hence the COVID-19 final anomaly score will be higher than the normal and pneumonia classes.

With 589 test images from each class (normal, pneumonia and COVID-19) in dataset II, we calculated the AUC for the balanced COVID-19 negative class vs. COVID-19 positive test images. The balanced COVID-19 negative class was created by randomly sampling 294 normal and 295 pneumonia images from 589 normal and 589 pneumonia test images. Table 4 shows the calculated AUC for datasets I and II. It can be seen that our proposed IAGAN augmentation method outperforms all other three models for both Dataset I and II: no augmentation, DCGAN, and traditional augmentation methods. DeLong test [32] was used to compare the AUC of the models by calculating the p-value for significance difference. The p-values are added next to the AUC of each augmentation method and measures the significance of the model compared to the model trained with no augmentation.",

We used the AnoGAN [22] architecture to show when the training data is augmented using our proposed IAGAN method, the AUC improves by 3% and 2%, compared to no augmentation, for dataset I and II, respectively.

We showed that by training IAGAN on a specific class, we were able to use all classes to generate new data for that specific class. Effective training of generative models for medical imaging can be specially helpful to detect anomalies in classes where we do not have enough data/labels for effectively training CNN models. The COVID-19 pandemic is a great example for the importance of generative models, where no images are required for this class of images in order to detect images of this class [23] . Advances in generative models for detection of anomalies can allow for fast deployment of such models at a time where adequate number of labeled images for the new disease are not available for the effective training of CNNs. It is worth mentioning that while an architecture like CycleGAN [33] uses images as input to its generator, to train a CycleGAN, images from two different domain (i.e normal and pneumonia) are used to learn the transition of one image domain to the other. While this could allow for augmenting data from one class to the other, it would require having enough labeled data for all classes and does not allow for single class data augmentation (i.e augmenting normal dataset using partially labeled chest X-rays with only available label being normal) as is enabled by IAGAN.",

Since the down-sampled image is concatenated with G's other input early on in the network, the effects of the input image might be associated with the added vector size, having the same effect as adding the same image with randomly sampled pixel valued. We trained the IAGAN but this time, the input images were randomly generated. The IAGAN failed to generate realistic images using random input images. This confirms that our proposed IAGAN architecture that encodes the input images using convolution and attention layers to a lower-dimensional representation, before concatenating with the projected noise is an effective way to generate meaningful images and augment data.
