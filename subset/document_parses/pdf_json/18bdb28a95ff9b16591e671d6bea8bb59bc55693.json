This disease has spread worldwide since then, and in March 2020, it was declared a pandemic by WHO. Nearly 6 months after the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in September 2020, COVID-19 cases in India once again started rising from the first week of March leading to a deadlier second wave of COVID-19 in the country. As of June 11, 2021, more than 29 million cases have been confirmed in India. More than 300,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in India, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.",

The progression to severe COVID-19 is particularly more in 11 elderly and immune-compromised individuals. It is a beta-coronavirus belonging to the same subgenus as the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The symptoms appear within 11.5 days in over 95% of the infected persons with a median incubation period of about 5.5 days. [1] This disease can cause venous and arterial thrombosis which can lead to stroke, myocardial infarction as well as pulmonary embolism. Severe COVID-19 has been associated with a systemic reaction characterized by raised serum ferritin and hyper-inflammation due to cytokines storm which eventually leads to multiorgan failure. [2] The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is found to be used by the SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. The latest study has shown that ACE-2 receptors are highly expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells and bile duct cells. [3] Huang C, et al. [4] studied the liver biopsy specimen of COVID-19 patients and found moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular inflammation. These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may cause hepatic injury.",

            "text": "Our study has shown that 44.2% of COVID-19 patients had liver dysfunction and it has increased to 68.9% in severe cases. The males were affected more than the females. Several studies have shown that the male gender, age more than 60, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular illness), and secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome were associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. [10, 6] Cai Q, et al. have shown that there was a significant increase in serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, and other liver-related parameters in severe COVID-19 patients. They also demonstrated that gradually the liver parameters became normal with the recovery of patients. [11] In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, it has been shown that 33.3% of the COVID-19 cases had elevated AST and 24.1% had elevated ALT. [12] A correlation between the severity of liver dysfunction and the severity of COVID-19 has also been reported by other investigators. [13] [14] [15] In a study, one COVID-19 patient had severe hepatitis with liver enzymes more than 200 times than normal. [5] However, in our study, none of the patients had liver enzymes more than four times the normal value. In a study done in Shanghai, 50.7% of the total patients in the study had deranged LFT at the time of hospitalization. Interestingly, a large number of these patients had severe symptoms when compared with the patients with normal LFT (44% vs. 27.4%; P = 0.035). [10] Only a few patients with mild symptoms experienced abnormal LFT values. In a systematic review and meta-analysis by Xin Zhao, [16] a total of 57 review articles from China were included. They have studied 9,889 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The results showed that in patients with mild COVID-19, the incidence of liver dysfunction was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4-26.4%). The liver dysfunction was found in a larger number of severe patients as compared to the mild patients (risk ratio 2.07 [95% CI, 1.77-2.43]). Further analysis showed that as the severity of COVID-19 increases, the level of AST, ALT, total bilirubin, glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increases and the level of albumin reduces. These studies support the concept that the degree In a majority of clinical studies, regardless of pre-existing chronic liver disease, COVID-19 was associated with mild-to-moderate liver failure. Many patients had raised transaminase levels, raised GGT and ALP levels (less frequently), low protein levels, and prolongation of prothrombin time. [17, 18] Deranged transaminases, especially in men, lead to a severe course of disease compared to others. Moreover, hypoalbuminemia has been identified as an independent marker of severe COVID-19, with a poor prognosis and higher chances of mortality. [19] [20] [21] [22] Baroiu L, et al. [23] Studied 849 patients of COVID-19 treatment and found that 388 patients had abnormal liver enzymes. They also observed that patients with liver dysfunction were older, had comorbidities, and had a more severe course.",
