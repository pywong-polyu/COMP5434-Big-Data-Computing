The aim was to examine relationships between stress, anxiety, and specific time management related factors. Considering possible differences between genders and degree levels, we developed five structural equation models (SEMs) to delineate these relationships. Results of a large-scale study of 502 participants show that students suffered from stress and two types of COVID-19-related anxiety: disease and consequences. Students' preference for organization was the only factor that significantly promoted their perceived control over time, which contributes to reducing stress, hence, anxiety. However, female students reported higher stress and anxiety levels than male students. Graduate students reported higher anxiety levels related to the consequences of the pandemic compared to undergrads. To promote students' preference for organization, we map the three categories of organization to corresponding persuasive strategies which could be used in the design of persuasive interventions. This creates an opportunity for developing technological interventions to improve students' perceived control over time, thus, reduce stress and anxiety.",

During these times, the requirement of social distancing and self-quarantine has imposed unconventional lifestyles with which harmful habits may have developed, compromising the welfare of whole populations [42] [5] . In higher education, the sudden transition from Face-to-Face to online teaching has introduced pedagogies that place students in complete charge of their learning. Moreover, the use of virtual platforms has widely increased to simulate classroom interaction in which synchronous learning is facilitated. Experiencing academic pressure in such educational environments can substantially contribute to students' high stress levels, affecting their performance [7] .",

Task prioritization strategy requires a distinction between important and urgent tasks [28] . In the Time Management Matrix, also known as Eisenhower's Matrix (Figure 1 ), Covey et al. categorized tasks into four quadrants -urgent, not urgent, important, and not important -and suggested possible strategies for managing tasks depending on their urgency and importance [12] . The use of personal planning tools, such as electronic planners, pocket diaries, calendars, computer programs, wall charts, index cards, and notebooks, is another strategy recommended to improve work productivity [9] . Contrary to the common belief that multi-tasking saves time, studies in human psychology have shown the opposite is often the case. Swinging between tasks wastes time and impacts productivity [43] . When it becomes routine, multi-tasking may lead to difficulties to focus when needed [43] . Improper time allocation and last-minute cramming for exams are causes of stress and poor academic outcomes [31] . Practicing effective time management strategies, such as setting goals and priorities and monitoring progress over time [23] , is expected to improve students' perceived control over time [26] . Research shows that improved perceived control over time has a significant positive impact on students' perceptions and attitudes toward work and life, promoting productivity and minimizing stress levels [23] [26] . Exploring how perceived control over time influences students' stress and various stress-related outcomes, Nonis et al. reported that students with high perceived control over time experienced lower academic stress levels and had higher academic performance and problem-solving abilities (i.e., approach-avoidance and personal control), which contributed to better health (i.e., physiological and psychological health) compared with those with low perceived control over time [32] .",

This means that all students suffered from the two types of anxiety during the pandemic. Figure 4 shows the average and distribution results of each type. Fig. 4 . Boxplot of students' responses (on a scale from 1 to 5, y-axis) to types of pandemic anxiety (PAS-9). Neutral rating is represented by the red horizontal line. Higher rating indicates higher anxiety. Table 4 summarizes the results of PAS-9. Students' results are presented by gender and degree level. Significant relationship was also found between anxiety and gender. Generally, female students reported higher average scores in both types of anxiety, PAS disease (t(500) = -3.26, p < .01) and PAS consequences t(500)= -3.81, (p < .0001), compared to male students. While both undergraduate and graduate students reported similar average scores in PAS disease, graduate students reported a higher average score in the PAS consequences (t(500) = -2.29, p < .05) compared to undergraduate students. Therefore, there is an association between anxiety related to pandemic consequences and students' degree level. Graduates suffer from higher anxiety as a result of pandemic consequences compared to undergraduates. ",

Although \"fight-or-flight\" is a common characterization of human physiological and behavioral response to stress [1] [47] , females are more likely to respond differently. With a behavioral response that manifests in a pattern of \"tend and befriend\", females tend to create and maintain a social network that may aid in this process [50] . During the pandemic, the life-threatening situation and the implementation of strict public health measures, including the requirement of social distancing and self-quarantine, have affected social relationships between people and their empathy towards others [44] . In such situations, social support has become limited, which could have contributed to higher stress among female students [50] . Compared to male students, female students also reported higher averages in both types of anxiety (disease and consequences). Stress is a common trigger for anxiety [48] , which explains the difference in anxiety levels between genders. Another possible explanation of why females report higher stress and anxiety is gender inequality in social roles, which allocates most household chores to females [8] . Females are primarily responsible for caring for children, ageing parents, and family members [14] . When everyone stayed at home during the lockdown, these chores combined with regular study demands could have increased female students' stress and anxiety.",

Some of them may be married with family and hence more anxious about the possible consequences of the pandemic not only on themselves but on their immediate family members (kids and husbands).

The low perceived control over time may be attributed to the sudden change in students' lifestyles during the pandemic, including the shift in their education from face-to-face to online. This disruption was accompanied by an urgent need to adjust by making substantial changes to students' daily schedules (and behavior). A recent report on the impact of online learning during the pandemic attributed students' mental health concerns to the isolation from other students and instructors, lack of guidance and counseling, and the difficulty and distractions associated with the use of online platforms [2] .

The mapping was based on the Goal-Setting strategy [25] and the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) framework [33] . (See section 1.2). Task organization is not easy to develop and maintain. The use of goal-setting strategy would help students direct their attentions and increase their task performance.

Students' preference for organization (PFO) was the only factor that significantly influenced their perceived ability to have control over time (PCT), which contributes to reducing stress, hence, anxiety. To promote students' preference for organization, we map the three categories of organization to corresponding persuasive strategies which could be used in the design of persuasive interventions. This creates an opportunity for developing interventions to improve students' perceptions of control over time, thus, less stress and anxiety.",
