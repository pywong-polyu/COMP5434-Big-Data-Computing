Many may not be aware that a scentless life may be a consequence of surviving Covid-19. Albeit reported to afflict only a small number of patients, persistent olfactory dysfunction can severely impair quality of life (QoL), and it poses a life-threatening situation to the patient and their family members.",

            "text": "From the initial anecdotal report on the association between new-onset olfactory dysfunction and Covid-19 in early March 2020, olfactory dysfunction has been regarded as a key manifestation of Covid-19. Myriad studies and research on olfactory dysfunction in Covid-19 have emerged over the past year, with a prevalence of 47.85 per cent. 1 Nearly 15-20 per cent of the afflicted population have reported persistent olfactory dysfunction. 2 Yet, this is starkly different from the findings of a six-month psychophysical olfactory assessment study, in which 60 per cent of the cohort were found to have persistent olfactory dysfunction, whilst only 18 per cent of this group self-reported on altered smell. 3 Parallel to that, the prevalence of, as well as recovery from, olfactory dysfunction in Covid-19 patients may be underreported, as most study findings are based on self-reports. 4 Whilst great attention is being paid to curbing the ongoing pandemic, with vaccination programmes being carried out globally, the fate of Covid-19 survivors with olfactory dysfunction remains a conundrum. Many may not be aware of the crippling effect of olfactory dysfunction amongst Covid-19 survivors. Recently published studies have focused on the prevalence and outcome of olfactory dysfunction amongst Covid-19 patients. Yet, the question is how olfactory dysfunction affects the QoL of these patients, as the road to recovery remains an enigma. This systematic review aimed to cover the current literature available on the impact of olfactory dysfunction on QoL in Covid-19 patients.",

A meta-analysis was considered inappropriate in our study because of the heterogeneity issue. Hence, meaningful interpretation of the We found that in three studies, QoL assessment was obtained through an online platform. Various questionnaires were used to assess the QoL, including the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders -Negative Statements, 8 the Multi-Clinic Smell and Taste Questionnaire, 10 the General Well-Being Schedule 10 and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. 11 In one study, standard questions were used during clinical evaluations at the Virginia Commonwealth University of Smell and Taste Center. 10 The QoL domains investigated included overall QoL, 8-11 mental health, 8, 9 taste dysfunction, 9,10 cognitive function, 11 functional outcome 11 and safety issues. 9 Overall, the QoL deficit affected 67.7 per cent of the included population. Olfactory dysfunction was assessed objectively in one study using the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks odour identification test. 11 Eighty-six per cent of the subjects tested had a reduced ability to taste food. 9,10 Loss of appetite was reported in two studies, affecting 67.3 per cent of subjects. 8, 10 Mental health status was described in two studies. 8, 9 AlShakhs et al. revealed that 42 per cent of Covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction mentioned feeling isolated, 8 whereas depression was reported to be present in 43 per cent by Coelho et al. 9 AlShakhs et al. revealed stress in 51.4 per cent of their cohort. 8 Safety-related concerns were reported in one study, and affected 57 per cent of patients. 9 None of the studies described any methods of olfactory dysfunction treatment.

This non-invasive intervention, directed at the rehabilitation of olfactory dysfunction, has demonstrated promising outcomes in relation to olfactory dysfunction from various causes. 23, 24 As well as being easy to administer, olfactory retraining therapy has been reported to decrease depressive episodes amongst patients. 25 The concept behind olfactory retraining therapy is based on daily repeated exposure to selected odorants. Four odours are traditionally incorporated, based on the odour prism proposed by Henning, of rose, eucalyptus, lemon and clove, 26 which correspond to one from each category: fruity, flowery, resinous and spicy. 27 Olfactory retraining therapy is believed to strengthen the olfactory nerve through repeated exercise. The only drawback of olfactory retraining therapy is the need to repeat the training exercise for months, which may be tiresome to most patients. Nonetheless, favourable results have been demonstrated amongst Covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction, whereby early olfactory retraining therapy corresponds to a better olfactory outcome. 28 \u2022 New-onset olfactory dysfunction is a known manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019, with a prevalence of nearly 50 per cent worldwide \u2022 Objective assessment of olfactory dysfunction revealed that olfactory dysfunction prevalence has been underestimated \u2022 Nearly 15-20 per cent of the afflicted population has persistent olfactory dysfunction \u2022 Persistent olfactory dysfunction has detrimental effects on quality of life (well-being, safety, taste, mental health, cognitive impairment, social functioning) \u2022 Early implementation of coping and safety strategies is advised Several coping strategies directed to managing olfactory dysfunction from various causes have been carried out successfully over the past decade. These include safety measures such as installing gas or smoke detectors. 16 Olfactory dysfunction patients tend to rely on family members to test food or check perfume usage. Family members and close friends need to play an important role in supporting these Covid-19 survivors, as they may be vulnerable and fearful of having permanent smell loss. Dysregulated appetite can be addressed by scheduled eating hours. 16 Strict adherence to manufacturing dates on food and drink is required to avoid food poisoning. Additionally, there are numerous social support groups that can play an important role in targeting emotional adaptation. 13 Currently, the ongoing pandemic has witnessed charity-based support groups such as Fifth Sense and AbSent coming forward to help afflicted patients. Online patient support groups enable patients newly affected with olfactory dysfunction to share their struggle with others who have managed olfactory dysfunction from other causes. Finally, the patients themselves need to come to terms with and gain emotional acceptance of the deficit to allow adaptive adjustment to the disease.",
