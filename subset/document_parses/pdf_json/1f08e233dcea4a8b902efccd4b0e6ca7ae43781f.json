            "text": "Objective: To describe how a fixed regimen of intravitreal injections (IVI) was helpful to continue activity during the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown and to address basic conditions to resume activity. Methods: A fixed regimen of IVI was conceived to significantly reduce the number of visits while keeping a number of injections related to the best outcomes. We retrospectively collected data of surgeries performed in 2019 and in the first seven months of 2020 and from OCTs in the first semester of 2020. Results: IVI per month, from January to July 2020, were 304, 291, 256, 204, 276, 297 and 322, respectively. Phacoemulsification surgeries in the same period were 397, 408, 171, 0, 304, 391 and 389. Posterior vitrectomies were 23, 21, 17, 10, 21, 28 and 25. Laser sessions were 44, 26, 33, 17, 23 and 33, respectively. OCTs dropped from a mean of 25.7 per day in the first half of March 2020 to 5.8 per day in the second half of March. A mean of 6.5 OCTs per day was made in April, rising to 19.1 in May and 39.5 in June. Conclusion: It was possible to keep the ophthalmological activity during the pandemic outbreak due to the existence of a pre-scheduled fixed regimen for IVI and to the availability of personal protective equipment. The air-borne nature of the peril we are facing addresses the need to evaluate the physical conditions of health facilities, including ventilation, size of waiting and consult rooms and the need to avoid elevators.",

[10] [11] [12] Fixed regimens with the number of injections per year based on the best outcomes may be a good option. 2, 3, 13 Another topic is whom to test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA before undergoing ophthalmic surgery. Should viral RNA detection by RT-PCR testing be asked for all asymptomatic patients undergoing topical anesthetic procedures, such as phacoemulsification or intra-vitreal injections? There is no consensus among ophthalmologists on who should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, because evidence of the virus in the conjunctiva and tears is elusive. 14, 15 In the Portuguese current panorama, most hospitals just resumed activity, with reduced numbers. The trend will soon be to resume activity at full length. The combination of departments based on upper floors of towered hospitals with tiny waiting rooms and massive outpatient attendance will be a huge challenge for many hospitals.",

Nevertheless, we observed several shortcomings of this protocol: delay in evaluation or adjustments, a considerable amount of DME patients failing to respond to the loading dose, but more importantly, a significant amount of CRVO patients with recurrence of macular edema and the development of macular gliosis, atrophy and permanent vision loss. Those shortcomings and the need to reduce the number of monitoring visits lead to the conception of a fixed treatment protocol. The number of injections in the new fixed protocol for CRVO was based on the results of the 6-monthly loading dose in the CRUISE study 5 that showed better outcomes than the minimum of 3+pro re nata (PRN) in the CRYSTAL study. 16 Although the 6 monthly injection protocol of the BRAVO study 4 showed a slightly better outcome than the minimum of 3+PRN protocol of the BRIGHTER study, 17 we followed a 3+T&E rationale because BRVO does not have the same severe complications as ischemic CRVO and our regimen was not reactive. A loading dose of 3+T&E rationale was adopted for AMD as the higher gain happens within this period 18 and the best results at one year are obtained with a mean of 8 injections. 19 A loading dose of 5 injections was adopted for DME due to the existence of late responders 2,20 and the results being better with 8-9 injections in the first year ( Figure 1 ). 3, 21 Even though cataract surgery stopped for the whole month of April during the lockdown, we were able to continue IVI without monitoring visits. Missing patients were called home, reassured and re-scheduled. OCTs were not interrupted, since technicians were split in fortnight turnovers. As no member of the department's personnel got infected, medical or non-medical, this model contributed to enforce the confidence and set the grounds for a rapid return to an almost normal activity as it is displayed in Table 1 . The only difference we have now is the scheduling of visits in intervals of 30 minutes.",

            "text": "Asymptomatic professionals or patients are not tested for SARS-CoV-2. Testing asymptomatic healthcare professionals and patients submitted to procedures that do not or may not generate aerosol would not be feasible or costeffective. 22 Furthermore, most reports found a small DovePress prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctiva and tears of symptomatic patients only. 14,23 RT-PCR tests will have difficulties surpassing the demand, once all specialties resume. Besides, the test does not protect the OR, since it must be disinfected according to the institutional rules. 12 The test does not protect the health personnel either, since a negative RT-PCR test does not fully negate the possibility that an individual is infected, and the test is not a vaccine but a sort of snapshot of the moment the swab was collected, therefore it seems to be pointless to test unsuspected asymptomatic health professionals. 24, 25 Moreover, viral RNA may last for a lot longer than the period of infectivity 26 and rapid serologic testing may lead to a sensation of a false security due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity for an acute infection. 24 Keeping the patient with a face mask and using closed surgical drapes are simple measures to protect the staff and the patient in the OR. Considering that there is a substantial amount of undocumented infection cases, 27 that patients need to be at a close distance for being examined, that sometimes they remain at a close range from the ophthalmologist for a long period of time as in laser treatments, 28 the ophthalmologists may be particularly exposed in the office or consult rooms. In the OR, patients wear face masks and surgical closed drapes act as a barrier, there is proper room ventilation and size, and the risk of producing positive SARS-CoV-2 aerosols is very low in the asymptomatic patient. 22 The fact that our colleague Dr. Li Wenliang was infected while assisting outpatients at the consult room and died from COVID-19, 29,30 the short distance between the patient and the ophthalmologist at the slit lamp microscope and the long duration of laser photocoagulation, raises the question whether the eye doctor might be more vulnerable at the office room rather than in the OR, since proper size and ventilation may not be adequate in offices or outpatient consult rooms. 28 Despite we kept activity during the lockdown and resumed surgery at full-length, we realize that healthcare facilities may substantially differ in their conditions. We perform the IVI in the OR. Some facilities use dedicated rooms instead of the OR. However, some of these rooms may not have the same standard of ventilation as an OR, a critical factor in a place shared by a high number of individuals. We did not suffer from shortage of personal protective equipment. Entering or circulating inside the hospital without wearing a face mask is, and was, strictly forbidden right from the start, consult rooms have windows that are kept opened as well as doors while observing patients, and accompanying persons are seldom allowed. 8 The waiting room is an open space seating area at the major hall entrance, where patients wait seated in front of TV monitors and are called by number. The whole department is based on the ground floor, including the three ORs of the Ambulatory Surgery Unit, therefore patients do not need to use elevators or stairs. When maximum capacity of the waiting room is reached, patients wait outside. All these measures decrease the viral load that has been related with the infection rate and the severity of the disease. 31",

Keeping patients with face masks while being operated and the use of filtering face piece respirators seem to be proper for interventions under topical anesthesia. RT-PCR testing of asymptomatic patients in ophthalmology seems to be indicated for patients undergoing general anesthesia only. Perhaps one lesson learned from this pandemic peril is that physicians should wear face masks at the emergency attendance rooms endlessly, as dentists do, even after the pandemic crisis subsides. Hospitals need to have wide waiting rooms and departments with high levels of patients' attendance benefit from being located in ground floors. Small multiple buildings with multiple ground floor entrances by means of an implantation in hilly grounds, surrounded by outdoor spaces, rather than huge towered buildings, may be more suitable as hospitals in the nearest future.",
