The presence of preoperative anemia was found to be related with increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admissions and postoperative infections. Objective: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with preoperative anemia among adult patients scheduled for major elective surgery at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. Methods: After obtaining an ethical approval, hospital-based cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted from June to August 2020 in University of Gondar Hospital. Full blood count within two weeks of preoperative period was considered valid if there were no any factors that affect the hematologic system Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations and binary logistic regression analysis were performed to identify factors associated withpreoperative anemia. The strength of the association was presented using AOR with 95% confidence interval and p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result: A total of 185 patients enrolled with 100% response rate. We observed preoperative anemia in 36.8% patients. The multi-variable binary logistic analysis showed that ASA II and III [AOR: 3.8, CI: 1.6-9.2], recent prior surgery [AOR: 3.3, CI: 1.3-8.5], history of malignancy [AOR: 9.4, CI: 2.0-43.4], orthopedic procedure [AOR: 11.2, CI: 4.0-31.6] and gynecologic procedure [AOR: 5.2, CI: 1.7-14.5] were significantly associated with preoperative anemia. Conclusion: The prevalence of preoperative anemia was high and ASA !2, recent prior surgery, history of malignancy, orthopedic surgery and gynecologic procedure were significantly associated with preoperative anemia. We recommend to clinicians to aim prevention, early detection and treatment of preoperative anemia among adult patients scheduled for major elective surgery to reduce risk of anemia and related adverse outcomes.",

According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, the global prevalence of anemia in 2010 was 32.9% [4] and in Ethiopia, it was around 23% in women and 10-26% in men [5] . The predominant burden of anemia is found in low and middle income countries. The WHO reported that 97% anemic population lives in these countries and half of this burden was caused by iron deficiency anemia [6, 7] . This public health burden can explained by poor intake of iron, intestinal parasitic infestations and high prevalence of malaria and human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus infections [8, 9] . The previous studies have revealed wide ranges of the prevalence of anemia among surgical patients. Preoperative anemia was found in 5-78% of patients who were scheduled for surgical interventions [10, 11] , and in 30-60% of patients who were scheduled for major elective surgery [12] . Even, higher rates among colorectal cancer and gynecological and major orthopedic patients [13] .",

The presence of anemia in surgical patient is associated with adverse clinical outcomes [14] . It carries several perioperative risks including increased morbidity, mortality, requirements of allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative infections, intensive care unit admissions, length of hospital stay, readmission and reoperation rates. Preoperative anemia is an independent factor associated with perioperative stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, renal impairment, and death in patients that undergone both cardiac and non-cardiac surgery [13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] . All of these negative impacts of preoperative anemia have huge cost implications especially for developing countries. The economic loss of iron deficiency anemia alone was 4% of gross domestic product in these countries [7] . Hence, early diagnosis and appropriate preoperative optimization of anemic surgical patients is very important [16, 18, 22] .",

The questionnaire was primarily prepared in English language and translated to Amharic language. Training for data collectors and supervisors was provided by the principal investigator. After completion of data collection, the variables were coded and cleaned. The data was entered into the Epi-data software (version 7) for cleaning errors and was analyzed by SPSS version 20 (IBM Corporate). The normality of the data was tested by using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed and presented with frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median and inter-quartile range (IQR). The relationships of nominal data with preoperative anemia were analyzed by using crosstabulations. Hosmer and Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness of fit. The associations between the independent variables and dependent variable were determined at 95% confidence interval with chi-squared test, bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression and presented in crude and adjusted odds ratio.

Patients scheduled for orthopedic surgery were over 11 times anemic than those scheduled for general and urologic surgery. Supporting our findings, a review article has reported that preoperative anemia was more prevalent in patients that undergone fracture repair surgery [22] . The possible reason might be pre-existing traumatic blood loss and repeated prior surgery in orthopedic patients for debridement and revision surgery [37] . Most of orthopedic patients in our study had traumatic causes that could induce acute and chronic inflammatory responses; therefore, blunted erythropoiesis and diminished sensitivity due to decreased iron availability that result in anemia. Supporting our study, high prevalence of preoperative anemia was reported among patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery [22] . Despite our finding, much lower prevalence of preoperative anemia have been reported in patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery [15] . Furthermore, gynecologic patients were at higher risk to present with preoperative anemia than those came for general and urologic surgery. Comparably with previous studies, gynecologic diseases are usually complicated with abnormal uterine bleeding [16] .",

Patients with preoperative anemia should be optimized with safe and low-cost hematinic supplements to reduce the risks of anemia and related adverse outcomes. As a developing country, the prevalence of anemia is high in the general population. The government and policy makers should design affordable preventive and therapeutic strategies to minimize the burdens of anemia and its negative impacts.",
