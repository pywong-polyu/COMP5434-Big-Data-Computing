The structure of the coronavirus transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which promotes the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, was readily determined [1] . The S glycoprotein comprises a S1 subunit that mediates binding to the host receptor and a S2 subunit that induces fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. Cellular entry is promoted by tight binding between SARS-CoV-2 and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which also explains the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The entry receptor hACE2 and the viral entryassociated protease are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells, which highlights their role in initial infection and also as possible reservoirs for dissemination within or between individuals [2] . These findings paved the way to the design of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.",

Bamlanivimab was the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for COVID-19, in November 2020. However, its marketing authorization was revoked in April 2021 in view of the sustained increase of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants that were resistant to bamlanivimab alone, resulting in the increased risk for treatment failure. Meanwhile, the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together was approved by the FDA in February 2021, and the authorization for their administration together to mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients was maintained. Another combination of monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, had been approved in November 2020 for the same indication. May 2021, the FDA approved the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab which targets the S protein. Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits binding of interleukin-6 (IL-6) to both membrane and soluble IL-6 receptors, was approved June 2021 for mild-tomoderate patients receiving systemic corticoids and requiring supplemental oxygen.",

            "text": "The repositioning of existing drugs to treat COVID-19 has been less successful than the development of antibody therapies. In October 2020, the FDA approved remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, as the first treatment for COVID-19, based on three randomized trials, where it was shown that hospitalized patients recovered faster and had relief of symptoms relative to control groups. Although remdesivir is a milestone in the treatment of COVID-19, mortality and morbidity remained high. It was also recognized very early in the management of the pandemic that patients with severe COVID-19 have a cytokine storm syndrome, with increased IL-6 and other cytokine serum levels, which correlate with the severity of the disease [3] . It was suggested that patients with hyperinflammation could benefit from selective cytokine blockade and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition [4] . In a remarkable tour-deforce of Artificial Intelligence, it was possible to identify baricitinib, approved for rheumatoid arthritis, as having potential antiviral and anticytokine activity [5] . Baricitinib is a JAK inhibitor that interferes with the pathway that leads to inflammation. The combination of baricitinib with remdesivir proved superior to remdesivir alone in COVID-19 patients receiving oxygen or non-invasive ventilation [6] . FDA approved this combination in November 2020, but NIH issued guidelines that recommend the use of this combination in patients receiving oxygen but not receiving corticosteroids. Previously, in June 2020, a press release disclosed that dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory corticosteroid with broad effects on innate and adaptive immunity, could reduce by 8-26% the 28-day mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 [7] . Dexamethasone was adopted for the management of critically ill patients even before the actual publication of the clinical trial results, which showed a reduction of mortality relative to the usual care group of 29.3% vs 41.4% for patients with invasive ventilation, and of 23.3% vs 26.2% for patients receiving oxygen alone [8] . Currently, dexamethasone is recommended for use alone or in combination with remdesivir for patients who require supplemental oxygen. A variety of other small molecules showed efficacy in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and were proposed for COVID-19 treatment, but did not yet translate to meaningful clinical benefits [9, 10] . A good example is methylene blue (MB), which exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 binding to hACE2 with EC 50 = 3.0 \u00b5M according to some authors [11] , or as low as 0.3 \u00b5M according to others [12] . These EC 50 values are lower than those reported for remdesivir (23 \u00b5M) [13] . At this concentration level, an assay involving 48 h exposure showed that MB inhibited the entry of a pseudovirus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein into hACE2-expressing HEK293T cells [11] . MB has been in clinical use in various antimicrobial fields for a century [14] , and its use was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with acquired methemoglobinemia, opening the way for drug repurposing. MB is also one of the most widely used and better characterized photosensitizers, with remarkable clinical effect in a variety of infectious diseases [15] . Interestingly, a cohort of 2500 patients treated among others with MB for cancer care did not develop influenza-like illness during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that MB played a protective role [16] .",

            "text": "Photodynamic disinfection (PDI) was proposed as an alternative approach to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and clinical use of PDI in COVID-19 patients has been published [22, 23] . The advantage of PDI is that it uses photosensitizer molecules that do not have pharmacological effect unless they are electronically excited with light of an appropriate wavelength and in the presence of molecular oxygen. The electronically excited photosensitizer has the ability to transfer its excess energy, or an electron, to molecular oxygen and generate single oxygen, or superoxide ion. These species, and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) eventually formed, have short lifetimes and react with biomolecules in the illuminated volume [24] . The oxidative stress produced can inactivate microorganisms or, under appropriate doses and drug-to-light intervals, trigger cell death [25] . The obvious advantage of PDI is that it can target tissues with laser light: the pharmacological effect is restricted to the illuminated volume and systemic toxicity is avoided. It has been emphasized that PDI is a good candidate for treating COVID-19, because SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus and these viruses are most sensitive to PDI [26] . In addition, the use of light to treat airway related infections is relatively common. Among the various photosensitizers that have been used in PDI of microorganisms, MB has a special interest, because it is used for other diseases and may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the dark. The mechanism of virus inactivation with MB-PDI has been investigated in detail and shown to involve both oxidation of proteins and damage to RNA [27] . Photoinduced modification of RNA enables the use of real time PCR methods to determine amplification inhibition with MB-PDI [28] . The inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with MB-PDI was recently explored by Loktev and coworkers [29] . Our work describes PDI of clinical samples collected from the surface of the respiratory mucosa of COVID-19 patients with nasopharyngeal swabs. We show that > 99.99% amplification inhibition can be obtained within 1 min laser illumination when an appropriate MB formulation is used. We also show that under these conditions MB-PDI has low toxicity to eukaryotic cells and inhibits the infection of human embryonic kidney cells overexpressing the hACE2 gene.",

The MB-based commercial formulation (0.01% w/v MB and 0.25% w/v chlorhexidine gluconate in an adjuvant aqueous base) and the illumination system (~ 860 mW at 670 nm, equally divided between two illuminators) employed in PDI of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those previously employed in PDI of MRSA [30] and of S. pyogenes [31] . These earlier studies evaluated the feasibility of photoinactivating bacteria colonizing the nose of surgical patients, which are responsible for a large fraction of nosocomial infections. Based on the results of such studies, we selected a MB formulation dilution of 1:20 (MB-1:20) and 4 or 8 min of illumination to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in the first set of clinical samples. This dilution corresponds to a MB concentration of 15 \u00b5M, but it is more appropriate to refer the dilution factor than the MB concentration because of the presence of adjuvants in the formulation. Each clinical sample was divided to obtain triplicates for each experimental condition and two RT-qPCR measurements were made and averaged for each triplicate. A calibration curve employing dilutions of a freshly prepared standard was employed to convert cycle threshold (Ct) values into viral loads (copies/mL). Figure 2a shows that 4 min of illumination in the presence of MB-1:20 were sufficient to obtain a percentage amplification inhibition > 99.999%. Subsequent clinical samples were illuminated for 2 min or for 1 min. Figure 2b shows that 1 min illumination with a MB-1:20 reduced the virus titer in this sample below the detection limit of our setup. The highest Ct measured in this work was 43.89 (0.02 copies/ mL, by extrapolation of the calibration curve). Based on the initial virus titer of this sample, the amplification inhibition is > 99.99%. Increasing the MB dilution to 100 (MB-1:100), with the same light dose, we found that a measurable quantity of virus remained in one of the samples after PDI (Fig. 2c) , although this clinical sample had a relatively low virus titer. MB-1:100 and 25.8 J can be considered the lower limit to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus present in a 250 \u00b5L.",

            "text": "Laser light at 670 nm alone or MB-1:20 alone for incubation times up to 8 min do not significantly damage the RNA of SARS-CoV-2. However, it is quite remarkable that MB-1:100 with 1 min illumination using 430 mW laser light produces a substantial reduction of the SARS-CoV-2 viral titer. This offers the opportunity to perform PDI of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of COVID-19 patients with acceptable local phototoxicity and no systemic toxicity. This result is particularly interesting, because the evaluation of the photoinactivation is based on the viral RNA. The absence of viral RNA amenable to amplification in RT-qPCR after MB-PDI suggests that it was substantially damaged in just a few minutes. It is unlikely that, in less than 5 min, MB molecules penetrated virions, intercalated with viral nucleic acid and photo-inactivated it. The size of SARS-CoV-2 virions is ~ 100 nm [32] and the effective diffusion length of singlet oxygen is ~ 200 nm [15] . It is more likely that MB molecules adhered to viral envelope, generated singlet oxygen at the surface of the virions and the singlet oxygen diffused inside the particle, where it is more soluble than in the aqueous media, and then oxidized the viral RNA. It is well-known that singlet oxygen reacts with proteins, nucleotides and lipids with rate constants of ~ 10 4 , ~ 10 3 and ~ 10 2 L/(g s), respectively [15] . This is a manifestation of the multi-target ability of ROS, often related to the fact that PDT is not readily associated with mechanisms of drug resistance. In particular, singlet oxygen reactions with guanosine are wellcharacterized and occur readily in photosensitization reactions [33] . These reactions are the most likely path to make Fig. 3 Toxicity of the MB formulation towards HaCaT cells after 5 min of incubation, in the dark or exposed to 25.8 J at 670 nm. CTR untreated cells, L light viral RNA undetectable by RT-qPCR. Earlier PDI studies with MB favored damage mechanisms involving MB intercalation with viral RNA but it is quite unexpected that this process could be efficiently completed in less than 5 min of incubation of MB.",

Three major systems have been developed for viral vectors derived from HIV that differ in the number of plasmids used (2 to 4 plasmids) and aim at the minimization of viral gene recombination to reduce the possibility of reversion to the wild-type virus [34] . Here we employed a methodology using four major plasmids, two of them encoding for packaging genes, one for the envelope including S protein and the transfer gene, in this case the reporter gene luciferase. Pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding luciferase were produced in HEK293T cells, as previously described [35] , with slightly modifications, using polyethylenimine (PEI) [36] . We selected HEK-293 T-hACE2 cells for infection with our LVs, because these cells overexpress the hACE2 gene and SARS-CoV-2 infection is promoted by tight binding between the virion and hACE2. HEK-293 T-hACE2 cells are infected when they are incubated for 24 h with LVs. At this point the cells can be washed to remove the virion particles in the medium. Adding D-luciferin 72 h later, the chemiluminescence intensity of cultured cells reports on the extent of infection. Cells without the addition of LVs serve as positive controls of cell viability and negative controls of infection. Figure 1b illustrates the planning of this study.",

In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, active virus infection and replication occurs in the apical layer of nasal and olfactory mucosa. Nasal photodisinfection with MB proved efficacious in the inactivation of multidrug-resistant bacteria colonizing the nose of surgical patients. Repurposing this procedure for the disinfection of the upper airways of COVID-19 patients immediately after the first positive diagnostic test may reduce the viral load, favoring recovering and reducing the spread of the disease. Our results show that MB-PDI of SARS-CoV-2 can achieve amplification inhibition > 99.99% at lower drug and light doses than currently employed for the photoinactivation of bacteria. Damage to viral RNA is achieved with incubation times shorter than 5 min. Inactivation of virus can be achieved with low micromolar MB concentrations and light doses (25.8 J) that are not toxic to human cells at such short incubation times. This offers the opportunity to provide safe, fast and efficient nasal photodisinfection of COVID-19 patients. A proof-of-concept clinical trial is presently exploring a nasal spray of MB formulation followed by 5 min of photoactivation using a nasal illuminator as a first line of defense against COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04615936).",

The band at 600 nm is characteristic of the presence of MB dimers in aqueous solutions [37] . Light at 670 nm will preferentially excite the monomer. The concentration of monomer will depend on dilution factors and, in clinical samples, on a variety of biomolecules and extraneous materials collected in the nasopharynx swabs. Using \u03b5 664 = 10 5 M -1 cm -1 for the monomer [38] , we estimate that its concentration in the 1:100 diluted solution (MB-1:100) is ~ 2 \u00b5M. Our PDI studies employed 1:20 and 1:100 dilutions of the NF-031 formulation in water, which correspond to total MB concentrations of 16 \u00b5M and 3.2 \u00b5M, respectively.",

The illuminator is coupled to the laser source to deliver the laser light in equal intensities through two optical fibers. To determine the output power of the nasal illuminator, a CW laser Omicron Laserage LDM750.1000. CWA.L.M, emitting at 749 nm, coupled with an optical fiber Medlight model FD was used as a reference. The light output power was measured using a Coherent LaserCheck detector, where all light of the reference laser was incident on the active area of the detector. The fiber was then inserted in the integrating sphere and the same detector placed in a proper location of the sphere to collect the scattered light. Using both measurements, a correction factor was determined correlating the light output power measured directly with the detector and through the integrating sphere. After determining this factor, by performing several measurements, the Nasal Light Illuminator was placed inside the sphere and the output power determined. The LaserCheck wavelength was set to the respective wavelengths to account for the differences of sensitivity. The laser output power measured with this method was 860 mW. The PDI studies employed light from only one of the fibers, i.e., a power of 430 mW.",

Samples were initially collected from patients in intermediate care units, but the virus titer found was relatively small. Patients in these units typically had the first symptoms more than 5 days before the collection of the sample. It is known that the highest viral loads are detected in nasal swabs performed within the first week of the symptoms [39] . Hence, a second series of samples were collected from patients shortly after admission in emergency wards. A third series of samples was collected from patients admitted in any CHUC service that tested positive for COVID-19 upon admission and suspected to have a high viral load. Only the second and third series of samples, which had higher viral loads, were used for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 before and after PDI.",

The cycle threshold (Ct) value is inversely related to the viral load and every ~ 3.3 increase in the Ct value reflects a tenfold reduction in starting material. We employed a Roche LightCycler 480 II System PCR platform and the genesig \u00ae Real Time PCR COVID-19 2G assay, a CE marked, in vitro diagnostic RT-PCR multiplex assay intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 (ORF1ab and S gene targets) in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens. The genesig \u00ae COVID-19 2G Primer & Probe Mix contains the primers and FAM labelled probe specific to the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV-2 and the primers and Cy5 labeled probe specific to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the primers and HEX labelled probe for the genesig RNA Internal extraction control (IEC). The concentration range used in the calibration curve was 2 \u00d7 10 2 to 3 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL, which corresponded to a range of 30-16 cycles. The highest number of cycles measured for any sample was Ct = 43.89 (2.33 \u00d7 10 -2 copies/mL, by extrapolation from the calibration curve). It is usual to consider a SARS-CoV-2 test positive when Ct < 40, and patients in the early stages of infection usually have Ct values of 20-30 or less",
