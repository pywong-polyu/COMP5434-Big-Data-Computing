In 2019, as the presidential primary kicked off, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said that the Democratic Party would not host a debate centered on climate change, reasoning that it would be unfair to host a debate on a 'single issue'. Similarly, climate solutions that go beyond the scope of simple decarbonization face stark criticism from both the left and right. In 2019, the New York Times editorial board questioned 1 whether addressing the climate crisis was 'merely a cover for a wish-list of progressive policies and a not-so-subtle effort to move the Democratic Party to the left?' Soon after, the Washington Post editorial board asserted 2 that policymakers should not 'muddle' decarbonization with social programmes that 'divert money and attention from the primary mission'.",

Muir wrote about the supposed laziness of Black 'Sambos' and described the Miwok, the Indigenous people of Northern California and Yosemite, as 'dirty' and 'altogether hideous' (Johnson 2014) .",

Regardless of regressive efforts by legislators, journalists, and some environmentalists to separate environmental issues from social justice, the reality is that climate change impacts every sector of the economy as well as every facet of our lives. With global emissions still increasing and on track to surpass 1.5 degrees of warming (Wilke 2019), we've already reached a point where climate-fueled planetary emergency is the context in which all other public-policy issues exist.",

Social science research has repeatedly shown that points of extraction (Needham 2014 ) and processing 5 of fossil fuels almost always follow lines of socioeconomic and racial divides (Bullard 2008) . Furthermore, climate-change-fueled wildfires and hurricanes do not impact all communities equally. This past summer, California deployed thousands of inmates (Fuller 2020 )-disproportionately people of color who are denied access to basic necessities like housing and work-to fight wildfires that literally turned the sky orange. 6 In Louisiana, Black and brown communities, many still grappling with the long-term impacts of Hurricane Katrina, bore the brunt of Hurricane Laura this past fall. 7 These intersections are exacerbated and clarified by the uniquely turbulent moment we're living in, with a global pandemic wreaking havoc on communities across the globe. The pandemic has made more apparent the deeply interconnected nature of our well-being and the issues we face. To start with, research has shown that increasing temperatures can lead to increased transmission of infectious disease and animal-borne illnesses (Lustgarten 2020) . Climate change impacts disease in numerous ways. For one, biodiversity loss increases disease transmission (Keesing et al. 2010) , and the warming climate is reducing biodiversity at an alarming rate (Harvey 2018) . Furthermore, increased global temperatures expand the geographic regions vulnerable to contagion (Lustgarten 2020) , and can bring back old viruses that were previously frozen away. This happened in 2016, when a heat wave thawed permafrost leading to an anthrax outbreak in nearby communities (Doucleff 2016) . As climate change exacerbates the spread and frequency of infectious diseases, we can expect environmental-justice communities to be impacted more than others.",

Wealth and power cannot fully protect one from disease (as the recent White House coronavirus outbreak makes clear) (Margolin and Bruggeman 2020) . However, who is affected by pandemics (and climate change) and to what extent they're affected is influenced by the power dynamics in society. To put matters into perspective: Reporting from the National Urban League found that Black Americans have been infected with coronavirus at three times the rate of white Americans, 8 and are twice as likely to die from the virus. The communities hardest hit by coronavirus have been struggling with public health Cha et al. 2020a, b) , economic, and environmental-justice issues since long before coronavirus brought society to a halt. The pandemic has only exacerbated these conditions. Indeed, emerging research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has found a link between air pollution and the lethality of coronavirus. 9 These findings are consistent with the lived reality on the ground in places like the Navajo Nation, prisons and ICE detention centers, and farmworker communities in California.",

When coronavirus was first reported in the nation in mid-March, infection rates per capita quickly became the highest in the country compared with any individual state. Numerous factors led to the rapid spread: disproportionate rates of comorbidities like diabetes, heart conditions, and lung disease, as well as exposure to radiation from abandoned uranium mines. Limited access to healthcare resources also stymied relief efforts. Notably, the nation has been able to curb infection rates through a series of containment measures that led Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to assert that the Navajo Nation's coronavirus response should serve as a model for the rest of the country. 10 Another clear example of marginalized groups facing disparate harm during the pandemic is the country's incarcerated population of more than two million people. 11 During the early months of the pandemic, coronavirus cases in federal and state prisons were almost six times higher than in the general population. Death rates were three times higher (Saloner et al. 2020 ). It's also likely that these numbers underestimate the prevalence of coronavirus in prisons, since some aren't testing or reporting cases at all (Van Beusekom 2020). Similarly, immigrants detained in ICE detention facilitates have faced disproportionate exposure to coronavirus and systemic lack of access to basic measures of protection. 12 The disregard that the US government has shown toward the humanity and health of people in prisons, jails, and ICE custody is a human rights atrocity that will stain the country's history for generations to come.",

Although the carbon tax was accompanied by some minor increases in welfare payments intended to offset its impact, the public largely rejected the tax perceiving it as an effort to kill jobs and further disempower the working class (Mercer 2011) .

Thousands of people, including many sharing concerns about climate change (Rubin and Sengupta 2018) , took to the streets in what is now known as the 'yellow vests movement' (Cigainero 2018) , protesting Macron's fuel tax, which disproportionately burdened the already marginalized working and middle classes, especially those in rural areas. Macron was forced to repeal the tax, and his party went on to lose their majority in parliament, no doubt in part due to the social unrest that the tax incited. 14 The experiences of Australia and France make clear the shortcomings of climate policy that seeks to divorce climate change from the socioeconomic context in which we live.
