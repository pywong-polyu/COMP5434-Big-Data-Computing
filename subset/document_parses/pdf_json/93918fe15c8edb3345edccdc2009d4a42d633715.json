Here, we undertake a model-based global integrated assessment to characterise alternative pathways towards 36 time-bound, science-driven targets by 2030, 2050, and 2100. We show that it will be unlikely to jointly achieve socioeconomic and environmental targets by 2030, even under the most optimistic pathways and the least ambitious targets. Nonetheless, humanity can still avoid destabilisation of the Earth system 6 and increase socioeconomic prosperity post-2030 via a 'Green Recovery' pathway. A Green Recovery by mid-and end of the century requires reducing global population by 5% and 26%, empowering sustainable economic development by 32% and 52%, increasing education availability by 10% and 40%, reducing the total global fossil energy production by 36% and 80%, reducing agricultural land area by 7% and 10%, and promoting healthy and sustainable lifestyles by lowering consumption of animal-based foods (i.e., meat and dairy) by 39% and 50%, compared to the business-as-usual trajectories for 2050 and 2100, respectively. Our results show that the combination of these changes together towards extended, more ambitious goals by 2050 and 2100 is central to the transformative change 7 needed to ensure that both people and planet prosper in medium-and long-term futures.",

To avoid a similar outcome for the SDGs and subsequent loss of momentum in progress towards global sustainability, it is prudent to explore alternate pathways towards increasingly ambitious mediumand long-term goals to enable missed 2030 targets to be met later on, to ensure that earlier achievements are not lost through complacency, and to establish a long-term process of continuous improvement. Here, we use integrated assessment modelling to assess the performance of alternative pathways towards 36 sustainability targets under eight SDGs by 2030 (short-term) and their extensions to 2050 (medium-term) and 2100 (long-term) with increasing levels of ambition. Given current and future socioeconomic and environmental uncertainties, this assessment is timely to illuminate robust options for humanity to achieve global sustainability aspirations over the course of the 21 st century, even if we fail to fully achieve the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda.",

On the other hand, Fragmented World's progress is only 36%, being on track in achieving only two food-related targets by 2030. For SDG 7, the sustainable economic development in Green Recovery leads to progress of 47% towards targets, mostly due to achieving economic growth with a higher adoption of efficient end-use technologies and a faster transition to renewable energy (Extended Data Figure 4c -i). However, Fossil-Fuelled Development and Fragmented World have the slowest progress and are on track in only one targets for clean energy (respectively) due to heavy reliance on fossil energy (oil, gas, and then coal) production throughout the century (Supplementary   Figure 6e -v, f-v, g-v).",

Priorities for transformative change in a new post-2030 agenda. Humanity is at a crossroads in planning for a post-pandemic world. Our projections of progress towards the SDGs showed that the 2030 agenda faces significant challenges limiting the chances of near-term success. Based on this evidence, we call for extending the current UN Agenda 2030's timeframe, with increasing levels of ambition in targets over the course of the century. This maintains the imperative for and global focus on sustainable development 5 over the long-term with a more radical approach 18,21 that disrupts the status quo, accelerates actions for achieving the SDGs, and puts a safety net in place where achieving ambitious long-term sustainability aspirations are not threatened by a failure to achieve some short-term goals. We showed (in Figures 1 and 2 ) that the Green Recovery pathway, over the medium-to long-term, can be a way forward for realising co-benefits between multiple goals 36 . As a step towards developing a more effective approach, we characterise the major transformative change needed across multiple sectors by analysing the distance to be bridged from current business-as-usual trajectories to the trajectories of a Green Recovery in a post-2030 timeframe (Figure 3 and Methods).",

Second, we assessed the ability of FeliX to quantify the SDG indicator (model fidelity). For those indicators that were not present in FeliX, we chose proxies. For example, we did not include an official indicator for biodiversity conservation such as the Red List Index as the required data is not produced in FeliX. Instead, we presented mean species abundance as a proxy indicator for biodiversity 21 . Third, we ensured that the selected indicators are amenable to the specification of quantitative performance thresholds for measuring progress towards the SDGs (target relevancy).

Here, the global average as calculated by FeliX is expected to reach the levels of current top performing countries. In selecting the top performing countries, we removed the outliers from the list to reduce bias in our calculation. For example, a small country with limited agricultural arable land can have very low levels of fertilizer application. Therefore, the inclusion of this country as a top performer in calculating the target for the 'food and agriculture phosphorous balance' indicator can be misleading for larger countries with larger contribution to global food production.

The value of this indicator is also sensitive to the size of a country's agricultural sector. Therefore, leaving no one behind and the average of the top performers did not lead to a meaningful target. In this case, we used a level of global improvement as a target for the indicator. The base year for improvement can vary between indicators depending on the availability of data. The decision about the improvement rate from the base year value was made on a caseby-case basis for each indicator in a range between 5% improvement (e.g., in reducing CO 2 emissions from land-use) to 50% improvement (e.g., reducing coal production) from the global average as the 2030 ambitious target.

The characterisation of the five pathways and their associated realisations (Extended Data Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6) represents fundamentally different futures for human societies and facilitates the impact assessment of possible strategies towards the SDG agenda. We selected 36 indicators within the scope of the model (Methods and Extended Data Figure 3) to evaluate eight sustainable development goals related to food and agriculture (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), climate action (SDG 13), and biodiversity conservation (SDG 15). We specified weak, moderate, and ambitious targets (Extended Data Figure 2 and Extended Data Table 2) for 2030, then increased the ambition and extended the timeframe of the targets to 2050 (consistent with the Paris Agreement timeframe 29 ) and to 2100 (aligning with the IPCC assessment timeframe 30 ).

For example, the Fossil-Fuelled Development pathway results in the most rapid improvement in socioeconomic indicators, such as Gross World Product (GWP) per capita (Extended Data Figure 5e-i), achieving moderate (and sometimes even ambitious) targets by 2100. However, human and economic prosperity in Fossil-Fuelled Development also leads to the rapid growth in the share of fossil fuels in energy supply (Extended Data Figure 5d-v, d-vi) driven by increasing energy demand from high energy intensity of the industry and services (Supplementary Figure 6d-v). The reliance on fossil fuels translates into high climate impacts from energy-related CO 2 emissions (Extended Data Figure 5g-iii) by 2100 in almost all 10,000 realisations of the Fossil-Fuelled Development pathway. This jeopardises the achievement of even the weakest targets set for climate indicators by the IPCC 35 in 2030 and beyond.

FeliX has been used previously for exploring global energy and land-use emissions pathways 17 , exploring the impacts of dietary changes on the food system 15 , and evaluating socio-environmental impacts in the Earth observation systems 45 . The model is calibrated with historical data 46 from 1900 to 2015. The model projects the global average of future socioeconomic and environmental developments over the long-term to 2100. We enhanced the latest version of FeliX 15 by implementing global change pathways based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios 25,26 and operationalising SDG indicators and targets in the model, closely related to the UN 2030 Agenda. A summary of the sectoral modules in FeliX is available in Extended Data Figure 1 and a detailed description is available in Supplementary Methods 1, in the original FeliX documentation 46 , and in previous papers 15,17 . The model and its supporting data are publicly available online (Data and Code Availability). Pathway construction We constructed five pathways consistent with the combinations of SSPs 25,26 and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 47,48 scenarios. The SSPs and RCPs together represent the interactions of five socio-economic futures with different levels of global radiative forcing from 1.9 W m -2 to 8.5 W m -2 . Our constructed pathways represent plausible societal, technical, cultural, economic, and climatic developments playing out over the course of the 21 st century. Given the deep uncertainties inherent to the characterisation of these pathways, we simulated 10,000 realisations of each pathway (50,000 total), with each realisation representing how the pathway could unfold under one possible state of the world (Extended Data Figure 2). Pathway construction was performed in three steps: 1. Construct pathway narratives: We first elaborated a set of internally consistent and coherent narratives about the five pathways aligned with the assumptions under five SSP-RCP combinations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP6) 49 to describe what the different futures could look like. This guided the selection of pathway drivers and their quantification (explained in the next two steps). We developed the pathway narrative for 'Green Recovery' consistent with SSP1-RCP2.6an indicative scenario for low-range greenhouse gas emissionswhich had the highest potential for climate change mitigation facilitated by technology advances and strong measures for emissions reduction from the energy and land sectors. The narrative for 'Business As Usual' and 'Inequality'two pathways with moderate mitigation challengeswas consistent with SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP4-RCP6.0, respectively. We developed the narratives of 'Fragmented World' and 'Fossil-Fuelled Development'indicative scenarios for high-range emissions both with significant challenges to mitigation and weak measures for emissions reductions from energy and land sectorsconsistent with SSP3-RCP7.0 and SSP5-RCP8.5, respectively.",

The sensitivity analysis process resulted in the ranking of model parameters across control variables based on a sensitivity ranking of 114 model parameters, we identified as pathway drivers those important parameters that captured most of the variance in SSP projections as reflected by the control variables. TheMorris method however, does not provide a cut-off value on the sensitivity index to limit the ranking results to a subset of important parameters. Instead, we identified the number of influential parameters from the ranking by systematically evaluating the consequences of selecting various combinations of the top ranked parameters across the control variables. To ensure that no significant model interactions were lost by selecting a subset from the top ranked parameters, we ran two sets of Latin Hypercube Sampling experiments. In the first set of experiments, we ran FeliX many times varying only a subset of top ranked parameters, and in the second set of experiments varying all parameters, checking the degree of correlation across control variables produced by the two sets66 .

Fundamental socioeconomic drivers of pathways 25 were calibrated based on quantitative projections of population 56 , economic growth 57 , and educational attainment 56 using formal demographic and economic models (Supplementary Figure 5).

Given the uncertainties inherent in the calibration of the pathway drivers, we considered parametric uncertainty in the calibrated value of the drivers and compared projected envelopes (rather than single indicative lines) with other IAMs. To create envelopes of plausible projections for each pathway, we used Latin Hypercube Sampling to randomly sample from the parameter uncertainty space of all drivers, creating 10,000 realisations (model projections) for each of five pathways.

First, we initially looked at the performance of simulated pathways towards the targets at the indicator level over time (Extended Data Figure 5) to investigate the ambition and achievability of targets. Here, we analysed the projected value of modelled indicators, in their real units of measurement, under each simulated pathway (and its realisations) in relation to targets at three timesteps (i.e., 2030, 2050, 2100). Second, we analysed the normative value of the projected indicators (in 2030, 2050, and 2100) under each modelled pathway to measure and compare the progress across all targets consistently with a single unit (i.e., percentage of gap from target) (Figure 1). Third, we aggregated the indicators' normalised values towards targets and measured the overall progress under each pathway at the goal level to account for possible synergies and trade-offs between the multiple modelled targets under each SDG (Figure 2).
