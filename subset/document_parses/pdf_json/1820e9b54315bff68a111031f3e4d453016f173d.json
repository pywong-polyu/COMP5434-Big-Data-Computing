The prediction results of the proposed algorithm are then compared with those of the SVR algorithm, which requires iteration. Moreover, airspace operation data before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic are selected as the experimental scene, and the prediction effects of time series with different degrees of chaos are comparatively analyzed. The experimental results reveal that the PSR-ELM algorithm achieves fast and accurate results, and, when the traffic flow state is sparse, the degree of chaos is reduced and the prediction effect is improved. The findings of this research provide a reference for air traffic flow theory.",

            "text": "The extreme learning machine (ELM), which is extensively used in the short-term prediction domain, has been introduced for the training of single-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs), which randomly choose hidden nodes and the output weight. Thus, the ELM method is superior to the traditional backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm and the SLFN. Due to its significant performance, the ELM method has been widely applied in different fields [5, 6] . The first online ELM method created by Huang et al. was the online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) [7] . In theory, this algorithm, which uses an incremental construction method to simplify the updating process of hidden-layer nodes, tends to provide outstanding generalization performance at an extremely fast learning speed. In 2007, Chen et al. [8] took into account the training complexity of the network and proposed the convex incremental ELM (CI-ELM). This method can generate a universal single hidden layer according to any continuous sampling distribution with a faster convergence speed. Feng et al. [9] proposed the error-minimized ELM (EM-ELM) for the automatic determination of network architectures. This method can add random hidden nodes to SLFNs in groups according to the number of samples in the data segment, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Rong et al. [10] used the fuzzy inference system (FIS) to calculate the membership function of neural network parameters, then developed the OS-Fuzzy-ELM method, which has a significantly reduced training time. To improve the adaptability to unknown data, Miche et al. [11] proposed an optimallypruned ELM (OP-ELM) based on a two-step regularization penalty, in which L1 and L2 norms are respectively used to simplify the hidden-layer nodes and output-layer weights. Zhang et al. [12] used a sparse ELM as an alternative solution for classification, thereby reducing the storage space and testing time. Moreover, kernel matrix optimization was introduced in this method to decompose the quadratic programming problem into multiple small sub-problems, thereby enhancing the processing capacity of the ELM method for largescale data. Zhang et al. [13] proposed an adaptive dynamic ELM (D-ELM) in which the hidden nodes can be dynamically recruited or deleted according to their significance to the network performance; this method combines the advantages of EM-ELM and AG-ELM [14] . Even if the objective function is not explicitly expressed, the generalization approximation ability can still be guaranteed under a minimum error condition. Liu et al. introduced the forgetting parameters ELM (FP-ELM) to measure the effect of known data on the current data segment, and quantified the degree of concept drift in the online learning environment [15] . Moreover, this method can be used to avoid estimator windup. In general, the methods developed in these previous studies resulted in improved prediction model adaptability and parameter adjustment according to the arriving data to avoid the retraining of all the data.",

The model was found to achieve excellent prediction performance on large traffic volume datasets collected from urban intersection arteries with a shorter training time and sufficient accuracy. Zhang et al. [26] found that ELMs with heterogeneous data exhibit improvements over linear models in terms of both the level and directional accuracy when handling traffic flow time-series data.

The input format of the ELM model affects its performance and training speed. Phase-space reconstruction (PSR) [28] is the basis of chaotic time-series analysis, and significantly dominates the prediction performance. It can be used to map scalar time series to the multi-dimensional phase space and thoroughly mine the implicit information. The delay time and embedding dimension are the key parameters of PSR, and there currently exist many methods for choosing these two parameters. The methods that can be used to calculate the delay time include the autocorrelation function method [29] , the mutual information method [30] , and the average displacement method [31] . The methods that can be used to calculate the embedding dimension include the G-P method [32] , the false nearest neighbors method [28] , and the CAO method [33] . However, the C-C method [34] is different from these methods, and can simultaneously estimate the delay time and embedding dimension based on statistical results. The advantages of the C-C method are its small required amount of calculation, strong anti-interference ability, and easy use. Thus, the C-C method was selected for use in the present study to determine the two parameters for PSR. Additionally, the phase-space reconstruction ELM (PSR-ELM) method was employed to analyze air traffic flow data.",

The first step was to split the multiple trajectories that may have generated new scattered trajectories, and then to delete them altogether. In the case of sufficient data points, the distance between two adjacent trajectory points in a trajectory of the aircraft will not be more than 20 km, but, based on the distance alone, the data may be defective; thus, they cannot be readily separated. However, if the time between two adjacent trajectory points exceeds 100 s, and if the average speed is greater than 120 km/h, then the distance is also more than 20 km, and it can be considered as multiple data separation. In this case, interpolation will supplement nearly 100 points. After calculating the average number of trajectory points, each trajectory was found to have only 200-300 trajectory points on average. In this case, interpolation will lead to trajectory distortion, so the data were not considered to be defective at this time. After the dispersion of the trajectory data, the scattered trajectory data were screened. In the same research area, although the numbers of trajectory points of different trajectory data were different, there was no significant difference (a difference of 10 times or more). The number of trajectory points was counted and averaged, and one-tenth of them was taken as the threshold value. Incomplete data were deleted as scattered trajectory data. The acute angles in the trajectory were then identified, the misplaced data points were determined for smoothing processing, and the defective data (data for which the distance between adjacent trajectory points was more than 10 km) were ultimately identified for linear interpolation processing.",

The blue lines shown in Fig. 5(b) are the training set, and the red line is the testing set. Two high peaks of traffic flow can be seen in the training set, which is consistent with the original time series, but the high peaks are not sufficiently accurate. Figure 5 (c) presents the real traffic flow, which fluctuates significantly with time.

By comparison with Fig. 5 , it can be found that the two prediction models correctly predicted the zero-flow period and the flow change trend, but the MSE value of the PSR-ELM algorithm prediction result was much smaller than that of the ELM model (0.62 < 1.2467); therefore, the prediction accuracy of PSR-ELM was higher and better fit the actual situation.

The stronger the chaos of the air traffic flow time series in different periods, the more unpredictable it is.",

The degree of chaos and the advantages and disadvantages of the prediction results have always been popular research topics. For the time series of measured data, the sample size is certain; to capture the evolution law of nonlinear time series is actually a problem of randomness. In particular, the occurrence of public emergencies, such as the sudden decrease in air traffic after the outbreak of COVID-19, has created an opportunity for research in this field; even on weekdays and holidays, it is difficult to collect continuous and long-term actual measured data of air traffic flow with different flow states.",

A random non-iterative learning method was used based on its chaotic characteristics; the ELM model was used to predict the evolution of time series, and the prediction results of different algorithms at low-and high-dimensional levels, as well as in different periods, were compared. Based on this investigation, different flow states, the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of traffic flow, and the relationships between traffic flow prediction results were revealed. The research results demonstrate that the ELM algorithm can predict air traffic flow at a highdimensional angles, and that the investigated air traffic flow time series exhibited varying degrees of chaotic characteristics under different conditions. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the air traffic flow was found to become sparse, the degree of chaos was weakened, and the prediction effect was improved.",

In this paper, PSR was used to map time series from low to high dimensions, and the PSR-ELM algorithm was used to predict the evolution law of air traffic flow time series with a better prediction effect. 2) In recent years, randomness-based non-iterative methods have attracted widespread attention, but there exists a lack of comparative experiments conducted with measured data. In this paper, the error, calculation time, and regression fitting of the random non-iterative ELM, and classical SVR algorithms for measured air traffic flow time series were compared. 3) For the first time, changes in air traffic flow chaos characteristics based on the impact of COVID on the air traffic flow state were analyzed. A relationship between the flow state, degree of chaos, and prediction accuracy was found, which provides a reference for air traffic flow theory.",
