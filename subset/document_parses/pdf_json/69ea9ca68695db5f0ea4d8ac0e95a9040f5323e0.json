This pioneering study systematically investigates how Chinese central government agencies used social media to promote citizen engagement during the COVID-19 crisis. Using data scraped from 'Healthy China', an official Sina Weibo account of the National Health Commission of China, we examine how citizen engagement relates to a series of theoretically relevant factors, including media richness, dialogic loop, content type and emotional valence. Results show that media richness negatively predicts citizen engagement through government social media, but dialogic loop facilitates engagement. Information relating to the latest news about the crisis and the government's handling of the event positively affects citizen engagement through government social media. Importantly, all relationships were contingent upon the emotional valence of each Weibo post. )is researcher at the School of Journalism and New Media, Xi'a Jiaotong University in China.

Meanwhile, matching between crisis-related information demand and supply directly determines the effect of online communication (Hong et al., 2018; Wukich & Mergel, 2015) . This empirical study also reveals that posts with pictures and videos attached relating to the latest information on the pandemic still brings the most citizen engagement; this could attribute to the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986, pp. 141-172) , in which the public are more likely to use a central path to process information, rather than focusing on the use of multimedia and other peripheral clues that are not pertinent to the content during crisis. Meanwhile, this study also supports the inferences by Chung (2017) and Denkta\u015f-\u015e akar and S\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc, 2018 that the technical features of Weibo and Twitter require the public to click more often to get supplementary information with pictures or videos, thereby reducing citizen engagement. This study confirms that the dialogic loop will increase CEGSM during public health crises. This further supports the results of del Mar G\ufffd alvez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2018) and Men et al. (2018) . In fact, in order to facilitate the dialogue loop, more than 96% of the sample uses hashtags and nearly a quarter use forms of questioning when posting information. DCT states that successful online communication and dialogue depends on the implementation of five principles, including: usefulness of information, ease of interface, rule of conservation of visitors, generation of return visits, and dialogic loop (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010) . Among them, the first three relate to technology and design, while the last two relate to dialogue (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010) . A dialogue loop is a suitable starting point for eliciting a dialogue between organizations and the public. The dialogue loop makes it possible for the public to talk with the organization and for the organization to responds to public questions and concerns (Kent & Taylor, 1998) . All these actions improve the relationship between the organization and the public and gradually promote citizen engagement (Kent & Taylor, 1998) . During public health crises, government agencies actively interact with the public through a dialogue loop, demonstrating their concern for public interests, ideas, and suggestions; in response, the public feel concerned, valued, recognized, and perceive a sense of enhanced belonging to government agencies and their social media communities, which in turn becomes an important motivation for continued engagement .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 317, "text": "(Hong et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 318, "end": 340, "text": "Wukich & Mergel, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 572, "end": 609, "text": "(Petty & Cacioppo, 1986, pp. 141-172)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1297, "text": "Men et al.

This result supports previous findings which claim that different types of content meet public demands in different ways, and the differences are directly reflected in the number of likes, retweets and comments (Keib et al., 2018; Lee & Xu, 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017) .

Although the quantitative indicators such as number of likes, retweets or reposts, and comments, have become representative standards for scholars to evaluate citizen engagement on social media, some studies suggest that more appropriated indicators beyond simply number of likes could be incorporated for the practical good (Men & Tsai, 2013) . For example, Men and Tsai (2013) divided citizen engagement into passive content consumption and proactive content contribution in their research on social networking sites in China. Future research should concentrate on proactive engagement on GSM platforms, such as co-production with citizens. Secondly, this study focuses on the official Sina Weibo account of the National Health Commission of China; however, local GSM has also made considerable contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should deepen understanding into how local GSM accounts facilitate citizen engagement and co-production during public health crises, and how different it is from the central government's social media practices. Thirdly, according to the research by Ji et al. (2019) , emotional strength, emotional presence, and emotional valence affect citizen engagement through social media differently. This study only focuses on the moderating role of emotional valence, and subsequent studies can further analyze the moderating role of emotional strength.
