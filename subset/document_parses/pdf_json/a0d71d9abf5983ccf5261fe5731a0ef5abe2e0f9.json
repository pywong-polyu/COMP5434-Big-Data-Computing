Also shown, for comparison, are the best-fitting Poisson distribution (with \u03bb = 1.4)), and the best-fitting negative binomial distribution (with distribution parameters r = 0.067, k = 0.1). The difference between the latter two curves illustrates the strong extra-Poisson variation in the secondary case distribution. (B) Scatter plot of secondary cases vs degree, at the individual level. The secondary case and degree distributions are shown at the logarithmic scale, and adjusted by 1 to account for zeros, to address skewness of the distributions. Although both secondary case and degree distributions show a strong right-skew (panel A), this figure illustrates that the latter does not explain the former: despite a positive relationship between the two distributions, a substantial number of individuals with low degree generate some infections, while many with high degree generate zero onward infections. (C) Estimated marginal density of per-contactinfectiousness (PCI) that, alongside degree, is needed to explain the heterogeneity in secondary cases. Shaded intervals show 95% Bayesian credibility intervals. (D) Estimated PCI vs degree. The figure displays relationship between the logarithm of the odds (logit) of PCI and the logarithm of the degree. These transformations allow us to plausibly model the joint distribution of PCI and degree as a multivariate normal in section 4 (see Materials and Methods and Supporting Information). There is a discernible lower band due to a large number of cases with zero onward infections, which have very low estimated PCI. Among those with onward infections, there is a discernible negative association. 7 .

This heterogeneity may arise, for example, from 1 biological factors such as the role of pre-existing, cross-reactive immunity that may moderate 2 viral load in some individuals more effectively than others (14). Our analysis suggests that PCI 3 increases with age and is significantly associated with sex (Fig. S5 ). Further data on these and 4 other individual-level characteristics would be invaluable in further examining key risk factors 5 for infectiousness. Where risk factors involve individual characteristics that can be readily iden-6 tified in newly diagnosed patients, such as viral load, these factors could also play an important 7 role in guiding future contact tracing efforts. However, heterogeneity in PCI could also reflect 8 variations in the closeness of reported contacts, with some reporting only the closest contacts 9 and others reporting wider contacts, thus explaining the negative correlation. We emphasise that 10 our data is limited to defined 'high-risk' contacts (see Materials and Methods), thus excluding 11 incidental contacts that might be expected to bias our estimates the most. Nonetheless, even 12 if there is variation in closeness amongst high-risk contacts, our analysis offers an approach 13 for adjusting for these variations, when interpreting what routine contact tracing data means for 14 transmission: in this case our estimates for PCI should be regarded as a data-driven weighting of 15 contacts, rather than infectiousness.

Two possibilities exist either we got it right and A is the seed, 12 or we got it wrong and B is the seed. While we can never be sure of this answer, we can test 13 the robustness of our claims to swapping seeds and contacts. While we cannot direct compare 14 onward infections and degree of contacts to seeds due to the bookkeeping problem, we can test 15 whether seeds and contacts display similar infectiousness. Indeed, we see that that the contacts 16 (2763 individuals) of normal seeds have an aggregate test positivity of 6.0% while the contacts 17 (1885 individuals) of normal \"contacts\" have a test positivity of 6.5%. These are statistically 18 indistinguishable (p = 0.45). Thus, as long as the coding of seed and contact by the govern-19 ment of Punjab was independent of degree (which is likely because seeds were typically tested 20 due to a biological criterion -showing symptoms -and not a social criterion), we surmise that 21 our estimates of the secondary case distribution are likely to be robust to swapping seeds and 22 contacts.",

First, the procedure is not opti-4 mized for the number of contacts to test. The problem we address is similar to a bandit prob-5 lem in the machine learning literature where, as more information about the PCI distribution 6 is available through testing, the number of contacts to test is optimized to maximize the (ex-7 pected) number of infections found while minimizing the number of tests. We anticipate that 8 this sequential procedure would be challenging to implement in a public health context, partic-9 ularly in a low resource setting. Instead, we opt for a simple rule that can be implemented with 10 no additional optimization (e.g. testing family members and only testing further if at least one 11 is positive) that can still substantially improve efficiency. We also need information about the 12 joint distribution of PCI and contacts for a fully optimized approach, which we cannot estimate 13 with precision in the data from Punjab. Additionally, we do not consider imperfect tests. False 14 positives would preserve the number of infections found but make the procedure less efficient 15 since some individuals will be tested based on false positives that would not otherwise be tested. 16 False negatives will reduce the number of infections found, though this impact would be miti-17 gated by the right-skew of the PCI distribution. Finally, this procedure relies on the availability 18 of tests with relatively rapid results and the willingness of individuals to be tested. If the delay 19 between testing and receiving results is too long, then contacts who were not tested in the pilot 20 stage could be infecting others in the population while waiting to be tested. ",

The figure illustrates 11 diminishing returns in the fraction of infections found, beyond a pilot subset size of 10 contacts 12(Fig. 4A). However, even with a pilot subset size of only 5 contacts, it is possible to identify 13 80% of infections(Fig. 4A), with <40% of the contact tracing effort that was expended in this 14 data(Fig. 4B).15Discussion We have shown how individual-level data, gathered from the routine course of 16 contact tracing, can be analysed to gain important insights into the transmission of SARS-CoV-17 2. As well as affirming findings from elsewhere, that the majority of cases appear not to infect 18 any others (1, 4), our findings also highlight how heterogeneity in transmission may be more 19 complex than previously recognised.",

How-1 ever, our analysis also highlight some limitations of this distribution: accounting for underlying 2 correlations between degree and PCI can lead to different outbreak dynamics, in terms of the 3 risk and size of major outbreaks over time (Figs. 3C,D). Our results also have implications for 4 the efficiency of contact tracing. When a large fraction of infected individuals do not cause on-5 ward transmission, we show the value of a simple two-step strategy, of, for example, first testing 6 family members and then testing other contacts only if at least one family member is found to 7 be positive(Fig. 4).
