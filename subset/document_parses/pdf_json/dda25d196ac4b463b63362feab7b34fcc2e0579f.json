This is the most accurate measurement of CO 2 levels, however, it is not without complications [6] . Indwelling catheters in neonates can be associated with an increased risk of infection and thrombosis [7] . Frequent blood sampling can also be painful for infants when there is no indwelling arterial catheter. MRI studies have found that early exposure to pain stress in preterm infants is associated with reduced white matter and subcortical brain matter maturation [8] . Follow up of extremely preterm infants exposed to multiple heel prick tests in the neonatal period has shown that this can result in hyperalgesia and increased sensitivity to painful stimuli [9, 10] . Repeated blood sampling in neonates can lead to iatrogenic anaemia and the requirement for multiple blood transfusions, which are not without risks [11] [12] [13] . The Canadian Paediatric Society, Foetus and Newborn Committee recommend non-invasive CO 2 monitoring for ventilated, preterm infants to minimise blood loss and the need for multiple transfusions [14] .",

Capnography assesses breath by breath the exhaled carbon dioxide in real time and gives a continuous waveform together with the end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2 ) level [15] . Use of capnography may, therefore, reduce large magnitude of difference in CO 2 levels. Indeed, one study found the use of continuous capnography during the resuscitation of mechanically ventilated term lambs with meconium aspiration syndrome reduced the degree of the magnitude of difference in CO 2 levels [16] . Mainstream or sidestream capnography can be used. We recently reported on the performance of a novel microstream sidestream capnography device in ventilated newborns and found a good correlation of the results of that device with the gold standard mainstream capnograph [17] .",

Prospective data were collected from a cohort of ventilated infants in whom endtidal CO 2 monitoring was used from 01/01/2019 to 01/07/ 2020. Data were collected from 200 consecutively born infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from 1/1/ 17 to 1/1/19, 36 infants from this sample were matched individually for gestational age and birth weight with the 36 infants prospectively recruited. The first infant that fulfilled the matching criteria in reverse chronological order was selected as a matched control. Approval for the study was given by the London (Camden & King's Cross) Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 18/LO/1602). Written informed consent was given by parents for their infants to take part in the prospective study. The retrospective data collection was registered with the clinical governance department of King's College Hospital NHS foundation trust for retrospective use of routinely recorded data on the medical and nursing charts. No minimum number of days of invasive ventilation was required to be included into the study. Infants without full CO 2 data were excluded as were infants that were not receiving conventional mechanical ventilation.",

Infants were invasively ventilated using either volume-targeted or pressure-controlled time-cycled modes, which included assist control ventilation, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation or conventional mechanical ventilation. If receiving volume-targeting modes, initial targeted tidal volumes (TTV) were set at 5 ml/kg with peak inspiratory pressure maximum (PIP max ) at 20-25 cmH 2 O, PIP max was adjusted to 5 cmH 2 O above what was required to achieve the TTV according to observation of chest movement and blood gas analysis. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 5 cmH 2 O. Routine clinical practice was to adjust the ventilation settings to achieve target blood gases initially of pH 7.35-7.45 and PaCO 2 between 4.5 and 7 kPa in the first week after birth. As per unit policy, infants were intubated with a Cole's shouldered endotracheal tube which minimizes leak [18] . In the prospective cohort, the Microstream sidestream filterline H set sidestream capnography sample line (Phillips Medical Systems, Oridion Medical Ltd) was fitted into the ventilator circuit between the ventilator tubing and the endotracheal tube. The sample line adaptor had a deadspace of less than 0.5 mls and a weight of 3.8 g. The sample line connected to the MicroPod, an external EtCO 2 module, containing the CO 2 nondispersive infrared spectroscopy sensor. Gas was sampled at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube at a rate of 50 mls/minute to the MicroPod. The module performed automatic adjustment for the changes in ambient temperature. A continuous timebased capnography waveform and EtCO 2 value was displayed on the ventilator monitor.",

A previous retrospective study reported the maximum PCO 2 during the first 72 hours after birth was a dose-dependent predictor of severe IVH development [21] . Continuous monitoring of EtCO 2 may, therefore, have the potential to reduce the complications associated with abnormal PCO 2 levels. The low rates of IVH and the lack of significant difference in IVH rates between the two groups in our study may reflect that despite tighter control of carbon dioxide levels in the prospective cohort, the median PCO 2 values in both cohorts were still maintained within the recommended range for preterm infants on invasive ventilation [22] . We appreciate that our sample size, particularly in the sub-analysis, did not allow us to robustly assess whether the monitoring had an impact on the incidence of IVH, but this was not our primary objective.",

The change in clinician behaviour, however, was over a 3-year period [24] . The introduction of transcutaneous CO 2 monitoring in ventilated infants, despite only showing a moderate agreement with PCO 2 values and no decrease in rates of IVH, was associated with a reduction in the frequency of blood gas sampling [25] , with the reduction being more pronounced in infants receiving high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). In this study, there was no reduction in the frequency of blood gas sampling following the introduction of capnography monitoring. It may be noted that our study period was too short for an effect on behaviour to have occurred or the display of continuous EtCO 2 levels may have prompted clinicians to undertake confirmatory blood gases if extremes were noted and hence keeping infants within a narrower range of PCO 2 .",

            "text": "There has been some scepticism amongst clinicians regarding the use of capnography in neonates [26] due to their small tidal volumes and rapid respiratory rates [27] . This may, therefore, affect how they interpret its accuracy and hence their willingness to reduce the number of blood gases taken to monitor PCO 2 . We have recently described end -tidal CO 2 is strongly correlated with PCO 2 and the two methods only diverge, as expected, with increasing severity of the underlying lung pathology [17] . Our study has strengths and some limitations. The noninvasive microstream sidestream capnograph device used in the present study has been previously validated against mainstream capnography [17] . We included preterm and term infants who required ventilation for a wide range of pathologies and hence results from this study can be generalisable to other medical and surgical tertiary neonatal intensive care units. We feel our sample size was appropriate, as with a standard deviation for carbon dioxide of 14.8 mmHg (1.97 kpa) in preterm infants [1] our sample of 36 infants in each arm (72 infants in total) could detect a difference in carbon dioxide of 11.3 mmHg (1.51 kPa) with 90% power at 5% significance level. This difference is smaller than the clinically significant difference in carbon dioxide of 13.0 mmHg (1.73 kPa) reported between preterm infants with or without IVH [1] . This was not a randomised trial, but the two time periods studied, pre and post introduction of EtCO 2 monitoring, were consecutive and no other major changes in clinical practice occurred during the study period. A possible limitation of our study was that we routinely used Coles shouldered tubes which have been shown to have minimal or no leak [18] and hence may enable more accurate EtCO 2 measurements. Such tubes are not in widespread practice and it would be interesting to assess if the type of endotracheal tube does influence the accuracy of EtCO 2 monitoring",
