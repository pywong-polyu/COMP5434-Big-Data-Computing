The majority of emerging infectious disease outbreaks are caused by zoonotic/vector-borne viruses. Bats and rodents are the two most important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans, whereas mosquitos and ticks are well-established major vectors of many arboviral diseases. Moreover, some emerging zoonotic diseases require a vector to spread or are intrinsically vector-borne and zoonotically transmitted. In this study, we present a newly upgraded database of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses designated ZOVER (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ ZOVER). It incorporates two previously released databases, DBatVir and DRodVir, for bat-and rodentassociated viruses, respectively, and further collects up-to-date knowledge on mosquito-and tickassociated viruses to establish a comprehensive online resource for zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Additionally, it integrates a set of online visualization tools for convenient comparative analyses to facilitate the discovery of potential patterns of virome diversity and ecological characteristics between/within different viral hosts/vectors. The ZOVER database will be a valuable resource for virologists, zoologists and epidemiologists to better understand the diversity and dynamics of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses and conduct effective surveillance to monitor potential interspecies spillover for efficient prevention and control of future emerging zoonotic diseases.",

A retrospective analysis revealed that during the past \u223c70 years, >80% of emerging infectious disease outbreaks are caused by zoonotic or vectorborne pathogens, of which the majority are viruses (4, 5) . In addition, evidence suggests that the increased global travel, urbanization and climate changes in recent years have dynamically affected the outbreak pattern of emerging infectious diseases (6, 7) . Therefore, recent studies have intensely focused on surveys of a massive number of different viruses (collectively termed the virome) carried by key animals that are recognized as the most relevant natural reservoirs or vectors for the causative agents of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases.",

            "text": "Bats and rodents are the two most important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans, including lyssaviruses, ebolaviruses, hantaviruses and coronaviruses. In particular, bats have been suggested to be potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, which is still posing a challenge to global public health (8) . Mosquitos and ticks are well-established major vectors for the spread of many arboviral diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, West Nile encephalitis, yellow fever and Zika (6, 9) . These arthropod vectors can harbor a heterogeneous group of arboviruses and spread them among vertebrate hosts with a unique transmission mode (10) . Moreover, some emerging zoonotic diseases require an ectoparasitic arthropod vector to be effectively transmitted, whereas mammals can serve as potentially competent amplifying hosts for several arboviruses (11) . For example, rodents play essential roles in the natural circulation of vector-borne viruses, such as the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus from the family Nairoviridae and the tick-borne encephalitis virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus from the family Flaviviridae D944 Nucleic Acids Research, 2022, Vol. 50, Database issue (12) . In addition, molecular and serological evidence from the field have documented that the mosquito-bat-mosquito transmission cycle of Japanese encephalitis viruses and Chikungunya viruses was established in the laboratory (10) . Therefore, it is critical to establish a comprehensive and integrative resource of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses worldwide for efficient identification of novel pathogens to detect potential interspecies spillover. Furthermore, a better understanding of the biodiversity, geographical distribution, and host/vector specificity of zoonotic and vectorborne viruses is intrinsically important to estimate risks and design strategies for the prevention and control of future emerging infectious diseases (13) .",

To ensure the integrity of data collection, extra searches were performed with additional keywords of taxonomic family names of mosquitos and ticks as complements. Since the ZOVER database focuses on natural mammalian viruses that are most relevant to zoonotic infectious diseases, all records that matched the aforementioned keyword(s) were then precollected into the database by considering the following three criteria: (i) excluding all records of phages, as well as insect, fungal and plant viruses; (ii) removing all viruses derived from animals other than mosquitos and ticks and (iii) filtering out laboratory-cultured viruses in the model of mosquitos or ticks. All remaining records were then downloaded to the local system and converted by in-house BioPerl (17) scripts into relational tables of meta-information, including virus name, sampling time and location, associated vector, detection methods, cell culture method (if available), accession, sequence submitter(s) and affiliation, and related publication (if exists). To ensure the accuracy of the meta-data, we further performed an intensive double-check for published records by proofreading any inconsistencies and incompleteness based on the information described in related literature. Thus far, a total of 10 761 mosquito-associated viruses and 4849 tick-associated viruses have been included in the current ZOVER database (Table 1) .",

The front end of the database consists of a set of Perl CGI scripts running on an Apache webserver. To make the interface of the ZOVER database more user-friendly and interactive than traditional HTML pages, additional web programming was introduced by using the cascading style sheet (CSS), asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), the cross-platform and feature-rich JavaScript library JQuery (http://jquery.com), and the open-source web development framework Semantic-UI (https://semantic-ui. com). Moreover, for the implementation of online data analysis and visualization tools, we further employed the modern SVG-based multi-platform charting library High-Charts (https://highcharts.com), a JavaScript library for providing an interactive tree known as jsTree (https://www. jstree.com), and a plugin-rich JavaScript library for manipulating grid data known as DataTables (https://www. datatables.net/). The standalone BLAST program (19) was integrated into the website to allow users to search the database by any query sequence for homology within the full/partial dataset of ZOVER. An internal pipeline incorporating the MUSCLE (20) and FastTree (21) programs was developed to provide online analyses of multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction, respectively.",

The new web interface can efficiently present the full contents of the previous DBatVir and DRodVir databases with much better user experiences than before, as it is built on a set of lightweight JavaScript libraries that can effectively organize a large amount of tabular data in a uniform grid. Each line of the grid describes an identified virus with full metainformation along with a clickable linear map for complete viral sequences. Additional features, such as collapsible menus, expandable trees, sortable and filterable grids, and live statistical pie charts, are also available from the refreshed interface for easy online data analysis and visualization as previously described. In contrast, some web utilities of the original DBatVir and DRodVir interface now malfunction due to intrinsic deficiency within the obsolete version of the JavaScript library. Thus, although the original interfaces of DBatVir and DRodVir will remain publicly accessible for consistency, no further upgrade of the web interface will be available hereafter. Instead, we highly recommend returning users of the DBatVir and DRodVir databases switch to the new web interface of the ZOVER platform in the future.",

Therefore, it is dedicated to providing users with a comprehensive overview of the diversity of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses from a comparative perspective. For convenience, all viral families related to zoonotic and vector-borne viruses have been organized into a three-dimensional dynamic tree with each taxonomic node represented as a colored ball ( Figure 1A ). The size of each ball is proportional to the total number of associated viruses currently collected in the ZOVER database. Additionally, the ball of each viral family can be highlighted when the mouse hovers over it and provides a direct link to the detailed comparison page for the corresponding viruses. By default, the general comparison page of each viral family provides a comparative visualization landscape for the associated viruses detected from bats, rodents, mosquitos and ticks in terms of spatial/temporal distribution and host/vector diversity. For instance, a zoomable global map with gradient coloring scaled to the number of associated viruses detected in each country/region is provided for each host/vector (Figure 1B) . The four maps of bat-, rodent-, mosquito-and tickassociated viruses are tiled within a single webpage simultaneously for intuitive comparison. It is particularly helpful for investigating potential linkage(s) among the existing viral population of different hosts/vectors. Moreover, the general comparison page also includes additional tabs for details of associated viruses identified from bats, rodents, mosquitos and ticks.

The predefined general comparison modules are very convenient for users to initiate study but lack the necessary flexibility for further in-depth deciphering. We therefore introduced an additional utility to the ZOVER platform to guide advanced users in performing a highly customized comparative analysis based on the background integrative datasets. The current database collects information on zoonotic and vector-borne viruses from bats, rodents, mosquitos and ticks. All of these hosts/vectors themselves are known to be highly diversified in terms of taxonomy. Rodents and bats are the two most diverse orders of known mammals that together comprise >60% of existing mammalian species (22, 23) , while mosquitos and ticks are comprised of \u223c3500 and \u223c900 species, respectively (9, 24) . Hence, unlike the aforementioned general comparison that focuses on interhost/vector virome diversity only, the customized analysis utility allows users to conduct both inter-and intrahost/vector comparisons. Customized analyses can be performed at different taxonomic levels, such as family, genus and species, to fulfill various demands from database users. Moreover, the submission form is fully configurable to focus the comparison on any specified geographic region and/or any customized period of time to disclose possible spatial or temporal patterns of virome diversity and dynamics.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, we would like to point out some potential limitations of the current ZOVER database. First, it was constructed as a sequence-centric database since molecular methods are now commonly used in the diagnosis and functional studies of viruses. However, there are indeed some reports of viral identification based on alternative approaches without sequencing (e.g. immunological methods). Therefore, these results will be intrinsically excluded from the ZOVER database. In addition, although we conducted exhaustive searches with different combinations of keywords to retrieve related records (sequences and literature) available from the public domain, it still cannot guarantee the inclusion of all records. Therefore, we highly appreciate and encourage users to contact us for any missed sequences/literature from the ZOVER database. Second, >35% of the sequences collected in the database are currently unpublished (without related literature). Thus, the meta-information associated with these sequences is only available from the related GenBank records deposited by the submitters. Unfortunately, some of the Gen-Bank records do not provide sufficient meta-information as expected. For instance, >10% of the aforementioned unpublished sequences in the current database do not have sampling time/country available. The absence of necessary meta-information will undoubtedly hamper further data mining. We therefore propose all data submitters to provide enough meta-information along with the sequences before release to the public or alternatively to send supplementary information to the ZOVER database to make the sequencing data indeed reusable and valuable to the community. Third, the numbers of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses detected from different regions/periods collected in the ZOVER database are not exactly correlated with the corresponding surveillance efforts that have been completed. The current database includes only viruses with sequences available and therefore virtually overlooks the possible large number of negative samples tested in those studies. Indeed, the principal prevalence of each virus is unavailable from the current database since it is generally absent from most original literature. Many current studies focus on the identification of new viruses or variants rather than the prevalence of known viruses. For example, metagenomicbased methods with pooled samples have been increasingly applied in the high-throughput surveillance of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses in recent years. Thus, it is technically impossible to directly deduce or estimate the positive rate of the detected viral sequences among individual samples. Therefore, although the overall spatial/temporal features of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses observed from the large amount of data in the ZOVER database are generally reasonable and acceptable, we prefer to recommend users to interpret the customized comparison results with caution, particularly in the case of conclusions based on a limited number of data.",
