While the activities of RNA chaperones are well studied with short RNAs, little is known about their global effect on the entire viral transcriptome. Here we used Selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl Acylation Analyzed by Primer Extension and Mutational Profiling (SHAPE-MaP) to systematically examine the secondary structure of the rotavirus transcriptome alone and in the presence of NSP2. Surprisingly, SHAPE-MaP data reveal that despite the well-characterized helix-unwinding activity of NSP2 in vitro, its incubation with rotavirus transcripts does not induce a significant change in the SHAPE reactivities. However, a quantitative analysis of the per nucleotide mutation rate, from which SHAPE reactivities are derived, reveals a global five-fold rate increase in the presence of molar excess of NSP2. Further analysis of the mutation rate in the context of structural classification reveals a larger effect on stems rather than loop elements. Together, these data provide the first experimentally derived secondary structure model of the rotavirus transcriptome and reveal that NSP2 exerts a larger effect on stems, while acting by globally increasing RNA backbone flexibility in a protein concentrationdependent manner.",

Each dsRNA segment serves as a template for transcribing differently sized (0.67-3.4 kb) protein-coding +ssRNA transcripts (mRNAs) that can fold into regulatory structures, such as those predicted to be found in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (4, 5) . In addition, consensus sequences found in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal regions of these segments also have important regulatory roles in viral infection, such as recruiting viral and potentially host proteins to enhance viral translation (6, 7) . Li et al provided one of the most comprehensive studies of rotavirus RNAs based on the minimum free energy consensus structures deduced from multiple sequence alignments and covariation analysis of group A rotavirus (RVA) strains (5) . This study revealed multiple conserved RNA regions present in all RNA segments that were proposed to fold into regulatory elements. However, in this study, structure probing validation of generated models was only carried out for the smallest segment 11 transcript. Structural analysis of a complete rotavirus transcriptome with single-nucleotide precision would enable identification of readily identifiable RNA structures in rotavirus genome that would galvanize their functional validation through recently established reverse genetics studies (8) . Structural descriptions of multiple viral RNAs have uncovered myriads of previously unknown functional regulatory motifs (9, 10) . Thus, the first step of identifying functional structural domains in viral RNAs is to model experimentally validated RNA secondary structures.",

            "text": "Importantly, rotaviruses encode an RNA chaperone NSP2 that is believed to be involved in RNA selection and stoichiometric segmented genome packaging (3, 11) . Single-molecule fluorescence studies of NSP2-mediated remodeling of short (< 50 nts) RNA stem-loops indicate that NSP2 binds single-stranded RNAs with nanomolar affinity, causing transient helix destabilization and melting of its secondary structure (12, 13) . These studies also revealed that NSP2 octamers can bind to RNA stem-loops in both open and closed conformations, raising further questions about the mode of action of NSP2 as an RNA chaperone that promotes inter-segment RNA interactions (13) . While these studies were important for our understanding of the RNA chaperone-mediated RNA annealing, there is no direct evidence of structural reorganization of the RV RNA upon NSP2 binding. Moreover, NSP2 binding itself poses another major challenge for modelling RV RNA structures, as there is very little understanding of how multivalent RNA chaperones can alter RNA folding on a transcriptome level (14) . NSP2 is an RNA chaperone known to melt RNA helices, its helix destabilizing properties have been characterized using single-molecule FRET and gel electrophoresis with synthetic RNA and DNA substrates (12, 13, 15) . However, this helixdestabilizing activity has yet to be investigated using RV RNA at a transcriptome scale. RNA folding is mediated by base-pairing that forms secondary structures which play a myriad of fundamental regulatory roles including gene expression (9, 16, 17) . To experimentally interrogate RNA structure, chemical structure probing coupled with thermodynamic modeling provides single nucleotide resolution information with transcriptome scale throughput (18, 19) . This is particularly pertinent for viruses, whose RNA genomes, or ssRNA precursors of dsRNA genomes, can be directly translated into viral proteins, or participate in the assembly of a nascent virus (20, 21) . Thus, experimentally investigating RNA structure with chemical probing allows us to identify potentially new and important roles for RNA structure in rotaviruses. Here, we provide experimentally validated structure models of a complete rotavirus RNA pregenome probed by selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) and mutational profiling (MaP) analysis (19, 22) . We identified multiple conserved structured regions with low SHAPE reactivity located in the 5\u2032 terminal regions of RV RNAs. We show that the RNA chaperone NSP2 binding to RV transcripts dramatically increases mutational rates induced by the SHAPE reagent, but has no effect on the computed SHAPE reactivity, suggesting a global effect on backbone flexibility with minimal structural rearrangement. Analysis of SHAPE-informed secondary structure models in the presence of NSP2 reveals that despite its promiscuous RNA binding mode, its binding preferentially affects base-paired elements, consistent with the RNA chaperone activity. These findings support a model in which promiscuous binding of NSP2 to the rotavirus transcriptome allows this chaperone to uniformly increase the flexibility of the RNA backbone, thus leading to the increased accessibility of RNA towards the establishment of intermolecular contacts.",

Sequences for the 11 segments are listed in Supplementary File S3 in SNRNASM format. The plasmids coding for segments 2 and 8 were digested using BbsI restriction enzyme (New England Biolab, NEB), the plasmid coding for segment 10 was linearized with BsaI (NEB), and the plasmids coding for the remaining segments were linearized using BsmBI (NEB). Following linearization, the digestion product was purified, and each RV segment was then transcribed using 1 \u03bcg of linearized DNA with HiScribe T7 from NEB at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours.

Therefore, we utilized a set of plasmids used for the virus rescue to produce eleven RVA transcripts in vitro (23) . The produced RNA was intact and pure to be used for subsequent analyses by high-throughput selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) to interrogate its secondary structure (Supplementary Figure S1A) . To develop an accurate model of RNA structure of the RVA transcriptome, we co-incubated an equimolar mix of eleven RV transcripts (0.25 \u03bcM total RNA concentration) in the RNA folding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES-Na, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Under these conditions, eleven RVA transcripts did not form stable inter-molecular contacts in our previous single-molecule fluorescence studies (13) . The RNA mix was then incubated with the SHAPE reagent 5nitroisatoic anhydride (5NIA), as described in Materials and Methods (32) . Conformationally flexible nucleotides exhibit high reactivities towards the electrophile 5NIA (32), thus allowing us to assess the RV transcriptome reactivity with single-nucleotide resolution. We performed at least two biological replicates of all SHAPE experiments, and SHAPE reactivities for these replicates were reproducible and highly correlated with R 2 > 0.7 in all cases (Supplementary Table S1 ). We quantified relative flexibility of each transcript using median SHAPE analysis, as previously described (33-36) ( Figure 1A ). Regions of low median SHAPE are generally more likely to fold into a single, well-defined conformation, while nucleotides with above median SHAPE generally adopt multiple structures (34) . We modeled the secondary structure and calculated base-pairing probabilities for the entire RV transcriptome. To do so, we used our experimentally determined SHAPE reactivities averaged over both replicates as a pseudo-free energy term, as previously described (34, 37, 38) . The resulting modelled base-paired nucleotides are shown as arcs, where the color of each arc represents the likelihood of the base-pair formed ( Figure 1A ). Representative models of regions of low SHAPE (minimum free energy structures) are shown in Figure 1B .",

The analysis revealed that both models were broadly similar (PPV of 66.8% and sensitivity of 84.52%, Supplementary Figure S1B ). In addition, we compared our SHAPE-derived models with the secondary structure models derived from the sequence conservation analyses (5) . Remarkably, both conserved 3\u2032 terminal regions of segments 10 and 6 exhibited low SHAPE reactivities, consistent with the predicted highly base-paired structures (Figures 2A and B, respectively) . We further identified two previously predicted stem loops located in the 3\u2032 terminal region of segment 6. This region has translation enhancing activity important for VP6 expression (39) . (A) Median SHAPE reactivity of each of the 11 RNA transcripts representing the rotavirus transcriptome averaged over two highly correlated (R 2 > 0.9) replicates. SHAPE experiments were carried out by incubating equimolar amounts of each RV segment and probed with 5NIA as described in Materials and Methods. A 50-nucleotide window was used to calculate median SHAPE values along each transcript and normalized to the overall median of the individual transcript. Areas of high median SHAPE (i.e., above zero, shown in green) represent conformationally flexible RNA regions. Areas of low median SHAPE (i.e., below zero, shown in blue) represent regions with high propensity to base-pair.

Additionally, the first 82 nucleotides and the first 94 nucleotides of segment 9 and segment 3, respectively, are conserved. These regions of high conservation correlate with regions of low median SHAPE, structured regions, identified in these data ( Figure 1A , as indicated by boxes).

            "text": "To measure the effects of NSP2 on RV transcripts, we began by incubating in vitro transcribed segment 11 RNA (0.67 kb) with increasing amounts of the RNA chaperone NSP2, and carried out SHAPE chemical probing ( Figure 3A) . Individual SHAPE reactivities of nucleotides across the segment 11 transcript are represented in a bar chart, where high SHAPE reactivities above 0.7 (shown as red bars) indicate flexible nucleotides, while nucleotides with low SHAPE reactivities below 0.5 (shown as black bars) represent conformationally constrained nucleotides. Visual inspection of these data does not reveal any obvious large differences in the SHAPE profiles. This is confirmed in Figure 3B , where we plot the SHAPE reactivities of segment 11 alone (x axis) and segment 11 SHAPE reactivities incubated with increasing amounts of NSP2 (y axis). The analysis shows that the slopes for all the titration points were close to 1, and the data remained highly correlated with R 2 = 0.78 for the 20 \u03bcM NSP2 titration end point ( Figure 3B , purple line), which is within expected replicate-to-replicate variability (Supplementary Table S2 ). Further analysis of SHAPE reactivities of segment 11 RNA in the presence of increasing concentrations of NSP2 suggests that the global median of SHAPE reactivities remains unchanged ( Figure 3C ). Thus, SHAPE-MaP analysis suggests that segment 11 SHAPE reactivities are highly similar in the absence or presence of NSP2, with only very minimal structural rearrangement and no apparent global change in SHAPE reactivity. SHAPE reactivities are calculated from raw mutation rates ( Figures 3D and Figure 3E ). The mutation rate of the untreated sample ( Figure 3D ) is subtracted from the mutation rate of the treated sample ( Figure 3D , 5NIA) for each individual nucleotide. Statistical outliers are removed, and the remaining mutation rate intensities are normalized so all reactivities fall between 0 (highly constrained) to 2 (highly flexible) (27, 28) . Thus, if NSP2 binding uniformly increases reactivities of all bases, the apparent SHAPE reactivities would remain unchanged, while the mutation rates would uniformly increase for all bases. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the raw mutation rates. Indeed, raw mutational rate analysis confirmed that the distribution of mutation rate for the 5NIA-treated sample is shifted to the right compared to the untreated control sample. Furthermore, we discovered if replicates are carefully executed using a fixed amount of 5NIA reagent, mutation rate replicates ( Figure 3F ) are highly correlated and have a slope near one, like the SHAPE data ( Figure 3G) . We therefore hypothesized that if NSP2 has a global effect on backbone flexibility, it would effectively be normalized out using standard SHAPE-MaP data analysis, and only an analysis of the raw mutation rates could reveal any effects.",

As can be seen in Figures 5A-C, the mutation rate at 20 \u03bcM NSP2 yields slopes > 4 for segments 5, 6, and 10, respectively.

Thus, our data suggest that RNA structure is pervasive in rotaviral transcripts, and it is not limited to untranslated terminal regions. Pervasive RNA secondary structures is a feature of all RNA viruses studied to date using chemical probing including flaviviruses (42) , H1N1 (36), HIV (9), alphaviruses (10, 34) , and coronaviruses (43, 44) . It must be noted that the structures we have identified here only exist prior to genome packaging (1, 45, 46) .

At first, these results appeared to be at odds with our previous biophysical studies of the RNA chaperoning effect of NSP2 on small RNA stem-loops that revealed melting of the structure (13, 15) . However, our direct analysis of adduct-induced mutations via mutational profiling allowed us to observe the previously unknown global effect of NSP2 on the rotaviral transcripts. Indeed, the quartile normalization used in the SHAPE-MaP data processing effectively masks any large global changes in mutation rates. Thus, although next generation sequencing enables unprecedented throughput, detailed understanding of the experimental system (i.e., specific vs non-specific RNA binding, RNA:protein binding stoichiometry, complementary biophysical data supporting RNA conformational changes) should always be considered for careful SHAPE-MaP data interpretation. Furthermore, visualization of the raw mutational data during analysis should always be carried out to reveal any changes in the RNA backbone dynamics that might be normalized out in subsequent data processing steps.",

Our classification analysis of bases as paired or unpaired nucleotides allowed us to observe that the log 2 (Fold Change) in mutation rate upon addition of NSP2 was more positive for paired nucleotides across entire RV transcriptome ( Figure 6 ). Previous studies suggest that NSP2 preferentially binds unpaired RNA regions (41) , therefore the higher log 2 (Fold Change) for paired regions does not reflect any structural preference in binding of NSP2. Rather, our mutational profiling analysis indicates that NSP2 has a larger relative effect on paired nucleotide's flexibility, consistent with its role as an RNA chaperone that promotes RNA-RNA interactions by making sequestered complementary sequences more accessible for making new inter-molecular contacts. It should be noted that further in-depth analyses followed by an extensive functional validation would be required to identify the nucleotides involved in the assembly of eleven distinct RV transcripts. Recent studies of the assortment and packaging of 8 RNA segments in influenza A viruses suggest that in IAVs such interactions are likely to be highly redundant, and potentially transient in nature (36, 47) , thus making their identification and validation a particularly challenging task. Nevertheless, understanding the mechanistic role of promiscuous RNA-binding proteins with RNA chaperone activities will help our endeavors to elucidate the RNA assembly pathways leading to a stoichiometric segment packaging. It should be noted that in RV-infected cells, based on the RNA-Seq estimates, the cytoplasmic viral transcript concentration is around 10-100 nM (48) , while the intracellular NSP2 concentration reaches 1-10 \u00b5M or higher (25) . Thus, our in vitro assays are broadly in line with the physiologically relevant RNA:NSP2 molar ratios that also promote RNA:RNA interactions in vitro (13) .",

Thus, one should not interpret this increase as an overall melting of secondary structure, or rearrangement of base-pairing. Indeed, we performed an analogous NSP2 titration using dimethyl sulfate (DMS), which methylates unpaired adenines and cytosines, and does not affect the backbone. We did not observe a significant increase in mutation rate, consistent with the base-pairing remaining largely unperturbed by NSP2 (Supplementary Figure S4) . Thus, the DMS probing data and corresponding mutation rate analysis support our hypothesis that NSP2 binding increases RNA backbone flexibility, while having very little effect on Watson-Crick base-pairing under our experimental conditions. It should be noted that SHAPE reagents measure backbone flexibility by preferentially acylating 2\u02b9 hydroxyls adopting a specific flexible geometry (22, 33) . It is the relationship between backbone flexibility and base-pairing that allows us to use SHAPE reactivity to inform secondary structure prediction, but fundamentally SHAPE reagents measure flexibility. Thus, the observed global mutation rate increase for SHAPE (but not DMS) indicates the effect of NSP2 is limited to the RNA backbone.",

This allows the RNA structure to be sufficiently flexible so that it can adopt a conformation compatible with stabilization of sequence-specific, potentially transient RNA-RNA contacts. By binding to multiple RNAs concurrently via surfaceexposed positively charged grooves, NSP2 octamers act as matchmakers of complementary sequences, promoting intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions (15) . While NSP2 promiscuously binds any ssRNA with sub-nanomolar affinity, the proposed mechanism would require NSP2-RNA interactions to be transient to allow sampling of multiple interacting RNA partners. We propose that on a transcriptome level, NSP2 achieves its RNA matchmaking activity by globally increasing RNA backbone flexibility, while the formation of multiple regions of inter-molecular base-pairing is governed by specific, yet to be revealed, complementary sequences present in the RV transcriptome.",
