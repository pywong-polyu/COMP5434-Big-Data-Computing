Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the organizational and social commitments and related factors during the coronavirus pandemic of healthcare workers in northern Iran. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in 2020 among 260 healthcare workers of Babol health centers by a stratified-random sampling method. Data were collected according to a valid and reliable questionnaire consisting of three parts: 8 questions about personal and job characteristics, 15 questions from Porter Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), 15 questions from Carroll's social responsibility. Each question was scored on the Likert scale of organizational and social commitment questionnaires. Data were analyzed by chisquare and logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: None of the healthcare workers belonged to the category of low organizational commitments. A portion of 27.7% of the healthcare workers had moderate organizational commitments and 72.3% had high organizational commitments. A portion of 9.2% of the healthcare workers had moderate social commitments and 90.8% had high social commitments. Chi-square showed that education (p = 0.001), job position (p = 0.001) and the area in which healthcare workers were present for service (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with organizational commitments. According to OR in the logistic regression model, healthcare workers with master's and doctoral education levels had 3.482 times more social commitments than others and the health group had 2.455 times more social commitments compared to the treatment group.",

Many regions of the world, including Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific, became involved in the fight against COVID-19 [3] . Coronavirus also spread in Iran and quickly affected various economic, social, cultural, and health activities overthere. In the coronavirus pandemic in Iran, part of the screening, identification, and treatment of patients was the responsibility of healthcare workers and they were providing services around the clock to control the disease. Bad conditions caused by the coronavirus epidemic are expected to affect the mental and physical health, as well as the organizational and social commitments of healthcare workers [4, 5] .",

Committed people use all their power to advance their goals and the goals of the organization and do not limit themselves to do things within the framework of existing laws and structures. Existence of non-committed staff causes a quantitative and qualitative decline in the performance of the organization and leads to a lack of motivation to provide services [8, 9] .

A portion of 27.7% of healthcare workers had medium organizational commitments and 72.3% had high organizational commitments. The results of this section show that at the time of the coronavirus outbreak, the healthcare workers of health centers in Babol had positive organizational commitments. A study by Iravan Masoodi et al. (2012) showed that the mean score of organizational commitments of healthcare workers were high and positive [20] . In a study by Khodadadei et al. (2018) showed that the organizational commitment was moderate in nurses [21] . A study by Hadizadeh Talasaz et al. (2014) showed that the mean score of organizational commitment in midwives working in health centers was 76.40 \u00b1 10.06 and in midwives working in maternity hospitals was 75.61 \u00b1 11.09. In a study by Hadizadeh Talasaz et al. (2014), organizational commitment was low and very low and a small number had high organizational commitment [22] . A study by Siew et al. (2011) showed that 51% of nurses had high organizational commitment, 44% had moderate organizational commitment and 1% had low organizational commitment [23] . Since in this study, the healthcare workers had high and positive organizational commitments, it shows that they are very loyal and committed to their job to the organization. The authors of this article argue that religion may be one of the reasons for the high organizational commitments of health workers in Babol. The people of Iran are Muslims and have the religion of Islam. The religion of Islam emphasizes that if a person has made a commitment to another person such as the employer and the work environment, he or she should adhere to it and should not do less. Therefore, by strengthening Islamic knowledge in healthcare workers, we can see higher organizational commitments in them. The mean of the highest scores in the organizational commitment questionnaire was related to satisfaction with the work in the health organization and related to feel honored to work for the health organization. The results of this section are expected to be useful for health managers because they should know whether the healthcare workers are proud of their job and duty that is in order to maintain the health of the people of the community. Therefore, managers must provide favorable conditions for healthcare workers to adapt to the work environment and solve their problems, because the satisfaction of them in health centers has a positive effect on the productivity and efficiency of the organization.",

Healthcare workers serving in rural areas had higher organizational commitments (p = 0.002). In this study, health group had higher organizational commitments. This indicates that health group were loyal to the organization because the tasks of health group during the coronavirus pandemic were very difficult, including prevention, follow-up and screening, and they had to identify contaminated sources, equipment and surfaces, potential patients and carriers in very difficult conditions, in cities and villages, on impassable roads and paths. According to the results of Tables 2 and 4 , organizational and social commitments were higher in healthcare workers aged 20 to 30 years and lower in the elderly. The authors hypothesize that the reasons for low commitments in elderly workers could be the type of employment because elderly workers are formal employees and younger people are temporary employees. Formal staff have job security and are not easily fired, but temporary employees may be fired for a mistake or complaint. Therefore, young people try to do their job better with more organizational and social commitments.",
