However, we would like to encourage authors who want to submit papers to Mycological Progress to keep these recommendations in mind. Even in case of studies that have no primary taxonomic background, it will be crucial to provide as much information on the taxonomy of the fungi that were studied. For instance, we strongly discourage the \"identification\" of a fungus that is supposed to be of value for biotechnological applications or to play an important ecological role, by generating an ITS sequence and using the BLAST tool of NCBI (https ://blast .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast .cgi). The problems associated with this tentative characterization procedures based on ITS sequences have already been outlined in the past (Raja et al. 2017; Hongsanan et al 2018) . Several studies have also shown the limits of the use of this \"primary barcode, owing to the fact that intraspecific and even intragenomic polymorphisms have been commonly observed in various taxonomy groups of fungi (cf. Stadler et al. 2020 ). The use of secondary barcodes has recently also been recommended by specialists in a guideline on taxonomy of plant pathogenic fungi, where a confusion of the species involved can have drastic consequences (Crous et al. 2021) .",

In addition, certain ecological groups of fungi such as obligate parasites and mutualistic symbionts cannot be easily cultured, and so far, the rDNA is the only part of their genomes that can be made available for phylogenetic studies. In addition, there are entire families and higher taxa of saprotrophic fungi (e.g., Orbiliaceae/Orbiliomycetes; Baral et al. 2020 ) that contain many species without available DNA sequence data, or the only data available as now are ITS or a combination with other genes of the rDNA like LSU or SSU.",

The authors will instead publish the optimal phylogeny and base their concepts on successfully obtained sequence data. We therefore would like to encourage authors to send us such examples where mismatches occurred. Therefore, we are planning to publish either a large community paper or a Topical Collection on this matter (\"Negative results in fungal molecular taxonomy and phylogeny\") in the near future.

The authors propose that all scientific fungal names including the valid names of higher taxa (and not, as currently practiced by the vast majority of scientific journals, only genera and species names) should henceforth be written in italics.The major advantage of this change should be to make these names more visible, and therefore, the authors recommend italicization of all fungal names (including those above genus rank) in the future. Mycological Progress is generally in favor of this new practice, and we encourage authors of new manuscripts to follow the recommendations by Thines et al. (2020) . However, since we are aware of some constraints (e.g., with italic and other special fonts getting lost through the transfer of the manuscripts to the copy editing template), we do not yet make it mandatory. Authors should decide before submission whether they want to italicize all higher taxa or whether they want to stay with the current practice. It is important that the manuscript is consistent in this respect. Once we have managed to obtain the above mentioned manuscript template, which is supposed to make the transfer of the text into the final version of the manuscript expedient, we may make it mandatory to use italics for all taxon names consistently.",

This \"Proposal to Recommend the Use of an Identifier as an Alternative to the Citation of the Authors of Fungal Names\" concerns the introduction of an identifier for the name of a taxon issued by an ICN-recognized registration repository, which may be used in place of the author citation of the name.

Many of these recommendations are already in-line with our current Instructions to Authors, anyway, but the recent paper also gives some examples for \"model papers\" for different fungal groups and provides a template for preparing standardized species descriptions. There are some recommendations that leave room for discussion; for instance, we actually discourage the use of the artificial neologisms \"asexual\" and \"sexual morph\" because this is not always scientifically accurate (cf. Kirschner 2019). Hence, we prefer to stay with the traditional terms \"anamorph\" and \"teleomorph\" that have been used for decades and by which the ambiguity caused by parasexuality is avoided.",
