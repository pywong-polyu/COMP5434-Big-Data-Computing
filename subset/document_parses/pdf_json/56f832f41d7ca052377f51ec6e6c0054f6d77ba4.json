Existing commercial disinfectants present issues such as a high carbon footprint. This study proposes a sustainable alternative, a bioliquid derived from biomass prepared by hydrothermal liquefaction. Results indicate a high inactivation rate of pathogenic virus and bacteria by the as-prepared bioliquid, such as up to 99.99% for H1N1, H5N1, H7N9 influenza A virus, and Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores and 99.49% for Bacillus anthracis. Inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis confirmed that low-molecular-weight and low-polarity compounds in bioliquid are potential antibacterial components. High temperatures promoted the production of antibacterial substances via depolymerization and dehydration reactions. Moreover, bioliquid was innoxious as confirmed by the rabbit skin test, and the cost per kilogram of the bioliquid was $0.04427, which is notably lower than that of commercial disinfectants. This study demonstrates the potential of biomass to support our biosafety with greater environmental sustainability.",

The main transmission of pathogenic microorganisms occurs via environmental media infected with bacteria or viruses (1, 2) , such as the transmission of influenza A virus via the fecal-oral route (3) . As permafrost gradually thaws due to global warming, ancient viruses and bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis can be released into the environment and cause severe health damage (4, 5) . When global warming continues to intensify, such events may become more common on a global scale.",

In addition, commercial disinfectants rely heavily on nonrenewable raw materials and thus are not conducive to sustainable development.

The Van Krevelen diagrams of CHO chemicals suggest that the hydrothermal temperature promoted the transfer of compounds from lignin/ carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecule-like structures to aromatic structures, as indicated by the downward-moving H/C values (Fig. 1D) . Further, low-molecular-weight and low-polarity compounds were easily produced at high temperatures, which was demonstrated by the decrease of m/z and O/C ratios from 414.5 to 371.5 and from 0.423 to 0.375, respectively (Fig. 1E) . Accordingly, the relatively abundant compounds with both m/z > 400 and oxygen number > 7 were clearly transformed to lower-molecular substances and lower-oxygen substances (Fig. 1F ). This occurred because lignocellulose was gradually depolymerized and dehydrated, leading to bond breaks and oxygen separation with an increasing hydrothermal temperature (12) . The excitation-emission matrix (EEM) results further suggested that substances at 239/330 nm and 275/312 nm (excitation/emission) were related to phenol-like compounds produced by lignin depolymerization (12, 14) . The fluorescence intensity increased notably with the increasing hydrothermal temperature, which demonstrated that its concentration increased (Fig. 1G) . Similarly, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Fig. 1H) illustrated that the concentrations of low-boiling phenols and ketones (low-molecular-weight compounds) and those of the typical antibacterial components (15) were high for bioliquid yielded at 270\u00b0C and 330\u00b0C. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bioliquid produced at high hydrothermal temperatures (270\u00b0C and 330\u00b0C) presented better inactivation effects because of the high concentration of lowmolecular-weight and low-polarity compounds.",

To further investigate the broad-spectrum potential and response to pandemic outbreaks, the inactivation of the influenza A virus (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9) and B. anthracis by bioliquid produced at 270\u00b0C was tested in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Quartz sand (the main component of soil) and masks were simulated as H1N1 and B. anthracis carriers. The cell viability was 100%, and was innoxious after bioliquid was diluted to less than 1.23% for Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells ( Fig. 2A) . The inactivation rates of H1N1 (mask and quartz sand as carriers), H5N1, and H7N9 were all 99.99% (Fig. 2B) , and that of B. anthracis (quartz sand as carrier) was 99.49%. The results strongly indicate that the carriers did not influence the inactivation of H1N1, and bioliquid can potentially prevent the transmission of pandemic-causing bacteria and viruses. In addition, the inactivation rate of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores (a typical challenge bacterium used to evaluate the disinfection effect) was 99.99%, indicating that the disinfection function of bioliquid had a broad spectrum. Furthermore, the bioliquid was innoxious to rabbit skin (Fig. 2 C and D) , which suggests that this bioliquid is safe in case people or animals unwittingly touch it. Moreover, the results of earthworm toxicity evaluation indicated that bioliquid was safer than phenolic disinfectant and hypochlorite disinfectant (Fig. 2E ). The inactivation rates of E. coli and S. epidermidis by bioliquid derived from different types of biomass were all up to 100%, which indicated that bioliquid derived from all types of biomass has a great antimicrobial ability. The result of EC 50 further indicated that biomass with high lignocellulose and low ash content may be preferable for the inactivation effects (Fig. 2 F and G) . The potential production quantity and cost of this bioliquid was estimated to be 113.02 million tons and $0.04427/kg, respectively, which are beneficial for large-scale production, due to the abundance and low cost of renewable materials compared to those of the currently available commercial disinfectants (Fig. 2H) .",
