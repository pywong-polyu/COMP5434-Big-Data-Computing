            "text": "As a consequence, the importance of understanding the COVID-19 dynamics is steadily increasing in the contemporary world. In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is commonly used to evaluate the transmissibility of an infectious disease like COVID-19. R 0 is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical case in a closed population. During the outbreak of an epidemic, the basic reproduction number can be affected by intervention strategies. For example, social measures that decrease the contact rate between individuals would control the basic reproduction number. Isolating or treating the infected cases could lower the R 0 value as well. Another concept in the epidemic theory is the effective reproduction number R t , which describes the number of people who can be infected by an individual at any specific time t in a population. R t is time-specific since it accounts for the varying proportions of the population that are immune to the disease over time. There are many recent studies implementing the SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927) or its modified version to analyze the COVID-19 transmissibility in terms of R 0 or R t (see e.g. Chen et al., 2020; Alvarez et al., 2020; Kantner and Koprucki, 2020; Gostic et al., 2020; Cooper et al., 2020). Furthermore, several studies have incorporated the information on social measures to understand the COVID-19 dynamics over the world. For instance, Dehning et al. (2020) combined the SIR model with Bayesian inference to study the time-dependent spreading rate of COVID-19 in Germany. Song et al. (2020) extended the SIR model by considering the quarantine protocols with a focus on understanding the time-course dynamics of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. Giordano et al. (2020) enriched the SIR model with additional compartments to account for under-diagnosis, which could explain the gap between the actual infection dynamics and perception of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Because of heterogeneity in susceptibility and social dynamics, the COVID-19 transmissibility differs among locations and change over time. U.S. local governments have started different interventions since mid-March to combat the widespread of COVID-19. Therefore, the basic reproduction numbers should spatiotemporally vary.",

For instance, during the outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China around 2003, Riley et al. (2003) ; Lloyd-Smith et al. (2003) reported an R 0 \u2248 3.0 for the onset stage of SARS in Hong Kong. Later in Chowell et al. (2004) , the reported R 0 for Hong Kong dropped to about 1.1 due to stringent control measures. Decreasing in R 0 captured the evolution of SARS transmission dynamics under the efficient diagnosis coupled with patient isolation measures. A recent study in Germany (Dehning et al., 2020) we demonstrate that our approach can improve the accuracy of the change point detection as compared with a common multiple change-point search method. Applying the proposed methods into U.S. states, we find that the detected change points correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. We also demonstrate that the SIR model integrated with change point information provided a better short-term forecast. In all, the BayesSMILES enables us to understand the disease dynamics of COVID-19, and provides useful insights for the anticipation and control of current and future pandemics.",

Assuming that only a small fraction of the population is infected or removed in the onset phase of an epidemic, we have S(t)/N \u2248 1 and thus the second equation reduces to dI(t)/dt = (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)I(t), revealing that the infectious population is growing if and only if \u03b2 > \u03b3. As the expected lifetime of an infected case is given by \u03b3 \u22121 , the ratio \u03b2/\u03b3 is the average number of new infectious cases directly produced by an infected case in a completely susceptible population. Since it is a good indicator of the transmissibility of an infectious disease, the epidemiologists name it the basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 in the context of a standard SIR model, or the effective reproduction number R t = \u03b2 t /\u03b3 t in the context of a time-variant SIR model, where \u03b2 and \u03b3 are replaced by \u03b2(t) and \u03b3(t) in (1).",

For a region of which recovery cases are closely monitored day by day, we use E = (E 1 , . . . , E T ) to denote the sequence of cumulative recovery case numbers.

Several recent COVID-19 studies also based their analyses on this resource (Dong et al., 2020; Zhou and Ji, 2020; Toda, 2020) . We first performed a preprocessing step to ensure the quality of the infectious data I for the model fitting. Due to the fact that the recovery cases did not exist for some U.S. states, we treated I and R as missing data and reconstructed the two sequences according to the process described in Section 3.1. The observed cumulative confirmed case numbers C were collected for each U.S. state starting from an early stage of the pandemic outbreak. In particular, we chose the starting time for each state as when there were least ten confirmed COVID-19 cases for that state. We also set the removal rate \u03b3 = 0.1 as suggested by Pedersen and Meneghini (2020) and Weitz et al. (2020) . Due to the fact that different states could have different starting times, we further trimmed the sequences I and R for each state based on the latest starting time available. Finally, we set March 22, 2020, as the new starting time (t = 1) for all 50 states, and let July 19, 2020, be the last observed time point (t = 120). We used the same hyperparameter and algorithm settings as described in Section 5.3.",

In particular, for each state, we calculated the marginal posterior probability of inclusion (PPI) for all time points, where the PPI for a time point t was calculated based on the B of MCMC samples after burn-in: p PPI t = B b=1 \u03b3 t /B. Then we obtained the vector p PPI = (p PPI 1 , . . . , p PPI T ). Each entry in p PPI is a value between 0 and 1, representing the proportion of time t selected as a change point among all iterations.

If this state had at least one change point (including the confidence interval) between March 27 -April 11, the first element in its cluster label is \"Change\". Otherwise, the first element in the group label was set to \"Stable\". We repeated the same process to determine the second and third elements of the class label for each state. In the end, each state was assigned to a cluster label from \"Change-Change-Change\", \"Change-Stable-Change\", or \"Stable-Change-Change\". The map in Figure 7 colors each of the 50 states based on its cluster label, where green, yellow, and pink correspond to temporal patterns \"Change-Stable-Change\", \"Change-Change-Change\", and \"Stable-Change-Change\", respectively. Interestingly, three out of the four states we have analyzed, New York, Texas, and California, belonged to the same category, i.e. \"Change- is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

The rest states in the 10 states with the most COVID-19 confirmed cases, including Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey, were labeled as \"Change-Change-Change\", and all of them had a change point between May 1 and May 10. As discussed in Section 6.1, Florida had a change point around May 13 with a confidence interval [May 8, May 18]. According to the Executive Order 2020-32 issued by the Illinois governors, the state entered the phase II reopening starting on May 1 with a modified stay-at-home order. For New Jersey, the statewide state-athome order was not lifted until June 9. However, our model suggested a change point around the end of April with a confidence interval [April 25, May 3] with a drop in R 0 from 1.11 to 0.68 (details available at https://shuangj00.github.io/BayesSMILES/). We noticed that on May 3 the New Jersey Governor announced a multi-state agreement to develop a regional supply chain for personal protective equipment, other medical equipment and testing. This joint-state protective measure allowed for efficient delivery and reliability of medical equipment for states, and therefore best utilized the life-saving resources in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Here, we used the estimation results from BayesSMILES to predict the new confirmed cases for the four states that we analyzed: New York, Texas, Florida, and California. As suggested in Section 6.1, the basic reproduction number R 0 for one state could go above or below the threshold value of 1 at different disease stages. Hence, for short-term forecasting, the predictions given by the BayesSMILES were based on the last segment's information, which ensured that the predictions fully reflected the most recent disease characteristics. In contrast, we evaluated an alternative approach that ignored the underlying disease dynamics and used all the data to fit a single SIR model for the prediction. We named this method FullDataSIR. Here, we illustrated the advantages of incorporating the change point information into prediction. In particular, we compared the prediction accuracy of the two methods: the BayesSMILES and FullDataSIR. Figure 8 showed the true value of the new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and the two types of predictions for the four states. For each state, the 7-day forecast was from July 20 to 26.",

Those identified change points correspond to latent events that significantly alter disease spreading rates, while the resulting segments are characterized by unique epidemiological patterns. We further describe the disease transmissibility for each of the segments by using a stochastic time-invariant SIR model, assuming the transmission rate remains the same till the next change points.

These studies motivated us to detect the important transitioning times that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. The change points that caused the transitions partitioned the COVID-19 data into segments characterized by unique temporal patterns. A stochastic version of the discrete-time SIR model was then applied to estimate the basic reproduction numbers across segments. For a given population, the variation in the reproduction numbers across different stages reflects the efficacy of the state governmental interventions. We propose BayesSMILES: Bayesian Segmentation ModelIng for Longitudinal Epidemiological Studies, to study the dynamics of COVID-19 transmissibility and to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The BayesSMILES adopts a Bayesian Poisson segmented regression model to detect multiple change points based on the daily infectious COVID-19 cases. This novel model can 1) capture the epidemiological dynamics under the changing conditions caused by external or internal factors; 2) quantify the uncertainty in both the number and time of change points; 3) adjust any relevant explanatory time-varying covariates that may affect the infectious case numbers. In addition, the BayesSMILES incorporated the change point information to quantify the COVID-19 transmissibility by estimating the distribution of the basic reproduction numbers among change-points segmented temporal spans.

The red dashed and the blue solid lines represent the true and the estimated change point locations, respectively, while the gray ribbons represent the 95% confidence intervals for those identified change points. As we can see, the BayesSMILES successfully detected the three true change points in general, as each of the 95% confidence intervals covered the truth.The resulted values of ARI and MI were 0.93 and 1.28, respectively. Later on, the stochastic SIR model introduced in Section 3.4 was then fitted to quantify the disease transmissibility in each segment bounded by the identified change points.Figure 3(b) shows the posterior distributions of R 0k 's fork = 1, 2, 3, 4 from their MCMC samples. The red dashed and blue solid line pinpoints the true and posterior mean of R 0k 's, while the two black solid lines mark the boundary of their 95% credible intervals. Clearly, those true values were within their corresponding 95% credible intervals. The final RMSE for R 0 estimation was 0.38 for this single simulated dataset.To our best knowledge, there is no method like the BayesSMILES that can detect latent change points while characterizing the transmission dynamics through an SIR model. Thus, in setting up a comparison study, we therefore considered a two-stage approach that first identifies multiple change-point of time-series data based on a likelihood based framework, and then estimates the basic reproduction numbers between each pair of nearby change points, following the stochastic SIR model introduced in Section 3.4.

We estimated the posterior mean of the basic reproduction number decreased from 2.24 (between March and to March 27) to 1.63 (between March 28 and April 8). Notably, March 28 was the date when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a 14-day domestic travel advisory for non-essential persons, which presumably alleviated the situation for the populated states such as New York. The second change point appeared around April 9, and the R 0 of the third segment dropped to 0.98 with a 95% credible interval of [0.76, 1.25]. This matched the exact day when the New York state posted its first drop of the ICU admissions since the COVID-19 outbreak began. The third change point was around April 27. Though there was no direct intervention issued in late April, we noticed that the mayor of New York City announced that all the major events had been canceled starting from April 20. This action could bring a positive effect in controlling the outbreak, and our estimation from the SIR model suggested a further decrease in the basic reproduction number down to 0.66 with a 95% credible interval of [0.54, 0.81]. We observed another change point around June 18, which was close to the Phase II reopening of New York state on June 22. During the Phase II reopening, restaurants were allowed for outdoor dining, stores opened for in-person retail, and more services resumed operational under strict limitations. Thus, we saw a little \"bounced back\" in R 0 from 0.66 to 0.82. The last change point was on June 29. As expected, the basic reproduction number increased to 1.04 with a 95% credible interval of [0.84, 1.29] in the last segment. Although there was no public announcement",

The estimated basic reproduction number was 1.29 with a 95% credible interval [1.02, 1.62]. This increase appeared around May 25 could be due to the Governor's updated executive order issued on May 26 that allowed additional services and activities to open for phase II reopening. The next change point was around June 16, and R 0 further increased to 1.72 with a 95% credible interval [1.40, 2.11]. According to the prediction reported by UT Austin's COVID-19 Modeling Consortium at the end of May, there might be a significant increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations beginning mid-June (News from kxan). Here, the change point location, as well as the increased basic reproduction number, were consistent with the results of this report. The last change point was around June 28 with an estimated decrease in R 0 to 1.42 with a 95% credible interval [1.17, 1.72]. Notably, the Texas Governor issued multiple executive orders around late June to early July to mitigate the disease spreading. For instance, the executive order on June 26 reemphasized the limited occupancy for all business establishments in Texas. According to an executive order on July 2, all Texans were required to wear a face-covering in public spaces in counties with 20 or more positive COVID-19 cases. On the same day, the Governor announced an update regarding the executive order on June 26 with additional measures to slow down the spreading of COVID-19.",
