Although many coronaviruses had been identified and characterized, they might be a tip of the iceberg and lots of potential severe and novel zoonotic coronaviruses needed to be revealed. On January 20th 2020, the Chinese government has revised the law provisions of infectious diseases to add the novel 2019-nCoV as class A agent.
