The interaction between RSV, envelope glycoproteins G and F, and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) is required for binding and entry into the host cells. A G2-S16 polyanionic carbosilane dendrimer was identified as a possible RSV inhibitor. We speculated that the G2-S16 dendrimer adheres to the host cell-surface HSPG, acts through binding to HS receptors, and prevents further RSV infection. The G2-S16 dendrimer was non-toxic when applied intranasally to Balb/c mice, and interestingly enough, this G2-S16 dendrimer inhibits 85% RSV. Therefore, our G2-S16 dendrimer could be a candidate for developing a new possible therapy against RSV infection.

Another study made with nanoparticles against RSV was shown to have very promising data as prophylactic or therapeutic approaches, placing nanoparticles as a very interesting and effective tool; meanwhile, the vaccine is developed [10] . Additionally, mice models had improved the present airway epithelial cells culture as well as the data obtained and mimic real respiratory infections [5, 11, 12] . The first infection step is mediated by the interactions of RSV envelope glycoproteins G and F and the cell surface HSPG [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Indeed, to generate a compound capable of blocking the interaction between heparan sulfate (HS) and HBD, resulting in an inhibition of infection generated by different viruses, such as RSV, would be an interesting therapeutic approach. This scenario makes the G2-S16 dendrimer an important tool for antiviral research, and the dendrimers could be a new possible effective therapeutic agent against RSV. Our main objective has been to evaluate the G2-S16 dendrimer for its possible anti-RSV activity and not only to research its mechanisms of action but also its biocompatibility in human cells lines and in BALB/c mice.",

Particularly, polyanionic carbosilane dendrimers, a class of hyper-branched polymers with a nanoscale globular shape, well-defined functional groups at periphery, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic cavities in the interior, and low polydispersity have proven to be broadspectrum antivirals with promising results. Globally, RSV infection is estimated at 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths annually [1] . Current advances in the use of nanoparticle technology such as dendrimers have found new opportunities that address some limitations in effective therapeutic agents. This RSV represents an important health problem in newborns, infants, young children, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly, due to the fact that there is no licensed vaccine for RSV and an effective therapeutic agent is needed [2] [3] [4] .

Indeed, to generate a compound capable of blocking the interaction between heparan sulfate (HS) and HBD, resulting in an inhibition of infection generated by different viruses, such as RSV, would be an interesting therapeutic approach. This scenario makes the G2-S16 dendrimer an important tool for antiviral research, and the dendrimers could be a new possible effective therapeutic agent against RSV. Our main objective has been to evaluate the G2-S16 dendrimer for its possible anti-RSV activity and not only to research its mechanisms of action but also its biocompatibility in human cells lines and in BALB/c mice.",

            "text": "Syncytium formation is a well-known mechanism of cell-to-cell infection that contributes significantly to virus spread in vivo. The RSV specifically uses syncytium formation to spread infection. To determine whether G2-S16 dendrimer prevents cell-to-cell spread of RSV after infection, a syncytium formation assay was performed on infected A549 cells after 72 h. The G2-S16 dendrimer was not toxic at the range of concentrations evaluated on A549 cells ( Figure 1D ). The inhibition range of the G2-S16 dendrimer was also measured in A549 cells at a MOI 3 ( Figure 3A ) to determine EC 50 and subsequently, therapeutic index (SI). As expected, in fields without the presence of RSV, the G2-S16 dendrimer is located inside A549 cells, mainly at the cellular surface (Figure 4 ; white arrows). These data are in concordance with cellular protection assay results, where the G2-S16 dendrimer is able to interact with A549 cells and protect RSV infection. In these fields where syncytium was generated, the G2-S16-FITC dendrimer was visualized inside the syncytium (Figure 4) , suggesting that it could interfere with adjacent cells, avoiding syncytium spread. Firstly, A549 cells were infected with RSV at a different MOI to allow syncytium formation and visualization. MOI 10 was selected for syncytium assays ( Figure 3B ). A549 cells were infected with RSV, treated with G2-S16 dendrimer, and stained for H/E ( Figure 3C ). Even the increase in RSV quantity, the G2-S16 dendrimer was able to reduce the number and mainly the size of the syncytium generated ( Figure 3E,F) . Infected A549 cells were also immune-stained to confirm inhibition observed in optical microscopy ( Figure 3D ). A549 cells were fixed 72 h post-infection and stained for RSV-F viral protein (white), HSPG (red), phalloidin (green), and nuclei with DAPI ( Figure 3D ). Our data demonstrated that treatment with G2-S16 dendrimer, even RSV infection, when performed at a MOI 10 reduced significantly the syncytium quantity and mainly the size of the formed multinuclear cells. Interestingly, when RSV infection occurs and syncytium is formed, the images reveal a polarization in the main receptor of RSV, HSPG, favoring infection and co-locating with RSV-F. We demonstrated that the G2-S16 dendrimer reduces syncytium formation, particularly the size of the syncytium, indicating a promising function against RSV infection. Thus, the next step was to locate the G2-S16 dendrimer in syncytium formation.",

Studies of cytotoxicity and inhibition curves made it possible to calculate the selectivity index (SI) of the G2-S16 dendrimer, enabling a value of >300 for RSV inhibition.

This first step confirms that G2-S16 dendrimer inhibition occurs in the entry early events of RSV infection. Data also confirm that this inhibition is mediated by an interaction of G2-S16 dendrimer with cellular receptors ( Figure 2) ; meanwhile, the interaction of the G2-S16 dendrimer with the RSV viral particles does not generate a significant effect in the RSV infection ( Figure 2 ). All these data demonstrate that the G2-S16 dendrimer is capable of interacting with host cellular receptors implied in the RSV infection. We previously described that G2-S16 dendrimer interacts with cellular HS and HBD in HSV infection [34] [35] [36] [37] . We also previously described that the G2-S16 dendrimer could interact electrostatically with the viral glycoproteins of the viral surface as well as cellular receptors [21, 22] . Interestingly, the RSV cellular entry mediators in the viral infection are mainly the HSPG, in such a way that it allows us to hypothesize that the RSV inhibition demonstrated by the G2-S16 dendrimer could be due to the interaction of the dendrimer with HSPG of the cellular surface, blocking this crucial initial step of the RSV infection.",

Our results clearly showed that the G2-S16 dendrimer applied intranasally at 93 mg/kg in BALB/c mice was well tolerated, and no significant signs or damage to pulmonary parenchyma or pleura were observed (Table 1 ). In addition, we also analyzed the antiviral activity of the G2-S16 dendrimer in BALB/c mice, and we demonstrated that it decreased by 86% when RSV infected BALB/c mice were treated with this G2-S16 dendrimer ( Figure 5 ).",

G2-S16 inhibits RSV infection in vitro and in vivo, and it presents good biocompatibility in vivo. In conclusion, G2-S16 dendrimer therapeutic application needs careful design and treatment regimen to be considered effective for RSV treatment. G2-S16 dendrimer in combination with biocompatible drugs and/or molecules could be a promising therapeutic for that infection. The use of G2-S16 dendrimer could also contribute to finding a solution to prevent RSV infection in infants and other target populations.",
