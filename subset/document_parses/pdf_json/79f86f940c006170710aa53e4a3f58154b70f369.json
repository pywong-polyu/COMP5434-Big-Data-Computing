            "text": "The triterpene oil squalene is an essential component of nanoemulsion vaccine adjuvants. It is most notably in the MF59 adjuvant, a component in some seasonal influenza vaccines, in stockpiled, emulsion-based adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines, and with demonstrated efficacy for vaccines to other pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Squalene has historically been harvested from shark liver oil, which is undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this study, we have demonstrated the use of a Synthetic Biology (yeast) production platform to generate squalene and novel triterpene oils, all of which are equally as efficacious as vaccine adjuvants based on physiochemical properties and immunomodulating activities in a mouse model. These Synthetic Biology adjuvants also elicited similar IgG1, IgG2a, and total IgG levels compared to marine and commercial controls when formulated with common quadrivalent influenza antigens. Injection site morphology and serum cytokine levels did not suggest any reactogenic effects of the yeast-derived squalene or novel triterpenes, suggesting their safety in adjuvant formulations. These results support the advantages of yeast produced triterpene oils to include completely controlled growth conditions, just-in-time and scalable production, and the capacity to produce novel triterpenes beyond squalene.",

Currently, the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and widely administered under the tradename FLUAD (Seqirus) since 2015 for people over the age of 65 in the United States. Recently, studies comparing MF59 adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in young infants have reported that the use of the MF59 adjuvant enhanced immunogenicity by inducing higher antibody titers and longer duration responses, leading to the use of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine for children in Canada [10] [11] [12] [13] . The MF59 adjuvant's utility is not solely for the purpose of the seasonal influenza vaccine. Studies investigating the efficacy of MF59 for pandemic influenza vaccines have also demonstrated the ability of MF59 to reach and satisfy the European Union's CHMP criteria for vaccine licensure and allow for the induction of cross reactive, long lasting memory B cells 14, 15 . MF59 also has demonstrated that it enhances cross reactive neutralizing antibody response to the pandemic influenza virus 16 . Furthermore, MF59 has been found to elicit a strong response across a variety of antigens such as for tuberculosis and chlamydia vaccine preparations 17 . Such findings suggest good potential for application over a wide variety of vaccines.",

This adjuvant creates an immunocompetent environment at the injection site by increasing antigen uptake and recruiting a greater number of monocytes and neutrophils 19 . The oil in MF59 is the triterpene squalene. Squalene was initially characterized from shark liver oil by Tsujimoto in 1916 20 , and the richest natural source of squalene still continues to be from deep-sea shark livers. Unfortunately, due to overfishing and increased pollution in the ocean (such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants) that can contaminate the triterpene product, shark-derived squalene is an unfavorable source for medical applications 21, 22 . Crude olive (Olea europa) oil has been an alternative source of non-animal squalene for when purity requirements have been lessened, as in personal care applications. Olive oil is ~ 0.15% squalene by weight, with the triterpene being more easily obtained through the deodorized distillate-a byproduct in the olive oil refining infrastructure. However, because of the low amount of squalene and the complex chemical mixtures inherent to plant extracts, the final purity of olivederived squalene is often ~ 97.5%, compared to the > 99% purity from the marine source 22 . While it is possible to obtain higher levels of purity from the plant source, it is not economical, and this discrepancy is critical in a demanding application like a vaccine. Despite this caveat, plant-derived squalene has been evaluated for its application in an emulsion adjuvant in Neisseria meningitidis B and influenza vaccines 23 . That investigation concluded that there was no difference in the antibody titers elicited between animal-and plant-sourced squalene.",

The design of the yeast chassis allows for the total biosynthetic production of squalene and other triterpene oils. More specifically, we are interested in applications for squalene isomers, such as botryococcene. Botryococcene is an isomer of squalene that is generated when the two precursor molecules, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), are conjugated in an asymmetrical manner unlike squalene, giving rise to a more branched triterpene oil 26, 27 (Fig. 1) . Botryococcene is naturally produced only by the green algae, Botryococcus braunii, which has specific races; one of which (race B) produces large amounts of triterpene oils, including methylated forms of both squalene and botryococcene 26, 28 . While B. braunii can produce large amounts of triterpene oil (> 30% of its dry weight) its slow-growth habit 29 , resistance to extraction 30 , and mixture of chemically similar triterpene oils-which would require laborious purification to obtain large amounts of individually pure triterpenes-all make it a less desirable source. Yeast have several advantages such as ease of genetic modification, a large body of work in scaling bioreactor/fermentation processes, a prevalence of accessible infrastructure for scaling, and are a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organism by the FDA 31 . The ability to easily genetically manipulate yeast also allows for more specific (or less complex) mixtures to be produced, allowing for easier purification.",

In a similar manner, we compared yeast-produced squalene, botryococcene, and a mixture of methylated squalenes as adjuvants in comparison to a commercially available emulsion (Addavax) and an in-house formulated shark squalene emulsion. Our goal was to compare the equivalency of Synthetic Biology squalene in adjuvant formulations to that derived from shark, as well as to perform the first of its kind SAR for structurally distinct triterpenes to elicit biologically significant increases in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ antibody and hemagglutination-inhibiting titers.

Briefly, yeast were simultaneously selected for aerobic sterol auxotrophy, a constitutive gain-of-function Sterol Uptake Enhancement (SUE) mutation, and production of high amounts of the triterpene precursor, FPP. Squalene or botryococcene production was obtained through introduction of a full-length B. braunii squalene synthase gene (BSS) or the squalene synthase-like (SSL) fusion protein of B. braunii SSL-1 and SSL-3 that includes a membrane associating region, respectively 32 . The mixture of methylated (C31 and C32) and non-methylated (C30) squalenes were obtained by integrating a copy of BSS and a copy of B. braunii triterpene methyltransferase 1 26 into the yeast genome. Triterpenes were extracted from yeast cultures by adding acetone and hexane to the aqueous culture for a final ratio of 1:1:1 (acetone:hexane:aqueous). The mixture was shaken and allowed to separate into organic and aqueous phases. The upper organic phase was collected and condensed by rotoevaporation. The condensed extract was purified over a silica column using hexane as an eluent. The triterpene fraction was assessed for purity via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the singly purified triterpenes were also verified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with comparison to analytical standards (Supplemental Fig. 1 ).",

An adjuvant using shark-derived squalene was also generated as an in-house formulation control. DLS spectroscopy indicated the average size of the emulsion droplets were 179.88 nm, 183.97 nm, 175.13 nm and 196.47 nm for the shark squalene, yeast derived squalene, botryococcene and mixed squalene, respectively ( Table 1 ). The nanoemulsions that were produced using the yeast triterpenes were similar in size compared to the formulation produced using the shark squalene and to Addavax. The polydispersity index (PDI) was also measured for all samples and were similar to the control, Addavax (Table 1 ). In addition, antigen integrity was verified by SDS-PAGE 36 and zinc staining after the adjuvants were formulated with the influenza vaccine and exhibited no difference compared to antigen only (Supplemental Fig. 2) . Adjuvant stability was evaluated after storage at 4 \u00b0C for 24 months and measured again using DLS which indicated less than a 5 nm change in particle size of the adjuvants produced using the yeast-derived triterpenes (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Synthetic Biology squalene and novel triterpenes do not exhibit reactogenic effects. Vaccines were delivered subcutaneously in the shaven hindquarters of BALB/c mice. The vaccine site was kept shaved to monitor for any morphological reactogenic effects. Some mice exhibited a raised white area around the injection site, which appeared at varying times post-injection (days to weeks after immunization) but subsided within a few days. Beyond this, it did not appear to cause any discomfort and most likely would have gone unnoticed if the area had not been shaved. These phenomena appeared more in adjuvanted versus antigen only vaccines but did not consistently occur more in any specific adjuvant formulation. While we found few other reports of similar pathology in the literature, it was most similar to a result observed with the RIBI emulsion adjuvant 37 . None of the yeast-produced triterpene formulated adjuvants exhibited any reactogenic morphologies nor were there any consistent gross changes to the spleen, liver, kidneys, or Peyer's patches at the end of the experiment in any of the treatments.",

IgG1 and IgG2a, for the combined sexes showed significantly higher titers for all the adjuvanted groups compared to the non-adjuvanted control at day 21 (Supplemental Fig. 4a ,b) and day 42 (Fig. 3a,b) . In addition, when comparing the response from 21 to 42 days, there was an approximately tenfold increase in the IgG titers (Supplemental Fig. 4 and 5) . At day 21, there were no significant differences in the titers between the three yeast-derived triterpene adjuvants compared to the shark squalene or the commercially available Addavax (Supplemental Fig. 4 ). The total IgG against the quadrivalent antigen results mirrored the individual IgG results; there were no significant differences between any of the yeast triterpenes and the Addavax or marine squalene controls, with significant differences only between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups (Fig. 3c) . IgG1:IgG2a ratios were not statistically different when comparing the antigen only treatment to any of the adjuvanted vaccines. The mixed squalenes did give a slightly lower IgG1:IgG2a ratio and was significantly lower than shark squalene adjuvanted treatment (Fig. 4) . IgE titers against the quadrivalent antigen were not detected above background in any of the treatment groups (data not shown) suggesting no allergic reactions triggered by any of the vaccines. In agreement with the ELISA data, the HI assay also showed significantly higher titers of HI antibodies in each of the adjuvant treatments compared to the antigen only treatment coinciding with the overall antibody responses (Fig. 5) . We also assayed for the presence of IgE antibodies against botryococcene due to it being a non-native compound. No detectable levels of IgE antibodies against botryococcene above background were detected. Sera collected four hours after the boost immunization (day 21) were analyzed for 14 cytokines in a multiplexed ELISA assay to determine potential differential inflammatory responses induced by the adjuvants. Only four cytokines were present at detectable levels in all treatments: IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, CCL2 and CCL5 (Supplementary Table 1 ). IL-1\u03b1, while detectable in all treatments, did not show any significant differences between administered vaccines (Fig. 6a) . However, IL-6 ( Fig. 6b) and CCL2 (Fig. 6c) both showed significantly elevated levels in all adjuvanted samples, except for Addavax (which did not show a significant difference from any of the treatments), when compared to the antigen-only control. Interestingly, the mixed squalene and C30 botryococcene adjuvanted treatments were also significantly different from each other in CCL2 (Fig. 6c) . CCL5 levels exhibited no difference between non-and adjuvanted treatments, but again C30 botryococcene and mixed squalenes were significantly different from each other (Fig. 6d) .",

However, we cannot attribute any important physiological phenomena to the difference observed in the CCL2 and CCL5 levels in the methylated squalene and botryococcene adjuvants at this time. Although, this might support further investigation into mixtures of squalenes to test nuance responses in T cells and B cells with the goal of creating a more desirable immune response and a more tailored adjuvant.",

From the physical characteristics of the nanoemulsion to the antibody and cytokine responses, these Synthetic Biology-derived triterpenes performed equally well in comparison to the currently shark-sourced squalene. However, issues of purity, origin, and pollutant contamination makes these Synthetic Biology derived triterpenes potentially superior to the current conventional sources. were the only detectable cytokines in serum using a multiplexed ELISA (14 cytokines assayed).

Antigen only (IgG1: n = 16; Total IgG and IgG2a: n = 18), Addavax (n = 12), shark squalene (IgG1 and total: n = 12; IgG2a: n = 11), C30 squalene (IgG1 and total: n = 12; IgG2a: n = 11), C30 botryococcene (IgG1: n = 26; Total and IgG2a: n = 30), mixed squalenes (IgG1: n = 13; IgG2a: n = 21; Total: n = 24). GMT are presented from samples determined in duplicate (\u00b1 geometric standard deviation). Group values were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test (\u03b1 = 0.05). Different letters above groups represent significant differences, shared letters represent no significant differences. Open circles represent individual animals (males and females).Scientific Reports| (2020) 10:17090 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73868-6",
