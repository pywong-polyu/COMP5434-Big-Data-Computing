Our study explored the experiences of students, host organisations and universities participating in volunteering in Australia, identify good practice, and discover barriers to success. A qualitative approach involved 60 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Students were often seen as being energetic, having flexible time and having skills associated with their studies. Some organisations, however, viewed students as unreliable, hard to manage and requiring specific programs. Some hosts were viewed as not valuing student volunteers, or not having the capacity to supervise. These perceptions were found to be nuanced. Erroneous myths were seen to develop from a single event, later confirmed by a 'related' event; in scenarios with multiple players, motivations, and complexities. The potential for misconceptions to undermine the true value of student volunteering for all stakeholders is ameliorated when there is common understanding, clear expectation setting, and ongoing dialogue.",

The overarching study of university student volunteering in Australia sought to explore the experiences of students, host organisations and universities participating in volunteering, to discover barriers to success and identify good practice from the perspectives of stakeholders in a range of settings. Myths and misconceptions became the focus of an emergent research question and were identified as important potential barriers to success. This paper examines myths and developing myths about university student volunteering, considers their development and perpetuation, and identifies potential steps to their reduction based on data collected for the larger project, including stories from all stakeholders about their experiences.",

            "text": "In organisational settings, stories, not necessarily founded in fact, are used to explain or understand the world. Repeated stories become woven into the fabric of an organisation, are used in developing understanding, and are powerful in shaping behaviour (Gabriel, 1991) . Bolman and Deal (2017) identify that myths and stories offer explanation and legitimation, adding to cohesion and mediating contradictions in turn providing the narrative of the organisation and its culture. Stories are capable of providing substance to the development and evolution of organisational culture, as well as offering researchers the opportunity to capture key data on interactions in organisations (e.g. Dailey & Browning, 2014; Maclean et al., 2012; Martin, 2016; Yost et al., 2015) . Stories can also be the basis for unhelpful stereotypes (Lyons et al., 2015; Riggio & Saggi, 2015) , creating and sustaining beliefs about individuals or groups (Bradley et al., 2000) . Stories are retrospective, part of the sensemaking process (Weick et al., 2005) , and contain individual interpretations, based on their view of the world. Repetition of stories, while useful in the transmission of knowledge and powerful in interpretation, can also serve to justify actions, rationalise outcomes, allow 'shaping' of understanding (Dailey & Browning, 2014; Weick, 2012) and potentially even serve to subvert, manipulate, challenge, create dissent, and alienate (Beigi et al., 2019) . (Mis)understandings and (mis)interpretations lead to the development of erroneous myths or misconceptions, which then influence behaviour, and efforts to dispel such myths can be harder than 'slaying dragons' (Gabriel, 1991, p. 427) .",

Sensemaking (Weick, 1995) happens constantly, retrospectively, (often) subconsciously and is grounded in individual understandings of the world. In groups and organisations, shared sensemaking creates mutual understanding by developing a common narrative. Explanatory stories need to be plausible, and fit with existing understandings and shared assumptions. Sensemaking is heightened, becoming incipient, when a trigger or prompt, an interruption, causes 'what is happening here' and 'what action is needed' thinking. Triggers come from anything which does not quite fit or does not meet expectations. Stories which seem to 'make sense' are likely to appease discomfort and be accepted as reality. Stories can, however, be the basis of erroneous myths, particularly if perpetuated by repetition (see also Weick et al., 2005) .",

Embedded stories become norms, influencing decision-making and behaviour, increasing in plausibility as the practices they influence become pervasive and self-perpetuating. The norms and assumptions on which decisions and behaviour are based become self-reinforcing, especially when individuals with influence appear to accept them. It is such self-reinforcing behaviour, which authors such as Tucker and Edmondson (2003) have long advised managers to question to prevent the perpetuation of errors in judgement based on myths or erroneous assumptions. As identified by Boje and et al., (1982, p. 18) , organisations engage in mythmaking, as 'an adaptive mechanism\u2026. to attribute meaning to activities and events\u2026.",

Categorical thinking, conceiving people as being part of a social category or group, is one of the processes by which the brain organises complex knowledge, and has functional value in assisting employment of that knowledge, particularly in social processes (Liberman et al., 2017) .

Elements found to be central to success are: being organised and prepared to host students (Gazley et al., 2013; Worrall, 2007) , good relationships, good communication and processes (Edwards et al., 2001; Littlepage et al., 2012) ; and appropriateness of students' skills and attitudes (Gazley et al., 2013) .

Top down coding, once this issue was identified, led to the conclusion that there was of a series of myths and misconceptions identified as in place or developing. The research team then examined their formation, evolution and perpetuation, and possibilities for amelioration. Member checks (Thomas, 2017) were undertaken via participant feedback workshops. Participant feedback workshops were carried out by the research team. They involved a series of workshops with participants who had been involved in the original research (member checks), and with broader stakeholders across Australia with an interest in University Student Volunteering. Over 200 people were involved in these workshops, which were interactive sessions to explore our findings and refine our thinking. The richness of the feedback enabled good discussion about all aspects of the project, including myths and misconceptions and the research team's understanding of these. The interpretation as to whether a myth or misconception was in place, or still developing, was based on both experiences of participants who had been subject to the outcomes of decisions, and on the reports of those who had witnessed these outcomes or been involved in discussions about university student volunteers.",

In 2019 (and pre COVID 19), Universities Australia (2019) reported that only 60.9% of higher education students are under 25 years of age, with 39.1% being older. Further, many students are working while studying, including many in casual employment to fund their studies. These factors restrict time availability of students for volunteering. Student profiles across the participating organisations further illustrated the diversity of Australian university students. The typical student at one of the universities studied, for example, is a 26-year-old female, studying part-time. This often means that the student has carer responsibilities for children or other family members, and work commitments to juggle. This diversity was reflected in the university student volunteering body, with those involved squeezing their volunteering into already busy schedules which included study, work and family commitments. The notion that student volunteers are young, time abundant, energetic and skilled is inaccurate.",

The former refers to narratives or stories erroneous in their substance but which were heard sufficiently often across multiple interview types to cause concern as a repetition of an erroneous myth, and on which there was evidence of decisions having been made. The latter are seen as nascent in their development with insufficient repetition to yet be labelled a myth, but repeated sufficiently often to cause concern as having the potential to develop into an erroneous myth. In the case of developing myths, there was evidence of the emergent thinking being considered but still not embedded.

Notions that university students are young, time-flexible and skilled, accompanied by events/issues, which have arisen from recruiting students based on these assumptions, have contributed to the myths identified here. The myth that students are unreliable seems to arise from the notion that they are available, with time to volunteer, and from actions of a small number of students who fail to turn up, turn up late, or withdraw from their volunteering when other commitments take up too much time. Perhaps volunteer involving organisations are unfamiliar with the diversity of the contemporary student cohort, including an increasing proportion of mature students, studying part time and juggling family, work and study commitments (Universities Australia, 2019). The myth that students are hard work arises from organisational hope that students bring skills or expertise associated with their studies. This expectation combined with the needs that all volunteers have-to be oriented, inducted, supervised, trained and managed (Brudney & Meijs, 2009; Rochester et al., 2010) -created a perception that student volunteers are harder work. The level of work associated with involving student volunteers may potentially be more than other volunteers, but the return on investment of time can yield good outcomes. Good communication, clear expectations and ongoing engagement are all hallmarks of quality volunteer management (Traeger & Alfes, 2019) to which all volunteers are entitled.",

The unreliability of student volunteers becomes accepted, even though it evolved from just two cases, and from unverified explanations. The sensemaking of the organisational representative created a plausible explanation. This explanation, passed on unchallenged, with the label 'student volunteer', including the reasoning around study commitments, becomes an established myth: 'students are unreliable'.

Evidence of the reasons for the students' missed commitments may also be needed. Most organisations in our study experienced situations where students missed commitments, but not all opined that students are unreliable, and some openly contradicted this-particularly the peak body representative interviewed. Importantly, where practice has evolved based on a myth, challenges to assumptions and practice led to a reconsideration of practice, and of the narrative.

Combining the extant literature on workplace myths with work on narratives and storytelling, this paper provides explanations for some myths identified as being present or developing in university student volunteering. The evidence illustrates the way that a story or 'sense' of something accepted and embedded influences decision-making and behaviour. Stories, even when they are based in misconceptions or misperceptions, and their evolution into myths, are selfreinforcing when those with authority appear to accept them. This is then the basis for 'legitimising present and future behaviours' (Boje et al., 1982 p. 18 ).

The process of coming to some agreement about each of the parties' expectations is likely to be central (Edwards et al., 2001) . It is also necessary to establish ways of addressing those times when the behaviours of individuals indicate that a myth is being perpetuated, or might lead to creation of a new myth. In the example here, managers may need to consider alternative explanations for student unreliability. Students may need assistance to understand the implications of their behaviours for host organisations. University representatives are in a prime position to facilitate such discussions. As it is natural to seek plausible explanations for events or issues, which are not as intended or expected, it is unlikely that myths will disappear, but their impact may be lessened by recognition and re-evaluation.",

Employing an approach which obtained multiple stakeholder views, it illustrates the emergence of myths and posits that changing the narrative is part of changing thinking and behaviour, and seeks to contribute to the development of understanding about mythmaking. University student volunteering is an activity with multiple players, all approaching the arrangements with different frames of reference and motivations. Host organisations may see students as a potential source of labour, skills and energy. For universities, student volunteering is part of a suite of activities tied to graduate capability. Student volunteers have differing and wide ranging motivations for being involved.",

This study has unearthed some counterproductive myths around student volunteering, which have been perpetuated with tenuous links to practical realities. The full benefits for all parties can only be achieved when and if there is a common understanding, clear expectations, and on-going open dialogue-all elements of good practice in terms of managing volunteers. Consideration of the evolution, perpetuation and influence of myths, and subsequent behaviours has led to suggestions about preventing and countering them, which may apply in other settings and which may assist with dragon slaying (Gabriel, 1991) .",
