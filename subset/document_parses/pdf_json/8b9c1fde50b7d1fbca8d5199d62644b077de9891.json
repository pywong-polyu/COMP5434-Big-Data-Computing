In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of \u2265 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.

While 21% of patients with severe COVID-19 had evidence of pulmonary hypertension only 2% of patients with mild to moderate disease had pulmonary hypertension. Presence of PH in their study was statistically significant in predicting the composite outcome including admission to intensive care unit, requirement of mechanical ventilation, and requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, mortality . 5 Li et al enrolled 120 patients with COVID-19, and obtained 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography to look for evidence of right ventricular strain. In the study patients who succumbed to the disease had a mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg, as compared to 28 mm Hg in the survivors. Additionally, in this study enlarged right heart chamber, diminished right ventricular function, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures wer statistically significant in predicting mortality at a median follow-up of 51 days. 7 Zamanian et al. reported a 34-year-old female with vasoreactive idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, presenting with worsening symptoms following COVID-19. Patient was continued on her medications of nifedipine, tadalafil and macitentan. She was treated with inhaled nitric oxide, and was monitored with home-based daily healthcare. Patient continued to have significant clinical improvement, and did not require any hospital visit. 8 Buja et al. reported a 34-year-old, morbidly obese (BMI of 51.6) young man, with concomitant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF <20%) presenting with clinical features of severe COVID-19.

            "text": "Interaction of COVID-19 and pulmonary hypertension is multifaceted. Two principal diseases that predispose to pulmonary hypertension, are also instrumental in worsening clinical outcome in COVID-19. Across multiple studies patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure have been shown to have poor clinical outcome. 9,10 Studies on myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19, have consistently shown that patients with severe myocardial injury, have higher pulmonary hypertension and poor clinical outcome. 5, 7, 11 In a few studies an association has been found between the presence of myocardial injury, and pulmonary hypertension, however causality has not yet been established. 12 COVID-19 patients are predisposed to venous thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation in the background of cytokine storm, hypoxia related free radical injury, prolonged immobilization, endothelial inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy, and diffuse intravascular coagulation. 13 Similarly, venous thromboembolism was reported in 7(58%) out of the 12 patients with severe COVID-19 who underwent postmortem autopsy. Among these patients, PE was attributed to be the principal cause of death in 33% (N=4). In a particular patient, autopsy showed acute, multiple, bilateral, segmental pulmonary thromboembolism even though CT was negative for any evidence of pulmonary embolism. 6, 14 In COVID-19 patients, the presence of pulmonary embolism is crucial in the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. 15 Finally, multiple studies have shown that thrombotic micro-angiopathy primarily involving the lungs is an important pathophysiological mechanism in severe COVID-19 disease. Patients with severe COVID-19 related fatality have been reported to have pulmonary microvascular thrombi, perivascular CD4 + T-cell infiltrates, platelet aggregations, platelet rich clots, intracapillary neutrophil entrapment, increased megakaryocytes in pulmonary capillaries, and intra-and extra capillary fibrin deposits on autopsy studies. Presence of endothelial injury, thrombosis, imbalance in vasoconstriction and vasodilation, inflammatory cells, platelets, cytokines can also contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling. 6, 13, 16 Outcome Studies on the effect of COVID-19 in patients with pulmonary hypertension is still lacking.",

In a recent study by Bangalore et al, 14 patients with focal ST elevation were included. Nine of these patients underwent coronary angiogram. Five of these 14 patients had normal LV function, and 3 had normal angiogram. In this study, the authors did not mention the mPAP, or PCWP. 17 A systemic review by Bao et al included 13 studies describing chest CT findings of COVID-19 patients, and 2738 participants lacked details on pulmonary trunk diameter, main pulmonary artery to ascending aortic diameter ratio, and other details of right ventricular function. 18 In studies reporting presence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 recording of pulmonary pressures have been inconsistent. 19",

Most patients presented in this literature review did not have invasive hemodynamic monitoring. In view of the technical difficulties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, studies reporting echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension have been crucial in understanding the relationship between COVID-19 and pulmonary hypertension. There is limited literature on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with prior idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. This review is skewed towards post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, in patients with cardiac dysfunction as noted by echocardiography. Details of interactions between multiple cardiovascular agents, pulmonary hypertension medications on patients of COVID-19 are still limited. 20, 21 However, the strength of this review is that it includes the presently available literature on COVID-19 patients with pulmonary hypertension.",
