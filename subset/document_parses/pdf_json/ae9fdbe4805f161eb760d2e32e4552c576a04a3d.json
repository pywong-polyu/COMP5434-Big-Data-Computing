            "text": "The impact of inflation on economic growth has been the subject of macroeconomic research and debates for quite a long time. The bone of contention, particularly, hovers on the debate on whether inflation impacts economic growth negatively or positively. One of the questions often raised is whether it is inflation that affects growth, or if it is uncertainty about inflation that upsets or motivates investment decisions and in turn affects growth [28] . Judson and Orphanides [43] caution that the debate surrounding inflation and growth is seldom settled because of estimation errors due to the omission of inflation uncertainty, which is a relevant variable in the determination of growth. Although literature is rich with studies concerning the relationship between inflation and economic growth, it is however, interesting to note that most scholars turn a blind eye to the impact of inflation uncertainty on economic growth. The pioneering work on inflation uncertainty was spearheaded by Tobin [69] who reasoned that inflation uncertainty induces households to hold more real capital assets, thereby stimulating capital productivity and economic growth. Tobin [69] , in line with Mundell [51] , were of the opinion that price instabilities provide room for growth.",

Theoretical studies took a different trajectory, with studies from Okun [60] , Friedman [28] , Stockman [67] and Ball [9] , explaining that price instability inhibits economic growth. The debate spills over to empirical studies which have contrasting conclusions. For instance, among others, Judson and Orphanides [43] , Grier and Perry [31] , Grier, Henry, Olekalns and Shields [30] , Apergis [5] as well as Iyke and Ho [38] documented a negative relationship between either inflation, or inflation uncertainty or both, and economic growth. In contrast, Coulson and Robins [20] , Jansen [39] and Fountas [25] reported a positive relationship among the variables. The debate also extends to empirical results between and within industrialised countries and emerging economies.",

            "text": "South Africa's significance in Africa as the financial capital and its influential role as a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) under the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) motivated the choice of South Africa in the paper. The history of price instabilities in South Africa dates from as far back as the 1960s. Several policies have been pursued to tame inflation, but with little success, until the adoption of inflation targeting in 20 0 0. It was the adoption of inflation targeting which triggered the fierce debate over the relationship between price stability and economic growth in South Africa. At one end, Hodge [36] with the concurrent support from pressure groups such as the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) (see [58] and [21] ) pose that South Africa can make use of higher rates of inflation to accommodate growth. At the other end, Nell [57] , Niyimbanira [59] , Munyeka [52] and Kumo [45] find that high inflation harms economic growth. It is against this background that this paper endeavours to enrich literature by examining inflation, inflation uncertainty and the economic growth nexus in South Africa during the period 1961Q1 to 2019Q4. Although the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing procedure is a widely used estimation technique in academic circles, this paper will be the first to make use of it in estimating inflation, inflation uncertainty and the growth nexus in South Africa. The ARDL bounds testing procedure suits the purpose of the study since it separates the long-run impact from the short-run impact, necessitating the paper to quantify the long-run and short-run impacts of the variables separately. Furthermore, according to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies on South Africa estimated the joint impact of both inflation and inflation uncertainty, which may have led to estimation errors from omitting a relevant variable, and accordingly, this paper pioneers in estimating the joint effect of the variables on economic growth in South Africa. Also, this paper has estimated the joint impact of inflation and inflation uncertainty before and after inflation targeting, thereby assessing the effectiveness of inflation targeting while also investigating any changes in behavior of the variables.",

During the same period, the rate of economic growth decelerated by nearly 18%, from 3.107% before the adoption of inflation targeting to 2.641% after the adoption of inflation targeting. It is also of significant importance to introduce the trends in inflation uncertainty during this period. Fig. I introduces inflation uncertainty trends from 1960 to 2019. The trends show that inflation uncertainty in South Africa moves in tandem with the rate of inflation; for instance, when inflation was high in the early 1980s, inflation uncertainty was also high; and when inflation was low after 2010, inflation uncertainty was also low.

            "text": "Literature shows that the debate on the relationship between inflation and growth dates back from the classical school of thought through to the new classical school of thought. The classical school reasons that competition for labor by capitalists increases the cost of labor as well as the costs of production which exert pressure on prices in the economy. The increase in costs of production erodes the capitalists' profits, discouraging them from production. Accordingly, this implies a negative relationship between inflation and economic growth in both the short and the long run (see [68] and [35] ). In contrast, the Keynesians argue that demand for labor reduces unemployment while increasing economic growth, and it results in higher nominal wages and inflation as its by-products, hence a positive relationship in the long run [1] . Monetarists offer a distinguished view: They deduce that workers suffer from money illusion temporarily in that any increase in nominal wages (and inflation) induces workers to increase their supply of labor (and economic growth) temporarily before reverting to the original supply of labor -hence, inflation has no relationship with economic growth in the long run, but a positive one in the short run [47] . The new classicals, whose theory rests on the tenet of rational expectations, stress that inflation is not related to economic growth in both the short and the long run [48] . The bone of contention extends to different scholars and bodies of theory. The debate surrounding the theory is still ongoing and inconclusive. Although these economic schools of thought explain the relationship between inflation and economic growth, they do not explain the role of inflation uncertainty in the determination of economic growth.",

It is only since then that scholars gained interest in the impact of inflation uncertainty on economic growth. Tobin [69] proposes that an increase in inflation uncertainty leads to a decline in accumulated wealth, prompting households to hold less non-interest-bearing assets but more real capital assets. As a result, these actions by households stimulate capital productivity and result in an increase in economic growth. Tobin [69] further outlines that under inflationary conditions, savings, investment spending and government spending increase which stimulate economic growth.",

This lessens inflation uncertainty over time as economic agents generate accurate predictions of future inflation. These accurate predictions, in a way, help in making informed investment decisions, which may promote investment spending, culminating in an increase in economic growth. In support, studies by Aghion and Saint-Paul [2] and Blackburn [11] demonstrate that inflation and inflation uncertainty lower the opportunity cost of investing in capital or labor resources in technological improvements, which stimulates investment spending, and ultimately economic growth. Induced by the stagflations of the 1970s, Friedman [28] queried the positive relationship between economic growth and inflation; and informally argued that inflation weakens the price mechanism, thereby harming economic growth.",

Some studies, for example Phiri [63] , obtained a non-linear relationship between inflation and economic growth while Hodge [36] documented that inflation positively affects growth in the short run, but negatively in the long run.

The choice of the ARDL bounds testing approach is justified by its several favourable properties. First, the modeling framework can derive a cointegrating relationship even when variables are integrated of either order one, or order zero; or even if it is a mixture of both [62] . Second, the ARDL bounds test comprises lags of both dependent and independent variables, making it a powerful tool for estimating both short-and long-run cointegrating relationships [61] . Third, ARDL is not sensitive to sample sizes and produces robust results even if the sample size is small. Fourth, the ARDL model captures the data generating process in general to specific modeling frameworks due to its ability to accommodate a sufficient number of lags [62] . Finally, even if there is endogeneity in the explanatory variables, ARDL provides unbiased estimates of the long-run model, with valid t-statistics [62] .

The short-run inflation coefficient for the period under study is \u22120.1744. This implies that 1% increase in the rate of inflation attracts a decrease in economic growth of 0.1744%. Although inflation uncertainty shows an insignificant long-run impact on economic growth, it nurtures a significant negative relationship in the short run. This suggests that inflation uncertainty is a shortrun phenomenon. The adaptive expectations theory by Friedman [27] can be employed to justify this phenomenon on the basis that uncertainties in decision making by economic agents decrease over time. This implies that, in the long run, inflation uncertainty may lose relevance and significance as an economic variable. For every 1% increase in inflation uncertainty, data shows contraction in economic growth of 0.0025% in the short run. Unlike in the long run where high interest rates harm economic growth, in South Africa, interest rates are positively related to economic growth in the short run. This can be attributed to the attractiveness of South African financial assets when interest rates are high. The error correction term (ECM) which measures the speed of adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium shows that 1% deviation from the equilibrium path in each quarter was corrected in the successive quarter at a rate of \u22120.36%.",

Although Antonakakis, Christou, Gil-Alana and Gupta [4] found that in a sample of 24 countries that adopted inflation targeting, 22 of them has experienced a reduction in inflation volatility, it is interesting to probe and investigate, using a different data set and estimation technique if the same outcome can be derived. In the same vein, this will also help in testing if there are any changes in the behavior and relationship among the variables within our model, despite the policy changes. Accordingly, the paper goes ahead and separates the period under study into two periods; that is, the period before the adoption of inflation targeting policy (1961Q1 to 1999Q4); and the period under inflation targeting policy (20 0 0Q1 to 2019Q4). Table 6 presents the long-and short-run results for the pre-inflation targeting period (1961Q1 to 1999Q4). The preferred optimal model for the pre-inflation targeting period (1961Q1 to 1999Q4) is ARDL(4,0,0,1). Panel C of Table 6 points out that the coefficients are structurally stable and free from autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity and incorrect functional forms. The calculated F-statistic shows evidence in favor of cointegration in the model. Inflation maintains a significant negative relationship with economic growth in both the short-and the long-run. Interest rates negatively affect growth in the long run, but positively in the short run. Inflation uncertainty maintained an insignificant relationship with economic growth in the long run, while nurturing a significant negative relationship in the short run, further ascertaining the notion that inflation uncertainty is a short-run phenomenon in South Africa. The results are therefore very similar to those obtained under the full sample period, that is, 1961Q1 to 2019Q4. The only exception is that the coefficients under the pre-inflation targeting period point out that economic growth was more responsive under the pre-inflation targeting period, compared to the full sample period. The focus now turns to the period under the inflation targeting regime. Table 7 presents the estimation results for the inflation targeting period (20 0 0Q1 to 2019Q4).",

The impact of inflation on economic growth remained consistently negative in both the short and long run during all three periods in the paper. However, economic growth became more responsive to changes in inflation rate in the long run after the adoption of inflation targeting, as evidenced by an increase (in absolute terms) of the inflation coefficient from -0.1491 to \u22120.4143. Therefore, inflation became an increasingly important determinant for economic growth in the long run.

Furthermore, the model shows proof of cointegration, and the estimated error correction term indicates cointegration and convergence. The results, therefore, pass the test of reliability. Inflation rate has a significant negative impact on economic growth in both the short and the long-run, which is consistent with the main results. Moreover, the proof that inflation uncertainty is a short-run phenomenon is also maintained. Interest rates also yield a negative relationship with economic growth in the long run, but a positive one in the short run, which is in line with the main results. Notes : * , * * and * * * denote significance at 10%, 5% and 1% respectively; is the first difference operator. S denotes stable. Source : Authors' compilations. Our data has a mixture of variables that are integrated at level (I(0), and inflation rate that is integrated of order 1 (I(1). This has, in turn, limited the choice of estimation methods since most methods require that either all variables are integrated of order 1 or at the same level, otherwise would risk spurious regression, for example, the vector error correction model, Engle and Granger [23] , the Full-Maximum Likelihood test of Johansen [41 , 42] and Johansen and Juselius [40] . However, the ARDL is immune from such restrictions. Nevertheless, in a quest for robustness, it would be interesting to check if the results will still remain the same should the lag length differ. Choosing an inappropriate lag length can lead to biased results that are not acceptable for policy analysis [18] . We therefore refrained from manually choosing the optimal lag length, but resorted to the AIC method, proposed by Pesaran et al., [62] and Narayan [54] . We also relaxed the number of maximum lags to 6. Table 9 displays the estimation results. The optimal model, according to the AIC model is ARDL (5,0,0,4,0) .",

The model is therefore reliable. Synthesising the results obtained in the previous models, the relationship between inflation and economic growth remains negative in both the short and the long run. Inflation uncertainty remains insignificant in the longrun while posing a significant negative impact in the short run. Interest rates maintain the negative relationship in the long run, and a positive one in the short run. Therefore, the results obtained in this paper are reliable and robust.",

The results we derived from the full sample (1961Q1 to 2019Q4) show that inflation harms economic growth in both the short and the long run while inflation uncertainty is insignificant in the long run but have a significant detrimental impact to economic growth in the short run. This confirmed an interesting finding that inflation uncertainty is a short-run phenomenon in South Africa without any long-run bearing, corroborating with the monetarists' adaptive expectations theory that uncertainties decrease over time [27] . We then split the datasets into two -one for the pre-inflation targeting period (1961Q1 to 1999Q4); and the other one for the inflation targeting era (20 0 0Q1 to 2019Q4) -to investigate if there was any change in the behavior of the variables due to the adoption of inflation targeting. Interestingly, inflation remained a significant negative factor to economic growth, but inflation uncertainty further became an insignificant variable in both the short and the long run after the adoption of inflation targeting. This implies that inflation targeting tied down inflation uncertainty to an extent that it became an irrelevant and insignificant factor in explaining economic growth, even in the short run. In light of these findings, we recommend that policymakers should pursue policies that ensure price stability to create a conducive environment for both short-and long-run growth. Price stability is a necessary condition for economic growth; however, it is not a sufficient factor for determining economic growth. Therefore, we further recommend that policymakers should pursue policies that stimulate economic growth, while allowing the SARB to commit to fighting inflation and inflation uncertainty.",
