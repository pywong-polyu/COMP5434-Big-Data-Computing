The \"72-hour rule\" allows non-OTP providers to administer methadone for emergency opioid withdrawal management while arranging ongoing care. Low-barrier substance use disorder (SUD) bridge clinics provide rapid access to buprenorphine but offer an opportunity to treat acute opioid withdrawal while facilitating OTP linkage. We describe the case of a patient with OUD who received methadone for opioid withdrawal in a bridge clinic and linked to an OTP within 72 h.",

The Drug Enforcement Agency and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration license and certify OTPs, respectively, and set detailed requirements for clinic characteristics, patient eligibility, dosing standards, observed dosing, and counseling [6] . The number and capacity of OTPs nationally is insufficient [7] . Restrictive zoning regulations, insufficient insurance coverage, and understaffing contribute to inadequate capacity, which can lead to long waits for intake appointments. Rural areas are particularly underserved, and patients may need to wait more than a year and commute long distances to access an OTP [8] . Delays in treatment increase the risk of continued drug use, infectious complications, and overdose death while decreasing the likelihood of eventual treatment initiation [9] .

However, the significant demand for opioid withdrawal treatment and OTP linkage only underscores the unmet need for methadone treatment and the urgency of systems change. Regulatory reform is urgently needed to reduce barriers to methadone, and the Biden-Harris administration has committed to modernizing methadone policies in 2021-2022 [18] . We urge federal and state policymakers to follow the lead of countries like Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom that have integrated methadone treatment for OUD into primary care and adopted pharmacybased models of observed and take-home dosing [19, 20] Until federal policies are reformed, bridge clinics can play an essential role in treating acute opioid withdrawal and building partnerships with local OTPs to prevent lifethreatening delays to methadone treatment.
