Since the first reported case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Japan on 16 January 2020, 794,884 cases and 14,738 deaths have been reported as of 29 June 2021 [1] . In Japan, most inpatient medical facilities imposed restrictions on family members' visits to admitted patients, as the government declared a temporary nationwide closure of all elementary and junior high schools on 2 March 2020, followed by a state of emergency declaration on April 7. Family members were not allowed to gain access into the ward except at the time of patients' admission and discharge and delivery of the necessities required in the hospital.",

It was reported that parents with restricted access to the NICU due to the novel COVID-19 outbreak experienced negative feelings, such as sadness and anger [2] . Thus, measures of parental restrictions should be carefully considered by providing alternatives that will prevent the adverse effects of these restrictions. Previous studies have suggested that NICU design (in which the single-family room had the loosest entrance restrictions for parents, followed by the hybrid design and the Open bay design with the strictest parental entrance restriction) [3] , telemedicine introduction [4] , and NICU visitation policy [5] may be useful means of mitigating the detachment of or adverse effects on parents.",

Although this study was conducted before COVID-19, no differences in the length of hospital stay were reported for children subjected to telemedicine between the Internet and control groups [6] . In Japanese NICUs, telephone is the most common device in telemedicine, and online devices (video/webcam, live videoconference, etc.) were not common before COVID-19. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the development of an online visit system was designed by Osaka University Hospital; a donation of 30 million yen was collected for the plan until November 2020 [7] . Moreover, because medical devices may malfunction due to the electromagnetic waves of mobile phones, the use of smartphones is often prohibited in Japanese NICUs. There has been no report on the actual use of telemedicine in Japanese NICUs, and it is unknown what kind of device or system is used.",

Participants retrospectively evaluated the past (in December 2019, i.e., before COVID-19) and current (during COVID-19) use of telemedicine. The survey involved the administration of questionnaires comprising 22 items (20 mandatory selective answer items and two optional descriptive answer items) (Appendix A). The questionnaire was drafted by MO and amended by MO, HS, and MX with reference to previous research [3] and the website [9] . The questionnaire was assessed for easy comprehension and appropriateness for the target audience by one neonatologist, two NICU nurses, one pediatrician, and one neonatal nurse researcher, and corrections were made where necessary. The average response time was 15 min. On 19 November 2020, the survey request letter was mailed to the head nurse of the NICU, requesting the nomination of the NICU nurse to participate in the online survey through PC or smartphones. A reminder was mailed on 4 December 2020. However, one of Shikoku region facilities informed us in writing that they would not participate in the study. Informed consent was obtained from the respondents, and the study was approved by the Hiroshima University Research Ethics Review Board (No.: E-2260).",

For descriptive statistics, we used counts and percentages, as presented in tables and figures. For comparison before and during COVID-19, considering that the survey responses were quantitative, we used the Wilcoxon test for all pre-post comparisons and McNemar's test or Cochran-Armitage test for all pre-post comparison in categorical variables. The association in categorical variables during COVID-19 was examined using Fisher's exact tests. In this study, the data obtained from optional answer items were excluded from the analysis. The statistical software JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was used for all analyses; all significance levels were two-sided and set as 5%.",

Most NICUs were in the Open bay (\u226590% of beds in multi-bedrooms) (n = 45), and few were in the Hybrid (11-89% of open beds in single-patient rooms) (n = 7).

The Kanto region NICU had the earliest restrictions implementation on 1 February 2020, while NICUs in the Hokkaido region started restrictions on 6 November 2020. The reasons for the restriction of parent's entry are shown in Table 2 . Table 3 shows NICU visiting screening before the COVID-19 outbreak (1 December 2019) and the response date. Migration history, poor physical condition, and temperature check-ups during COVID-19 increased compared to those before COVID-19. In all NICUs, there was a time restriction on parental visits. Parental visiting median time in the NICUs was limited to 1 h. The NICU where a nurse was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 restricted parents from entering anytime. Furthermore, grandfathers, mothers, and siblings were prohibited from entering most NICUs. We found a variety of parental presence policies measured during COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). All NICUs restricted parental presence, whereas 23 NICUs (44%) allowed on parent at the bedside for the entire hospital stay, and a minority (21%) allowed only ers into the NICU. ",

The median parental presence allowed time was 1 h (range: 0-23 h). We found that 23 NICUs (44%) allowed only one parent at the bedside with limited time for the entire hospital stay and 11 NICUs (21%) allowed only mothers into the NICU. In 19 NICUs (36.5%), there were responses of delay in the discharge of neonates caused by the aforementioned restrictions. We also noted that there was a decrease in the implementation of skin-to-skin contact care during COVID-19 compared to that before COVID-19. Mothers frequently reported as not being supported to provide skin-to-skin care to their infant or encouraged to breastfeed as soon as possible after birth and inadequate information on expressing breastmilk or breastfeeding support during COVID-19 [5] . Similarly, our study found that the implementation rate of kangaroo care and milking decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 5 ). It was speculated that the decrease in physical and emotional contact between parents and children and the lack of time to acquire childcare skills resulted in an extension of discharge from the NICUs.",

It was observed that NICU policies were implemented outside Japan during the pandemic [2, 3, 5] , and the policy was associated in decreasing the incidence of delay in neonatal discharge from Japanese NICUs (Table 6 ). One study suggested that a policy of one parent entry restricted to limited duration was associated with a higher proportion of issues related to lack of bonding as well as the inability to participate in care, obtain updates, and bring supplies, followed by the entry of both parents with a restriction on the duration of presence [5] . Therefore, in the case of a parental presence time-limited policy, the presence of both parents at the same time might mitigate adverse effects. Moreover, this study showed that some NICUs limited entry to mothers only because based on Japan's social background, mothers play a major role in childcare, and only 5.1% of fathers take childcare leave [10] . Many fathers work after their children are born, which increases their infection risk.",

            "text": "Telemedicine was increasingly implemented to solve the problem of the loss of communication opportunities between parents and their neonates and healthcare providers (Table 3) . However, the results of this study showed that telemedicine was not associated with a decrease in the incidence of neonatal discharge delay in Japanese NICUs (Table 6 ). In NICUs that responded, the new telemedicine facility was initiated on 4 August 2020, and the study only analyzed data on telephone or online telemedicine (Item No. 16 of Appendix A). Therefore, we believe that the extent of using telemedicine in Japanese NICUs was insufficient, and it is premature to conclude that telemedicine exclusively influenced the study results. Remote medicine allows parents to communicate with their children and express their feelings. This connection is through the parents' smartphones, tablets, PCs, and NICU information devices through online video calls [4] , virtual visits [6] , mobile apps [12] , and web camera systems [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In previous studies, parents watching live videos from a webcam felt separated from their children [16] and experienced the pain of helplessness in alleviating their children's suffering [16, 17] . However, many positive opinions from parents watching their children's live videos were also reported. Owing to advanced medical technology, which enabled less stressful contact between parents and their children, parents felt close to their children [17] and could confirm the stability of their children's condition [17, 18] . Nevertheless, the confidentiality of patients' information was a major concern for both parents and healthcare professionals because of the transmission of live videos [17, 18] . The need to create communication materials for medical staff and parents through videos [15, 17] increased the workload of nurses [15] . However, they thought that parents could see and understand their children's responses immediately after birth by watching their neonates' videos to promote bonding between parents and children [13, 17] . Thus, remote medicine is considered a useful means of mitigating the adverse effects of the isolation of parents and children, despite parent restriction from NICU entry due to COVID-19.",

The survey was conducted at 109 institutions (110 centers, of which one declined); however, only approximately half of them responded. The preferred response rate was \u226560% [19] . In addition, the result of this study was extrapolated from nurses' perception. Because the outcomes of this study were at the parent-level, a survey conducted directly on parents to assess their satisfaction with telemedicine and its ability to help alleviate the negative impact of NICU in-person visiting restrictions should have been included. Finally, this study is a one-time crosssectional study of hospitals and does not consider the medical condition or background of individual patients. Furthermore, the hospital's pandemic policy may have influenced the extension of length of hospital stay. Therefore, future research should examine whether COVID-19 parental admission restrictions are associated with extended hospital stays for newborns, even when adjusted for patient attributes and institutional background. However, it is remarkable that the study clarified the parental visit restrictions in level III NICUs of approximately half of the Japanese population. This study suggests that the parents of NICU patients in Japan are relatively strictly restricted from entering the hospital after the COVID-19 outbreak. The University of Oxford [20] showed the assessment of the severity of countries' COVID-19 policies based on nine perspectives on a 0-100 scale (100 being the strictest score). The highest score of Japan's policies strictness from January to December 2020 was 40 (March to May 2020), which is moderate compared to that of other countries. However, the strict control of the visits of hospitalized patients' families to the hospitals was in effect nationwide. Remarkably, restrictions on parental presence in the NICU were consistent with the hospitals' policy. The results of this study raise policy and ethical questions about the separation of parents and their neonates in the NICU, which is expected to continue in Japan due to delays in COVID-19 vaccination, and provide a basis for studying effective measures to mitigate the effects of separation between parents and their babies.",

We acknowledge this weakness; however, to the best of our knowledge, findings in NICU studies are usually limited to the specific region (e.g., country) wherein the study was conducted [2, 3, 5] . This might be because the condition of the NICUs would clearly differ across regions owing to differences in political and economic aspects. The nature of the current study was not to compare the condition of NICUs across multiple countries to clarify any cross-culturally universal principles. Alternatively, it aimed to describe the parental visit policy and telemedicine use in Japanese neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) before and during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Additionally, we investigated the effects of parental restriction on parental infants' care, as well as the association between delay discharge and NICU design, telemedicine and parental visiting policy, which were reported to be a useful method for mitigating the negative impact on parents. We believe that the current findings not only provide evidence to the academic community, which helps to understand the complete picture of the NICU issues worldwide, but also influences the governments of the related regions to improve political practices over time.",

            "text": "Many NICUs began strict parental restrictions on entry into the NICU from April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This restricted parents from entering the hospital and reduced their time spent in the NICU. The implementation rate of kangaroo care and milking was found to decrease due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those restrictions might be associated with an extension of neonatal discharge in some NICUs. Further research is necessary to evaluate the clinical effects of these restrictions on the bonding between parents and children, the development of newborns, and the lengths of hospital stay. NICUs with hybrid design were able to lengthen parental presence and mitigate parental restrictions. In addition, in the case of a time-limiting parental presence policy, the presence of both parents at the same time might mitigate adverse effects. In Japan, the development and introduction of telemedicine utilizing web camera systems, virtual space, and mobile apps in the NICU are required due to currently inadequate the use of telemedicine. Regardless of COVID-19, it is necessary to consider the needs of parents who cannot enter the NICU when developing an appropriate telemedicine method. Further research is necessary to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of telemedicine among both nurses in NICU and parents.",
