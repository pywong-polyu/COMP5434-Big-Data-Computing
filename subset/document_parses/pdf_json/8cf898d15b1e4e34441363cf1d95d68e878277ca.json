Breast reconstruction is recognized as an important option for women undergoing total or partial mastectomy, but is considered an elective component of breast cancer care and thus may be delayed in situations of limited capacity. This paper presents consensus recommendations for care of patients with breast cancer undergoing breast reconstruction during the pandemic based on expert opinion from the BC Breast Reconstruction Network. We identify areas for change with consideration for the protection of health care workers and patients. We share preliminary insights regarding novel approaches to program referrals, patient consultation, adjuvant therapies, prioritization of surgical resources, and reconstructive options. Our recommendations were developed with the objective of deferring reconstruction until patient safety and resource utilization could be optimized. These strategies aim to focus resources on patients requesting reconstruction in whom adjournment of reconstruction will unacceptably compromise outcomes. We also sought to limit health care utilization during the pandemic while planning for the anticipated backlog of deferred reconstruction patients requiring care once resources are restored.",

Recent studies have reported no increased risk of death for patients with COVID-19 within 4 weeks of receiving systemic chemotherapy. 3 In the absence of contraindications to breast-conserving surgery, we recommend against total mastectomy to reduce the potential demand for reconstructive surgery. If this approach results in breast deformity, delayed reconstruction postradiation can be achieved with advanced oncoplastic reconstruction.",

Cases deemed appropriate for combined procedures despite pandemic restrictions were defined as triage Group 1 in our algorithm. One such case was that of a 37-year old patient with progression of LABC while on neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Owing to the extent of cutaneous involvement, the centralized network facilitated resource coordination for expedited surgical excision and reconstruction for chest wall coverage with a pedicled latissimus dorsi flap. Another exceptional case for Group 1 priority includes patients with T3/T4 tumours and macromastia undergoing partial mastectomy, in whom consultation for oncoplastic closure is considered to avoid mastectomy-related and radiation-induced complications.",
