It is associated with an increased risk for sepsis, respiratory infections and severe outcomes with conditions such as pneumococcal disease [2] , varicella zoster [3] , and influenza [4, 5] . There is some evidence to suggest that this increased risk persists even among asymptomatic patients after adoption of a gluten-free diet [4, 6] . Interestingly, this increased susceptibility results from the pathophysiology of CD, rather than from immunosuppressive therapy, as seen in other immune-mediated conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease [7] . In theory, this intrinsically high susceptibility, compounded with malnutrition and immunosuppressive medical management, may put CD patients at risk of life-threatening disease in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [8] .",

The balance on covariates was assessed using the standardized mean difference, and absolute values >0.1 were considered positive for residual imbalance. A 2-sided alpha of less than 0.05 was defined a priori for statistical significance. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all analyses.

            "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, there is a dire need to identify risk factors for poor outcomes with COVID-19 to optimize risk stratification for prevention, vaccine administration, surveillance and therapeutic measures, especially in high-risk populations. Evidence on outcomes of COVID-19 infection shows that patients with a weak immune system, such as the elderly population or those with multiple comorbid conditions, tend to have a higher case fatality rate [13] . Further, data show that transplant populations, especially patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapy, tend to have particularly worse outcomes with COVID-19 [9, 14] . Thus, it could be argued theoretically that CD, with its baseline alterations in afflicted individuals' immune profile, immunosuppressive therapy, and other well-documented data on higher predisposition and poor outcomes with respiratory infections (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia, tuberculosis, and influenza), should alter the disease course of COVID-19 in the CD population for the worse [2] [3] [4] [5] . Interestingly, another postulation is that since the immunemediated cytokine response is primarily responsible for the damage resulting from COVID-19, CD patients, with their weaker immune systems, may fare better with COVID-19 infection [15] .",
