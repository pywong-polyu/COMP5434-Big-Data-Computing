We have comprehensively analysed phylogenetic relations between SARS-CoV-2, and the related bat and pangolin Sarbecoviruses sampled so far. Determining the likely recombination events reveals a highly reticulate evolutionary history within this group of coronaviruses. Clustering of the inferred recombination events is non-random with evidence that Spike, the main target for humoral immunity, is beside a recombination hotspot likely driving antigenic shift in the ancestry of bat Sarbecoviruses. Coupled with the geographic ranges of their hosts and the sampling locations, across southern China, and into Southeast Asia, we confirm horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus, are the likely SARS-CoV-2 progenitor reservoir species. By tracing the recombinant sequence patterns, we conclude that there has been relatively recent geographic movement and co-circulation of these viruses' ancestors, extending across their bat host ranges in China and Southeast Asia over the last 100 years or so. We confirm that a direct proximal ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be sampled, since the closest relative shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 approximately 40 years ago. Our analysis highlights the need for more wildlife sampling to (i) pinpoint the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2's animal progenitor, and (ii) survey the extent of the diversity in the related Sarbecoviruses' phylogeny that present high risk for future spillover.",

First detected in association with an unusual respiratory disease outbreak in December 2019 at an animal and seafood market in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China ) no definitive progenitor of animal origin has been identified. Environmental samples taken from this market have only revealed evidence of infections linked to humans and the finding of cases with no identifiable association to this location suggests either that the market was not the epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 spillover event, or that multiple independent spillover events occurred 1,2 . Since the 2020 coronavirus pandemic began, both generalized metagenomic and focused sampling and sequencing efforts have uncovered a number of viruses related to SARS-CoV-2, almost all retrieved from locations in China and Southeast Asia [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .

We present evidence of recombination and a handful of hotspot locations where breakpoints are over-represented, in particular upstream of Spike with a downstream coldspot (where breakpoints are under-represented) in the S1 subunit; likely a product of antigenic selection in ancestral viruses as S1 includes the two immunodominant regions NTD and RBM 13 .

What is clear is it is imperative to account for these complex recombination patterns when examining the evolutionary history of these pathogens, since multiple evolutionary histories can be inferred from the single whole-genome alignment. As SARS-CoV-2 continues circulating in humans and mutation increases its sequence diversity, identifying SARS-CoV-2 recombination events will become easier and important to monitor 18 .",

To overcome this trade-off we performed a secondary, more conservative, recombination analysis using GARD (see Methods) and identify the locations of 21 recombination breakpoints that strongly impact the inferred phylogenetic relationships of the analysed sequences when mosaic patterns are ignored. We then determined the phylogenetic relationships of the viral sequences in each of the 22 putatively non-recombinant genome regions bounded by each identifiable breakpoint ( Figure 3A ).

We find RmYN02 shares a most recent common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 about 40 years ago and RaTG13 about 50 years ago ( Figure 4A ) consistent with previous estimates 11, 12, 19 . Although SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to RmYN02 across most of its genome, the region corresponding to the first half of the RmYN02 Spike ORF appears to have been derived through recombination from a parental sequence residing outside the nCoV clade 4 ( Figure 1A ). Two more viruses very recently identified in Yunnan, RpYN06 6 and PrC31 8 are most closely related to RmYN02 for part of their genomes. In the portion of the genome corresponding to recombination breakpoint partitioned (RBP) regions 2 to 5, the three Yunnan viruses (RmYN02, RpYN06, PrC31) cluster with strong support in a sister clade to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2A , Figure S1 ). This pattern suggests that bat sampling efforts in Yunnan have uncovered a cluster of related viruses distinct to the likely viral population of SARS-CoV-2's proximal ancestor. Molecular dating of the RBP region 5 phylogeny ( Figure 4A ) indicates that this \"Yunnan cluster\" shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 around 1982 (95% HPD: 1970 HPD: -1994 . This analysis further allows us to date the node between PrC31 and RmYN02 to 2005 (95% HPD: 1998-2010), which is one of the most recent nodes in the phylogeny ( Figure 4A ).",

Across the majority of their genomes (excluding segments of Orf1ab and Spike) these viruses are members of the nCoV clade and share a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 that existed before 1934 (95% HPD: 1907-1957) according to molecular dating of RBP region 5 ( Figure 4A ). However, in RBP regions 8-12 the sequences of these viruses cluster outside the nCoV clade, being genetically most closely related to Zhejiang virus Longquan_140 and the HKU3 set of closely related bat Sarbecoviruses sampled in Hong Kong (bordering Guangdong province) (Figure 2A , Figure  S1 ). The link between SARS-CoV-2's closest relatives and viral populations in the southeast of South China becomes even more apparent in the phylogeny of RBP region 2 where Longquan_140 clusters within the nCoV clade along with CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21 ( Figure  2A ).

These viruses are, after the China sampled CoVs mentioned above, the next closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2 with common ancestor age estimates (using RBP region 5) around 1907 (95% HPD: 1873-1938) and 1883 (95% HPD: 1841-1921), respectively ( Figure 4A ). Similar to the other nCoV viruses, the recombination analysis uncovers more intricate phylogenetic relations for some parts of the genome. Notably, RShSTT182 and RShSTT200, despite being from Cambodia, cluster with RaTG13 for RBP regions 8 and 9 ( Figure 2A , Figure S1 ), while in RBP region 4 of the genome RacCS203, from Thailand, clusters together with SARS-CoV-2 within the Yunnan clade ( Figure 2A ). This indicates that co-circulation and recombination between these viruses in the last century is responsible for the observed patterns in their inferred evolutionary history, despite the current samples having been collected across a geographic range of at least 2,500km. This wide distribution of related viruses, including shared recombination breakpoints, highlights an important feature of bat species: their frequently overlapping/sympatric ranges will provide ample opportunities for transmissions of viral variants from one bat species (or sub-species) to another.",

Despite one collected from Yunnan, China and the other from Cambodia, viruses RmYN02 and RacCS203 share a closely related non-nCoV sequence in RBP regions 15 and 16 (encompassing the Spike NTD and RBD respectively; Figure 2B ) having a distinct RBD compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 4,5 .

We speculate that some of the apparent patterns of recombination-mediated exchange between nCoV and non-nCoV viruses can be partly explained by recombination \"overprinting\". This will occur when an nCoV virus has acquired a non-nCoV genomic sequence through ancestral recombination but its progenitors cocirculating with other nCoV viruses incurred subsequent recombination events that overlapped portions of the original non-nCoV recombinant sequence, producing the more complex \"patchy\" patterns we see in the currently sampled viruses. Note, overprinting of recombination regions will result in reduced confidence in the breakpoints at deeper nodes in the phylogeny.",

For example, the intermediate horseshoe bat species, R. affinis, is sufficiently dispersed across China to account for the geographical spread of i) bat Sarbecovirus recombinants in the West and East of China, ii) infected imported pangolins in the South, iii) bat Sarbecovirus recombinant links to southwest of China, and iv) SARS-CoV-2 emergence towards Hubei in Central China ( Figure 3B) . Strikingly, the ranges of multiple species including R. affinis, R. sinicus and R. pusillus overlap all the regions of China where the nCoVs have been collected ( Figure 4B ). Other horseshoe bat species that might harbour nCoVs have different ranges, for example, R. ferrumequinum, being absent from large parts of South Central China, and R. malayanus found predominantly in the western part of China and countries to the Southwest of China (Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Viet Nam, and Peninsular Malaysia) 29 .

Additionally, these two bat species are found in shared roosts with R. sinicus and R. ferrumequinum in Yunnan and with R. sinicus in Guangxi 30 , providing opportunities for host switches, co-infections and thus recombination between the sarbecoviruses that these bat species carry. R. pusillus and R. affinis also link more regions of China with bat species such as R. shameli, R. malayanus and R. acuminatus which are only found in Southeast Asia and southwest of China ( Figure 4B ). Latinne et al. (2020) 31 recently published a large-scale sampling expedition of coronaviruses across bats in China. Although only short RdRp fragments were sequenced, reconstructing the phylogeny for the novel viruses reveals a cluster of seven identical Sarbecovirus sequences sampled from R. affinis within the nCoV clade, that cluster close to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S2) . Still, the fact that viruses in the Yunnan clade (consisting of RmYN02, RpYN06 and PrC31) were sampled from three different Rhinolophus species supports the hypothesis that these viruses readily infect multiple different horseshoe bat species with overlapping geographical ranges.",

Specifically, samples should be collected in roosting environments spread across China with care being taken both to avoid a further spillover or reverse zoonosis and to protect the bat species 30 . Sampling strategies will also need to consider the distinct subspecies of Rhinolophus as the delineators of genetically meaningful host populations for coronaviruses. For example, there are two R. affinis sub-species on mainland China: himalayanus and macrurus 32 . Future sampling should also encompass a range of indigenous mammals other than bats that we now know can be infected by coronaviruses. Although highly endangered, it is possible that Chinese pangolins, given their susceptibility to infection and their geographical range across southern China 33 , might be the \"missing\" intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 proximal ancestor 1 .",

Considering the high frequency of recombination, it is expected that selection could preferentially favour exchanges of specific genome regions, in line with our detection of hotspots near the Spike gene ( Figure 1B ,C). Our analysis further illustrates the importance of accounting for recombination rather than using whole-genome pairwise similarity to determine the shared evolutionary history of these viruses. This is exemplified by RaTG13 which is often described as the \"on average\" closest Sarbecovirus to SARS-CoV-2 despite not being the closest virus once recombination history is accounted for in the other nCoV Sarbecoviruses ( Figure 1A, 3A) .",

Although very few nCoV viruses are known to be hosted by mammals other than horseshoe bats, the recombination patterns detected within the nCoV genomes imply the existence of one or a few primary reservoir hosts with a geographical range spanning Thailand from the Southwest and Zhejiang to the East, a distribution that is consistent with specific Chinese horseshoe bats being the primary reservoir hosts. Having presented evidence in support of R. affinis and R. pusillus's potential significance as the reservoir species, it should be noted that at least 20 different Rhinolophus species are distributed across China (four being endemic to China), many of which have not yet been found hosting nCoVs. The generalist nature of Sarbecoviruses also means multiple wild or farmed animals (e.g., minks) 1 could have facilitated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans.",

Beyond the relatively rare detection of SARS-like antibodies in people from rural communities in China 34, 35 , SARS related coronaviruses have not, to our knowledge, seeded outbreaks in humans before. This indicates that there is limited human exposure to these viruses, suggesting ecological \"barriers\" to their emergence 36 . One possible recent disruption that caused widespread and unusual movements of animals in China and may have increased the permeability of this barrier, was the dramatic shortage of pork products in 2019 37 attributable to an African swine fever virus (ASFV) outbreak impacting 100s of millions of pigs in China 38 . Such a major disruption in the food supply chain will have potentially brought humans into increased contact with Sarbecovirus infected animals as i) exotic meats replaced pork, ii) animals from rural locations were brought to city markets and/or iii) by meat from infected animals being transported in cold chain processes. Further facilitating animal contacts, increased human encroachment into rural areas as a result of new and faster travel networks around and between metropolitan areas have also likely increased opportunities for Sarbecoviruses to spillover into humans. Given the reality of frequent humananimal contact, routine characterisation of respiratory infections would seem a sensible precaution to prevent future emergence of Sarbecoviruses.",

Breakpoint positions were classified as undetermined if the 95% confidence interval on their location overlapped: i) the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the alignment; or ii) the position of another detected breakpoint within the same sequence (in such cases it could not be discounted that the actual breakpoint might not have simply been lost due to a more recent recombination event). All of the remaining breakpoint positions were manually checked and adjusted when necessary using the BURT method with the MAXCHI matrix and LARD two breakpoint scan methods 51 used to resolve ties.

To illustrate the distance of each virus from SARS-CoV-2 for each GARD determined genomic region, we defined the nCoV clade on each phylogeny as the subset of the aforementioned 20 nCoV viruses forming a monophyly with SARS-CoV-2 in each phylogeny. The rest of the viruses were classified as members of the non-nCoV clade for each RBP region. We then used an arbitrary tip distance scale normalised between all phylogenies so distances are comparable between regions. For each maximum likelihood tree, the tip distance between each tip and SARS-CoV-2 is calculated using ETE 3 56 as d1 for members of the nCoV clade and d2 for members of the non-nCoV clade. The distances are then normalised so that for nCoV clade members range between 0.1 and 1.1 (1.1 being SARS-CoV-2 itself and 0.1 being the most distant tip from SARS-CoV-2 within the nCoV clade) and between -0.1 and -1.1 for non-nCoV members (-0.1 being the closest non-nCoV virus to SARS-CoV-2 and -1.1 the most distant), as follows:",

This region was selected due to its length, being one of the two longest non-recombinant regions in the analysis (3,238 bp) , and because all 20 nCoV viruses form a monophyly in the respective tree. Based on the observation of an increased evolutionary rate specific to the deepest branch of the nCoV clade reported in MacLean et al. (2020) 12 , we adopted the same approach of fitting a separate local clock model to that branch from the rest of the phylogeny. A normal rate distribution with mean 5x10 -4 and standard deviation 2x10 -4 was used as an informative prior on all other branches. The lineage containing the BtKY72 and BM48-31 bat viruses was constrained as the outgroup to maintain overall topology. Codon positions were partitioned and a GTR+\u0393 substitution model was specified independently for each partition. The maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstructed previously for RBP region 5 was used as a starting tree (rooted at the BtKY72 and BM48-31 clade). A constant size coalescent model was used for the tree prior and a lognormal prior with a mean of 6 and standard deviation of 0.5 was specified on the population size. Two independent MCMC runs were performed for 500 million states for the dataset. The two chains were inspected for convergence and combined using LogCombiner 58 using a 10% burn-in for each chain. The effective sample size for all estimated parameters was above 200.",
