The leading example in the media is the looser social distancing policy in Sweden versus strict policies in its Scandinavian peers. By informally comparing the evolution of the pandemics in Sweden and Denmark (or Norway), many commentators argue that several Covid-19 cases and deaths in Sweden would be avoided in the short-run were a strict lockdown in place. 1 Aiming to provide a quantitative assessment on the short-run effects of lockdowns, this paper takes this exercise seriously in the context of US states. Given that the timing US states adopted lockdown policies differs among them, we adopt techniques based on synthetic control (SC) approach of Abadie and Gardeazabal [2003] and Abadie et al. [2010] to assess the impact of lockdowns on the short-run evolution of the number of cases and deaths in the treated US states. 2 More specifically, we consider an extension of the original SC method called Artificial Counterfactual (ArCo) which was put forward by Carvalho et al. [2018] . Due to the nonstationary nature of the data, the correction of Masini and Medeiros [2019] is necessary.",

Other papers, such as Brzezinski et al. [2020] , and Sears et al.

The key identification assumption in these papers is that variations in the timing are random after controlling for covariates. Brzezinski et al. [2020] also consider an instrumental-variable approach. Fowler et al. [2020] and Grassi and J. Sauvagnat [2020] follow similar empirical strategies but at county level, and also find substantial reductions in cases and fatalities in counties that adopted stay-at-home orders and state-mandated business closures, respectively. Our analysis, that rests on alternative identification assumption and method, should be seen as complementary.

At the same time, and for a similar reasoning, the lockdown strategies adopted in treated states must be in place during the period of analysis. 8 7 This assumption is motivated by the incubation period of the virus. According to the World Health Organization, the \"[...] the incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however can be up to 14 days.\" See https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200402-sitrep-73-covid-19.pdf. 8 In the Appendix A.1, Table A .1 shows the reopen dates for the treated states. Fortunately, there are horizons that can balance both goals: enough states to build the synthetic controls and a relative extensive period to construct the counterfactuals. In particular, we restrict the analysis up to the 58th epidemiological day. This figure accommodates at least ten control states to build the synthetic controls, 9 at the same time it maximizes the out-of-sample days to run the counterfactuals. In this sense, our analysis concerns the very short-run impact of lockdowns, up to nearly three weeks.",

We use the red lines to build synthetic controls for each full blue-line up to the turning point, and then construct counterfactuals by simulating the synthetic controls forward up to the 58th day. The idea is to compare them with the blue dashed-lines that capture actual cases. As Figure 1 highlights, some states display lack of variation within the in-sample period. Just to give an example, Washington had had only one confirmed case for the first 36 days since its first confirmed Covid-19 infection. Hence, we exclude it from the control group. For similar reasons, we also exclude Arizona, Illinois, and Massachusetts from the control pool. The analysis ended up relying on six control states.",

However, we cannot implement the strategy described above because there is not enough variation in deaths for the in-sample period. Some states, for instance, implemented a state-wide lockdown policies before the first confirmed death. Thus, we propose an alternative method. We consider a counterfactual state for the number of deaths based on the counterfactual estimated for the number of cases. This is not straightforward as in the traditional synthetic control method because the ArCo methodology described above includes an intercept in the estimation, which is measured in the log of the number of cases, and not only a convex combination of other states. Intuitively, the methodology described above chooses a combination of states that is at a fixed distance from the treated unit at the in-sample period and not a convex combination of states that matches exactly the actual number of cases. The intercept controls for all time-invariant characteristics that define the counterfactual.",

The timing of the policy intervention ( 0 + 10) corresponds to the lockdown date plus ten days. The counterfactual analysis makes it clear the importance of lockdown policies in mitigating the acceleration of the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases in the treated states. As shown in Figure 2a , for example, our results point to a substantial increase in the number of cases in Alabama if it had not adopted an early lockdown. Similarly, Figures 2b and 2c reveal the same behavior for the cumulative curves in the other selected states. Counterfactuals are constructed with the estimated weights and cumulative cases of the six states that compose the control group. These weights are reported in Table A .2 in Appendix A.2. In Appendix A.3, we present similar counterfactual plots for the remaining treated states. In order to assure that the proposed methodology is producing proper counterfactual analysis, we generate placebo results by producing a \"synthetic control\" for each control state using the remaining control states as control pool. Results are displayed in Figure 3 , which shows the ratio of the estimated counterfactual cumulative cases to the actual ones for treated states except New York (black lines), and non-treated states (red lines). We assume that the epidemiological day of the placebo intervention is 0 = 36, marked by the vertical dashed line, which is the median (and the mean) timing of the policy interventions in the treated states. It is reassuring that for half of the placebo counterfactuals the ratios fluctuate around one, whereas for the majority of treated states ratios grew above one at some point (likely around the actual timing of policy intervention). The latter result means that lockdown policies were effective to tame the spread of the virus, whereas the former suggests that results are not driven by chance.",

This is suggestive that South Dakota's population endogenously decided to stay more at home, and avoided environments prone to the risk of contamination.

The first row corresponds the case in which controls are used as placebos, whereas the second considers the treated states only. As we discuss below, New York is clearly an outlier, whose ratio reached an implausible value of 16.5 as reported in Table A .3. Hence, our preferred specification is displayed in the third row which excludes New York from the pool of treated states. We also compute other two versions of these ratios using the lower bound (lb) and upper bound (up) of the 95% confidence interval in the numerator. The ratios are clearly above one for the treated units, whether New York is excluded or not. According to our preferred specification, counterfactual estimates suggest that the number of cases would be nearly two times larger were lockdown policies absent.

One possible explanation is that there is a delay between cases and deaths, as the latter is a consequence of the former. Hence, deaths only show up in the official statistics days after cases. Perhaps, if we could estimate counterfactuals for longer periods, the synthetic accumulated deaths would further decouple from the actual ones. In addition, since weights on the controls are estimated considering the (log) cumulative number of cases, the counterfactuals for cumulative deaths are arguably noisier. 11",

As reported in Table 1 , among the treated states, New York was the fastest one to react to the pandemic, and established a state-wide lockdown policy only 20 days after the first case. Figure 4 extrapolates the last in-sample observations by using both the observed mean and median growth rates for the last ten days, which yields a similar pattern to the result obtained by applying the synthetic control approach. Due to the progression of the virus, particularly in New York City, the in-sample observed rates are quite high once compared to other states as illustrated in Figure 1 , which can be explained not only by the dynamics of the city but also by its high population density. Hence, New York is clearly an outlier and might not be amenable to our synthetic control approach, which justifies reporting results excluding New York above.",

These figures illustrate why we had to limit our sample size to only 58 epidemiological days. For example, if we had used 60 days in our analysis, we would have to exclude Alabama and Maine from our treated states, given that they would not be in a state-wide lockdown in the last days of the out-of-sample period.",

With only two exceptions (Missouri and Nevada), every state has an out-of-sample mean and median of the observed-to-predicted ratio below one. This means that, on average, the realized cumulative cases were smaller than the counterfactual, which highlight that lockdowns had a meaningful impact on slowing down the Covid-19 spread in these states. Table A .3 reports the ratio of the counterfactual cumulative cases to the actual ones on the 58th day after the first confirmed case in each state. It also reports the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval. Among the 20 treated states, the ratio is larger than one in 18 of them. For Missouri and Nevada, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of lockdown policies. For Mississipi and South Carolina, the impacts of lockdowns are only modest. Note that New York is clearly an outlier, with such ratio around 16.5. We discuss this case in the main text.",

As discussed in the main text, South Dakota, which displays a ratio well above one, experienced a large reduction in outside mobility even without official lockdown measures. California and Nebraska, which display ratios below one, had very few Covid-19 confirmed cases during the period before the cut-off.

We report results for treated and control states separately. Regarding mobility changes in residential areas, on average, residents from every state analyzed spent more time in these areas after the pandemic outbreak. However, those from treated states spent even more time indoor. Nevertheless, there are outliers. For instance, residents from South Dakota spent a lot more time in residential areas than before the pandemic, which helps understand the results found for this state in the placebo test.",
