Without triage, there is a risk that patients will be admitted to the ICU in the sequence that they present, disadvantaging those who either present later or have poorer access to healthcare. Moreover, if the patients with the best prognosis are not allocated life support, there is the possibility that overall mortality will increase. Before formulating criteria, principles such as maximizing lives saved and fairness ought to have been agreed upon to guide decision-making. The triage process is subdivided into three parts, i.e., having explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria for ICU admission, prioritization of patients for allocation to available beds, and periodic reassessment of all patients already admitted to the ICU. Multidimensional criteria offer more holistic prognostication than only using age cutoffs. Appointed triage officers should also be enabled to make data-driven decisions. However, the process does not merely end with an allocation decision being made. Any decision has to be sensitively and transparently communicated to the patient and family. With infection control measures, there are challenges in managing communication and the psychosocial distress of dying alone. Therefore, explicit video call protocols and social services expertise will be necessary to mitigate these challenges. Besides symptom management and psychosocial management, supportive care teams play an integral role in coordination of complex cases. This scoping review found support for the three-pronged, triage-communicationsupportive care approach to facilitate the smooth operationalization of the triage process in a pandemic.",

Moreover, subjective individual decision-making at the bedside results in both inconsistent decisions and moral distress among healthcare professionals.

Upgrading general ward facilities to offer acute non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen therapy can provide respiratory support to some of these patients.

Patients who have already been admitted to the ICU but on reassessment found to be unsuitable for continued life support will also fall into this category. Moreover, infection control measures create unique challenges such as the psychosocial distress of dying alone. Early referral to supportive care services with concurrent rather than sequential provision of palliation is preferred because resuscitative care and symptom control are not mutually exclusive [12, 13] .

Where appropriate, durable power of attorneys and previous advance care plans have to be identified [28] . To do this effectively without being subject to undue pressure, early referral is necessary. In COVID-19, a reasonable recommendation for this threshold may be intranasal oxygen of > 4 L/min to maintain SpO 2 > 92%, or the rapid escalation of oxygen requirements, or clinically assessed significant work of breathing. Although officers, who are implementing approved triage processes, need not require the consent of patients to either withhold or withdraw critical care [4] , communicating the allocation decision requires sensitivity so as not to increase the distress of the patient or family. Therefore, the activation of triage officers should be coupled with a triggering of communication and supportive care services to assist with end-of-life discussions [29] . The auditing of triage decisions can be performed by a triage review committee. This committee would also hear appeals if there is disagreement between physicians or if the patient/family is unable to accept the triage decision [5] . Besides senior clinicians, ethicists, and nurses [17] , members of the lay public can also be included in this committee to provide broad representation. If there is an appeal, the primary role of the committee is to ascertain that the triage criteria was correctly applied [5, 29] . For this reason, if there are any changes to the triage criteria because of emerging data, these changes have to be submitted to the triage review committee and approved in advance of implementation. If equally deserving patients are vying for the same ICU bed, a life cycle calculus can be employed to maximize number of years of life saved [30] . If a further tie-breaker is required, random selection is used to ensure equitable distribution without any discrimination [5] . The expectation is for the triage review committee to return a binding decision expeditiously (e.g., within a day) and the decision to be documented in the clinical records [29] . If patients require immediate ICU care during the course of a review, they can be temporarily supported with the necessary critical care based on the explicit understanding that life support may be withdrawn depending on the committee's decision. The entire triage process should be trial run using simulated case scenarios to ensure smooth coordination and a common understanding of principles [4] . All deliberations of the triage review committee ought to be subject to oversight (e.g., through the head of the hospital ethics committee) [4] .",

This model can be promoted using the principle of solidarity, i.e., because COVID-19 infects indiscriminately, no one is safe until we are all safe. Prioritization based on instrumental value (e.g., healthcare workers who are infected with COVID-19 through the course of their work) should also be openly discussed and consensus forged.",

By framing ICU treatment as a time-limited trial, expectations of the family are managed should the patient subsequently not meet triage criteria on reassessment. For patients who do not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, honest explanations of the expected prognosis should be offered and any illusion of choice not encouraged. When health systems are operating under crisis standards [32] , some choices are unavailable. This will be unfamiliar to the public who may be used to having the dominant say in treatment decisions. When triage decisions are not concordant with a patient's wishes, family members may feel that the medical team is abandoning the patient, and strong emotional reactions can be expected [33] . Consistent and compassionate communication will aid family come to terms with triage outcomes and support them. One tool that can be used is the SHARE talking map: showing the guideline, headlining what it means for the patient, affirming the care that will be provided, responding to emotions, and emphasizing that the same rules apply to everyone [34] . Implementing such tools in a crisis and effective listening [35] to concerns of patients/families may stretch frontline medical teams. Medical social workers experienced in end-of-life conversations can lead the communication arm of triage by both serving as the conduit between family and the medical team, and working collaboratively with supportive care services [36] .",

Patients with COVID-19 will be isolated, and family members, who had been in close contact, will be unable to visit because of quarantine. Visitation may be only permitted when patients deteriorate to become dangerously ill. Telephone and video calls have become alternatives for connecting the family to the patient. For those who are to ill to make these calls, a protocol can be established for assisted video calls: the nurse enters the patient's room, and using a dedicated smartphone, lets the family view and speak to the patient (Fig. 2) . The family has to be primed about patient's physical presentation beforehand to minimize distress. This should not be any different from preparing a family before they would physically see a patient admitted to the ICU in usual times outside the pandemic context. Appropriate precautions are necessary to ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality meet both legal and professional standards [37, 38] (Fig. 3) . These precautions include ensuring that the patient is decently covered and taking steps to verify the identity of the callers. Similar confidentiality precautions should be undertaken when the ICU team conducts tele or videoconferences with the family for medical updates. Special provisions should also be made for immigrant populations who may face language barriers. These include the availability of interpreters and appropriate translation of information brochures that carry frequently asked questions. The value of these protocolized interventions should be audited through patient and family satisfaction surveys that can be administered after the patient has been discharged.",

This will require both non-pharmacological (e.g., facial cooling, relaxation techniques, and breathing exercises) and pharmacological (e.g., opiates, haloperidol, and benzodiazepines) interventions. However, other commonly used techniques such as the use of handheld fans blowing air to the face for relief of dyspnea may not be advisable given the theoretical risk of droplet dispersion [13] . Besides expertise in prescription, supportive care teams also offer conservation strategies that are needed to stretch any limitation in the inventory of available drugs [39] .

These items can include religious resources, photographs, smartphones, and audio recordings to make family members feel engaged in the caregiving.

Coordination with community partners such as home and inpatient hospice services help to improve rightsiting of patients [48] . In addition, appropriate provision of spiritual care and management of staff distress fall within the responsibility of supportive care [14] .",

The consultative option is based on involvement of specialized teams who are consulted, and this model has the advantage of dedicated expertise, as well as continuity of care after ICU treatment has been completed. This expertise includes patient-centered decision-making, communication within the team and with families, continuity of care, emotional support for families, and symptom management [51] . The integrative model embeds principles of supportive care in usual ICU management and requires commitment of critical care clinicians to be trained in the necessary skills [50] .

Co-rounding enables efficient interprofessional communication, decisionmaking for complex cases, and coordination of care. During the surge, there can be a transition to the consultative model with explicit triggers to ensure timely clinical service provision (Table 1) . Ultimately, dynamic changes in workflow and clinical load, as well as the unique challenges of this new viral infection, require flexibility and improvisation to provide a commensurate supportive care response [53] .

There is also evidence of considerable variation in withdrawal practices from terminal weaning to immediate extubation [57] . Patients who have been assessed by triage officers to no longer meet criteria for continued life support will need such withdrawal procedures to be performed in a timely manner without causing distress.

If the most appropriate patients with the best chances of survival are not allocated life support, there is the real possibility that overall mortality will increase. Maximizing lives saved and fairness have been the cornerstone of triage criteria. However, the operationalization of such criteria will require real-time data, as well as both communication and supportive care support. Otherwise we may risk paralysis in disposition with inconsistent decisions and multiple demands for appeal from dissatisfied patients and their families. Such paralysis will undermine the triage procedure's goal of saving lives in a timely manner. The three-pronged, triagecommunication-supportive care approach will require multi-disciplinary input and open interprofessional communication for successful implementation that is similar to many other ICU interventions. Protocolized approaches ensure consistency especially in a pandemic where new staff may be working in unfamiliar roles. The Table 1 Indications for referral to specialist supportive care 1. Difficult-to-control physical symptoms despite usual treatment approaches 2. Complex family dynamics impacting decisions about use of lifesustaining treatments 3. Conflicts among staff or between staff and patients/families about prognosis and/or use of life-sustaining treatments 4.
