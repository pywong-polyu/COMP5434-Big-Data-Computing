This requires many countries to impose a health emergency or quarantine, which has had positive results in reducing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has also had negative economic, social and health effects. So, we suggest a mathematical model for the dynamics of how COVID-19 disease is spread, as well as a mathematical modeling for the dynamics of diabetes, then highlight the negative effect of quarantine has on the health of diabetics. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls, and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical analysis using MATLAB.",

Recently, more and more attention has been paid to study the control optimal (see [32] [33] [34] and the references mentioned there). this paper is arranged as, in section 2 , we combined two mathematicals models: mathematical model of transmission of COVID-19 SEIRQ T and mathematical model of the dyanamics of the population diabetics P DC. In section 3 , we presented an optimal control problem in our proposed model, some results concerning the existence and characterization of the optimal controls using the Pontryagin's maximum principle are given. Numerical simulations through MAT-LAB are given in section 4 . Finally we concluded the paper in section 5 .",

Our objective is to highlight the negative impact of the application of total quarantine on diabetics in particular. We have also proposed several strategies to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which leads to the lifting of the quarantine. We have also made recommendations to diabetics who must be followed during a health emergency to avoid complications of diabetes. We also introduced three controls which, respectively, represent Sensitization and prevention, quarantine, awerness program for diabetics people. We applied the results of the control theory and we managed to obtain the characterizations of the optimal controls. The numerical simulation of the obtained results showed the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies. Also, in future papers, we will study the dynamics of transmission of the Covid-19 disease using fractal-fractional Caputo-Fabrizio operator and / or Optimal control of spread of COVID-19 mathematical model using Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo fractional derivative.",
