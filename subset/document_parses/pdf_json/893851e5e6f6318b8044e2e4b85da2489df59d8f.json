In that context, the risk is that ignoring these major societal expectations that are rapidly emerging will lead to unsustainable and sterile contributions given, for example, the usual inertia of the research world to make research topics evolve. From our point of view, these expectations, relevant to the federative concept of sustainable development, concern mainly: 1) the consideration of the environment and the limited amount of hardly-renewable resources from our planet, 2) the insurance that every technological development is useful and suitable to the human society.",

Indeed, the rapid evolution of digital technologies in Industry 4.0, fostering the multiplication of sensors and actuators (e.g. Internet of Things -IoT, mobile robotics) and decision and learning abilities (e.g. Artificial Intelligence -AI) of digital or Cyber-Physical Systems causes the emerging of a great number of new functionalities and potentialities along with a great number of high ethical stakes for human decision-makers who are involved in industrial systems.",

The first factor concerns the fact that the digitalised entities are intended to facilitate the augmentation, the monitoring or even the replacement of humans, allowing new possibilities in production control as well as new investigations regarding data analysis to be enacted. Industrial practices already show some unforeseeable and questionable situations due to this advent. The second and the third factors come from the fact that two types of complexity have to be handled: an internal complexity (second factor) due to the fact that these entities become more and more complex to understand and control, and an external complexity (third factor) due to the fact that it will become more and more complex to understand and control the interrelations among them and the human society, their consequence and their possible diversion in an unpredictable environment.",

Moreover, ethics can be progressively enriched in its deployment and improved in its achievement, which is the purpose of the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) [5] . This paper raises thus the question of handling ethics as a KPI or not when deciding. To illustrate the complexity of the question raised, two industrialists were asked the same questions: \"how does your company manage ethics?\" and \"what are the relevant stakes?\" Their testimonies are provided in Fig. 2 (their names have been changed to preserve their anonymity).",

Its science falls within the field of philosophy, and seeks to dissociate \"what is good\" from \"what is bad\" [6] . Legal frameworks have then been defined associating a set of deontological rules to apply and conditions to respect. Ethics has thus always been an integral part of any approach involving human interest, its framework being constantly adapted and enriched with regards to the occurred events related to such an interest. While the concept of ethics was initially concerned with human behaviour, its field of analysis has been recently broadened to take into account the behaviour of highly autonomous systems in their operation and decision-making, typically machines, robots and cars [7, 8] . From our perspective, ethical industrial systems are industrial systems that are ethically designed on the one hand and ethically used and supported on the other hand [9] . Moreover, ethics in industrial systems can be considered as a notion that covers all the steps of the lifecycle of an industrial system and concerns all the involved stakeholder decision-makers throughout this cycle, that can be, therefore, summarised in three significant steps: the design (a priori view, before operations), the use (during operations) and the support (a posteriori view).",

A significant question is thus: how to handle ethics when making decision with regards to future industrial systems, and especially its control? From our perspective, two approaches can be adopted to answer this question. The first one consists of stating that ethics is a kind of a new criterion when making a decision, and imply considering ethics as a kind of KPI, while the second approach states that ethics cannot be just another criterion when making a decision, and is more global. The following section studies these two approaches. Even if the question and the approach are felt to be generic, the primary application field of this study concerns future industrial systems.",

The application of these rules and norms is made prior to or by the replacement of any decision made. In other words, any decision made is ethical since it is compliant with these rules and norms. This approach reassures the humans involved in the decision-making process since it guarantees that each decision is made within a static, stable and well-established ethical context.

Standards are also proposed, leading to the assignment of some definitions and conditions to fulfil [12] . Ethics has also been approached through the quality facet, as it has to be managed and measured, identifying it as a kind of compliance with what needs to be [13] . In addition, ethics has also been deployed according to the major pillars of society, in coherence avec the sustainability paradigm [14, 15] . In this sense, environmental ethics has been introduced for the relationship of human beings to nature [16] . And, as far as we are concerned, digital ethics is currently dealing with the use of digital technologies [17] . However, even if it is the core activity of many researchers and practitioners, to the best of our knowledge, no specific habits have been established concerning ethics in future industrial systems, even if attention starts to be drawn in this sense by considering potential symbiosis between humans and machine [18] .

This uncertainty may arise in cases of non-routine operations of the system, when exceptional, unplanned events occur or whose characteristics are not fully known. Such cases may concern the situation where the control is made by human decision-makers as well as the situation where the system controls itself. Human decision-makers can, therefore, be faced with too many options, each of them having advantages and disadvantages, yet to be evaluated in terms of societal or environmental impacts through PIs (Performance Indicators). Consequently, in this context, making the correct \"ethical\" decision is not trivial. In the case of self-operating systems, the reaction in front of new unconsidered event is totally unknown. Choosing the correct a posteriori approach and making the \"good\" ethical decision will be challenging. In the second case, having the correct a priori design will be impacting.",

As a preliminary to this discussion, let us recall the general definition of a PI, as \"a variable indicating the effectiveness and/or efficiency of a part or whole of the process or system against a given norm/target or plan\" [20] . By its definition, a PI -and a KPI when it is overall or major -provides performance expression, subscribes to the control loop principle and deals with the \"What you measure is what you get\" [21] principle. A PI involves thus an objective (expected state) and a measurement (reached state). The performance expression is the result of the comparison of the objective and the measurement. In a reactive control logic, such a measurement leads to improvement action launching. Figure 3 illustrates the principle of considering a PI as a triplet (objective, measurement, action) [22] . With this view, ethics handling by PI vision drives the definition of respectively the corresponding objectives, measurements and actions that are associated with it. These three definitions are described hereinafter.",

Indeed, general rules and principles can be applied to normal operation context and deal with structural needs, but cannot cover new unconsidered situations and all the consequences of the made decisions. The suggested proposal is, therefore, to have a complementary manner for approaching ethics. As the set of possibilities at each step of the industrial system is non-bounded and since ethics become not only a result or a condition to check but a process to build, the idea is to subscribe to a continuous and progressive improvement philosophy in order to define new adequate behaviours and to enrich the existing framework, adopting the idea that it is not possible to ensure \"optimal\" ethics from scratch, but ethics considerations could be enhanced through iterative improvement processes. Dealing with the Deming wheel principle [28] , such a philosophy consists of continuously proceeding through the following steps: i) observing the system according to ethics expectations, ii) planning the expected states of the system regarding the occurred events, iii) choosing the corollary actions and applying them, iv) checking the achieved results and finally v) reacting by enriching ethical aspects and planning new expected states. This is the methodological approach that is conveyed by PIs tools. Assuming that ethics can be seen at some moments as a KPI and at other moments not, it will be consequently assumed that it deals with either a continuous improvement approach or a set of pre-defined rules.

Indeed, as the situation could be totally unknown, the reaching of the expected states could require several iterative steps. At the end, the best ethical decisions to be made are defined according to the analysis of the data that are provided by ethics KPIs. These KPIs could gain from being associated to a digital twin of the industrial system that can simulate and evaluate different strategies from its current state. Some parts of the framework can be automated, while others not (e.g. the design of alternative decisions in a consequentialist behaviour); the presence of the human remains therefore compulsory. It is also possible to trigger systematically the consequentialist behaviour, even if deontological rules apply, to suggest improvement either in the triggering situation and in the ethical decision made. This framework is clearly a first attempt. It remains to be improved, implemented and tested in various situations. For example, it could be interesting to augment the application of a deontological rule with a consequentialist study when a certain degree of freedom remains available for decisions after the application of the deontological rule. Another situation that could be studied is when it is not possible to evaluate all the consequences of a decision from an ethical perspective. In that situation, clustering technics could be used to find similar situations and evaluate the ethical degree of the decision made then.",

The consequentialist view is related to unknown situations where many solutions can be considered. In this case, the idea is to associate with ethics objectives to achieve and measurements for having pieces of information according to the different options and reacting. In the first case, deontology bounds decisions as a set of constraints, while in the second case ethics is a criterion to be integrated into the decision-making process.",
