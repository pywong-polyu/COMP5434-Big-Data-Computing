            "text": "To resolve these issues, a second-generation G-CSF with an extended half-life in blood (pegfilgrastim) has become available. In a clinical study of Japanese breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide therapy (TC therapy), the incidence of FN in patients administered pegfilgrastim was 1.2% (2/173), compared with 68.8% (119/173) in the placebo group. 4 Subsequently, pegfilgrastim has freed patients from the burden of daily administration in cancer chemotherapy, enabled safer administration of highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens, contributing to wider implementation of outpatient cancer chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim has been approved in more than 80 countries or regions, including the United States, Europe, and Japan as of January 31, 2020, and is mainly indicated for reduction in the duration of neutropenia, incidence of FN, and incidence of infection as manifested by FN in patients with malignancy receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. 5 Although pegfilgrastim enabled a reduction in G-CSF dosing frequency and lowered the risk of FN in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy, its safety has not been established when administered between 14 days before and 24 hours after administration of cancer chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim administration requires patient visit to the hospital just after chemotherapy, which is burdensome to some patients for physical, mental, and socioeconomic reasons such as moving to a hospital, and often involves a long waiting time at the hospital with its associated physical discomfort. Furthermore, many patients do not want to impose a burden on their supporting family members and thus want to maintain their daily routine as much as possible. Medical institutions also have multiple challenges in dealing with the increasing numbers of outpatients receiving cancer chemotherapy, such as maintaining adequate staffing levels of those with specialized skills and reducing waiting times at reception and cashiers. In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may change the way outpatient chemotherapy is conducted in the future. In order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, efforts to prevent neutropenia should be made even more assiduously than before, and the frequency of hospital visits should be reduced. 6 An on-body injector (OBI), which automatically administers pegfilgrastim about 27 hours after the chemotherapy, can thus be expected to address the unmet medical needs of these patients by reducing the number of hospital visits. This study was therefore conducted to evaluate the safety of automatic pegfilgrastim administration using an OBI in breast cancer patients, to whom the OBI was attached after cancer chemotherapy.",

The study was conducted in accordance with the consisted of screening and treatment observation periods involving four cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide. One 3.6-mg pegfilgrastim dose was administered subcutaneously via OBI during each cycle of chemotherapy. The study enrolled 35 patients, and no serious adverse events or febrile neutropenia occurred. Administration of pegfilgrastim was successfully completed at all times when the OBI was attached to the patient, and no safety concerns associated with OBI function arose.

To apply the device, the infusion set is placed on the patient's body surface, and the infusion set is then connected to the main pump unit. Subsequently, the main pump unit is placed on the abdomen, using adhesive attached to the skin. The electro-mechanical drive in the main pump unit is set to operate automatically, approximately 27 hours after activation of the device, pushing the stopper to continuously deliver pegfilgrastim from the drug-loaded cartridge at a constant flow rate, providing subcutaneous injection through the catheter of the infusion set. When the OBI begins to operate, this is signaled by a lamp that lights up and can be checked by looking through a check window to confirm that the stopper has been pushed to the end.
