            "text": "Physical activity and self-compassion are closely related to individuals' mental health (eg, depression). However, most studies only examined their independent roles in mental health without considering the potential interaction between the two variables. The present study aimed to investigate the independent and joint associations between physical activity (PA) and self-compassion (SC) on depression symptoms and examine the additive interaction between PA and SC. Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized in the present descriptive study. By recruiting participants via social media platforms, 1846 Chinese college students completed International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and items regarding socio-demographic information. Independent and joint roles of low-level PA (LPA) and low-level SC (LSC) on depression symptoms were examined by logistic regression models. Additive interaction between LPA and LSC on depression symptoms was examined by the following indices: relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP), and synergy index (S). Socio-demographic variables were included in the models as covariates. Results: Both LPA (OR = 1.47 [1.16, 1.86]) and LSC (OR = 5.74 [3.89, 8.45]) were independently associated with higher probability of depression symptoms. Combining LPA and LSC led to an additive interaction and greatly increased the odds of depression symptoms (OR = 9.62 [5.38, 17.22]; RERI = 2.47 [0.19, 4.75], AP = 0.25 [0.05, 0.44], S = 1.38 [1.02, 1.87]). Conclusion: Both LPA and LSC were associated with an increased risk of depression symptoms. Moreover, combining LPA and LSC may develop an additive risk for depression symptoms. Future research and clinical intervention could integrate PA and SC to find a better way to resist depression symptoms.",

Numerous studies have indicated the high prevalence of depression symptoms among youths. For instance, a meta-analysis covering 45 studies including 50,825 participants revealed that the prevalence of depression symptoms among Chinese college students was about 30.39%. 1 Depression is a psychosomatic phenomenon showing both physical and psychological symptoms (eg, emotional and physical retarded activity), 2 and it associates with an array of detrimental health outcomes among young adults, including impaired cognitive processes, a variety of somatic diseases, and even frequent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. 3 Given the prevalence and adverse influence of depression symptoms, it is essential to reveal factors that could provide more targeted and efficient interventions. The present research focuses on two important factors, namely physical activity (PA) and self-compassion (SC).",

Physical activity is conducive to promote selfefficacy, 13 and further help individuals to meet the essential need of autonomy and competence. In addition, exercise and sports, forms of physical activity, might involve social interaction with others, cultivating the sense of relatedness.",

SC and PA are constructive ways for self-help. While most studies focus on the independent role of PA and SC in the intervention of depression symptoms, their combined effect is rarely studied. Notably, as proposed by the cumulative risk model, instead of examining a single risk factor, the accumulation of risk factors may better explain an individual's developmental outcomes. 19, 20 Moreover, there is a reciprocal relationship between PA and SC, suggesting that combining PA and SC may produce an additive effect on mental health. On the one side, individuals with high-level self-compassion (HSC) are likely to have a better sense of autonomy for health. 21 Therefore, individuals with HSC may have more intrinsic motivation (eg, for their physical and mental health) to engage in PA and maintain PA habits. 26, 27 SC is also associated with more adaptive self-regulation, conducive to rational goal-setting of PA. This may facilitate PA by increasing the individual's sense of competence or self-efficacy with appropriate exercise goals. 22, 23 On the other side, participating in PA is beneficial for regulating emotion and reducing the risk of psychopathology (eg, depression). 24, 25 Individuals may experience less rumination while exercising, which further promotes mindfulness and increase self-compassion. 26 Indeed, a recent metaanalysis covering 25 studies have concluded that higher levels of PA were associated with higher levels of SC. 26 Considering the known separate role of LPA and LSC in depression symptoms, along with the mutually reinforcing relationship between PA and SC, it is thus reasonable to speculate that concurrent exposures to LPA and LSC would generate an additional risk in depression symptoms. Specifically, we proposed that a combination of LPA and LSC was associated with a higher risk of depression symptoms (Hypothesis 2), and there was an additive interaction between LPA and LSC (Hypothesis 3).",

The inclusion criteria for participants were: (a) Chinese college students; (b) willing to participate in the study, (c) able to communicate in Chinese, and (d) no major mental health problems at present. Students who had completed all questionnaires (approximately 15 minutes) were given ten RMB (Chinese currency, equivalent to 1.5 USD) via online payment. In total, 1942 participants from 30 provinces and autonomous regions were recruited and 1846 participants (response rate = 95.1%) provided valid answers in this study. Participants were asked to provide online consent before filling out the survey. Based on existing studies on depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, 28-31 the sample was computed using G*Power 3.1 based on the following assumptions: an expected prevalence (25.0%) of symptoms (PHQ-9 scores \u226510 as the cut-off), 1.5 odds ratio (OR) of symptoms among LPA or LSC, margin of error of 5% and power of 90%, two-tailed examination, and binomial distribution of independent variables. This gives a total sample size of 1435. The finally recruited sample (n = 1846) exceeds this, indicating the sufficiency for statistical analysis. The confidence level was set at 95%. The research obtained ethics approval from the local Human Research Ethics Committee (blinded for review).

The antidepressant effects of PA can be explained from two aspects: biological and psychological mechanisms. 47 Regarding the biological mechanism, it is suggested that PA elicits a wide range of structural and functional changes in the brain, which suggests that PA may produce its effect through multiple pathways, such as balancing neurotransmitters related to mood-regulation or stress response (eg, cortisol). 48, 49 PA was also associated with the decrease in basal proinflammatory markers and the increase in antiinflammatory markers. 50 Thus, PA can moderate the relationship between inflammation and depression symptoms. 51 In terms of the psychological mechanism, PA improves self-esteem and self-efficacy, for example, by improving physical self-perceptions and transferable sense of coping with challenges. 52,53 PA also makes it more accessible for individuals to get more social support by more interaction and emotional disclosure during exercises with companions. 54, 55 Besides, physically active individuals are prone to have other healthy behaviors in their daily life, such as recommended eating and sleep habits, which are also associated with better mental health. [56] [57] [58] [59] Therefore, compared to the participants with HPA who could obtain the benefits of PA above, it is not surprising to find those with LPA had a greater risk for depression symptoms in this study.",

SC is associated with the mammalian caring systems. 63 The activation of this system may generate oxytocin, which can downregulate one's stress response and alleviate mood disorders (eg, depression). 64 Besides, SC indicated a competence to treat oneself with kindness when suffering pain. 65 Conversely, individuals with LSC may manifest a high level of self-criticism. 66 Many studies showed that excessive self-criticism might lead to depression symptoms. 67 One possible reason is that self-criticism, similar to external criticism, may diminish one's self-esteem and generate a sense of failure, leading to depression symptoms. 68 In addition, individuals with LSC tend to ruminate on the sufferings and setbacks they experienced, which also explain the development of depression symptoms. 69 Notably, a substantial increase in the odds of depression symptoms was observed in combination with both LPA and LSC in this study. Our findings partially support previous research demonstrating that the increase in the number of unhealthy behaviors increased the odds for depression symptoms. [70] [71] [72] Our findings are also in line with the cumulative risk model, suggesting that cumulative risk predicts cumulative outcome. 19 As expected, both LPA and LSC were risk factors for depression symptoms, and thus their co-occurrence could significantly increase the risk of the symptoms.",

In other words, the coexistence of LPA and LSC may make an additive risk on depression symptoms. Although underlying mechanisms of this finding can hardly be fully classified based on our data, some empirical evidence may be helpful in explaining the additive interaction. Research suggests that individuals with LPA are more prone to have rumination and self-coldness, which may negatively impact their capacity of SC, 73, 74 and trigger psychological problems such as depression. 75 Individuals with LSC may have symptoms of self-isolation that may affect their sense of relatedness, and LSC may also reduce individuals' autonomous health behaviors both psychologically and physiologically. These, subsequently, may lead to emotional dysregulation 76 and learned helplessness, 77 which may further undermine selfefficacy and increase the likelihood of experiencing depression symptoms. Taken together, these findings may partly explain why additive interaction between LPA and LSC act synergistically to increase the odds of depression symptoms. Nevertheless, literature concerning the additive association between LPA and LSC on depression symptoms is rare, more research is called in the area to clarify the mechanisms.",

Second, this study collected data from university students, mainly from Guangdong province. The results may not be generalizable to other populations. Third, the assessments of PA, SC, and depression symptoms in this study were selfreported, leading to potential recall bias. Fourth, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, even though the indexes of additive interaction of physical activity and self-compassion were still significant, the lower confidence intervals of AP and S are close to the statistical rejection area. This suggested that the significance may be marginal. Nevertheless, we still find 25% of depression symptoms attributed to the interaction of LPA and LSC. Future studies are needed to validate or refute our findings. Finally, it is worth to be noted that PA is the superordinate concept of exercise. Exercise refers to several kinds of PA that are planned, structured for purposes of fitness. 78 More purposed and moderate-to-high intensity exercise, relative to incidental PA, may pose a distinct influence on depression symptoms and differently interact with SC, whereas it is not precisely measured in this study. But generally, college students accompanied with LPA and LSC were prone to have more depression symptoms. Future studies can further improve the study design with more precision.",

According to recent metaanalyses, 84, 85 body-mind exercises were of great benefit to treating depression symptoms. Therefore, clinical measures integrating PA and SC can also be designed and taken to help prevent or reduce depression symptoms in young adults. For instance, when we design the interventions for depressive symptoms, we could add some SC components to PA-based interventions or some PA components to SC-based interventions. The effect of these interventions may be better than the interventions involving only PA or SC.",
