Food fraud can occur in various ways ranging from isolated acts of dishonesty by individuals to organised illegal activity coordinated by sophisticated criminal gangs (Table 1) . Fraud can involve dishonesty at any stage in the production or supply of food; it is often complex and can be seriously harmful to consumers and businesses.",

Interpretation of results is rarely clear cut and analytical results are often used to inform and target further investigation rather than for making a single compliance decision. Once the adulteration risks have been characterised for a given raw material, a surveillance programme can be developed which builds con dence in the organisation's suppliers and con rms that the vulnerability prevention measures in place are appropriate. Every year over 50,000 authenticity tests are conducted and pooled for intelligence sharing and since its creation in has collated over 250,000 product authenticity test results.
