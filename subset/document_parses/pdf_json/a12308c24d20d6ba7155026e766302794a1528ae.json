            "text": "Burnout is an occupational syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment from work stress. Physician burnout is increasing from a prevalence of 35%-50% despite ongoing efforts to reduce burnout, 1 with a recent metaanalysis indicating a 51% prevalence prior to the pandemic. 2 The recent pandemic has placed further strain on physicians due to increased workload, anxiety related to supply of personal protective equipment, and uncertainty about patient care and health services. 3 Burnout is a vital issue for physicians and healthcare systems as burnout is associated with worse job performance among physicians, job attrition and is a stronger contributor to medical errors than fatigue. 4 Burnout costs the Canadian health system $213 million related to reduced physician work hours. 5 Physician burnout may disproportionately affect individuals based on their gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation, although study findings are sparse and inconsistent. [6] [7] [8] Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This survey used a validated burnout instrument, Maslach Burnout Inventory, to measure internal medicine physician burnout during the pandemic. \u25ba The study analysed ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation of physicians on burnout and personal accomplishment that is infrequently assessed. \u25ba As interventions for reducing burnout are not frequently informed by physician views, we determined which types of interventions to reduce burnout were considered important and explored any differences of these preferences by ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. \u25ba The response rate was somewhat low at 38% but the results did not differ among divisions that had high response rates>50% compared with those that were lower.",

The Public Health Agency of Canada reports that women, racialized Canadians and essential workers are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 9 According to the American Medical Association, COVID-19 exacerbated inequities, not just for patients, but also for physicians. 10 These issues may not only impact the prevalence of burnout, but also influence the potential solutions for mitigating burnout. Thus, we sought to evaluate the prevalence of burnout, determinants, work-to-life conflict, considerations of quitting and views on potential interventions to reduce burnout during the pandemic and to examine whether these measures differed by gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation among physicians who worked in the department of medicine at two academic, tertiary care hospitals in Vancouver, Canada.",

In addition to providing an overall measure of burnout, the instrument enables the measurement of the three distinct domains of burnout using summated ratings. The emotional exhaustion domain consists of nine items (eg, I feel emotionally drained from my work) for a total score range of 0-54. The depersonalisation domain consists of five items (eg, I do not really care what happens to some patients) for a total score range of 0-30. The personal accomplishment domain consists of eight items (eg, I have accomplished many worthwhile things in this job) for a total score range of 0-48. The presence of physician burnout was defined as an emotional exhaustion score \u226527 or depersonalisation score \u226510, consistent with criteria used in other studies 12 and those with scores less than this were considered as not experiencing burnout. We used the same cut-points for defining the presence of emotional exhaustion or not and depersonalisation or not. Feeling low personal accomplishment (defined as a score \u226433) was evaluated separately from overall burnout. 12 Evidence linked one-point changes in burnout scores with meaningful differences in selfperceived major medical errors, reductions in work hours and suicidal ideation. 13 Respondents were asked if they had ever left a position or considered quitting a position now for any reason. We assessed work-to-life conflict using one item from a national study on burnout among physicians: 'My work schedule leaves me enough time for my personal/family life' (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree). 14 The presence of work-to life conflict was considered if respondents disagreed with that statement. Physicians were also asked if they felt that the COVID-19 pandemic increased their feelings of burnout (agree, neither agree nor disagree or disagree).",

All models included the following explanatory variables: age, gender, ethnicity (dichotomised to white or visible ethnic minority physician due to sample size), sexual orientation, clinical hours, attribution of COVID-19 affecting burnout, division, weekend days worked and on call duties. We tested for the presence of interactions between gender and ethnicity as well as gender and sexual orientation in these models. As these interactions were non-significant, we present the models without the interaction terms. Missing values ranged from 14% to 17.5% across all survey questions (14% missing MBI). From available data, there were no statistically significant differences by division, age, gender, ethnicity or clinical hours worked among those with missing data and those without. Missing values were excluded from analyses (complete case analysis); therefore, our estimates are conservative. All tests were two sided, and the level of significance was 0.05.

            "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, although most of our respondents feel a sense of personal accomplishment, burnout and emotional exhaustion are high. Physicians who endorse that COVID-19 affects their feelings of burnout are more likely to report burnout and to consider quitting a work position or have quit a position. Women and visible minority physicians are more likely to report components of burnout compared with their white counterparts during the pandemic. The prevalence of burnout and its components in the current study are generally higher than those reported prior to the pandemic. A systematic review of 176 studies from 2018 reported a prevalence of overall burnout of 48.7%, emotional exhaustion of 36.7% and depersonalisation of 32.1% among studies using similar burnout measures. 12 Also, a recent meta-analysis of 22, 778 medical and surgical residents identified a 51% aggregate prevalence prior to the pandemic. 2 However, given significant heterogeneity in the physician subjects sampled, location and study dates, it is challenging to directly compare prevalence before and after the pandemic. Recent studies from China, Italy and the USA report similarly high rates of burnout among healthcare workers but most do not use standardised, benchmarked burnout questionnaires or examine personal accomplishment. [19] [20] [21] [22] Our analysis highlights that physicians perceived that COVID-19 increased their burnout. However, burnout was high across all divisions studied regardless of whether they LGBTQ, lesbian, gay, bisexual, two-spirited or queer. EMR, electronic medical record Open access were responsible for caring for patients with COVID-19 or not. This suggests a widespread impact of the pandemic and the restrictions imposed including anxiety related to supply of personal protective equipment, uncertainty and significant shift in clinical practice to virtual care. 23 In a recent analysis of surgeons, knowing a person who died from COVID-19 infection or someone who acquired a COVID-19 infection increased the risk of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder, irrespective of being deployed for COVID-related work. 24 Increased work hours, concerns over infecting family members, lack of support from peers, limited resources and overwork were identified as drivers of burnout and emotional exhaustion during the pandemic. 21 22 Given recent social movements focused on racial inequity and the amplification the effects of social disparities during the pandemic, 25 our finding that more women experience emotional exhaustion and both women and visible minority physicians are more likely to report feeling low personal accomplishment than their counterparts is important. Although inconsistent, studies of physicians before the pandemic reported a higher risk of emotional exhaustion in women than men. 26 27 There are few studies examining gender or ethnicity on burnout during the pandemic. However, a recent analysis of medical trainees demonstrated that women were more likely to report stress compared with men. 20 The reasons underlying the high prevalence of emotional exhaustion in women during the pandemic may include more family stress, greater child-raising responsibility than men, increased risk of depression 28 and less supportive work environments. 6 26 27 Working parents spent an additional 6 hours caring for their children and women took more than two-thirds of that additional time during the pandemic in Canada and elsewhere. 29 However, we did not find any gender differences in our one item question on work-to-life conflict. Further, the increased hours spent are thought to be at the expense of academic productivity in women 30 and may contribute to feeling low personal accomplishment compared with men. The literature is also inconsistent regarding the impact of race on burnout or its components. 7 31 32 A previous national US survey found that minority physicians were less likely to report burnout including emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation compared with white, non-Hispanic physicians, 33 whereas others demonstrated no difference in burnout. However, with increased COVID-19 infections, incidents of racial discrimination increased dramatically and this 'double pandemic' 31 may place greater strain on visible minority physicians. Although our study also found no difference in emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation by ethnicity, we identified a greater likelihood of feeling low personal accomplishment. The reasons underlying a feeling of low personal accomplishment in these groups are unknown but may be related to higher prevalence of imposter syndrome, a syndrome where an individual doubts their skills, or accomplishments, increased discrimination or being less likely recognised for their accomplishments than their counterparts. 7 30 32 33 Although our study did not find any differences in burnout among sexual minority groups, a previous analysis of medical students found greater rates of depression than heterosexual medical students. 8 Given the high prevalence of burnout, strategies to reduce burnout are needed urgently. Most interventions studied thus far include person level interventions to improve resilience and coping with effective tools such as online cognitive behavioural therapy. 34 There are fewer studies evaluating additional components that address system-level issues including optimising work quality or quantity. Further, there are few studies evaluating physician preferences for person level, work quality or quantity interventions. In this study, ratings for the interventions that reduced work inefficiencies and non-physician clerical work were rated similarly highly among gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation subgroups. This extends the findings from other observational studies that satisfaction with workflow, relationship with colleagues, time and resources for continuing medical education, opportunity to affect decision making, workload and having a trusted advisor were associated with lower likelihood of burnout. 15 These interventions that addressed work quality were highly rated, whereas person-level interventions were less highly rated. New interventions should focus on combining personlevel interventions, with system-level approaches that address work quantity and quality interventions.",

Second, the number of physicians who identified as LGBTQ or non-binary gender was low that may have underestimated any differences. Third, we were not able to quantify any incremental effect of the pandemic on burnout, as we did not have comparable data just prior to the pandemic. Perceptions of COVID-19 impacting feelings of burnout may be subject to confirmation bias.
