At the outset, a consultation process was undertaken whereby key stakeholders were asked to compile a list of the key microorganisms of interest to the sector.

A survey of the rapid assays commercially available for the 19 organisms/groups of organisms was conducted. A wide disparity between the number of rapid tests available was found. Four categories were used to summarize the availability of rapid assays per organism/group of organisms: high coverage (>15 assays available); medium coverage (5-15 assays available); low coverage (<5 assays available); no coverage (0 assays available). Generally, species or genera containing pathogens, whose presence is regulated-for, tend to have a good selection of commercially available rapid assays for their detection, whereas groups composed of heterogenous or even undefined genera of mainly spoilage organisms tend to be \"low coverage\" or \"no coverage.\" Organisms/groups of organisms with \"low coverage\" by rapid assays include: Clostridium spp.; fecal Streptococci; and Pseudomonas spp. Those with \"no coverage\" by rapid assays include: endospores; psychrotrophs; SRB/SRCs; thermodurics; and thermophiles. An important question is: why have manufacturers of rapid microbiological assays failed to respond to the necessity for rapid methods for these organisms/groups of organisms? The review offers explanations, ranging from the technical difficulty involved in detecting as broad a group as the thermodurics, which covers the spores of multiple sporeforming genera as well at least six genera of mesophilic nonsporeformers, to the taxonomically controversial issue as to what constitutes a fecal Streptococcus or SRBs/SRCs. We review two problematic areas for assay developers: validation/certification and the nature of dairy food matrices. Development and implementation of rapid alternative test methods for the dairy industry is influenced by regulations relating to both the microbiological quality standards and the criteria alternative methods must meet to qualify as acceptable test methods. However, the gap between the certification of developer's test systems as valid alternative methods in only a handful of representative matrices, and the requirement of dairy industries to verify the performance of alternative test systems in an extensive and diverse range of dairy matrices needs to be bridged before alternative methods can be widely accepted and adopted in the dairy industry.

TTR is critical for microbiological analyses carried out in a dairy setting: for many products if testing time can be significantly reduced this results in reduced hold/warehousing time and associated costs, as well as quicker time to market for final products. Standard ISO-based plating methods, which have been employed in the industry for over 100 years to evaluate microbial risk via analysis of in-process and finished product test streams, are time consuming, requiring two or more days of incubation prior to reading, with positive results requiring further plating and incubation to confirm putative identifications (Boor, Wiedmann, Murphy, & Alcaine, 2017; Wilkinson, 2018) .

Timely determination of whether a process is in-control or out-of-control, capable or not capable, based on defined process conditions and run time, is very useful for the process operator. For example, if a customer specification for spores in whey powder is 500 CFU/g and the in-process whey stream contains 800 CFU/g then it is highly likely that the finished powder will be out of specification and, therefore, rapid quality data allows an intervention such as further heat treatment and/or filtration of the liquid stream to achieve correct product specification.

As is the case with other immunological methods, ELISAs work on the basis of labeled antibodies that bind to antigens on the cell surface of specific microorganisms or groups of organisms (Poghossian, Geissler, & Sch\u20ac oning, 2019) . The development of further ELISAs for the dairy industry depends on the availability of highly specific antibodies against the microbes of interest.

Over the course of a number of meetings, a list of relevant organisms was compiled. This list is complex, with 19 organisms or groups thereof, and may contain some entries (and indeed some omissions) which may come as a surprise to academic researchers in the field of dairy microbiology, but not to those \"on the ground\" in the dairy industry (Table 1 ). The absence of Campylobacter jejuni, which in 2017 featured as number seven in the top 10 pathogen/food vehicle pair causing the highest number food-borne outbreaks in the EU (EFSA & ECDC, 2018), may constitute one such omission. However, it must be understood that organisms such as C. jejuni, which make up the natural microflora of cow's milk but which are eliminated by pasteurization and do not reappear to contaminate products during downstream processing are not of interest to the dairy industry (Artursson, Schelin, Lambertz, Hansson, & Engvall, 2018) .

Additionally, if an organism's (or usually group of organism's) detection provides a useful insight into the dairy manufacturer's process then it is also on the list. The list may be divided into five categories: single species which are pathogens; genera containing pathogenic species; broad taxonomic groupings; organisms displaying certain growth preferences or resistance as regards temperature; indicators of quality. From a food safety standpoint, the importance of many of the organisms included on the list cannot be disputed (7.7% of foodborne outbreaks in the EU in 2017 involved dairy produce; EFSA & ECDC, 2018): this would include all the species or genera to which pathogens belong and all of which fall under stern regulatory criteria regarding their levels in finished product. Beyond the detection of pathogens necessary for the hygienic control of dairy products and their regulatory compliance, dairy producers have an interest in the detection of microbes or groups thereof which provide them with data on raw material quality, CIP and the operation of equipment such as pasteurizers, spray driers and ultrafiltration plants: many of the broad taxonomic groupings, organisms displaying certain growth preferences or resistance as regards temperature and indicators of quality are of interest to dairy processors precisely for this reason.

Even more puzzling to the taxonomist may be the desire to detect the best part of an entire kingdom (yeasts and molds) or a tranche of unrelated microbes which happen to grow or survive at a certain temperature (e.g. psychrotrophs). Regardless of these groupings' spurious systemic basis, however, they are of proven practical value in that they allow personnel in decision making and planning roles in dairy plants to manage their processes in accordance with the principals of quality assurance and GMP. Companies to which dairy plants supply materials for input into their own product lines (e.g. infant formula manufacturers) often use criteria such as endospore or SRC count as a basis for lot acceptance. Countries outside of the EU regulatory framework may also have stipulations for minimum e.g. endospore counts. Cronobacter sakazakii, along with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp., is one of the \"big three\" pathogens of current concern for postprocessing contamination of dairy products (Boor et al., 2017) . Because of the danger it poses to neonates, C. sakazakii is seen as a particular risk in infant formula, with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 stipulating its absence in 10 g of dried infant formula and dried dietary foods for special medical purposes intended for infants below 6 months of age (European Commission, 2005) . This puts considerable pressure on milk powder manufacturers in terms of the ability to supply a consistently clean product as well as deploying within the boundaries of the Regulation a highly sensitive assay for detection of the organism. C. sakazakii finds its way into product through its persistence in the processing environment, where moisture and organic matter favor its survival (Flint et al., 2020) . Because of this, along with detection in intermediates and finished product, manufacturers are interested in controlling for C. sakazakii's presence in the plant, meaning the requirement for a convenient and rapid assay (though not necessarily as sensitive as that required for product testing) is urgent.

Endospores of B. licheniformis, for example only suffer a 0.01 log reduction in milk following pasteurization (Khanal, Anan, & Muthukumarappan, 2014) and members of the genus can grow as biofilms where both endospores and vegetative cells are present (Park, Yang, Choi, & Kim, 2017) .

Along with non-Staphylococcus species such as E. coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and St. uberis, the CPS cause bovine mastitis, entering the dairy supply chain through the milk of infected cattle (Vanderhaeghen et al., 2015) . Because the disease risk associated with S. aureus (and possibly the other CPS) is by virtue of the heatstable toxins they produce (Islam et al., 2018) , regulations can either refer to the detection of toxin or the organisms that produce it. In cheeses, milk powder and whey powder, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1441/2007 stipulate that no enterotoxins should be detected in 25 g of product (European Commission, 2007) . Limits for the toxin-producing organisms are less severe: cheeses made from raw milk may contain up to 1.0 \u00c2 10 4-5 CFU/g of CPS; cheeses made from milk that have undergone a lower heat treatment than pasteurization and ripened cheeses made from milk or whey that has undergone pasteurization or a stronger heat treatment may contain up to 1.0 \u00c2 10 2-3 CFU/g of CPS; unripened soft cheeses (fresh cheeses) made from milk or whey that has undergone pasteurization or a stronger heat treatment may contain up to 1.0 \u00c2 10 2-3 CFU/g of CPS; milk powder and whey powder may contain up to 1.0 \u00c2 10 1-2 CFU/g of CPS. Primary legislation states that if greater than 1.0 \u00c2 10 5 CFU/g of CPS are found in raw milk it has to be tested for staphylococcal enterotoxins (Commission and Parliament Regulation [EC] No 178/2002, European Parliament and Council, 2002) . If enterotoxin is detected, the raw milk is considered unsafe. Staphylococcus spp. are important components of dairy plant biofilms (Flint et al., 2020) and as such should be a target organism of plant hygiene monitoring programs. The ability of assays to detect all members of the CPS should be verified.

Because many non-Clostridium spp. are able to grow on the media used to select for SRCs, colonies showing positive for sulfite reduction are more correctly referred to as CFUs of \"sulfite reducing bacteria (SRBs)/SRCs\" (Weenk, van den Brink, Struijk, & Mossel, 1995) .

The answer is that, historically, it has been more convenient to apply the SRB/SRC plate-based assay than those for Clostridium spp. alone, and so detecting SRBs/SRCs became shorthand for detecting Clostridium spp. This leads on to the question: will new, rapid methods, especially those based on genetic tests, be able to replicate the broadness of the test for SRBs/SRCs?

While it has many detractors, the very fact that it is still in use testifies its worth as an assay of the general hygienic status of raw milk, and, on occasion, downstream products. The basis of the test is as an indicator of hygiene and safety in that a high count in e.g. raw milk (>1.0 \u00c2 10 5 CFU/mL) suggests poor practices in the milking parlor and/or transportation, whereas a low count (<5.0 \u00c2 10 4 CFU/mL) is normally required for a high-quality final product (Gleeson et al., 2013; Willis et al., 2018) . It is still in use for the purposes of establishing the hygienic and safety criteria for many national and international regulatory authorities (see Sadiq et al., 2018) . The FSAI, for non-fermented dairy products stipulates limits of <1.0 \u00c2 10 5 CFU/mL for \"satisfactory\", 1.0 \u00c2 10 5-7 CFU/mL for \"borderline\" and > 1.0 \u00c2 10 7 CFU/mL for \"unsatisfactory\" (FSAI, 2019).

The biofilms they form tend to be resistant to many commonly used cleaning agents: biofilms of P. aeruginosa of dairy origin were resistant to benzalkonium chloride, iodophor and sodium hypochlorite treatment.

P. fluorescens is the most widely reported spoilage bacterium in raw milk at refrigeration temperatures and can secrete significant amount of heat-resistant extracellular hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, lipases and lecithinases in raw milk during storage at low temperature (Sadiq et al., 2018) .

A standard PCR will not discriminate between DNA isolated from a vegetative cell from that isolated from an endospore. Unless a method such as density-gradient centrifugation is used to separate the vegetative cells from endospores in a sample, PCR as a rapid method is of no use in endospore detection. Similarly, growth-based rapid assays must remove or inactivate (through heating) vegetative cells from a sample in order to yield data on the growth of only endospores (Thomas & Prasad, 2014) . However, since endospores have widely differing growth requirements (species within the genus, Clostridium, are strictly anaerobic, while Bacillus, are aerobic) it is very difficult to envisage one single growth assay successfully detecting all endospores present-unless this were to come in a multi-well format where the medium, temperature and atmosphere of each well was tailored to the growth of a different strain. Any immunoassay would require a cocktail of antibodies of broad (genus) specificities in order to detect the common species from the common endospore genera (Anoxybacillus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Geobacillus, Paenibacillus) as it would be very unlikely to find one antibody of acceptable specificity which bound to all endospores (Kennedy & Wilkinson, 2017) . Interestingly, were the problem of separating endospores and vegetative cells overcome, PCR could be used to detect a broad range of endospores: a cocktail of primers could be applied to amplify the DNA of multiple strains. Were technical issues regarding the staining of endospores overcome, the technique made more convenient and sample reading automated, fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) could be used to detect all endospores: probes are available for broad taxonomic groups such as that into which all endospore formers can be placed, the phylum Firmicutes (Doyle et al., 2015; Rohde, Hammerl, Appel, Dieckmann, & Al Dahouk, 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 385, "text": "(Eijlander et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 860, "end": 883, "text": "(Thomas & Prasad, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1663, "text": "(Kennedy & Wilkinson, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2256, "text": "(Doyle et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2309, "text": "Rohde, Hammerl, Appel, Dieckmann, & Al Dahouk, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endospores"}, {"text": "This group is composed of a wide range of unrelated bacteria, whose only shared feature is the ability to grow at temperatures below 7\u00b0C (see above).

According to the regulation, alternative methods to the reference method can be used as long as they provide at least equivalent results to the reference method in the relevant food category, as demonstrated by validation against the most recent edition of the analytical reference method specified in the regulation (European Commission, 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 371, "text": "(European Commission, 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1155, "text": "(European Commission, 2005)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Regulations surrounding alternative microbial test methods"}, {"text": "European and international third-party accreditation and certification organizations such as AFNOR, Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC), MicroVal and NordVal can carry out independent unbiased validation of proprietary alternative methods according to ISO 16140:2016 or similar standards in line with the abovementioned regulation (ISO, 2016) . The performance of these validation procedures results in issuing of an independent certificate of method performance, confirming that the method meets an appropriate standard for its intended use, as set out in the criteria of the validation study. FBOs and independent testing laboratories can then perform method verification studies to confirm that the validated method functions in the end users' lab as was determined in the validation study. In the case where a company wishes to use a method that does not carry these thirdparty certifications, validation using the ISO 16140 series of alternative method validation standard procedures, or equivalent recognized protocols, must be carried out and the method must be authorized by the relevant authority overseeing compliance with Regulation No 2073 /2005 (FSAI, 2014 . In certain instances, alternative microbiological methods can present challenges to alignment with strict regulatory terminology. In many cases, alternative microbiological methods can present microbiological data in forms different to that produced by the standard culture-based methods (i.e. CFU per sample). For example, ATP-based bioluminescence test systems produce results in Relative Light Units (RLU; Bottari & Santarelli, 2015) , and FCM-based BactoScan\u2122 and BactoCount instruments present results of bacterial counts as Individual Bacterial Counts (IBC). The microbiological criteria for food groupings set down in Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 specify microbial limits in CFU per sample. Similarly, the microbiological criteria for raw milk hygiene set down in Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 (European Commission, 2004 indicate the maximum number of microbes that are allowable based on a plate count per ml at 30\u00b0C -therefore in units of CFU/mL. Dairies commonly employ a payment scheme for farmers based on the total bacterial counts (CFU/mL) in raw milk. However, rapid high-throughput alternative FCM-based BactoScan and BactoCount instruments are widely used in dairies and testing laboratories for microbial counting in raw intake milk, where results are presented as IBC/mL, the values of which can differ from CFU/mL. Conversion factors have been developed to equate IBC to CFU, and a standard method (ISO 21187; ISO, 2004) is available to allow determination of conversion factors between standard method results and alternative method results in line with regulations. However, variability can still exist in conversion factors between different labs that have individually validated their conversion factors according to the regulations using the recommended standardized methods.

In the case of isothermal amplification methods, the detection limit for L. monocytogenes in a milk powder matrix using a propidium monoazide loop mediated isothermal amplification (PMA-LAMP) method was 10-fold higher than in a broth culture (Wan et al., 2012) . Detection limits for a range of bacteria using LAMP were similarly found to be higher in skimmed milk, whole milk, and a range of cheeses, and L. monocytogenes enriched to a level of 4-5 CFU/mL was undetectable above a background level in milk and cheeses of varying fat content including mozzarella, crescenza and cottage cheese by isothermal amplification, while this concentration of bacteria was detectable in a broth culture (Tirloni et al., 2017) .

Depending on the specific product, dairy products vary in pH, a w , and in fat, lactose, casein and whey compositions, and even products generally referred to as MPC can comprise items ranging from 40% to 90% protein content. Furthermore, the composition and structure of milk constituents, such as casein micelles and soluble casein proteins are affected by calcium ion concentrations, by temperature, and by the pH of the dairy product (Lin, Leong, Dewan, Bloomfield, & Morr, 1972; Marchin, Putaux, Pignon, & L eonil, 2009; Walstra, 1990) . These differing properties can affect the microbial detection and enumeration efficiency of test systems in specific dairy matrices, and the differentiation of microbial cells from matrix components. At a basic level, the source of the milk may define the performance of a test system-it has been suggested that the performance of FCM-based systems, such as the BactoScan\u2122, may vary if, for example, the test sample is sheep's milk instead of cow's milk (Tom\u00e1\u0161ka et al., 2006) .

Similarly, matrix interference from milk proteins was reduced in a proof-of-concept study of direct MS microbial analysis of enrichment cultures of milk, only after performance of a secondary enrichment step to further dilute the interfering particles in the milk matrix, which masked identification of species-specific peptide mass fingerprints ( Jadhav, Shah, Karpe, & Morrison, 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 555, "text": "(El-sharoud, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 556, "end": 583, "text": "Liu, Sui, Wang, & Gu, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 584, "end": 602, "text": "Shan et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 603, "end": 621, "text": "Song et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 622, "end": 643, "text": "Tirloni et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 644, "end": 660, "text": "Yu et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 661, "end": 680, "text": "Zhang et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1313, "text": "(El-sharoud, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1702, "text": "( Jadhav, Shah, Karpe, & Morrison, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strategies to reduce dairy matrix interference"}, {"text": "If enumeration is required and, thus, enrichment cannot be carried out, or where extra matrix cleanup measures in addition to dilution by enrichment are required, physical and chemical matrix clearance methods have been tested for removal and reduction of particulate material, fat and protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strategies to reduce dairy matrix interference"}, {"text": "For many platforms such as PCR, isothermal amplification, ELISA, FCM and lateral flow, strategies to remove these components include filtration to remove large particulate material, centrifugation to separate and remove the fat component, treatment with detergents such as SDS or Triton X-100 to solubilize lipids, treatments with EDTA or citrate to solubilize casein micelles, and treatment with proteases such as proteinase K or savinase to digest the protein component (Bosward, House, Deveridge, Mathews, & Sheehy, 2016; Chiao et al., 2013; Gunasekera et al., 2000; Kumar & Kumar Mondal, 2015; Liang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2013; Soejima et al., 2012) .

Centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation to isolate bacterial cells may also be carried out (reviewed in Bottari & Santarelli, 2015) .

The individual matrix component proportions in different dairy products, and the presence of supplemental ingredients, such as vegetable fats and vitamins in EMP, could affect the capability of technologies to assess the microbial content, and the strategies employed for matrix preclearance. In addition to this, conformational changes in matrix components, such as proteins, in response to heat treatments can alter the effect these pre-clearance mechanisms have on the effectiveness of the preclearance protocols. In a study by McClelland et al. (1994) , a milk-clearing reagent was effective in removal of interfering particles from pasteurized milk for detection by FCM, but not from ultra-heat treated milk, where the clearing solution had no effect on removal of interfering particles, and produced results similar to an un-cleared control. The authors attribute this to the differential behavior of casein micelles following heat treatment that may have prevented their flocculation and removal. Similarly, homogenization alters the structure of casein micelles, which may also affect the ability to remove these particles. Care should be taken that the agents used for removal of interfering components, do not themselves interfere with the proper functioning of the detection assay, or result in excessive microbial cell loss, for example loss of cells present in the discarded supernatant of a centrifuged sample, or loss of cells attached to matrix components that are removed from the sample (Bosward et al., 2016; Geng et al., 2014) . Even in cases where pretreatments are performed, detection limits in the pretreated matrices can still be higher than those in pure culture. In a qPCR assay for detection of Enterobacteriaceae, milk was treated with proteinase K following centrifugation to remove micellar casein, and sample pellets decreased in size due to degradation of matrix protein. Even with this treatment, the Ct values of the qPCR assay were higher in the milk matrix than in sterile water (Soejima et al., 2012) . However, reduction of detection limits in dairy matrices to levels comparable to pure culture may not be a goal; it may be sufficient to include matrix pretreatment steps to reduce matrix interference enough to allow the alternative test system to have an advantage over traditional methods in aspects such as time-to-result, sample throughput and test system footprint.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 667, "end": 691, "text": "McClelland et al.

While it may be technically difficult to develop rapid assays for broad, ill-defined groupings of organisms, we would urge commercial assay developers to take note of the evidence provided by this study and develop assays to fill the evident gap, especially given the increasing focus on a number of these grouping. For example, testing for sporeformers is becoming increasingly important in the dairy industry, where their carry-through post-pasteurization into powders is of growing concern, and, in a context where the microbiological quality of raw milk is higher than it has ever been, the focus is shifting to spoilage organisms which enter the product post-pasteurization.

Microbiological criteria in official regulations concerning safe levels of microbes for consumption and microbial limits for sale of dairy products are founded on culture-based test methods. Novel technologies that produce results that do not correlate exactly with this gold standard, and produce results based on measurement of other cellular characteristics, such as cell membrane permeability, intracellular enzyme activity, or ATP concentration can encounter obstacles to implementation in routine testing regimes, due to non-adherence to strictly defined regulation criteria. Specific terminology in official regulations, such as explicitly requested units of measurement of microbes, may create difficulties in the acceptance by authorities of alternative methods that do not report data in CFU by authorities, and therefore by laboratories testing dairy products. Furthermore, a lack of demonstrated assay performance in a diverse range of dairy products routinely tested by the dairy industry can prevent the industry from investing time and money in a test system that may not prove compatible with their range of products when in-house verification studies are performed. Therefore, further evidence of assay performance in a broader range of dairy matrices could help the industry to make the change to alternative microbiological testing systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and recommendations"}, {"text": "It is also key that the dairy industry customer base is open to the adoption of rapid methods to replace the current traditional ISO cultural methods prescribed in product specifications.
