Each participant underwent the traditional 512 Hz tuning fork-based Rinne test, as well as a smartphone-based Rinne test by means of a single uncovered smartphone with a vibration application.

The smartphonebased Rinne test could correctly discriminate between patients with an air-bone gap \u2265 25 dB at 512 Hz from patients with a lower or no air-bone gap at 512 Hz. The smartphone-based Rinne could not evaluate two patients with a moderately severe/ severe sensorineural hearing loss due to their inability to detect the vibrations. Conclusion A smartphone-based Rinne test was validated for the detection of an air-bone gap \u2265 25 dB at 512 Hz in the clinical setting. The validity of patient-operated smartphone-based Rinne test awaits further study. Level of evidence 2B.",

The Rinne test is a bedside examination that compares the two thresholds, and it is used to detect a conductive hearing loss (CHL) [1] . It is traditionally performed by placing the vibrating tuning fork on the mastoid process until the subject cannot hear the sound due to vibration decay (BC threshold). The tuning fork is then held 3-4 cm adjacent to external auditory canal. If the subject hears the signal emitted from the vibrating fork it means the AC signal transmission is better than the BC, and thus the interpretation is Positive Rinne with presumed CHL [2] . In the case of CHL with a greater degree of loss, AC will be worse than BC, and the Rinne test is said to be negative (BC < AC). The degree of CHL needed to change the Rinne test result is frequency specific [3] , and it is more successfully performed with a 512 Hz tuning fork [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Several studies investigated parameters that can affect the accuracy of the Rinne test, such as, the tuning fork material [14] , the force applied by the tuning fork against the mastoid [15] , the object the tuning fork strikes to produce vibration [16] , and more. As a result, many standardizations of Rinne test performance are found in different guidelines [17, 18] .",

Pure tone audiometry subsequently became the gold standard for differentiating between the various types of HL [19] . Now the smartphone-based version of the Weber test has recently been validated [10] . It was also shown to reduce the time from onset of an idiopathic sudden SNHL to diagnosis [10] . Our current results demonstrate that a smartphone-based Rinne test is a legitimate option for the diagnosis of a CHL of various etiologies. The reversal of the Rinne result after the CHL condition was addressed supported its validity as a diagnostic tool for use by clinicians. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the traditional and smartphone-based Rinne tests was comparable, albeit when the latter was administered by a clinician in this investigation.",
