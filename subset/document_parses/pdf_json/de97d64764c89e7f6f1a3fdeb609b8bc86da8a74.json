Based on structural similarity with other \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3S) targets, we hypothesized that ACE2 may be affected by \u03b3S proteolytic activity. We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by \u03b3S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of \u03b3S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of \u03b3S does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking. OPEN 1",

S-protein binding to ACE2 triggers membrane fusion and viral entry, but only after S-protein priming by Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) 3, 4 , which also cleaves the ectodomain of ACE2 5 . ACE2 cleavage, or shedding, can additionally be induced by the disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) 6 , which was found to compete with TMPRSS2 5 . In this regard, there are conflicting reports of ADAM17-mediated shedding affecting SARS-CoV entry 5, 7 . Viral infection has also been shown to trigger ACE2 endocytosis 8 , leading to reduced cell surface expression of ACE2 9 . Intriguingly, ACE2 is seen as a \"double-edged sword\" 10 . While high expression of the receptor enables viral infection, some of the deleterious effects associated with COVID-19 are attributed to loss of ACE2-mediated cardiovascular protection, due to cell surface downregulation 11 . In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been great interest in novel therapeutics that modulate ACE2, either to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry 12 or to target the renin-angiotensin system imbalance associated with severe disease 11 . Ideally, novel ACE2-focused therapies should be able to disentangle these two faces of the receptor.",

I-CLiP proteases introduce a water molecule into the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer for peptide bond hydrolysis within the transmembrane domain. \u03b3S targets are typically singlepass, type I transmembrane proteins with large ectodomains and C-terminal intracellular domains (ICD). \u03b3S substrates first undergo ectodomain shedding at the cell surface, rendering a membrane-bound protein stub that is targeted by \u03b3S for intramembrane proteolysis. The released soluble ICD tends to be rapidly degraded by the proteasome, but in some cases, such as the Notch family of cell surface receptors 13 and the amyloid \u03b2 precursor protein (APP) 14 , the ICD has signaling activity. For example, Notch ICD binds a Mastermind/Rbpj complex to activate transcription of canonical Notch target genes 15 . But in addition to Notch and APP, dozens of other putative \u03b3S targets have been identified 16 , not determined by an amino acid consensus sequence, but rather specific transmembrane conformational structure and accessibility 17, 18 . Validation of novel \u03b3S targets is hindered by the lack of clear-cut common features and ectodomain shedding requirements.",

Consistent with other confirmed \u03b3S targets (i.e. APP 14 , Notch 13 and Jagged1 19 ), ACE2 has a large ectodomain that can be processed by a sheddase (ADAM17/TMPRSS2) 5,6 and a single transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A) . Based on this structural similarity, we hypothesized that after ectodomain shedding, the resultant protein (ACE2\u0394E) may represent a novel \u03b3S target. To test this hypothesis, we expressed ACE2 tagged at its C-terminus in 293 T cells, and triggered ectodomain shedding by either TMPRSS2 co-expression, or PMA-induced activation of endogenous sheddases 20 . In the presence of TMPRSS2, we observed a 15 kDa C-terminal ACE2 fragment which accumulated in the presence of a \u03b3S inhibitor (GSI), dibenzazepine (DBZ) (Fig. 1B) . PMA treatment rendered a 18 kDa C-terminal fragment, consistent with the expected size after ADAM17-mediated ACE2 cleavage 6 . Similar to TMPRSS2 co-expression, this longer form of ACE2\u0394E also accumulated in DBZ treated cells (Fig. 1C) . Intriguingly, we observed ACE2\u0394E accumulation even in unstimulated cells expressing ACE2 (Fig. 1B,C) , suggesting endogenous ectodomain shedding followed by \u03b3S cleavage is part of the normal turnover of ACE2. We also used a chemically distinct GSI (Compound E) (Fig. 1D) , that confirmed that ACE2\u0394E is targeted by \u03b3S.",

To confirm the physiologic relevance of \u03b3S-mediated ACE2 cleavage, we used two well-characterized ACE2-positive cell lines that allow SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, Caco-2 and VeroE6. Using an antibody that recognizes the C-terminal region of ACE2, we observed accumulation of endogenous ACE2\u0394E with GSI treatment in both cell lines ( Fig. 3A-C) . These data confirmed results from ectopic ACE2 expression, using endogenous ACE2 and TMPRSS2/ADAM17 (in Caco-2 cells) or ADAM17 alone (in VeroE6), leading to the expected ACE2\u0394E product of ADAM17-mediated cleavage. We next took advantage of this system to test whether longer ACE2\u0394E half-life or impaired production of ACE2-ICD may produce negative feedback on this pathway in these cells. This hypothesis was based on nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of the C-terminal fragment of the related protein, ACE 23, 24 . However, we did not observe nuclear ACE2 or differences in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 in DBZ-treated VeroE6 or Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3D,E) . These data render unlikely the possibility that ACE2-ICD mediates feedback inhibition on ACE2 gene expression. \u03b3S inhibition does not alter SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-mediated cell entry. As genetic or pharmacologic \u03b3S inhibition affected ACE2 cleavage and subcellular localization, we hypothesized that GSI may reduce To test this potential, we utilized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped with VSV and tested a wide range of DBZ concentrations (0.3 nM-1 \u00b5M). In comparison to a potent S-protein neutralizing antibody, used as a positive control 25 , DBZ did not affect SARS-CoV-2 S-protein mediated viral entry in VeroE6 or in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4) . These results indicate that although \u03b3S is necessary for ACE2 intracellular processing, blocking \u03b3S does not affect viral entry.",

            "text": "ACE2 has recently caught the attention of the research community because of its role as the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we have characterized ACE2 as a novel target of \u03b3S (Fig. 5) . Similar to other known targets [16] [17] [18] , ectodomain shedding prompts \u03b3S-mediated intramembrane cleavage to release soluble ACE2-ICD. Some ICDs (i.e. Notch) generated by \u03b3S are transcriptionally active, but a functional role of many others remains elusive 16 . \u03b3S has also been dubbed as the \"proteasome of the membrane\" 26 . Our finding that ACE2-ICD is rapidly cleared by proteasomal degradation suggests is consistent with the view that \u03b3S-mediated cleavage represents a way to dispose membrane proteins stubs. However, our data cannot as yet discard the hypothesis that ACE2-ICD might represent a novel biologically active peptide. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Previous reports indicate that ACE2 processing by cell membrane proteases such as ADAM17 or TMPRSS2 impacts SARS-CoV S-protein mediated cell entry 5, 7 . Our data is clear that pharmacologic inhibition of \u03b3S-mediated ACE2 cleavage does not, but cannot rule out the possibility that other compounds termed \"\u03b3S modulators\" (GSMs) 27 may behave differently. GSMs, developed primarily to differentially affect \u03b3S processing of so-called \"on-target\" (i.e. APP) as opposed to \"off-target\" (i.e. Notch) substrates, may in fact selectively increase \u03b3S processivity. In light of our finding that ACE2 is a novel \u03b3S target, GSMs are worth evaluating for www.nature.com/scientificreports/ biological activity against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. In addition, some groups have speculated that blocking Notch signaling with GSIs may ameliorate COVID-19 progression 28 . Notch signaling promotes M1 polarization of macrophages 29 , and also contributes to T-cell cytokine production 30 . Thus, despite our finding that GSI does not directly affect viral entry, potential effects to block Notch-induced hyperinflammation suggest compounds that have completed Ph2/3 clinical trials can potentially be repurposed for COVID-19.",

The next day, medium was removed and cells were infected with VSV-G pseudo-typed \u0394G-luciferase (G*\u0394G-luciferase, Kerafast) in DMEM at an MOI of 3 for 1 h before washing the cells with 1 \u00d7 DPBS three times. DMEM supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC) was added to the infected cells, and supernatant harvested the next day. To test DBZ inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, VeroE6 or Caco-2 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well. Pseudovirus were incubated the next day with serial dilutions of DBZ in triplicate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The mixture was added to cultured cells and incubated for an additional 24 h. An S-protein neutralizing antibody was used as control 25 . Luminescence was measured using a Britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer) (Suppl. Information).",
