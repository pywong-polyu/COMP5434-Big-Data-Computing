Drawing from a sample (N = 385) of adult permanent residents of Athens, Greece, the study examines the impact of COVID19 upon holiday intention. The chaordic systems are evaluated through the use of fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, whilst the study also used Necessary Condition Analysis for the calculation of the size effects of the examined conditions. The findings reveal two sufficient complex configurations leading to holiday intention: (i) holiday risks, and (ii) impact of COVID19. Based on the results, the article also offers a set of managerial implications. The contribution of the study is to both theoretical and methodological tourism domains.",

A pneumonia of unknown cause was first detected in Wuhan, China, and it was reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Country Office in China on 31 st December 2019 (WHO, 2020) . Actually, the first case of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province was traced back to 17 th November 2019, and the Chinese authorities identified at least 266 cases of Coronavirus (COVID19) before the end of the year (Ma, 2020) . In Europe, COVID19 was first detected on 27 th December 2019 in France (Roberts, 2020) , four days earlier than the first case was reported by WHO. Since then, many more European countries have begun to report confirmed cases of COVID19, whilst in the United States the first confirmed case was reported on 19th January (Holshue et al., 2020) . The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th January, whilst the name 'COVID19' for the new Coronavirus disease was announced by WHO on 11th February (WHO, 2020) . The scientific community has given the strain an interim name of 2019-nCoV, taking into account the year of discovery, its status as a 'novel' virus, and its family name (CoV) (Doyle, 2020) . On 11th March, WHO declared the novel COVID19 outbreak a global pandemic (Cucinotta & Vanelli, 2020) . Globally, by the end of the spring (31st May), more than 6.2 million people had been infected with COVID19, resulting in more than 370,000 fatalities, whilst approximately 2.8 million had recovered (Hopkins, 2020) .",

Concerning the aviation industry up until May 2020, estimates compared with figures for 2019 show an overall reduction in seats offered by airlines ranging from 32 to 59 percent, an overall reduction in passengers ranging from 1.8 million to 3.2 million, and an overall loss of gross operating revenues for airlines ranging from 240 to 420 billion USD (ICAO, 2020) . This has led several airlines, including South African Airways, Avianca Holdings, Air Mauritius, Virgin Australia, Miami Air International, BRA, Flybe, RavnAir, Air Deccan, and Trans States Airlines, to declare themselves bankrupt (Madureira, 2020) . In tourism for 2020 the estimated fall in international arrivals compared with 2019 figures is expected to reach 30 percent, with financial losses of 450 billion USD in international tourism receipts, almost a third of its global contribution (UNWTO, 2020b) . Accordingly, 75 million jobs are expected to be lost in 2020 from the tourism sector (WTTC, 2020). All these aspects illustrate a deep crisis, placing tourism in its darkest hour.",

A precondition of this is to regain the holiday intention of visitors. Tourism-related literature has examined a series of effects generated by disasters and crises. More specifically, several previous studies focused on crises and evaluated numerous issues such as business efficiency (Pearce II and Michael, 2006; Olthetena, Sougiannis, Travlos, & Zarkos, 2013) , productivity aspects (Mar-Molinero, Men\u00e9ndez-Plans, & Orgaz-Guerrero, 2017; Y\u00e9pez, 2017) , operational ability (Akrivos, Reklitis, & Theodoroyiani, 2014; Epstein, Shapiro, & G\u00f3mez, 2017) E-mail address: nikolaos.pappas@sunderland.ac.uk.

However, the literature is predominantly silent upon the examination of holiday intentions during crises, let alone an unprecedented crisis like COVID19.",

This study aims to examine the impact of COVID19 upon the holiday intention of the residents of Athens, people living in a country that has successfully managed to minimize the impact of the pandemic, but has been battling with an economic crisis for more than a decade. To do so, the research investigates the psychological impact of COVID19, the economic impact of the pandemic, the recession and COVID19, and the travel, destination and hospitality risks. The theoretical contribution of the study is a better understanding of the formulation of holiday intention during a COVID19 nationwide lockdown. Methodologically, its contribution is twofold. First, it examines the complexity of holiday intentions by using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, a method that has only recently been employed in the travel and tourism domain. Second, it progresses to a complementary analysis of the size effects of the examined conditions by using Necessary Condition Analysis, a new method in the service sector.",

These decisions were taken because of: the lessons leant from countries (e.g. Italy) that already had a substantial number of COVID19 fatalities; the shortage of intensive care units (less than 550 beds throughout the country) (Sarris, 2020) ; the extensive lack of medical and paramedical personnel; and the overall bad shape of the national health system (in the last decade 70,000 beds were lost and 359 hospital departments were closed) due to extensive budget cuts made over more than a decade to tackle the Greek economic crisis (Pigadas, 2020) . These early stage measures led to a very low number of fatalities (less than 200) during the first wave (spring 2020) of COVID19.",

It should also be noted that COVID19 had already devastated the Greek tourism and hospitality industry, a sector that contributes approximately 20 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Reuters, 2020) . According to the IMF (2020), COVID19 will cause Greece to face a 10 percent loss in GDP during 2020, and a 5.1 percent loss in 2021.",

The term 'chaos' refers to \"a class of dynamic behaviour of deterministic systems characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions, diverging but constrained trajectories that imply unpredictability, and complex organisation or structure\" (Schuldberg, 2011, p. 183) . Chaos theory was initially devised in 1963 (Lawrence, Feng, & Huang, 2003) , and has proved to be particularly useful when analysing complex systems (Mahmoudabadi, 2015) . The theory of complexity has developed from the theory of chaos, and is mainly employed for studies researching aspects that include complex characteristics. Complexity theory concerns the systems that include several interacting agents, and even if it is difficult to make predictions, these are structured systems and allow improvement (Zahra & Ryan, 2007) .",

Hock (1996) suggested the term 'chaordic' term in order to emphasise the character of chaotically-ordered entities and complex systems. It is derived from the amalgamation of the words chaos and order, and creates the technical term 'chaord' ( Van-Eijnatten, Putnik, & Sluga, 2007) . The main characteristic of a chaordic system is the dynamic and complex set of specific elemental connections that formulate a unified whole, whilst behaviourally it is at the same time unpredictable (chaos) even if it follows specific patterns (order) (Olmedo, 2011) . The main features of these systems are (Olmedo & Mateos, 2015) : (i) the impossibility of long-term planning; (ii) their constant change, and their potential to form new complex structures in a spontaneous and endogenous manner; and (iii) their substantial influence based upon unexpectedly dramatic changes. As a result, a chaordic system has long memory (long-range correlational involvement and chaotic oscillations included in time series and in a non-stationery nature (Lahmiri, 2017) ), self-organisation (systemically exhibiting emergent properties by internally organising behaviours/operations (Kauffman, Peterson, Samuelsson, & Troein, 2003) ), asymmetry (no statistical distribution, equivalence or equality with regard to operation, functions and behaviours (Waz & Waz, 2009) ), resilience (the system is able to handle the conditions occurred, recover, and react accordingly (Mycek et al., 2017) ), and it is sensitive when dealing with the initial conditions (the system has the ability to quickly diverge when the conditions slightly differ (Olmedo & Mateos, 2015) ).",

In this way, they can abruptly move from one state to another in a qualitative manner (Smith & Humphries, 2004) . During crises and disasters, there is a dramatic increase in the complexity aspects of a business environment (Coskun & Ozceylan, 2011) , hence, complexity theory is also linked to emergency management (Morakabati, Page, & Fletcher, 2017) , creating a need for the examination of the formulated chaordic system (Pappas, 2018) . At present, forecasting for a long term period of time is unlikely for chaotic systems, and substantial change may occur when it is not expected; hence, \"adaptiveness and flexibility are vital for the survival of organisations (Levy, 1994) .",

Concerning tourists, they are characterized by complex psychology, and their perspectives are difficult to quantify, calibrate, and sometimes justify (Zhai, Zhong, & Luo, 2019) .

The metrics of consistency and statistical hypotheses are not likely to be included when we employ outcome scores in order to evaluate the extent to which complex configurations are adequate (Wu, Yeh, Huan, & Woodside, 2014) . According to configurational theory, when considering factor arrangement, different outcomes may be generated from the same set of causal factors (Ordanini, Parasuraman, & Rubera, 2014) . This research examines the impact of COVID19 upon the holiday intention of Athenian adult permanent residents. Therefore, the presence or absence of a given condition (binary sets) affecting the holiday intention of the respondents was examined. Along with the socio-demographics of age and monthly income, the six examined attributes were: (i) the psychological impact of COVID19; (ii) the economic impact of the pandemic; (iii) the recession and COVID19; (iv) the travel risks; (v) the destination risks; and (vi) the hospitality risks. Taking into consideration previous research by Olya and Altinay (2016) and Pappas (2018) for the formulation of tenets, the study includes the following six: T1: A given attribute is able to determine different effects of COVID19 upon holiday intention in accordance with its configuration/interaction with other attributes. T2: Recipe principle: For the moment that two or more simple conditions formulate a complex configuration, a condition of outcome is able to have a high consistent score. T3: The interactions/configurations that are complex are able to influence the effect of COVID19 upon holiday intention. T4: Within different combinations the simple conditions of interactions/configurations are able to affect in a positive or negative manner the effect of COVID19 upon holiday intention. T5: Equifinality principle: A sufficient effect of COVID19 upon holiday intention cannot always be the result of a high score of outcome. T6: When there are high Y scores, a recipe that is considered given for the effect of COVID19 upon holiday intention is not relevant for all cases.",

From 23rd March until 4th May the whole country (including Athens) was in strict lockdown due to COVID19, therefore the research was based on telephone interviews and used structured questionnaires. More specifically, the participants were randomly contacted using the starting landline telephone code of 210 followed by seven more digits. Most Athenian landline telephone numbers follow this pattern. In order to reduce research bias, list-wise deletion was used (the entire record was excluded from the analysis) for partially completed interviews. When handling missing data, list-wise deletion is considered to be the least problematic method (Allison, 2001) .",

According to Dul (2020) , this method can be employed in a complementary manner in both parametric (i.e. regression) and non-parametric analysis (i.e. QCA). It is important to employ NCA because a necessary condition is considered a vital outcome factor, and without this condition the outcome will not occur (ERiM, 2020).",

This is because NCA was a complementary method used to evaluate the size effects of the examined conditions, and did not affect the generation, combination, and efficiency of complex configurations as they were generated by fsQCA. Table 5 presents the coverage of the three sufficient complex configurations, which is high (0.43556). Moreover, all eight of the simple conditions are present in at least one of the generated complex sufficient configurations, regardless of the fact that all solutions end up having the same outcome. This shows that each attribute has a contribution in a different way to the formulation of respondents' holiday intention related with the combination with the rest of the simple conditions. Therefore, the first tenet (T1) is confirmed. All three of the solutions include four attributes (more than two simple conditions are needed in order to create a complex configuration), and lead to the same outcome. Previous studies, such as Woodside (2014) and Pappas (2018) , highlight this finding, and subsequently confirm the second tenet (T2). As previously mentioned, fsQCA in not based on variables but cases, and their solutions deal with (Ordanini et al., 2014) : (i) an outcome concerning the combination of the examined antecedents; and (ii) the way these conditions are related within the specific combination. Therefore, each sufficient complex configuration is generated through the complexity that specific simple antecedents interact, affecting the final outcome (Olya & Altinay, 2016) . Thus the third tenet (T3) is confirmed. The inclusion or exclusion of specific attributes (contrarian case analysis) has shown that whether a simple condition is present or absent influences the effect upon the desired outcome, and in our case of COVID19 upon holiday intention. This actually confirms the fourth tenet (T4). As Woodside (2014 Woodside ( , p.2499 suggests, \"the occurrences of different paths usually do not occur with the same frequency among the set of paths\". The principle of equifinality shows that multiple paths (in our case three) are able to lead to the same outcome. Hence, the findings confirm the fifth tenet (T5). Finally, Table 5 highlights that the coverage of the generated solutions varies from 0.41382 to 0.46924. According to Olya and Altinay (2016) and Pappas (2018) , this finding indicates that no sufficient complex configuration applies in all cases. Each solution only partially covers the examined sample. On the other hand, the sum of solutions significantly covers the examined population of Athenians. This case relevance leads to confirmation of the last formulated tenet (T6).",

These two sufficient configurations meet the aim of the study by showcasing the effect of COVID19 upon the Athenian residents with regards to their holidays. The first sufficient complex configuration reveals that holiday risks (travel; destination; hospitality) affect the related COVID19 holiday intention of respondents. More specifically, high scores appear for age (f_a), travel risks (f_tr), destination risks (f_dr), and hospitality risks (f_hr). In this solution the socio-demographic of age seems to play an important role in the formulation of holiday intention. This can be explained by the fact that the older people are, the higher the proportion of fatalities from COVID19. More specifically, taking into consideration the USA, the country with most fatalities worldwide, amongst younger adults (aged 18 to 44) the share of deaths was lower than four percent, whilst for people over 75 years of age that share rocketed to almost 50 percent (Worldometer, 2020) . As a result, older people are likely to be much more worried about the risks of taking a holiday. With regards to COVID19, these aspects highlight the importance of age when destinations and tourism-related enterprises target specific market segments, and employ their crisis management communications. One more aspect that needs to be taken into consideration is the high susceptibility of tourism to risks and crises. Several past studies (indicatively please read Hajibaba, Gretzel, Leisch and Dolnicar (2015) and Pappas and Papatheodorou (2017) ) highlight the vulnerability of the industry to crises and disasters. This is because the sector is characterized by numerous interacting entities and activities critically vulnerable to crises (Cole, 2009) leading to an inherent non-linearity of the respective relationships, which prevents the effective coupling of causes and consequences (Olmedo & Mateos, 2015) . As a result, the current sufficient complex configuration confirms findings from previous studies concerning the effect of risks upon holiday intention, provides evidence of the importance of holiday risks related to COVID19, and highlights the crucial age factor with respect to tourism during the current pandemic.",

More specifically, this solution scores highly for age (f_a), income (f_i), psychological impact of COVID19 (f_pci), and the economic impact of COVID19 (f_cei). As a result, the study contributes by providing a connection of those aspects in terms of COVID19 impact to travel intention, providing the grounds to destinations and tourism-related enterprises to more effectively assess the business environment, and create sufficient pathways that can lead to the unforementioned travel intention. Once more, the sociodemographic of age in present, as in the first solution, this time alongside monthly income. The latter can be explained, since recent studies reveal that almost three quarters of Greeks (73 percent) perceive that the arrival of COVID19, the lockdown that followed, the devastation of the Greek tourist season that has already heavily affected tourism operations in the country, and a potential second outbreak from the autumn onwards have significantly affected their income (Financial Press, 2020) . Monthly income is not something that affects only Greece, considering that a third of the population of the G7 (the seven wealthiest economies in the world) share the same income perspectives (Enikonomia.gr, 2020), whilst it is estimated that worldwide COVID19 will lead between 420 and 580 million people into poverty (UNU, 2020). However, the connection between monthly income and the simple condition of COVID19 economic impact (f_cei), and subsequently with the psychological impact of the pandemic (f_pci) is justified, since the statements of the latter evaluate a holistic perspective by discussing everyday life, people's way of life, hygiene, and fear and anxiety issues. Therefore, the current sufficient complex configuration provides evidence for the extent of the impact of COVID19 and the respondents' holiday intention, and reveals a reluctance to take holidays at least for the foreseeable future. Hence, it can be presumed that the return from COVID19 to tourism normality is not likely to be as fast as that following crises and disasters the sector has faced in the past.",

It further progresses to a complementary analysis of the size effect of the examined conditions using NCA. After disregarding one solution based upon the NCA results, the findings reveal two sufficient complex configurations focusing on: (i) holiday risks, and (ii) the impact of COVID19. The chaordic systems affecting holiday intention as a result of COVID19 and identified by the research findings create a necessity for collaboration within the tourism industry that is more vital than ever. Safety comes first. Transportation companies (with special reference to the aviation industry) should create grounds for people to feel safe to travel again. These can include several initiatives such as the ad-hoc communication with customers concerning health and safety measures and advancements from travel companies, and relevant press releases focusing on the safety of the transport means (air; land; sea).This is always the case for travel, whether for business or leisure, but is even more relevant to holiday trips, since they are considered to be discretionary activities and are characterized by high elasticity . Safety also concerns destinations and hospitality firms. Social distancing is likely to last for a long time, since it is more than likely that there will not be a vaccine in 2021 (Lanese, 2020; Spinney, 2020) . Therefore, it is crucial that destinations adopt all the necessary precautionary measures to ensure the safety of, as well as a feeling of safety amongst, their visitors. Destination initiatives can include crisis management communications addressed to both, visitors and tour operators in order to promote the undertaken actions for making a safer environment, the fast destination adaptability to the new reality, the strengthening of the health system and infrastructure in the destination and overall in the country in reference, the progress of confirmed COVID19 cases and related fatalities, the undertaken measures to protect the locals and the visitors, and the reshaped quality levels (with special focus on hygiene aspects) of the provided tourist products and services. The same applies to hospitality firms, whilst pressure for much lower occupancy rates (hence lower profitability) is substantial for both accommodation and service providers. Maybe this is one of the most appropriate times to also start talking about international collaborations and international uniformity of safety measures throughout the components of tourism in order to minimize potential confusion and the subsequent fear and anxiety levels of holidaymakers.",

It is apparent from national and global forecasts, and supported by the findings of the current research, that a considerable number of people who were used to travelling for their holidays now consider it unlikely that they will be able to do so due to the widespread economic devastation COVID19 has created. This means that the value-for-money aspect is more crucial than at any other time. Travel, tourism and hospitality firms, along with destinations, need to offer much higher quality to their products and services with a parallel reduction in prices. The subsequent reduction in profits can be handled with various ways involving the financial flexibility of enterprises, the restructuring of operations, and collaborative activities with other destinations and firms, even with those that might have been perceived as competitors in the past. COVID19 has violently reshaped the global tourism scenery, rapidly passing from 'overtourism' to 'undertourism', and especially affecting tourism-dependent economies (Johnston, 2020; Tarlow, 2020) . Destinations and tourism-related enterprises do not have the 'luxury' they had in the past of depending for profitability on high volumes of tourists. Combined with the austerity in several countries (in our case Greece), it is more than certain that tourism has to face a substantial challenge to recover. Hence, international collaboration and support focusing on further economic development can strengthen tourism potential in national and international level. So as with COVID19 any collaboration cannot be fragmented in national borders.",

Several studies in the service sector (indicatively please read Ordanini et al., (2014) , Pappas (2019) , and Skarmeas et al., (2014) ) have already highlighted that linear analysis is not able to encapsulate the full spectrum of this complexity. However, travel, tourism and hospitality research is still heavily dependent on the reductionist linear (Newtonian) approach. As it is showcased by the findings (also supported by previous studies mentioned above), in an academic context the use of non-parametric analysis in travel, tourism and hospitality is able to provide a more holistic approach of the aspects under examination. Therefore, shifting the research focus on the examination of more complex aspects can further enhance our understanding of tourism-related phenomena and conditions. Especially during crisis periods where complexity substantially increases and several other crises may be triggered by the first (Pappas, 2018) (in our case the socio-economic crises initiated by the COVID19 health crisis), the identification of multiple pathways that can lead to the same outcome is of the utmost importance.",

First, this is the first time in the modern era that the travel, tourism and hospitality industries have faced such an extensive and devastating crisis. Therefore, much more research is necessary for a full understanding of the unprecedented conditions the world has to face, and tourism has to confront. This is strengthened by the fact that COVID19 first appeared in mid-November 2019, and within a very short time has violently managed to change the way we think, act, and react. This aspect is also strengthened by the perspective that the travel intentions of tourists may differ due to various reasons such as the preference of domestic or international travel, due to state/government restrictions, the knowledge of language and culture, the perception of feeling more safe near home etc. The second limitation derives from the environment of the current research. The examined population was interviewed during a period of strict lockdown , in the capital of a country (Athens, Greece) that has successfully managed to avoid (at least during the first wave of the pandemic) a health crisis, but is heavily dependent on tourism, and has battled for more than a decade with an economic crisis (the most severe on European soil [Pappas, 2018] ) whilst COVID19 has further deepened its already devastating socio-economic effects.
