Even 66 though travelling and socialising have therapeutic effects on mental health, all such activities 67 have come to a standstill. It was found that quarantined individuals grow more prone towards 68 developing a spectrum of mental illness, where mood swing, confusion, irritability, numbness, 69 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 stress, anger, anxiety, grief, depression, insomnia are evident (Brooks et al., 2020). Beyond the 70 social scenes, SARS-CoV-2 episodes have been fetching loads of stressors into the locked lives 71 of people, such as duration of the lockdown, loss of freedom, boredom and frustration, social 72 separation, inadequate lifestyle supplies, financial crisis, increased family issues and domestic 73 violence, anxiety related to local news as well as rising case numbers, stigma, fear of contracting 74 the disease, uncertainty about life, fear of losing closed ones and fear of death (thanatophobia). 75 Researchers have also reported serious case studies of stress disorders. During the 76 outbreak of SARS in 2003 outbreak, a study reported that quarantined individuals displayed 77 symptoms of frustration (58.5%), annoyance (54.3%), worry (40.2%), loneliness (38.5%), 78 helplessness (31.7%), anger (28.6%), Fear (22.4%), nervousness (18%) and sadness (18.1%) 79 whereas only 4.7% reported to be happy (Reynolds et al., 2008). Other investigation also 80 concluded that healthcare professionals, children, elderly and people with underlying mental 81 health issues were inevitably susceptible to psychological distress during the outbreak of any 82 epidemic. Health-care professionals remain at a high risk of physical and mental fragility. 83 Insufficient testing, inadequate treatment options, lack of enough Personal Protective 84 Equipments (PPEs), extensive workloads, agitated public reactions etc. are certain additional 85 stressors (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). Healthcare workers who were quarantined earlier after 86 having contact with SARS patients, developed symptoms of acute stress disorder, exhaustion, 87 anxiety, poor attentiveness, indecisiveness, worsening work performance and even consideration 88 of resignation. Moreover, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were persisted 3 89 years later (Brooks et al., 2020). Also, alcohol abuse or addiction symptoms were found to be 90 correlated with them even after 3 years (Wu et al., 2008). Later, another study conducted after 91 an epidemic breakout reported that mental health was much unstable among quarantined 92 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 157 All the authors contributed to conceptualization, data collection, writing and reviewing. 158 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8",

Ever since the World War II, the 3 world did not face any extreme challenge as threatening as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 (as named 4 by ICTV) possesses a high basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and has confirmed routes of droplet-5 borne air transmission and contagious spread from one to another human. Due to no prior 6 exposure to this pathogen (COVID 19 ) and unavailability of vaccines of the same, every 7 individual across the world has become vulnerably susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the 8 Worth Health Organisation (WHO) and healthcare authorities of all countries are relentlessly 9 emphasizing on practicing basic personal hygiene, the use of face-masks and personal protective 10 equipments (PPEs), social distancing and self-quarantine as protective and preventive measure 11 against COVID-19. This is supposedly to be professed and practiced until a vaccine arrives in the 12 market to provide herd-immunity. Besides, most of the countries have been under the stringent 13 internal/external movement restriction. Even though the practice of intermittent lockdown is 14 helping countries to flatten the epidemic curve, but its effect is not providing a satisfactory result 15 The gravity of the pandemic has taken toll on economy, transport industry, education, and 16 people's psychosomatic well-being.",

To validate social-distancing, a ban on frequent inter-state travel and entry of international 24 flights has been restricted. A report stated the slump in air traffic by 63% in the last week of 25 March, 2020; much less compared to the last year (BBC news report, 2020). In addition with the 26 halting transport any kind of mass gatherings have been restricted. Strict vigilance of military 27 and police force have been employed to keep control on the frivolous movement of the civilians 28 across the streets. Apart from extreme emergencies airway and terrestrial transportation have 29 been lessened in number. Certain sectors like grocery shops, banks, and pharmacies have been 30 exempted from remaining completely closed; the on-road transportation system i.e. from cart-31 pullers to the airline industries are undergoing a major economic crisis. An empirical research 32 conducted in Germany projected the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the transportation volume 33 and bulk-goods capacity in food material trade. The bulk-goods capacity tended to depend on the 34 total number of arising fresh infections per day rather than the length of pandemic (Loske, 2020).35 An upsurge in transportation of essential goods was found to be in proportion with the demand of 36 groceries. Talking in terms of transportation, freight segment has faced an ambiguous demand 37 pattern, whereas business or profit in public transport has shown a steady fall. United Nations 38 Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) reported intriguing data outcome regarding 39 transportation of several countries as following (UNECE, 2020). Early lockdown period have 40 witnessed a downfall in road fatality in countries such as France (-56%), Norway (-54%), 41 London (-36%), Ireland, Israel etc. compared to the month of 2019. Road traffic reduced 42 considerably. In New York City vehicle miles were approximately fifty million as per March 13 43 whereas it fell to ten million within April 13. Budapest confirmed 90% reduction of bus 44 commuters as well as 50% decline in traffic congestion. In Berlin, road traffic reduced by 40%. Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Norway faced a sharp drop in passenger vehicle registration in 47 March, 2020 as compared to the previous years. Nevertheless, collision rates have taken a 48 nosedive across the globe. The positive effect of 'sustainable mobility' which concerns 49 environmental preservation in form of cycling has however gained much priority as a mode of 50 transportation in several countries However, in order to keep up to earn revenue and sustain 51 transport sectors American airlines have transformed several passengers' flights to good-carriers 52 (TERI, 2020). Moreover, transportation system has well contributed during the challenging 53 period by converting passenger trains to mobile hospitals, offering free boarding to patients and 54 front-liners, delivering relief goods to red zones etc. 55 Scientifically suitable approaches that may lead to strong policy decisions on transportation 56 system in terms of COVID-19 pandemic are deficient. Hence, even after the lockdown is being 57 lifted up across countries, passenger restriction in public transport should be prioritized as well 58 as multiplying the number of passenger vehicles. Strict traffic control should be introduced 59 everywhere to avoid vehicle jam and mass gathering. Online booking facility for every public 60 medium of transport should be mandatory. Researchers of transport segment of different 61 countries should stress on the concept of monetary compensation for each transport industries 62 facing a massive loss throughout the pandemic. A recent investigation have projected a PASS 63 (Prepare/Protect/Provide, Avoid/Adjust, Shift/Share, Substitute/Stop) method typically designed 64 for transport policy making in the course of current and future threats (Zhang, 2020). individuals. Younger ones were vulnerable. Moreover, the married population had more mental 93 fitness than the single counterparts (Liu X et al., 2012). In the following years a study on 94 pandemic discovered that quarantined mothers with children needed mental health protection or 95 counselling services during or after the episode. Out of the total cases 16.7 % of children were 96 found to have acute stress disorder (16.7%), adjustment disorder (16.7%), grief (16.7%), and 97 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were reported to be 6.2%. PTSD scores were four 98 times higher among quarantined children (Sprang and Silman, 2013). 99 Research conducted in China on the onset of COVID-19 showed that Chinese 100 psychosomatic deterioration. Physical symptoms like muscle ache; coryza and dizziness were 101 directly related to heightened level of stress, anxiety and depression. Most of people displayed 102 hypochondriasis and apprehended becoming COVID patient. Also the very thought of infecting 103 their family members was found to be highly prevalent (Wang et al., 2020). Cases of dire panic 104 were reported (Roy et al., 2020). The most panic stricken section of population was youths, 105 females and co-morbid individuals (Varshney et al., 2020). Insufficient health care and 106 infrastructure for COVID-19 treatment created panic among the patients and their caretakers. 107(Paz et al., 2020). A study held in Japan also exposed higher rate of depressive and anxiety 108 symptoms among the economically weak, part time workers and unemployed population, and109 part-time or provisional workers (Ueda et al., 2020). Zhang, Yang and team found that more than 110 one-third of the Chinese population faced insomnia during this COVID-19 episode (Zhang & 111 Yang et al., 2020). Internal migrant workers who constituted to be one of the most vulnerable 112 sections of the society were found to develop serious mental distress (Choudhari, 2020) and 113 many were reported to commit suicide.Parenting stress also increased due to the online schooling in Japan (Hiraoka & Tomoda, 115 2020).

            "text": "The social distancing almost galvanized people mentally and brought sea change in121 behavioural pattern of individuals across the globe. According to the recent policy briefs by 122 United Nations, \"The mental health and wellbeing of whole societies have been severely 123 impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently\" (UNSDG, 2020). World 124 Health Organization is stressing upon #HealthyAtHome hash tag. For psychosocial well-being 125 biological, emotional, spiritual, social, mental and material aspects are extremely instrumental.126 Family and community networks exclusively play pivotal roles in the developmental process of a 127 human being. Even though virtual socialization is acting as a support system by so far, but to a 128 great extent it is mode of and faceless medium of communication. 129 New research methodologies and policy making in all distressed countries should focus on short 130 and strict lockdown at the hotspots, adequate and rapid supplies of basic needs to the homes 131 under lockdown, promoting trusted news-sources to cut down misinformation, enough 132 psychological services through e-care and telemedicine. Government bodies should support the 133 contribution of multidisciplinary mental health teams at national and state levels; provide 134 psycho-educational material and training in stress management with special reference to 135 pandemic stress; ensure infrastructure of alternative mental health services accessible to the 136 public. Risk of losing livelihoods after the period of lockdown is putting a 'macro-stress' on vulnerable populations. 'Work from home' opportunities should be increased to mitigate the 138 frustration after sudden change in work schedule and financial thoughts. Safe social services 139 systems are needed for providing surveillance and intervention following up the reports of 140 problems by vulnerable people (such as domestic violence or child abuse) in this period of 141 lockdown. At the individual level, intake of healthy meals and mood enhancing dietary 142 supplements should be augmented. Practice of mindfulness, meditation, exercise and breathing 143 exercises can switch off the fight or flight system. 144 However, in this present scenario of COVID-19 have put many nations into 145 bewilderment, especially the nations with high density population is somewhat facing problems 146 in disciplining people about certain nitty-gritty like the advice on use of masks, opting for a 147 hygienic lifestyle and professing cleanliness morale. They should brainwash every individual 148 about the severity and gravity of the pandemic so as to make people become more aware and 149 conscious. Nevertheless, it is of utmost and equal importance on the part of the government to 150 boost research counterparts, find out scientific and conducive ways to construct new policies for 151 the transportation industries as well as psychological wellbeing of citizens.",
