The disease transmission rates, the recovering rates and the fraction of individuals who wear masks are all time dependent in the model. We develop a progressive estimation of the disease transmission rates and the recovering rates based on the COVID-19 data published by John Hopkins University. We determine the fraction of individual who wear masks by a maximum likelihood estimation, which maximizes the transition probability of a stochastic susceptibleinfected-recovered model. The transition probability is numerically difficult to compute if the number of infected individuals is large. We develop an approximation for the transition probability based on central limit theorem and mean field approximation. We show through numerical study that our approximation works well. We develop a bond percolation analysis to predict the eventual fraction of population who are infected, assuming that parameters of the SIR model do not change anymore.",

            "text": "In December of 2019 a few patients of a new infectious respiratory disease were detected in Wuhan, China. This disease has been called coronavirus disease 2019 and the virus that causes COVID-19 has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern at the end of January 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020 . Since the outbreak, most countries have adopted various measures in an attempt to contain the pandemic. These measures include restriction of travelling, shutting down schools, restaurants and businesses, cancelling large gatherings such as concerts, sports and religious activities, and even city lockdowns where residents are not allowed to leave home unless emergencies. Clearly these measures seriously affect daily lives and are devastating to the economics. The purpose of this paper is to show that wearing facial masks is a simple and inexpensive measure to contain the spread of COVID- 19. In fact, we shall show that if a relatively small fraction of population wears facial masks, the disease can be contained.",

This ability is measured by a quantity called the outward mask filter efficiency of masks. Facial masks also protect their wearers from inhaling droplets or aerosols from a nearby cougher, if the cougher does not wear a mask. This ability is measured by a quantity called the inward mask filter efficiency of masks. Thus, facial masks can be particularly useful to confine the spreading of diseases that transmit through droplets or aerosols. However, the effect of wearing facial masks to the epidemic spreading has never been studied in a network level. In this paper we present an epidemic network study to justify this argument. Specifically, we propose a time dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with two types of individuals. Type 1 individuals wear a facial mask and type 2 individuals do not. A randomly selected individual from a population is a type 1 individual with probability p, and is of type 2 with probability 1 \u2212 p. There are four types of contacts between two individuals depending on whether the two individuals wear a facial mask or not. These four types of contacts have four different disease transmission rates. From the data published by John Hopkins University [5] we progressively estimate the time dependent disease transmission rates and the recovery rates of the SIR model.",

Specifically, we assume that the COVID-19 epidemic propagates in a social contact network according to an independent cascade model [6] , [7] . The social contact network in our study consists of tree connection of cliques of random sizes. We derive the transition probability of the number of infected individuals from one time slot to the next. We propose a maximum likelihood estimation of p that maximizes the transition probability. The transition probability is expressed in terms of binomial distributions. Parameters of the binomial distributions corresponding to real data published in [5] are typically very large. That makes the transition probability numerically difficult to compute. We propose an approximation of the transition probability based on central limit theorem and mean field approximation. Through numerical studies, we show that the approximation works well. We derive a percolation analysis of the maximum number of individuals that can eventually be infected. We incorporate the maximum likelihood estimation and the percolation analysis into the progressive estimation. That is, based on the data published by John Hopkins University, we progressively estimate the disease transmission rates and the recovery rates. We then find p from the maximum likelihood estimation. Finally, using percolation analysis, we predict the maximum number of individuals that can eventually be infected.",

            "text": "COVID-19 has attracted a lot of research work on epidemic networks. We now review some research work that is related to the use of facial masks. Li et al. [8] proposed a decision making process in a susceptible-exposed-symptomaticquarantined model. At each time, every susceptible individual chooses whether to wear a mask or not in the next time step, which depends on an evaluation of the potential costs and perceived risk of infection. Damette [9] conducted a panel econometric exercise to assess the dynamic impact of face mask use on both infected cases and fatalities at a global scale. A negative impact of mask wearing on fatality rates and on the COVID-19 number of infected cases was observed. Damette found that population density and pollution levels are significant determinants of heterogeneity regarding mask adoption across countries, while altruism, trust in government and demographics are not. In addition, the most effective way to increase mask use is through strict laws by governments. Betsch [10] examined nearly 7000 German participants and observed that implementing a mandatory policy increased actual compliance of wearing masks. Mask wearing correlated positively with other protective behaviours. They also observed that voluntary policy is far less effective, and mandatory policy is far more effective to curb transmission of airborne virus.",

The study was also simulation based. Wang et al. [14] and Zheng et al.

We first describe the social network model and then the probabilistic SIR model. It is well known that social networks possess a few important properties, such as significant clustering coefficients, power law degree distributions, short path lengths, positive degreedegree correlations, existence of community structures and etc. In this paper, we propose a social network model that possesses significant clustering coefficients and allow analysis of epidemic spreading at the same time. Our social network model is a tree connection of cliques of random sizes arranged in layers. Specifically, in layer zero, there is a clique consisting of a random number of fully connected vertices. Each vertex in a layer connects to k cliques of random sizes in the layer. We model dense clusters or households in social networks by cliques. Randomly connected cliques have been proposed to model social networks by Coupechoux et al. [16] and Trapman [17] . We illustrate a graphical example of this model in Figure  2 . Let K be the size of a generic clique. Assume that the probability mass function (pmf) of K is given, i.e.",

To determine the likelihood function, we propose a probabilistic version of the SIR model that spreads the disease in the social network model described in the last paragraph. This probabilistic SIR model is based on independent cascade models. Independent cascade models are popular not only in the study of epidemic spreading but also in the influence maximization problems of viral marketing [6] , [7] . In an independent cascade model, each infected node has exactly one opportunity to transmit the disease to its neighbors. Whether the transmissions are successful or not depend on independent events. In our model, we distinguish between nodes that have used their opportunity to transmit the disease from those who have not. A node is said to be infectious, if this node has not used its opportunity to transmit the disease to its neighbors. A node is said to be infected but not infectious, if it has used its opportunity to transmit the disease. Our model is a discrete time model. Let X t be the total number of currently infected individuals in period t. Let Y t be the number of individual who contract the disease in period t. In our model, we assume that a layer i vertex who contracts the disease in period t have ability to transmit the disease to their neighbors in layer i + 1 in period t + 1, and lose the ability in periods t + 2, t + 3, . . . and so on. Recall that we use cliques to model dense clustering such as households in a social network, Since householdbased transmission is typically much stronger than that outside households [18] , [19] , we assume that once a vertex in a clique becomes infected, all vertices in that clique are infected at once. In period t, there are Y t infectious individuals and X t \u2212 Y t infected individuals who can not transmit the disease to others. Those who are infected but cannot transmit the disease to others in period t can remain infected in subsequent periods or become recovered with probability \u03b3. A graphical illustration of the model is shown in Figure 3 . It is clear that this model is a discrete time Markov chain. We shall derive the transition probability",

An infected vertex can execute its opportunity in any one time slot during its infection period. In this paper, we assume that infected vertices execute their opportunities in the beginning of infection periods. We make this assumption so that the mathematical analysis of (13) is possible. In this paper we have not attempted to model the microscopic transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

Either (46) has exactly one root in interval [0, 1], or it has no root in this interval. If (46) has exactly one root in [0, 1], it is the smaller root (denoted by p ) of the two roots.

            "text": "We calculate the average distance between the two solutions for k c = 1 and k c = 3. The result is shown in Figure 10 . This shows that the approximation method works very well for k c = 1. The approximation error for k c = 3 is also acceptable. Next, we use the data published by John Hopkins University [5] to predict the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic using our model. In this study, we assume that K is deterministic and K = k c = 3. Due to large infection rates of some countries, we assume that k = E[Y ] = 150 in order to have \u03c6 22 \u2264 1. We choose \u03c4 = 5 days as the width of a time slot in the time dependent SIR model. We first execute Algorithm 1 on the number of infected and recovered individuals in mainland China. The time functions of \u03b2 22 (t) and p(t) are shown in Figure 11 . The maximum fraction of population who will be infected predicted at time t is also shown in the figure. The epidemic started from the People's Republic of China from January, 2020. The authority managed to contain the epidemic very well by the end of February. However, there are several significant events between January and August of 2020. In mid April, the Chinese authority revised the way that death toll is calculated [32] . In mid June, Beijing faced a second wave of infections [33] In mid July, there was a surge of infected number of individuals in Xinjiang [34] . At the end of July, there was a surge in Dalian [35] . From Figure 11 , we see that \u03b2 22 (t) is large initially in January, and is controlled to reach a small value by the end of February. The value of \u03b2 22 (t) again rises and drops before and after the events described above. From Figure 11 , note that p(t) also rises and decreases before and after the events. However, function p(t) lags behind function \u03b2 22 (t). This correlation has a nice interpretation. Rise in \u03b2 22 (t) usually manifests itself in the rise of infected number of individuals. As the population sees a rise in the infected number of individuals, more people wear masks to protect themselves. On the other hand, decreases of \u03b2 22 (t) result in less number of newly infected individuals. People typically see this as sign of a safe community. Thus, less people wear masks in public places. As \u03b2 22 (t) rises, the predicted size of giant component S(t) also increases. However, as p(t) catches up and rises, S(t) decreases. Notice that the time sequence \u03b2 22 (t) reflects a joint efforts of many measures to contain the epidemic. Wearing facial masks is a measure in the personal level. Shutting down schools, businesses, and keeping people at home is a measure in the government level. In this paper, we consider only the measure of wearing masks and ignore other measures. Thus, p(t) in Figure 11 may be higher than the actual fraction of population who wear masks, as it reflects a joint effect of many measures to contain the epidemic. Note that the value of k c can influence the value of p(t), \u03b2 22 (t) and the predicted size of giant components S(t). In Figure 12 we show the time function p(t) for k c = 3 and k c = 1. The more densely clustered people are, the larger k c is and the more infectious the disease is. From Figure 12 , we see that population react and more people wear masks if k c is large. Next we study the epidemics of six countries. They are the United States of America, India, France, Italy, South Korea and Japan. We execute Algorithm 1 to compute \u03b2 22 (t), p(t) and S(t). The time functions of \u03b2 22 (t), p(t) and S(t) for the six countries are shown in Figure 13 , Figure 14 and Figure 15 , respectively. We present p(t) and S(t) of the six countries in Figure 14 and Figure 15 . Since these functions fluctuate a lot, we use a built-in Matlab function to compute the polynomial regression of these functions in order to show a general trend. Note that India has a smaller infection rate \u03b2 22 (t) than that of the U.S.A. However, India has a much smaller predicted size of giant component than that of the U.S.A. This is because India has a very large recovery rate [36] , [37] . We also note that around July France has a \u03b2 22 (t) comparable with that of the US. However, France has a high predicted S(t) after August. It is worth noting that p(t) of France in mid August is not close to 1. By raising p(t), France may have a better control of the epidemics. Finally, we show the average value of p(t) for three western countries versus that of three Asian countries. The average value of p(t) of western countries and Asian countries rises nearly equally quickly in the beginning of March 2020. Asian countries had a better control of the epidemic. As a result, Asian people relaxed and p(t) was significantly lower in April and May 2020. The rise and drop of p(t) for Japan and South Korea in Figure 14 and Figure 16 during April and May 2020 seem to agree with the timing of some major outbreaks recorded in [38] , [39] .",

In this study, we set p = 0.4 and \u03c6 22 = 0.6. In each simulation, we randomly select a vertex and then randomly select two vertices that are distance i from the vertex for i = 1, 2, . . . , 5. These eleven individuals are infected at time zero. We simulate the independent cascade model until no new infection is observed. We repeat the simulation fifty times before we take an average. From Table V , we note that simulation results of real-life networks are consistently smaller than those obtained from (61). Note also that real-life social networks nearly always possess clustering and community structures, while the random network model that leads to (61) does not. Dense connections within a community are helpful to the spreading of the disease within the community [18] , [19] . However, community boundaries can hinder the spreading of the disease. ",

Based on the number of infected individuals and the number of recovered individuals published by J. H. University, we estimate the disease infection rates and recovery rates. We proposed a probabilistic version of the SIR model. We derived the transition probability of this random SIR model. By maximizing the transition probability, we estimate the most probable value of the fraction of population who wear masks. This transition probability numerically difficult to compute, if the states of model are large. Based on central limit theorem, we proposed an approximation. Through numerical and simulation study, we show that the approximation works well. Finally we carried out a percolation analysis to predict the eventual fraction of population who will be infected with the disease. We proposed a progressive analysis of the epidemics. Using results from the progressive analysis, we analyzed the epidemics of six countries.",

            "text": "which is negative. From the results above and the fact that the right side of (46) is positive, it follows that (46) must have two real roots. It also follows from the results above that R 0 (p) is monotonically decreasing and (46) can not have two roots in [0, 1]. Since R 0 (p) is decreasing for p \u2208 [0, 1], it follows that if (46) has exactly one root in [0, 1], the root is p . It is also quite clear that if (46) has a unique root in [0, 1], the root is the optimal solution of (42). Now we analyze cases, in which (46) does not have roots in [0, 1]. Since R 0 (p) is decreasing for p \u2208 [0, 1], it follows that either both roots of (46) are greater than 1, or p < 0 and the other root is greater than 1. We now analyze these two cases separately. We first note that we have treated R 0 as an independent variable in (42). Thus, the derivative f (R 0 ) is with respect to R 0 . In the two cases in which Eq. (46) has no roots in [0, 1], we have to treat the objective function in (42) as a function of p. Specifically, the derivative of the objective function with respect to p is d dpwhere f (R 0 ) is given in (43). We claim that in the first case the objective function of (42) is increasing for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, the optimal solution of (42) isp(t) = 1. We also claim that in the second case, the objective function of (42) is decreasing for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, the optimal solution of (42) isp(t) = 0. We now prove the two claims. From (43) and (68),where h(R 0 ) = y(t + 1) 2 \u2212 y(t) 2 R 2 0 \u2212 \u03bey(t)R 0 . Note that h is a quadratic and concave function of R 0 with h(0) = y(t + 1) 2 > 0. It is clear that equation h(R 0 ) = 0 has two real roots. Function h has a zero at R 0 = c, where c is the right side of (46), i.e. c = \u2212\u03be + \u03be 2 + 4y(t + 1) 2 2y(t) .If R 0 (1) < c < R 0 (0), equation h(R 0 ) = 0 has exactly one root in the closed interval [0, 1]. This root is R 0 = c. If c < R 0 (1), both roots of (46) are greater than 1. This corresponds to the first case. If c > R 0 (0), then p < 0 and the other root is greater than 1. This corresponds to the second case. In the first case,for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. From (69), it follows that df (R 0 (p))/dp > 0, since R 0 (p) < 0 for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. This proves the first claim.In the second case, R 0 (p) < c for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, h(R 0 (p)) > h(c) = 0 for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. From (69), it follows that df (R 0 (p))/dp < 0. This proves the second claim.",
