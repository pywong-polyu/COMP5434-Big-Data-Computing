The study published in this issue by Moreno-Torres et al.

Among 1594 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 135 (8.5%) experienced bacterial infectious events, distributed as follows: urinary tract infections (32.6%), bacteremia (31.9%), pneumonia (31.8%), intra-abdominal infections (6.7%) and skin and soft tissue infections (6.7%). Independent predictors of bacterial infections were older age, neurological disease, prior immunosuppression, and admission to intensive care units (ICU).",

However, in multivariate analysis, older age, prior neurological or kidney disease, immunosuppression and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were associated with increased mortality (p < 0.05), while bacterial infections were not. On the other hand, the use of steroids or steroids plus tocilizumab did not confer a higher risk of bacterial infections while increased survival rates. In summary, the authors concluded that baseline COVID-19 severity rather than incident bacterial infections contributed to mortality. Thus, rather than considering empiric antibiotic therapy, the use of steroids or steroids plus tocilizumab might improve survival in this population.",

The first extends for 7-10 days and results from viral replication in the upper respiratory tract alongside with influenza-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, headache and myalgia. The second phase results from the host immune response mostly in the lungs around 10-14 days later [2] . The presence of lung interstitial infiltrates in image testing at this stage is very common. The severity of hypoxemia reflects the extent of the alveolar inflammatory reaction. In older individuals, the immune response is more prone to be dysfunctional, accompanied by a cytokine release syndrome ('cytokine storm') that can be life-threatening.",

Retrospective data from several cohorts estimate the incidence of bacterial superinfections between 5 and 27% or 13.5-44% in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission [4] . These studies concur to highlight that respiratory and urinary infections are the most frequent bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 patients. Arguably, admission to ICU is associated with other, more complex infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream or urinary tract infections [5] . Furthermore, nosocomial infections tend to be associated with more resistant bacterial strains, including C. difficile [6] , requiring the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which pose additional challenges. Outside ICUs, the use of empiric antibiotic therapy has not proven any benefit on SARS-CoV-2 outcomes [7] .",

This is not only the result from respiratory failure but from the need to require invasive ventilation, with the added risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia and other nosocomial infections [10] . Although the use of monoclonal antibodies, such as tocilizumab, has been associated with reduced mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, these agents may increase the rate of bacterial superinfections [11] .
