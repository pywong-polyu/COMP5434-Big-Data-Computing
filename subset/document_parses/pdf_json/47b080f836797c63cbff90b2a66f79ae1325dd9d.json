These individuals, often called superspreaders, transmit the virus to an unexpectedly large number of people. Further, a small number of superspreading places (SSPs) where this occurred account for a large number of COVID-19 transmissions. In this study, we propose a spatial network framework for identifying the SSPs that disproportionately spread COVID-19. Using individual-level activity data of the confirmed cases in Hong Kong, we first identify the high-risk places in the first four COVID-19 waves using the space-time kernel density method (STKDE). Then, we identify the SSPs among these high-risk places by constructing spatial networks that integrate the flow intensity of the confirmed cases. We also examine what built-environment and socio-demographic features would make a high-risk place to more likely become an SSP in different waves of COVID-19 by using regression models. The results indicate that some places had very high transmission risk and suffered from repeated COVID-19 outbreaks over the four waves, and some of these highrisk places were SSPs where most (about 80%) of the COVID-19 transmission occurred due to their intense spatial interactions with other places. Further, we find that high-risk places with dense urban renewal buildings and high median monthly household rent-to-income ratio have higher odds of being SSPs. The results also imply that the associations between built-environment and socio-demographic features with the high-risk places and SSPs are dynamic over time. The implications for better policymaking during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.",

In the early stage of the pandemic when limited pharmaceutical and vaccine options for treatment and prevention of the disease were available, certain non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing and stay-at-home orders) were considered effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 (Gao et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020; Yabe et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021) . A common assumption underlying non-pharmaceutical interventions is that people's mobility can be reduced by these control measures and thus the spread of the virus via face-to-face contact can be mitigated.",

            "text": "As previous studies have found, the transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly through people's face-to-face interactions in their daily life (especially via respiratory droplets released by infected persons when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe heavily) (Huang and Kwan, 2021) . Further, most people travel to different places in their daily life for various activities (Kwan, 2012) , and people's daily mobility outside their homes may not be reduced since they still have to obtain groceries, medicines, essential services, or go to work during a pandemic (Huang et al., 2020) . Thus, people's daily mobility is also shaped by various built-environment and socio-demographic features, which may in turn render some places more risky than others (Hutch et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2020) . For instance, using contact tracing data collected in Hong Kong, Huang et al. (2020) , Kan et al. (2021a, b) , Kwok et al. (2021) , and Yip et al. (2021) found that certain socio-demographic features (e.g., population density, household income, workplace location, and occupation) and built-environment features (e.g., green space, sky view, building density and height, transport nodal accessibility, land use configuration, and street length) significantly affected the spatial patterns of COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong. Similarly, the same kind of association between built-environment and socio-demographic features with COVID-19 transmission risk has been observed in European countries (Mogi et al., 2021) , the U.S. (Raifman and Raifman, 2020; Kim and Kwan, 2021; Huang et al., 2021a) , and England (Lee et al., 2021a) . Therefore, there is strong evidence from different countries that built-environment and socio-demographic features are contributing factors of COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, studies have observed the existence of spatial nonstationarity in the associations between environmental features and COVID-19 transmission (Kwan, 2021) : the associations between environmental features and COVID-19 transmission could change over space.",

            "text": "Although these studies provide a useful foundation for understanding what environmental features would affect the transmission of COVID-19, their conclusions might be misleading due to temporal nonstationarity (Kwan, 2012 (Kwan, , 2021 . The temporal nonstationarity in health-environment associations means that those associations may change over time. For instance, using data collected from the United States, Hong Kong, and England, studies have found that controlling the pandemic via restricting people's mobility may be effective only for a short period and for certain social groups (Kim and Kwan 2021; Lee et al., 2021a, b) . Specifically, people's mobility hardly declined after the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., after June 2020 in the U.S.) despite social distancing measures were still in effect, and poor people experienced a slower decline in mobility in the early stage of the pandemic. Thus, the associations between environmental features and COVID-19 transmission may be different among various waves of COVID-19. In other words, there may be temporal nonstationarity in such associations. Our knowledge about the temporal nonstationarity in the associations between environmental features and COVID-19 transmission is still highly limited to date. It is thus important to explore the temporal nonstationarity in these associations across different waves of COVID-19. The contribution of such analysis is two-fold. On one hand, the new knowledge generated can inform the development and enhance the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions by targeting specific high-risk places or venues in specific periods. On the other hand, certain features of the environment can be identified and dynamically managed to reduce risky behaviors and thus reduce the transmission of Further, studies have found that superspreading events that occurred at some high-risk places played an important role in driving the transmission of COVID-19: most infections are transmitted by a few individuals at a few high-risk places (e.g., bars or other social gathering venues). These individuals are often called superspreaders, who transmit the virus to an unexpectedly large number of people. For instance, Adam et al. (2020) reported that 80% of COVID-19 cases were transmitted by 19% of the infected persons at some high-risk places during the first wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Moreover, Chang et al. (2021) concluded that a small number of superspreading places (SSPs) account for a large number of COVID-19 transmissions in the U.S. Thus, in this study, we conceptualize a high-risk place as a place or venue with a high likelihood of COVID-19 transmission through the frequent visits of infected persons. Further, a high-risk place may evolve into a superspreading place (SSP) due to its intense spatial interactions with other places, which means that people who are infected at an SSP frequently visit certain places and thus significantly increase the COVID-19 risk of these places. Hence, in this framework, an SSP is a high-risk place with a high ability to spread the disease to many other places. Note that SSPs not only are risky places but also play a pivotal role in spreading the disease due to their superspreading characteristic.",

In past studies, the rich-club coefficient was used to assess the extent to which a few powerful nodes (i.e., nodes with high degree and strength) dominate the structure of a network. These powerful nodes will not only form a cohesive cluster among themselves but also maintain their connections with the peripheral nodes (Opsahl et al., 2008) . Thus, in the case of COVID-19, the SSPs can be identified using the spatial network framework: the few powerful nodes can be regarded as SSPs. For instance, using daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapor-eChin and Bouffanais (2020) identified the SSPs based on the degree and strength of the spatial network. The study also indicated that a high-risk place may further evolve into an SSP because of intense spatial interactions with other communities (e.g., busy bus interchanges).",

The city is well developed with its built environment characterized by compactivity and connectivity (Kwok et al., 2021) . Specifically, Hong Kong follows the pattern of high-rise and high-density development due to limited land resources, where more than 90% of the people are serviced by the public transport system (Transport Department of Hong Kong, 2020; Yip et al., 2021) .

The government implemented these measures at the outset of the pandemic and they were quite effective during the first and second waves. Then, the measures were relaxed in early June of 2020, which led to the third wave of the outbreak. Thus, the government tightened the measures from the start of the third wave up to the end of the fourth wave.

We first obtained public transport network data, including data on the Mass Transit Railway (MTR), bus, and ferry services, from the Hong Kong Transport Department. Then, the nodal accessibility of the transport nodes in the public transport system was estimated based on the connectivity matrix of the transport network. The nodal accessibility of each node represents how well the node (i.e., an MTR, bus, or ferry station) is connected with other nodes in the public transport network. Note that we only consider public transport in the study since over 90% of the trips in Hong Kong are made by public transport (Transport Department of Hong Kong, 2020). A building density layer was derived from a building polygon dataset at the 1:1000 scale that the Lands Department provided, and these data were rasterized and resampled to a grid structure with a 100-m spatial resolution. Building density represents the percentage of the area in each 100m \u00d7 100m grid cell occupied by buildings and measures the extent of crowdedness due to the number of buildings within a given area (Fig. 2a) . A Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer was derived from SPOT-7 Satellite images (2017) with a spatial resolution of 6m \u00d7 6m (Fig. 2b) . A land-use dataset was compiled by the Hong Kong Planning Department in 2018, which includes 27 land-use types and with a spatial resolution of 10m \u00d7 10m (Fig. 2c) . A restaurant dataset was derived from the Openrice website (https://www.openrice.com/), which is the most popular dining guide to help people find restaurants and bars in Hong Kong. The dataset includes various types of social gathering venues (i.e., restaurants and bars) with location information (i.e., latitude and longitude) (Fig. 3a) . A markets dataset was provided by the Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. This dataset includes public markets or cooked food markets with location information (i.e., latitude and longitude) (Fig. 3b ). An urban renewal dataset was provided by the Hong Kong Urban Renewal Authority (URA). This dataset includes completed URA redevelopment projects with location information (Fig. 3b) .

K s and K t are the spatial and temporal Epanechnikov kernel function, which is a common method used in ArcGIS (Nakaya and Yano, 2010) . Note that the selection of spatial and temporal bandwidth parameters (i.e., h s and h t ) are critical to STKDE. Thus, we use a space-time Ripley's K function, which can detect the magnitude of clustering at different spatial and temporal bandwidths, to calibrate the optimal spatial and temporal bandwidth parameters (Delmelle et al., 2011; Hohl et al., 2016) . In the study, we found that clustering patterns become stronger with increasing spatial bandwidth and decreasing temporal bandwidth. Further, the strongest clustering was found at h s = 1000m, and h t = 10 days. Note that small spatial and temporal bandwidth parameters will generally result in very spiky clusters, while larger parameters may result in oversmoothing (Delmelle et al., 2014) . To strike a balance between these two extremes (i.e., the detected clusters being too spiky or oversmoothed), we chose the bandwidth parameters h s = 600m and h t = 7 days, which corresponds to medium magnitude clustering. Although it would be ideal to create more spatiotemporally detailed surfaces, the spatial and temporal resolutions in the study are 100m \u00d7 100m and 1 day because of limitations in the data and computing resources. Further, the high-risk clusters are identified from the density estimates using the top 5% threshold. Finally, to identify high-risk places, we project the detected space-time clusters onto the continuous 2-D (i.e., longitude and latitude) spatial surface of the study area. Thus, the spatial units used in the study is the 100m \u00d7 100m cells (used in the STKDE) on this continuous 2-D surface.",

To infer the movements of each confirmed case among the high-risk places, we first perform a spatial join analysis between the visit records of each confirmed case and the high-risk places. Note that the high-risk places are generated by using the visit records of the confirmed cases. Hence, 83% of the visit records of the confirmed cases are located in the high-risk places after the spatial join analysis. Thus, each confirmed case's visit records can be denoted as a tuple list of T = {(s 1 , d 1 ), (s 2 , d 1 ), \u2026, (s n , d m )}, where s i is a high-risk place that a confirmed case visited on day d i . Then, we derive the movement chains of each confirmed case among the high-risk places as S = (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 \u2026s n ), where s i means that the confirmed case has visited high-risk place i, and the tuple (s i ,s i+1 ) represent the movement between high-risk place i and high-risk place i + 1. Last, we extract the high-risk place movement chains for all confirmed cases, and the matrix of movements among high-risk places is represented as M = (s i , s j , w), where s i and s j are the high-risk places i and j, and w is the intensity of flows between s i and s j .",

Previous studies have found that transport nodal accessibility, green space, land-used diversity, population density, and the density of buildings, residential areas, public spaces, restaurants, markets, and workplaces, as well as the occupation and household income of the population in different areas can significantly affect the first to third waves of COVID-19 transmission in Hong Kong (Huang et al., 2020; Kan et al., 2021a, b; Kwok et al., 2021; Yip et al., 2021) . However, they did not examine how the associations between those features and SSPs.

We first create three spatial networks for the four waves (see Fig. 7 ): the high-risk places are regarded as nodes, and the intensity of interaction (i.e., the flow of COVID-19 confirmed cases) between nodes are regarded as weighted links. Then, we used the degree, strength and rich-club coefficients to identify the SSPs in the spatial networks of the four COVID-19 waves. Note that the degree of a node in a network refers to the number of connections to other nodes. The strength of a node in a network is the sum of its weights. Fig. 8 presents the statistical results of the degree and strength in the three spatial networks. As Fig. 8a and b shows, both the degree and strength of the three spatial networks can be well fitted to the exponential function. In addition, we found that the nodes with a high degree (i.e., d \u2265 6 for the first and second waves, d \u2265 8 for the third wave, and d \u2265 10 for the fourth wave) accounted for only a small proportion of all the nodes: 21%, 22% and 28% for the first and second waves, the third wave and fourth wave, which indicates that relatively few of the highrisk places have high spatial interaction with other places. The nodes with high strength (i.e., s \u2265 11 for the first and second waves, s \u2265 14 for the third wave, and s \u2265 60 for the fourth wave) also accounted for a small proportion of all the nodes: 24%, 22% and 23% for the first and second waves, the third wave and fourth wave, which means that most of the superspreading events occurred in a few high-risk places in Hong Kong over the four waves. These results imply that most of the superspreading events happened at a few of the high-risk places over the four waves, where individuals infected in those superspreading events further infect others in other places through their daily mobility.",

We find that the relationships between the degree and the strength of the spatial networks over the four waves can be fitted to a linear function, which indicates that the spatial interactions between the COVID-19 cases of the high-risk places increase linearly with their degree. The estimated coefficient of the first and second waves is 4.2, which is larger than that of the third wave (i.e., 2.9) but smaller than that of the fourth wave (i.e., 16.3). The result suggests that the COVID-19 cases are more concentrated in a few of the high-risk places in the third wave than in the first and second waves and the fourth wave. In other words, although the number of confirmed cases in the third wave is larger than those of the first and second waves, the increasing cases are more related to the superspreading events in a few of the high-risk places. Further, the fourth wave has the largest estimated linear coefficient (i.e., 16.3), which indicates that the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the fourth wave have higher mobility than the first to third waves, despite the number of high-risk places in the fourth wave is similar to the third wave. These results imply that a few high-risk places dominated the COVID-19 transmission process in Hong Kong as the number of confirmed cases increased.",

The result confirms the existence of an obvious rich-club effect in the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Fig. 9a suggests that the degree d \u2265 6 is an important elbow point (i.e., the degree of nodes change rapidly when d \u2265 6) for the first and second waves, while d \u2265 8 and d \u2265 10 are important for the third and fourth waves. Fig. 9b shows that when s \u2265 11 is important for the first and second waves, while s \u2265 14 and s \u2265 60 are important for the third and fourth waves. Thus, we identify the SSPs over the four waves according to the results.

In the third wave, twenty (or 21%) of the 95 highrisk places are identified as SSPs. In the fourth wave, twenty-five (26%) of the 94 high-risk places are identified as SSPs. Moreover, 75%, 73% and 85% confirmed cases had visited the SSPs in the first and second waves, the third wave, and the fourth wave. The results indicate that most of COVID-19 confirmed cases were infected in a few SSPs, and then the confirmed cases further spread COVID-19 to other places through their daily mobility across the city. The results imply that the spatial distribution of SSPs may be similar in different waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong (e.g., the spatial distribution of SSPs in the third and fourth waves). One possible explanation is that some high-risk places might be the initial SSPs in different COVID-19 waves in Hong Kong (e.g., Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui and Sham Shui Po). These initial SSPs played a pivotal role in spreading COVID-19 since the disease would spread from the initial SSPs to other places due to people's daily mobility. Note that people's mobility hardly declined after the early stage of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Further, the spatial distribution of people's daily mobility in a city tends to be quite regular over a certain period (e.g., hours, days, and weeks) (Sevtsuk and Ratti, 2010; Huang et al., 2019) . Thus, people's regular daily mobility would further shape the similar spatial distribution of high-risk places and SSPs in different waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.",

Specifically, the density of renewed buildings and the median monthly household rent-to-income ratio significantly increase the likelihood of COVID-19 superspreading events at a high-risk place, from which COVID-19 can then spread to other places. Thus, urban renewal areas with a high median monthly household rent-to-income ratio have a higher likelihood of being SSPs than other high-risk places in Hong Kong. One of the reasons for this is that there are many old apartment buildings (or tenements) in the urban renewal areas, and most of them are rented by people who have a low income. Thus, these old buildings are potential hotbeds of COVID-19 transmission because of their cramped quarters, faulty piping, and poor ventilation (Ho et al., 2012) . Further, those areas are also one of the most diverse (e.g., diverse races and nationalities) and densely packed neighborhoods known for their high concentrations of subdivided flats or apartments where the residents are among the poorest people in Hong Kong (The New York Times, 2021) .",

Further, compared to the first and second waves, the third and fourth waves have similar patterns of associations between built-environment and sociodemographic features with SSPs. For example, nodal accessibility, land-use diversity, and Workplace 2 (i.e., the percentage of the working population in high-risk places with workplace in Kowloon) can significantly increase the odds of being an SSP in the third or fourth waves, while they do not have that association with SSPs in the first and second waves. One of the reasons for this is that people's mobility hardly declined after the first and second waves of COVID-19 (e.g., after June 2020) in Hong Kong, despite social distancing measures were still in effect (Lee et al., 2021b) . Thus, the associations between environmental features and COVID-19 transmission change over different waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. These results imply that the associations between built-environment and socio-demographic features with the high-risk places and SSPs are dynamic over space and time. Specifically, those associations may change under different non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the transmission risk of COVID-19 in different places may increase or decrease over time (Kwan, 2021) .",

Then, we reconstruct the spatial movements of the confirmed cases among the high-risk places and create spatial networks by representing the high-risk places as nodes and the movement flows of the COVID-19 confirmed cases between nodes as weighted links. Spatial network properties (i.e., degree and strength) and the rich-club coefficient are used to identify the SSPs. Lastly, the associations between various built-environment and socio-demographic features with the high-risk places and SSPs are examined using regression models. The main findings and implications of the study are summarized as follows.",

The study also provides strong evidence that temporal nonstationarity exists in research on the environmental determinants of COVID-19 transmission. This corroborates the findings in other studies that the spatial distributions of COVID-19 are different between the first and second waves in other regions of the world, and thus the associations between built-environment and socio-demographic features with COVID-19 transmission could be different between different COVID-19 waves (Golinelli et al., 2021; Mar\u00ed-Dell'Olmo et al., 2021; Shim et al., 2021) . Our results based on the data of all four waves further reveal that the spatial distributions of COVID-19 in the third and fourth waves are similar in Hong Kong. One of the reasons for this is that people's mobility hardly declined after the early stage of COVID-19 (e.g., after June 2020) despite social distancing measures were still in effect. This led to repeated COVID-19 outbreaks in some of the high-risk places in the third and fourth waves.

First, our results reveal that around 80% of COVID-19 confirmed cases visited a few specific places (e.g., Wan Chai, Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Wong Tai Sin and Kwun Tong) in their daily life, and those places were the high-risk places that experienced repeated COVID-19 outbreaks. Specifically, these high-risk places have intense spatial interactions with other communities, which render them to evolve into SSPs through spreading the disease to many other places. Our findings thus suggest that policymakers should put more resources to target these high-risk places to improve the ability to control and prevent COVID-19 outbreaks (e.g., contact tracing, testing and vaccination).",

Specifically, some social groups may be doubly disadvantaged if they live in these areas. For instance, people with disadvantage socioeconomic status (e.g., unemployed, low income or a high median monthly household rent-to-income ratio) do not have many options regarding which trips to make or forego. Hence, they may have to expose to high-risk environments even if there are COVID-19 outbreaks in their communities. Moreover, they may still expose to high-risk environments even if they can stay at home since their old and dilapidated apartment buildings are potential hotbeds of COVID-19 transmission (Morawska et al., 2020; Nature, 2021) . Thus, our findings suggest that policymakers should be aware that certain social groups in high-risk places may be doubly disadvantaged when formulating measures to control the transmission of COVID-19.",

However, studies on vulnerable populations have concentrated on people's socioeconomic status and demographic factors (Tate, 2013; Oulahen et al., 2015) . Our findings indicate that people may be doubly disadvantaged due to their residential environments (e.g., old and subdivided apartments in urban renewal areas with high COVID-19 transmission risk) and socio-demographic features (e.g., unemployed, low income or high median monthly household rent-to-income ratio).

For instance, a comparative analysis of SSPs across the multiple waves of COVID-19 in different cities (e.g., Seoul, London, New York, Tokyo, and so on) could be conducted if similar data are available in these cities. Thus, future studies would reveal more systematic urban social inequity (e.g., race, gender, children, the poor, the aging people) due to the multiple waves of COVID-19 across the world if comparative studies among different cities could be conducted. Finally, the results of STKDE used in the study are determined by the sizes of the spatial and temporal bandwidths. Thus, the results of STKDE may be different if the sizes of the bandwidths are changed. Although this study adopts the well-known optimal bandwidth selection methods (i.e., space-time Ripley's K function) for the STKDE, further investigation is necessary to examine the impact of bandwidth size on STKDE results.",
