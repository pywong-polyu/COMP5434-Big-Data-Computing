For example, the World Health Organization recommends a 14-day quarantine of exposed individuals to mitigate onward transmission from COVID-19 cases who have extended incubation periods. 12, 13 However, travellers are typically far less likely to have been infected than traced contacts; if disease prevalence in their origin country is not substantially elevated in comparison to their destination, then their risk of transmitting is presumably equivalent to residents of the destination country who are following the same country-specific public health precautions.

As community transmission became established in many nations, studies have suggested that the benefit of strict border closures in mitigating the transmission of disease from travellers diminished. Research for community settings has shown that testing later during quarantine, rather than upon entry into quarantine, can substantially shorten the duration of quarantine needed to reduce post-quarantine transmission. In particular for international air travellers, a 14day quarantine can effectively be shortened to five or seven days. The number of infectious COVID-19 cases that escape from these quarantines depends on the prevalence of disease in the country from which travel is originating as well as the travel volume into the country.",

No prior study has evaluated the appropriate duration of quarantine necessary to prevent any rise in infection rates per capita in the destination countries as a result of travel. By accounting for prevalence, daily incidence, vaccine coverage, immunity, age demographics, and travel flow between countries, we quantified the contribution of travel towards imminent infections in the destination country under different quarantine and testing strategies. For travel between 26 European countries, our results for the pandemic situation observed on November 21, 2021 demonstrate that there are often less burdensome quarantine and testing strategies that can serve as effective alternatives to strict border closure. These estimated sufficient quarantine durations are especially dependent on COVID-19 prevalence and immunity within the two countries. We also found that asymmetry in the travel flow, just not the volume of travel flow, can also influence the estimated sufficient quarantine durations. Using data on variants of concern, including Omicron, we found that the adequacy of a border control strategy to limit variant spread depends strongly on the geographical distribution of the variant. While our results pertain to European countries, we also provide an interactive spreadsheet that can be used to determine appropriate quarantine durations between any two countries. Moreover, our framework can also be applied at any spatial or population scale within which movement restrictions could feasibly be implemented.",

Therefore, knowledge of the potential suppressive effects of travel quarantine and testing on prevalence of known VOCs is important to limiting the resurgence of the disease, and should be considered in the specification of country-specific and individualised travel quarantine strategies.",

To quantify the minimum sufficient duration of travel quarantine among each origin-destination pair of 26 countries in Europe, we incorporate the travel flow between countries and country-specific age structure, while accounting for natural immunity, vaccine coverage and disease burden observed on November 21, 2021 across Europe.

When considering travel between countries, we assume long-term stays such that prevalence in travellers rises to the prevalence in the country visited by the time of return. The assumption of long-term stays instead of short-term stays simplifies the calculations of imminent infections when allowing travel between two countries, and provides a conservative estimate of the minimum sufficient quarantine duration (Supplementary material: Sufficient travel quarantine).

For different values of the incubation period, we examined a longer reported incubation period of 8\u00a229 days 44 and an extended incubation period of 11\u00a266 days (based on the 95th percentile of the reported distribution). 45 When varying the adherence to self-isolation, we only vary it for individuals who are not in quarantine, as isolation is mandatory in quarantine. Lack of adherence to quarantine was parameterized as complete; transmission for those not adhering to quarantine was specified as equivalent to the scenario of a zero-day quarantine with no test. To perform a scenario analysis examining the differences in outcome across serial dates of analysis, we quantified the minimum duration of quarantine at weekly intervals between October 3, 2021 and November 21, 2021 and then compared these durations to those estimated for October 3, 2021. To calculate imminent infections based on an alternative source of travel flow data, annual air passenger transport between countries was used. 46 ",

From the estimated country-specific travel quarantine strategies that are individualised for origin and destination pairs, we found that travel can be allowed among most pairings without increasing the within-country imminent infections in the destination country (Fig 2, Fig S1) . Countries with lower prevalences of disease tended to require more stringent regimens of quarantine and testing (Fig. S2) . For example, as of November 21, Spain was classified in Red EU travel status and exhibited the lowest case burden per capita among the 26 European countries studied. We found that quarantine durations ranging between 0\u22124 days would result in fewer imminent infections in Spain than closed borders for most of the origin countries, with a travel ban for travellers from the UK ( Fig. 2A, Fig. S1 ). Malta was also in Red status with a minimum sufficient quarantine duration between 2\u221210 days, with a travel ban for travellers from Germany and Poland (Fig. 2B, Fig. S1 ). Cyprus, Portugal, the UK, Greece, and Austria-each with Dark Red EU travel status-exhibited minimum sufficient quarantine durations ranging from 0\u22122 days to 0\u221212 days with the implementation of travel bans ( Fig. 2C\u2212G, Fig. S1 ). A Dark Red EU travel status destination country such as Hungary-with high prevalence-can require no quarantine (Fig. 2H, Fig. S1 ). In general, we found that the recommended duration of travel quarantine increases with the ratio of the prevalence in the origin country to the destination country (Fig. 2I, Fig. S1 ).",

For August 8, the minimum sufficient quarantine duration for destination countries with low prevalence (i.e., Green status) had a median of four days, moderate prevalence (i.e. Amber status) two days, whereas in destination countries with high prevalence (Dark Red status) the median estimated quarantine duration was zero days.

            "text": "In addition to prevalence of disease, travel volume has a notable impact on quarantine and testing strategies that are sufficient to enable travel without increasing within-country transmission (Fig. S2) . For instance, a comparison of Dark Red status Norway and Greece reveals that sufficient quarantines to visit Greece would need to be longer due to differences in typical travel asymmetries in and out of the country (Fig. 2D; Fig.  S1 ). For a few destination countries (such as Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Portugal and Greece), we found that even a travel quarantine duration of 14 days would be insufficient to keep within-country imminent infections equivalent to or lower than that achieved by a complete travel ban ( Fig. 2I; Fig. S1 ). This result can arise when there is substantial asymmetry in the number of travellers abroad. For example, travel asymmetry between the UK and Greece is high; consequently, a ban on travel for visitors from the UK would be required to ensure transmission within Greece is not increased. A large number of travellers in the country and fewer residents abroad leads to serious challenges in minimising quarantine and testing strategies to maintain travel at normal levels. These results indicate that a multitude of factors can simultaneously influence the importation of infection, impacting the minimum sufficient quarantine durations. Sensitivity analysis of the minimum sufficient quarantine durations for each parameter revealed that the natural immunity and number of daily travellers in both the destination and origin countries; daily incidence per capita and disease prevalence in the destination country; as well as vaccine-elicited immunity in the origin country exhibited substantial impact on the quarantine duration (Fig. S2) . The number of travellers abroad in the destination and origin country, vaccine-elicited immunity in the destination country, and disease prevalence in the origin country had moderate impact, while age demographics and population sizes had negligible effects on the duration of travel quarantine (Fig. S2) . As the pandemic situation evolves in each country, the changes in population immunity and disease prevalence will impact the minimum sufficient quarantine (Fig. S1 vs Fig S32) . The estimates are fairly stable on a monthly time scale; the minimum sufficient quarantine durations calculated as of October 3 Figure 2 . The estimated minimum duration of travel quarantine for specified origin-destination country pairs that reduces withincountry imminent infections to be equivalent to border closure for the pandemic as of November 21. Specifying age-dependent vaccine effectiveness and proportion of asymptomatic infections, as well as country-specific demographics, incidence, prevalence of non-isolated infections, vaccine coverage, natural immunity and travel flow, we determine the minimum sufficient duration of travel quarantine with an RT-PCR test on exit from quarantine (colour gradient) that should be stated by the destination country for individuals arriving from the origin country based on data for November 21, 2021. The countries are ranked based on their estimated incidence per 100,000 over the last two weeks (November 8 to November 21) and stratified based on the European Union country classification system: Green, < 25 cases per 100,000; Amber, 25\u2212150 cases per 100,000; Red, 150\u2212500 cases per 100,000; and Dark Red, > 500 cases per 100,000.

Therefore, among countries with surveillance enabling estimation of the number of cases attributed to the variant, sufficient quarantine and testing is similar for these variants to that determined for general transmission without stratification by variants (Fig. 2I  vs. Fig. 3A ). In contrast, the emerging Omicron B.1.1.529+BA variant and all other variants excluding Delta G/478K.V1 and Omicron B.1.1.529+BA were at relatively lower frequency in most European countries, with much greater variance in prevalence. Consequently, sufficient quarantine durations would be longer for these variants than that determined in a general analysis of COVID-19 transmission (Fig. 3B \u2212C vs. Fig. 2I and Fig. 3A) .

We conducted our analysis for a snapshot in time based on the epidemic situation observed on November 21, 2021 in 26 European countries. We demonstrated that quarantines for European destinations can be informed by country-specific prevalence, daily incidence, vaccine coverage, immunity, age-demographics, and travel flow from the country of origin. Our analysis for this specified time of the epidemic indicated that for nearly half of these European origindestination country pairs, no quarantine or test is necessary to prevent increased within-country imminent transmission from travellers, and for the majority, a test with no quarantine would be sufficient. For many other country pairs, a travel quarantine of a few days combined with testing on exit would suffice. The duration of travel quarantine is influenced mainly by the relative prevalence of disease between the origin and destination countries, immunity in both countries, and the asymmetry of travel. With a goal of preventing the introduction of variants of concern, quarantine and testing strategies that are sufficient for the general case will usually help to prevent the rise of imminent VOC transmission within-country as well. The strategies diverge when variants of concern are infrequent and prevalence is heterogeneous on the international scale.",

However, quarantine durations quantified from our analysis are generally shorter than those implemented in most countries. These short but non-trivial quarantine durations arise from a multitude of factors. Firstly, unlike standard quarantines that aim for no post-quarantine transmission, our framework only requires quarantines where travel does not elevate infection rates in the destination country relative to border closure. Also, infected travellers are more likely to enter quarantine later in infection compared to traced contacts who enter during the early stages postinfection. Other external factors, such as prevalence, travel flow, and immunity, also influence these quarantine durations. Therefore, accounting for the duration of the incubation period as well as external factors is essential for determining the appropriate travel quarantine strategy.",

However, implementing travel quarantine and testing policies that are specific to many input parameters, dependent on country of origin as well as destination-and that change dynamically as waves of the pandemic strike and recede-is logistically challenging. Indeed, some countries have specified a single quarantine duration for any traveller entering their country. 48, 49 A single policy may be unduly restrictive-or in some cases may not be restrictive enough. An intermediate approach is to simplify input parameters and discretize country classification in accordance with existing frameworks, such as the incidencebased EU traffic-light system. By considering European averages for other parameters, we demonstrated the feasibility of mapping our more highly parameterized approach to the EU traffic-light system.",

For example, Greece (Dark Red EU-status) requires a travel ban for travel from the UK (Dark Red EU-status) in the country-pair model, whereas no quarantine is indicated for the EU trafficlight model. The EU traffic-light model relies only on differences in incidence. Expanding beyond the EU traffic-light model to include country-specific vaccination coverage is possible, with the consequence of higher complexity of policy decision-making. However, any individual country can still improve the accuracy of the tier-based model by categorising the rest of Europe in the EU tier-system and parameterizing the model (e.g., travel flow, immunity, and demographics) specific to their country as well as European averages for origin countries. Therefore, our results from the EU trafficlight model provide guidance regarding a simplified approach that aligns with current practises and illustrates easy communication of appropriate travel quarantine duration. Together, the two models provide insight as to an effective quarantine duration for travel within Europe, and provide analytical justification for decisionmaking that can otherwise be politicised rather than evidence-based.",

Where disease prevalences and immunity levels are unknown or poorly monitored, countries may adopt a precautionary principle and take a restrictive approach to border control. Because travel volumes during the pandemic are uncertain, we used the annual number of arrivals to paid accommodations in 2019 to inform a fixed daily travel flow, which underestimates the overall travel flow across country borders during 2019. However, we expect that it would still be greater than the reduced travel flow during the pandemic. Thus, our estimates for the sufficient travel quarantine can be considered conservative relative to the extent of travel during the pandemic. While we present our results based on average daily travel flow, seasonal fluctuations in travel could distort these average relationships, affecting imminent transmissions as seen during 2020 summer travel in Europe. 50 Our sensitivity analysis indicates that a disproportionate increase of travellers into a destination country requires longer quarantines, while quarantine restrictions can be lessened when residents are more willing to travel. Therefore, re-evaluation of the sufficient quarantine to account for changes in travel flow between countries may be necessary to ensure continued safe travel.",

However, whether the sufficient quarantine and testing strategies identified here are worthwhile from a public health or cost-effectiveness perspective requires additional consideration. For instance, high rates of hospitalisation can overwhelm the healthcare infrastructure in a country. Stringent disease control measures were found to slow the local disease progression, 8 delaying the peak in incidence and potentially preventing a crash of the local health system. Thus, policymakers may consider applying travel quarantines to ensure that the hospitalisation rate remains manageable. Hospitalisation rates in the destination country are likely not influenced by traveller origin or even by quarantine duration because of the relatively small numbers of travellers when compared with widespread infection among the resident population during a fully emerged pandemic. 51 In this circumstance, travel quarantines will have an almost trivial impact on within-country imminent infections and a proportionately small contribution toward hospitalisation rate. For countries looking to shift toward a zero-COVID policy, the minimum sufficient quarantines determined from this framework are inadequate because they allow for a level of transmission similar to that estimated under a travel ban and do not halt the importation of cases. A balanced consideration of quarantine duration should come both from an understanding of the relative impact of travel on infection and on the public health consequences of infections.",

This homogeneity impacts the number of infections occurring in and produced from travellers. Accounting for heterogeneity in the implicit contact patterns between travellers and residents can increase or decrease the minimum sufficient quarantine duration. Indeed, the number of infections that will occur among the residents of the destination country is influenced by the reproduction number. However, our estimates of minimum sufficient travel quarantine are independent of any changes in the reproduction number, as this number factors out of the calculation (Supplementary material: Sufficient travel quarantine).

Even after several months into the pandemic, infections may still be under-reported due to limited health resources and a high proportion of asymptomatic infections. 56\u221259 In part for this reason, the EU traffic-light system elevates their assessment of risk for countries that have high rates of test positivity. Disproportionate under-reporting of infections in the origin country relative to the destination would limit the informativeness of our analyses using only reported infections. To overcome this limitation, an analytical layer could be added that adjusts reported prevalence by test positivity. 59, 60 As the pandemic progresses, quarantine decisions may shift completely toward prevention of one or multiple variants of concern that are more transmissible or can escape natural and vaccine-mediated immunity, 17 that may justify imposition of highly restrictive quarantine and testing strategies, or even border closure. Just as in the early COVID-19 pandemic, 61 a strong implementation of travel restrictions could forestall specific variants of concern at the border. However, detection of such variants can be substantially delayed relative to their introduction or establishment in a country, 62, 63 which can lessen the effectiveness of border closure. Moreover, early detection of low-frequency emerging variants is unlikely-even by an aggressive surveillance effort. Consequently, our estimates of minimum sufficient quarantine durations for variants of concern should be understood as applying only to those already identified. Analysis on quarantines aimed to prevent the invasion of an emerging variant would be useful, but there is no methodology evident to us for doing so. Rapid and accurate identification of variant properties is crucial for policy decisions, because attempting to forestall even a low-frequency variant would often entail near-complete border closure, which may be unnecessary if the public health threat of the variant is minor compared to other circulating variants. National efforts to address disease spread would be tremendously aided by genomic approaches to rapidly and accurately assess variant properties. Building international capacity for such surveillance should be a priority for all nations, so that decisions can be informed and judicious.",

However, some guidance for other countries may be obtained by finding the European country pairs most similar in circumstance to any origin-destination pair of interest. Furthermore, our modelling framework can be used directly by policy makers to inform travel quarantine duration between any two countries using countryspecific input data. The applicability of our approach is not limited to travel between countries-where border controls are typically strongest and easiest to imposebut can be applied to any distinct populations for which disease prevalence, travel flow, and other input data can be quantified. Ultimately, international quarantine and testing should not be considered a substitute for national policy preventing the spread of disease at a more localised scale within the country itself. Even if a 0-day quarantine is sufficient between countries, widespread local travel may lead to infections where there were previously none. 64, 65 The expected success of quarantine and testing can be undermined by non-compliance. We found that the level of adherence to self-isolation upon symptom onset had less impact on the estimated minimum sufficient quarantine duration than decreasing adherence to the quarantine policy. As adherence to quarantine decreases, the duration of sufficient quarantines increases. It is worth noting that non-compliance is increased by the stringency of the requirement, so that it is possible to achieve less by requiring more. For example, some entrants to Canada opt not to comply with its 14-day quarantine requirement. [66] [67] [68] As the first days of quarantine are often the most important to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, 10 it can be disadvantageous to public health goals to require a longer quarantine that elicits poor adherence instead of a shorter quarantine with improved compliance. Furthermore, shorter country-specific quarantion durations could free up resources for measures that improve compliance such as providing low-cost, safe accommodations and convenient, rapid, and accurate testing.",

Inferior specificity of rapid antigen tests would lead to a higher false-positive rate, but this effect on imminent infections will be negligible if nonzero. Nevertheless, false positives may incur additional expenses for travellers such as validation tests, opportunity costs, and psychological damage. 72 With regard to their lower sensitivity, our results indicate that rapid antigen tests can play a significant role in effective quarantine and testing. The faster turnaround for the processing of antigen tests permits its use a day later during quarantine than the RT-PCR test. This feature enables its timing just before travel departure, while RT-PCR would need to be scheduled days in advance and an infection in its early stages may not be detected. 10 We also showed that multiple rapid antigen tests could potentially be equivalent to or better than RT-PCR tests for prevention of post-quarantine transmission. Furthermore, use of an antigen test does not preclude one from sampling variants of concern, as positives can be referred for RT-PCR validation and genetic sequencing. However, the high volumes of testing required for travel quarantine poses challenges for utility of both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests. The processing time of numerous RT-PCR samples could be made more feasible using high-throughput assays, while additional training for travellers may be required to reduce the number of missed cases from rapid antigen tests.",

However, the model can be reparameterized with the properties of other emerging diseases that may carry a global risk, to obtain policies of quarantine and testing that are sufficient to prevent increased withincountry transmission. Border closure would be recommended during very early stages of pandemic spread to limit the global dissemination of an emerging disease from the epicentre, 73 but such a measure provides limited benefits once community transmission is established in the country. 5 As the trajectory of a pandemic continues to unfold and country-specific prevalence, circulation of variants, and potentially vaccination coverage changes, travel quarantine strategies can be adjusted to enable effective and judicious responses to new epidemiological conditions. Use of our model can provide an evidence-based approach to ameliorate policy decisions that often otherwise result in polarised, entirely permissive or overly restrictive states. Our quantitative approach facilitates equitable and safe international travel conditions between countries.",
