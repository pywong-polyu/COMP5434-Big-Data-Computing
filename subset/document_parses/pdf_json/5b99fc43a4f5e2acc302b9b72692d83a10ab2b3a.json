[4] [5] [6] In Quebec, there is also notably lower vaccine coverage among children living in more materially deprived neighbourhoods. 3 7 Factors shown to contribute to disparities in COVID-19 vaccine coverage include inequitable access to vaccination services among disadvantaged populations, language and resource (eg, computer access) barriers and greater mistrust of governments and public health agencies among some equityseeking groups. 8 To successfully combat vaccine hesitancy, defined as 'a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines', 9 and reduce inequities in vaccine uptake among children and adolescents, research has demonstrated that interventions are most effective when tailored to meet local needs through active engagement and co-development with communities. 10 Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches have been widely used to develop solutions that improve community health and increase health equity through a process of co-learning and genuine partnership between researchers and communities. 11 Human-centred design (HCD) is a problem-solving approach that shares CBPR's emphasis on co-creation and bidirectional exchange of knowledge between the design team and the project's intended beneficiaries ('users'). HCD engages with communities and their needs through an iterative process of building empathy with the experiences of individual users, generating ideas for how to solve problems, and designing and testing out prototypes. Traditionally used more in the private sector, HCD has in recent years been applied to numerous public health problems, [12] [13] [14] including to develop mobile apps and education materials to bolster vaccine uptake. 15 16 Emerging evidence suggests that the integration of HCD into CBPR projects may lead to more innovative, accessible and effective solutions to address complex health and social issues. 17 18 ",

Six public primary schools (out of 16 total) and 2 public secondary schools (out of 4 total), with an equal number of each per neighbourhood, were randomly selected to participate. We excluded a priori two public schools that serve unique student populations: one primary school for children with intellectual/developmental disabilities and one small secondary school that supports older students who had previous difficulties within the educational system. For the former, decision-making around vaccines likely involves different considerations for the parents of students with disabilities, while the latter school did not include our full age range of interest. Students aged 14 years and older attending one of the two sampled secondary schools are eligible to participate in the online questionnaire. This age cut-off was selected because adolescents 14 years and older do not require the consent of a parent or guardian to be vaccinated in Quebec. 24 In addition, parents or guardians of all children aged 5-11 years attending one of the participating primary schools are eligible to participate. Surveys are being conducted in January 2022 (baseline) and June 2022 (follow-up). All questionnaires are available to participants in French and English, and the parent questionnaire is also available in Arabic, Urdu and Punjabi.",

Where possible, questions are based on existing validated surveys and scales, including Statistics Canada's COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Survey 26 and Quebec's National Institute for Public Health Surveys on vaccine acceptance for children. 2 Social determinants of interest include parental education, race/ethnicity, language(s) spoken at home and place of birth, which are measured using questions adapted from the Canadian Population Census. 27 The adolescent questionnaire measures vaccine uptake and focuses on understanding the reasons for receiving or not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The questionnaire includes basic sociodemographic and health questions for the adolescent and members of their family. As with the parent questionnaire, the adolescent questionnaire collects information about household COVID-19 infections and vaccination history, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 infection and vaccines, and sources of vaccine-related information.

Using the eligible student populations of the sampled primary and secondary schools, we require response rates of 6% and 28% among parents and adolescents, respectively, which are reasonable targets based on our previous COVID-19 research in Montreal schools. 31 We will use descriptive and inferential approaches to analyse survey data. Analyses will describe and compare rates of vaccine acceptance and uptake for children and youth between baseline and follow-up.
