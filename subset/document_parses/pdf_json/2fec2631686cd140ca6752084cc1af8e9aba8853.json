However, systematic studies on the effects of drugs in comorbidities are lacking. Drug interactions with the cellular protein-protein interaction (PPI) network give rise to ADRs. We selected 6 comorbid disease pairs, identified the drugs used in the treatment of the individual diseases 'A' and 'B'-44 drugs in anxiety and depression, 128 in asthma and hypertension, 48 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, 58 in type 2 diabetes and obesity, 58 in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, and 84 in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis -and categorized them based on whether they aggravate the comorbid condition. We constructed drug target networks (DTNs) and examined their enrichment among genes in disease A/B PPI networks, expressed across 53 tissues and involved in ~1000 pathways. To pinpoint the biological features characterizing the DTNs, we performed principal component analysis and computed the Euclidean distance between DTN component scores and feature loading values. DTNs of disease A drugs not contraindicated in B were affiliated with proteins common to A/B networks or uniquely found in the B network, similarly regulated common pathways, and disease-B specific pathways and tissues. DTNs of disease A drugs contraindicated in B were affiliated with common proteins or those uniquely found in the A network, differentially regulated common pathways, and disease A-specific pathways and tissues. Hence, DTN enrichment in pathways, tissues, and PPI networks of comorbid diseases will help identify drugs contraindications in comorbidities.",

            "text": "Comorbidity is the phenomenon in which one or more diseases co-exist with a primary disease in patients. Comorbidities are the norm rather than exceptions among chronic conditions and pose a significant threat to the physical and psychosocial wellbeing of patients [1] . Comorbidities increase with age, and the risk of mortality increases with the number of comorbidities. A longitudinal study (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) has shown that the mortality risk increased by 25% in patients with 3-4 chronic comorbidities and by 80% in those with 5 or more comorbidities, both in comparison with individuals having no chronic conditions [2] . The prevalence of comorbidities increases from 10% in 0- 19 yearolds to 78% in individuals aged 80 or more [3] . The prevalence of comorbidity in women of age groups of 18-44 years, 45-64 years, and \u2265 65 years was 68%, 95%, and 99% and in men, it was 72%, 89%, and 97% [4] . As per the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) survey, 73.8-98 .2% of the respondents reported having at least one comorbid condition along with a primary condition [1] . The most striking finding from this report was that the estimates of individual disease burden based on the respondents' perception of their health condition decreased substantially when adjusted for comorbidity [1] . This effect was particularly magnified for neurological disorders, chronic pain, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and diabetes, all of which contribute immensely to the global disease burden [1] . For example, anxiety disorders collectively affect 284 million people (63% females, 2.5-7% variation by country) around the world, and are among the most prevalent mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders (WHO and IHME, 2017) [5] .",

For each disease pair, negative log-transformed p-values indicating the statistical enrichment of the disease networks/biological pathways/tissues in the 4 drug target networks were assembled into a data matrix containing disease networks/biological pathways/tissues as rows and drug target networks as columns; each cell in the matrix contained a -log 10 P value. Following the established approach [42] , log transformation was performed to reduce the influence of extreme values on the obtained PCs. PCA was performed with a web-based tool called ClustVis (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/) [43] . The data matrix was pre-processed such that 70% missing values were allowed across the rows and columns. The -log 10 P values in the matrix were further centred using the unit variance scaling method, in which the values are divided by standard deviation so that each row or column has a variance of one; this ensures that they assume equal importance while finding the components. The method called singular value decomposition (SVD) with imputation was used to extract principal components. In this method, missing values are predicted and iteratively filled using neighbouring values during SVD computation, until the estimates of missing values converge. The factor/component loadings corresponding to the disease networks/pathways/tissues that contributed to the selected principal components were also extracted.",

Drugs contributing to specific adverse effects were collected by manually selecting relevant 'condition concept names' (Additional File 1: Table S1 ). For example, to identify the anxiolytic drugs that may cause depression, the condition concept names, depression, major depression, depressive symptom, depression suicidal, depression postoperative, postpartum depression, depressive delusion, and agitated depression, were selected. The list of anxiolytic drugs was then compared with the list of drugs associated with these condition concept names. The matching drugs were compiled into groups 'a' and 'c', for example, \"drugs effective in anxiety and contraindicated in depression\". Similarly, groups 'b' and 'd' drugs were compiled. The proteins targeted by the drugs belonging to groups a and b were retrieved by querying the Drug Bank database through the DGIdb drug-genee interaction database) web portal [25] (see Additional File 3: Table S3 ). Finally, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the drug targets were assembled by extracting their protein interactors from the PPI repositories BioGRID [27] (version 4.3.194) and HPRD [26] (version 9) using a Cytoscape plugin called BisoGenet [28] .",

Each cell contained the negative of log-transformed p-values. -log 10 transformed p-values have been used as inputs for PCA in previous studies [58, 59] . Following the established approach [42] , log transformation was performed to reduce the influence of extreme values on the obtained PCs. Single value decomposition (SVD) with imputation and unit variance scaling was applied to this matrix to extract principal components that explained the variance observed with each of the data modalities across the DTNs. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to matrices containing gene-level association scores in several studies [59] . PCA is primarily used to capture systematic variations underlying datasets. All the principal components generated after this analysis were considered for our study, since they may together reveal underlying clustering patterns among the different DTNs. ",

The GDA score ranges from 0 to 1 and is computed for a gene based on the number of publications supporting its association with the disease, and the number and types of database sources (levels of curation (expert-curated/computationally-predicted) and the model four measures of network similarity, namely, matching node ratio (green data points), matching link ratio of all shared edges (red data points), matching link ratio of all shared organisms in which the association was validated). The 100 top-ranking genes collected in this manner were used as starting points for the construction of disease networks. Here also, the network is assembled by extracting PPIs from BioGRID and HPRD using a Cytoscape plugin BisoGenet, similar to assembling of DTNs. Then, we systematically conducted network overlap analyses with each of the 9 disease pairs and identified the proteins (a) shared between the two disease networks, (b) unique to disease A and (c) unique to disease B ( Table 1) . The relative risk between diseases was proportional to the matching node and link ratios (Fig. 2) . The control disease pairs showed low relative risks and smaller disease network overlaps, whereas three out of five comorbid disease pairs showed high relative risks and larger network overlaps, namely, Asthma -Hypertension, COPD -Heart failure and Type 2 diabetes -Obesity. However, this trend was not seen in the comorbid pairs, Rheumatoid arthritis -Osteoporosis and Parkinson's disease -Schizophrenia. Specifically, their higher relative risks (compared with other comorbid pairs), were not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the network overlaps. ~85% of the human interactome awaits experimental discovery [60] . Hence, two factors may have led to the underestimation of the network overlaps. Firstly, the inherent incompleteness of these disease networks [60] . Secondly, the tendency of incomplete networks to exhibit small overlaps [60] .",

These proteins are bound with high affinity at specific binding sites by drugs that follow the Lipinski's 'rule-of-five', i.e. orally bioavailable drugs with specific molecular characteristics that influence their pharmacokinetic ability to enter systemic circulation and act on their target sites ( We found that the proteins shared between the two diseases were the most significantly enriched for druggable targets in 5 out of the 6 tested comorbid pairs ( Table 2 ). In case of the sixth pair, namely anxiety and depression, the proteins that are exclusive to the depression network were found to be more enriched for druggable targets. In 2 out of the 5 disease pairs that shared many common drug targets, the drug target proteins were significantly enriched in G protein-coupled receptor activity (pvalue <0.05) ( Table 3) . Based on these observations and the finding in the previous section that relative risk varies in tandem with network similarity measures, we speculated that contraindications in comorbidities may arise from drug action on druggable proteins shared between the networks of comorbid diseases ( ",

Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been shown to reduce HPA hyperactivity in both depressed patients and patients with generalized anxiety disorder [83] [84] [85] . Therefore, it is possible that anti-anxiety drugs that do not aggravate depressive symptoms target the adrenal gland, which produces the cortisol hormone, an effector or 'endpoint' of the HPA axis that seems to be regulated in a similar manner in depression as well as anxiety. We performed comparative transcriptome analysis of disease-associated, tissue-associated and drug-induced gene expression profiles using the BaseSpace Correlation Engine to analyse this hypothesis.

The differential gene expression (DGE) profile induced by maprotiline (12.8 \u00b5M) in PC3 cells (Broad Connectivity Map (CMAP 2.0) [39] ) was negatively correlated with the profile identified in the blood samples of patients with major depressive disorder patients (MDD) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) versus MDD patients without GAD (GSE98793 [40] ) (Fig. 8a) . This negative correlation of maprotiline with MDD/GAD could illustrate the fact that drugs administered to treat diseases often revert the expression of perturbed diseaseassociated genes to their normal levels [87, 88] . Secondly, the MDD/GAD profile was negatively correlated with the expression profile of adrenal gland cortex (Fig. 8a) , indicating that this tissue could be critical to disease alleviation. Maprotiline-induced DGE profile was positively correlated with the profile of adrenal gland (Fig. 8a) , indicating that maprotiline-mediated MDD/GAD alleviation may be dependent on adrenal gland, i.e. the reversal of MDD/GAD-associated expression profile induced by maprotiline could occur in the adrenal cortex. We then asked whether the genes differentially expressed in each of these profiles converged on a common set of biological processes.",

We then used the web-based tool called NaviGO [89] to group these 30 enriched biological processes into functionally cohesive networks based on semantic similarity measures of GO terms. Two such functional networks not only had top-scoring edges between the GO terms, but also contained GO terms enriched among all the three differential expression profiles (Fig.   8b, c) . One network contained four GO terms associated with protein folding (Fig. 8b) , and another network contained eleven GO terms representing cell cycle events (Fig. 8c) . Interestingly, 'protein folding', 'cyclin D associated events in G1' and 'G1 phase' were independently retrieved among our top-10 Reactome pathways found to be nearest (in terms of Euclidean distance) to the DTN of antidepressants that are not contraindicated in anxiety.

This could indicate that these disease Aspecific tissues may play a role in producing beneficial effects in disease A, while producing deleterious effects in disease B. For example, spleen was detected as a tissue highly specific to rheumatoid arthritis. The primary functions of this lymphoid organ are blood filtration, recycling of iron from old blood cells and generation of adaptive immune responses against bacterial, fungal and viral infections [90] . However, spleen has also been shown to act as a reservoir of osteoclast precursor cells, which upon resorption into bones, differentiate into osteoclasts. [91] Splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen) has been noted in 5-10% and 52% of rheumatoid arthritis patients in separate studies (based on physical examination and imaging studies respectively) [92] [93] [94] . Rheumatoid arthritis patients are also prone to developing spontaneous splenic ruptures [95] . In our analysis, spleen was identified to be nearest (in terms of Euclidean distance) to the DTN of rheumatoid arthritis drugs that were contraindicated in osteoporosis (Fig. 9) . This seemed to indicate that spleen mediated opposite effects in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Anecdotal evidence seemed to support this conjecture. While splenectomy seemed to improve rheumatoid arthritis in a patient [96] , it seemed to inhibit (a) attenuation of osteoporosis in a rat model [97] and (b) fracture healing in patients [98] . Table 5 summarizes the general conclusions of our study. We discovered that the DTNs of disease A drugs that are not contraindicated for a disease B may be nearest (in terms of Euclidean distance) to Table 5) . On the other hand, disease A drugs that are contraindicated for a disease B may be nearest to (a) proteins that are either uniquely found in the PPI network of disease A or are shared between the PPI networks of disease A and disease B, (b) biological pathways that are associated with disease A or are commonly active in both the diseases, and are regulated in an opposing manner in both the diseases and (c) tissues showing a high enrichment of disease Aassociated variants and thereby preferential affiliation with the etiology of disease A, and mediating opposing effects in disease A and disease B ( Table 5) . Table 5 : Disease network, pathway and tissue-level characterization of drugs that are contraindicated/not contraindicated in comorbid conditions. A has been used to indicate the Component loading values of 39 tissues associated with the drug target networks (DTNs) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoporosis to PC1 and PC2 have been plotted along the X and Y axes respectively. PCA was performed with the p-values of enrichment of the tissues significantly associated (p-value < 0.05) with the DTNs of RA and osteoporosis. These values were transformed to -log 10 P values, which were then assembled into a data matrix containing tissues as rows and DTNs as columns. Unit variance scaling was applied across this matrix. Single value decomposition (SVD) with imputation was used to extract the principal components (PCs). The component loading values shown in the figure correspond to component scores of 4 DTNs along PC1 and PC2 that explain 89% and 6% of the total variance respectively. The tissues that were exclusively associated with each of the 4 DTNs among the top-ten tissues that were identified to be highly related to the DTNs, after computing the Euclidean distance between the component loading values and the component scores, are shown as square-shaped data points for the DTN of drugs effective in RA and not contraindicated in osteoporosis, diamond-shaped data points for the DTN of drugs effective in osteoporosis and not contraindicated in RA, triangle-shaped data points for the DTN of drugs effective in RA and contraindicated in osteoporosis and cross-mark-shaped data points for the DTN of drugs effective in osteoporosis and contraindicated in RA. The tissues shown in circular and rectangular boxes were also identified to be highly specific to RA and osteoporosis respectively by TSEA-DB (due to a significant enrichment of RA/osteoporosis-associated variants). Note that spleen, which was identified to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (disease A) drugs that are contraindicated in osteoporosis (disease B), is a tissue enriched with rheumatoid arthritis (i.e. disease A) associated variants. This corroborates our finding that disease A drugs that are contraindicated in disease B are affiliated with disease A-specific tissues.",

The four network similarity measures along with the relative risk were low in the case of our three negative control pairs, namely, Multiple sclerosis -Peroxisomal disorders, Schizophrenia -Rheumatoid arthritis, and Asthma -Schizophrenia. This confirmed that these were indeed non-comorbid pairs. The network similarity measures and relative risk were higher in the case of Anxiety -Depression, Asthma -Hypertension, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder -Heart failure, Type 2 diabetes -Obesity, Rheumatoid arthritis -Osteoporosis, and Parkinson's disease -Schizophrenia, confirming that they were comorbidities. However, these measures do not follow the same trend in the case of the comorbid pairs. The higher relative risks of Rheumatoid arthritis -Osteoporosis and Parkinson's disease -Schizophrenia (compared with the other comorbid pairs) were not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the network similarity measures. Several factors may explain these variations in our analysis. Firstly, it has been shown that relative risk overestimates the comorbid associations between rare diseases and underestimates the associations between highly prevalent diseases [43] . The number of cases in the HuDiNe database for Rheumatoid arthritis -Osteoporosis and Parkinson's disease -Schizophrenia are 24629 and 5439 respectively, which can be classified as rare occurrences when compared with the other comorbid pairs. Additional File 17: Figure S14 shows the relationship of the relative risks of the nine pairs of diseases with the individual prevalence of the diseases and the prevalence of the disease pairs as comorbidities. Secondly, the human interactome is a progressively developing network with ~85% remaining to be discovered. Therefore, the inherent incompleteness of the human PPI network, sampling biases introduced as a result of the selective discovery of PPIs, and the tendency of such incomplete networks to exhibit small overlaps [60] could have led to the underestimation of the network overlaps. Our second key finding was that druggable proteins were highly enriched among the proteins shared between the networks of two comorbid diseases ( Table 2) .",

This was contrary to our expectation that these target networks would be preferentially affiliated with biological modalities pertaining to disease A. This conjecture was based on the assumption that for a drug to be specifically active against a specific disease A without aggravating a comorbid disease B, it had to reverse the phenotypes specifically associated with disease A. In this model, phenotypes of disease B were considered as 'off-targets' in line with the principles of conventional pharmacology, in which unintended effects of the drugs were attributed to interaction with pathways that may not be consequential to the pathology of disease A (i.e. pathways relevant to disease B) [13] . Our findings on the contrary indicate that the mechanisms underlying the pathology of the comorbid disease B may contribute to the therapeutic alleviation of disease A. Although further investigations may be necessary to dissect the basis for this observation, it is possible that an etiological association between the two diseases may cause their emergence or development to be interdependent. Specifically, future studies should concentrate on 3 etiological models of comorbidity [99] , namely, the direct causation For example, the alterations in such genes would have led to pathway perturbations in specific tissues, which if counteracted by the drugs, may lead to alleviation of disease A.",

This is in line with the speculation that both beneficial and adverse outcomes of drug treatment may arise from shared effectors and pathways, and that it may be difficult to delineate the separate mechanisms underlying the two outcomes [13] .

(b) Identification of the proteins collectively targeted by the drugs in each of the groups by querying Drug Bank through DGIdb. (c) Construction of DTNs using the protein targets as input nodes and assembling their immediate neighbors in the human protein-protein interaction network up to a distance of 1, based on data from the PPI repositories BioGRID and HPRD. (d) Performing gene enrichment analysis with the four DTNs (corresponding to each of the disease pairs) in 3 biological data types: (d1) disease protein-protein interaction networks, (d2) tissue gene expression and (d3) biological pathways. (e) Generation of a data matrix containing the enriched disease protein sets/tissues/pathways as rows, DTNs as columns and log-transformed p-values in each of the cells, and using the matrix as an input for principal component analysis. (f) Extraction of component loading values of each of the enriched disease protein sets/tissues/pathways that correspond to each of the principal components.

The comorbidity of disease A and disease B may arise from the correlation of the risk factors of disease B with the risk factors of disease A in the 'associated risk factors model'. On the other hand, comorbidity in the 'heterogeneity model' may arise not from the correlation of the risk factors associated with disease A and disease B, but from the capacity of the risk factors of disease A to cause disease B and vice versa. On applying the disease causation model to our findings, one may speculate that drugs targeting the proteins uniquely found in the disease B PPI network, and the pathways and tissues associated with disease B may alleviate disease A without aggravating disease B. The associated risk factors and heterogeneity models in this scenario would imply that the risk factors of disease B would influence the development of disease A directly, or through correlation with the risk factors of disease A. This model can be illustrated for genetic risk factors of disease B with the capacity to influence disease A.",

For each of the disease pairs, we retrieved the top-10 pathways closest to each of the DTNs out of all the pathways enriched in the DTNs (Additional Files 5-10:Figures S1-S6). Confirming our earlier suspicions, we noted that disease A DTN classes without contraindications in disease B were nearest to pathways possibly underlying both the diseases or uniquely associated with B, which are similarly regulated, i.e. upregulated or downregulated together, in the two comorbid diseases. On the other hand, disease A DTN classes with contraindication in disease B were nearest to pathways underlying both the diseases or unique to disease A that are differentially regulated, i.e. upregulated in one disease and downregulated in the other or vice versa.",
