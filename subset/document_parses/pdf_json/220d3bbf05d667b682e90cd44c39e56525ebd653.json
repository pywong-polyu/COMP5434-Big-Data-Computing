Blood routine tests were also measured at days 3 and 5 since admission, and adjuvant corticosteroid therapy throughout the disease course was retrieved. Clinical outcome was 28-day mortality after admission. The Ethics Commission of Tongji Hospital approved this study, with a waiver of informed consent. We constructed a fully Bayesian latent variable model for integrative clustering of the six data categories [2] . The appropriate clustering number was determined by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion. Only features with high posterior probability (e.g., 0.8) were kept.",

Patients presented severe respiratory failure, dramatically elevated counts of WBC and neutrophil, and lymphocyte depletion. Remarkably elevated cytokine occurred, accompanied by later development of ARDS and multiple organ failure. Type B: Poor prognosis and elderly enriched; dyspnea and cough with expectoration were common symptoms, accompanied by diarrhea and anorexia. Unfavorable respiratory condition and decreased lymphocyte count could be observed. Patients presented an imminent elevation of cytokine and a high risk of developing ARDS and multiple organ failure later after treatment. Type C: Intermediate prognosis; symptoms of dry cough and fatigue, and original comorbidity of hypertension were common. The respiratory condition was normal, and most laboratory tests were within normal or moderately elevated. Type D: Favorable prognosis and middle age enriched; primary symptom was cough with expectoration. Patients had stable breathing and most laboratory tests were in a normal range or slightly elevated.",

The four prognostic types present a stepwise distribution in age, respiratory condition, and inflammatory markers, suggesting their prognostic efficacy. The specificity of symptoms does not appear to be strong, but gastrointestinal response (e.g., diarrhea) , \u00d7 10 9 /L) of blood routine tests at days 1, 3, and 5 since admission among four prognostic types. Survival was analyzed with log-rank test and pair-wise comparison was adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg method. Labels of \"high\" and \"low\" were based on data interval instead of clinical reference values. AKI: acute kidney injury; DIC: disseminated intravascular coagulation; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; CVD: cardiovascular disease; SpO 2 : peripheral oxygen saturation; FiO 2 : fraction of inspired oxygen; WBC: white blood cell; RDW: red cell distribution width needs vigilance [3] . Unexpectedly, hypertension is more evenly distributed, which contradicts previous study indicating hypertensive with COVID-19 was more likely to be in a high risk of mortality [4] . Notably, types A and B always showed higher content of WBCs and neutrophils, no matter on days 1, 3, or 5 since admission, while types C and D had relatively higher lymphocyte counts compared to other types; such trend seemed not to be affected by corticosteroids even though more patients in types A and B received adjuvant corticosteroids therapy than C and D. Investigations in larger cohorts are required to provide more evidence. The study is limited by ignoring the potential treatment effect. However, such classification could help in better triage, allowing for a more rational allocation of scarce medical resources in a resource-constrained environment. Corticosteroid therapy 28 (76) 38 (84) 13 (48) 27 (64) Continuous variables were described as median (IQR) while categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (%). All records were measured at admission to intensive care wards unless otherwise indicated. Multiple group comparison was done with Kruskal-Wallis test; proportions for categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. All calculated P values were less than or equal to 0.001 except for respiratory rate (P = 0.004), absolute lymphocytes at day 3 since admission (P = 0.013), and corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.013) Abbreviations: CVD cardiovascular disease, rpm breaths per minute, SpO 2 peripheral oxygen saturation, FiO 2 fraction of inspired oxygen, WBC white blood cell, RDW red cell distribution width",
