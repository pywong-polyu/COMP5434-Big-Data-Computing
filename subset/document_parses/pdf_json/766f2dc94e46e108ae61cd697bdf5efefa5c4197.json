China topped the list of economies looking to invest in Thailand for the first time in 2019. A report by the BOI last year confirmed that China overtook Japan as the Southeast Asian nation's main source of foreign direct investment thanks to the BRI-linked projects that overspilled from the US-China trade war and Thai government incentives. 2 China's \"Going Out\" policy encourages Chinese companies to expand their production bases to Thailand and other ASEAN member countries from the push factor lead by higher production costs at home. But the pull factor that makes China come into Thailand are derived from several factors: high-speed tracks, the Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand 4.0 (cars, smart electronics, biotechnology, logistics, and aviation), solar energy, BRI, International Business Center of Bangkok, real estate. 3 According to BOI, applications from China, valued at the first three months of 2020 (Jan-Mar), proposed to BOI hit the largest with 56 projects. It was 22% of the total foreign investment proposed to the BOI. The approved project mostly came from China, accounting for 42% of total approved foreign investment to Thailand.

            "text": "Most interesting is that the Thai and Chinese governments have agreed on having tourism cooperation since August 1993 to promote marketing and international tourism cooperation. However, the Chinese government has allowed Chinese people to travel outside the country under government control; Thailand was the only first group together with Singapore and Malaysia that allowed Chinese people to travel. From that scheme, the number of Chinese tourists traveling to Thailand have been increasing on average every year. In the current field of tourism a great number of Chinese tourists are flowing into the ASEAN countries, especially into Thailand. Since 2014, about 4.6 million Chinese tourists came to Thailand, whereas in 2015 the number of Chinese tourists increased to 7.9 million. 4 China ranks as number one of tourist market in Thailand. In 2019, there were 10.98 million Chinese tourists, representing 28% of all foreign tourists. China has established the China National Tourism Office (CNTO) in Bangkok in 2017 to promote tourism cooperation between Thailand and China. However, in the beginning of 2020, the Chinese government attempted to contain the outbreak of coronavirus which is expected to have a detrimental impact on Chinese economic activity and outbound tourists. In late January, several days before Chinese New Year, the Chinese government announced measures to place quarantine in Wuhan and most of the other cities in the Hubei province. The lockdowns included a ban on transportation and all outbound travels, which had an impact on more than 50 million people. The Fear of virus spread across the country had halted the global tourism industry. On the issue of economic activity, by comparing to the similar virus outbreak in 2003 where Chinese citizens suffered from the SARS virus, the Chinese economy slowed from 11.1% to 9.1%. Markets expect the GDP growth to fall from an expected 6% to 4.5% in the first quarter this year, bringing 2020 GDP down to 5.4%. The falling number of tourists from China and other countries would have a damaging impact on the Thai economy. The revenue receipts from foreign tourists in Thailand are accounted for around 10% of the GDP. Based on data from World Travel & Tourism Council's report (WTTC), the direct and indirect effect of the Thai tourism industry on GDP was at 21.6% of GDP in 2018 and taking 15.9% away in Thai employment. Thai tourism industry relies on income from the spending of Chinese tourist visitors which is 28% of the GDP in 2019. During January 2020 the situation looked very normal, with a slight increase in visitors when compared to the previous year from 3.718 million to 3.810 million visitors (+2.46%). 5 Even at the end of January (around 27 January), China halted all group travel both domestically and to other countries. This was decided at a time when there were 4,515 confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, with 106 casualties. Even without the decrease in Chinese arrivals to Thailand in February 2020 as a result of the Chinese decision, traveling had already been self-restricted since arrivals from most countries had already started to decrease. After that, overall arrivals decreased from 3.604 million visitors in February 2019 to 2.062 million visitors in February 2020; a decrease by 42.78% when compared. Chinese arrivals decreased from 1.065 million to 161 thousand visitors (\u221284.92%). Thailand decided to determine that visitors from certain countries (including China) needed to be self-quarantine for fourteen days when arriving into Thailand, unfortunately leading to a drastic decline of tourist arrivals. On 25 March 2020, Thailand decided to ban all foreigners from entering the country (with very few exceptions), thus resulting in the number of Chinese visitors to be decreased by no less than 94.22%. They were not actually allowed to leave the country since then.",

Thailand, therefore, considered Jan 4, as the first point for dealing with the epidemic \"COVID-19\". On March 12, Thailand has established a center-CCSA to manage the situation of the COVID-19. Also, urgent measures were taken in managing such situations, as well as preventing and solving problems of new emerging infectious diseases. On May 14, the announcement of the \"Thai Chana (Thai victory)\" tracking application, a platform to help prevent disease control, was used for the public to check-into register and get a QR code so that they can be traced. For shop operators it was applied for public scanning to check-in and check-out the density of the crowd or reserve a service queue in order to avoid a lot of people lingering in the store, such as a barber shop. You can also rate the service satisfaction of operators, receive reward points, get discount coupons, and no need to worry about personal information because the system only requires the use of a phone number. To acquire this system the store must get registered on the website. When people use the service, they have to scan the QR code as checking-in and registering the information to the Department of Disease Control which is under the administration of the Public Health Ministry. The application system will know the public density of users in that store and decide whether to use the service or go to another store, and check out when leaving the store every time after checking in: the information will be sent to the Department of Disease Control. This system will be able to track users who go to shops that are at risk which will have a message sent to the mobile phone, and get free inspection services in which all information is confidential. There is no complexity in using it. In addition, the system will require the public to check the operators to comply with the five measures of the era. A rating is considered a good result for the operator to call. Fulfilling all of the above is also regarded as the safety of users, but if any shop does not use this method there must be a notebook for people to register their names when using the service.",

Though China has been accused politically for using this pandemic it to \"COVID diplomacy\", but that does not affect the Sino-Thai cooperation. Although COVID-19 has affected the progress of the BRI projects between the two countries, some projects had to be interrupted indefinitely.

Office of the National Security Council of Thailandmentioned that China tends to strengthen relations with Thailand in various areas and offer tourists from China to return to Thailand at the first opportunity. 11 Thailand should carefully consider their interactions with China. By trying to avoid any Chinese conditions or actions that would be binding on Thailand and it affects the stability and interests of the country in the long run, and because most of the countries in East Asian countries have been able to control the outbreak.

This outbreak makes us see the risk of bringing the economy to a single source. After China has banned people from traveling outside of the country to help reduce the outbreak of COVID-19, Thailand's GDP had been significantly affected. Therefore, Thailand had to use a sibling-like relationship with China when conducting business, as well as make rules that are practical for foreigners to do business, and let investors know about the best practices. Currently, there are many Chinese students who come to learn in Thailand. At the same time, there are multiple Chinese associations that collect information about trade and investment, as well as policies. Such information help meet the investment needs of Chinese companies in Thailand on how to succeed, where to invest, and what type of resources can be utilized to achieve a sustainable business operation, etc.",

By seeking a solution from \"crisis\" to \"cooperation\" according to the guidelines \"open, learning and seeking mutual benefits\". \"Openness\" is a significant factor that drives Chinese investors, as well as tourism and multinational corporations. In accordance with the BRI, and using the guidelines for foreign trade investment as a way to reduce production costs, trade and investment bases can be established. Indeed, China has a great influence in the context of today's world community. Thailand is one of the countries that China is interested in trading, investing and increasing tourism. Blocking the flow of such capitalism and not accepting the coming of Chinese capital in the context of today's free world society is beneficial for Thailand's economy. On the other hand, being \"closed\" or blocking the flow of such capital is not in the country's best interest. \"Learning Literacy\" is a mechanism by which, for instance, when we are exposed to an influx of Chinese capital, we have to \"learn\" the vocabulary, learn the processes, etc. in the context at both global and national scales; for the Chinese capital does not flow to Thailand alone, but also runs all over the world. Thus, we have to learn as much as possible about the procedures, operational guidelines, regulations, laws and trade cultures, customs, prohibitions and practices that govern the world. In addition, understand the implementation of policies and inter-government links (Government to Government: G2G); conducting business transactions, various investments between companies (Business to Business: B2B); and the interactions between people (People to People).",

Nowadays, however, Chinese businesses may use more local community level channels. Through more education, knowledge and understanding, Chinese businesses will be able to know about Thailand's trade laws, investment and other laws related to business operations better in Thailand. The ultimate goal is to find a right way to invest together in order to achieve legitimate investment trades. Presently, however, there exists some Chinese business practices in Thailand that may not be very legitimate, such as finding a nominee (Thai company) to conduct business together; i.e. by using gaps in the rule of law. Finally, \"Mutual benefit\" or mutual benefit creation is one that requires solutions to problems or seek creative solutions to manage problems that arise in accordance with the SDGs, where satisfaction is shared by both parties.",

The epidemic hindered the travel of Chinese tourists and tourists from other foreign countries, resulting in a substantial decline in Thailand's tourism revenue, which caused a serious impact on the Thai economy. Act as ASEAN's member, Thailand and the rest of nine member states have cooperated in terms of regionalization via ASEAN plus one campaign. China's expanding role is not only in trade and investment but also as the world's largest outbound tourism market, leading to closer economic ties between geographically adjacent ASEAN and China. However, the new outbreak of the disease is dragging down China's economy, leading to a slowdown in growth that will affect the economies of ASEAN countries with which China is close to the three main channels: trade, investment and tourism.",

Hence, the foreign ministers of ASEAN and China met in Vientiane, Laos on February 20 to discuss joint measures to combat the threat of COVID-19. In their joint statement, the eleven countries agreed to step up cooperation in sharing medical and health information, and best practices to enhance emergency preparedness and response. They also underscored the importance of cooperation in risk communication and community engagement to ensure people are promptly and correctly informed, thus thwarting misinformation and fake news.
