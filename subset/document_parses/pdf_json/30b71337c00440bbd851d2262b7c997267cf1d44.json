The primary aim of the study is to describe the chronology of lung pathologic changes in COVID-19 by using a post-mortem transbronchial lung cryobiopsy approach. Our secondary aim is to correlate the histologic findings with computed tomography patterns. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, who died while intubated and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled. The procedure was performed 30 min after death, and all lung lobes sampled. Histopathologic analysis was performed on thirty-nine adequate samples from eight patients: two patients (illness duration < 14 days) showed early/exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage, while the remaining 6 patients (median illness duration-32 days) showed progressive histologic patterns (3 with mid/proliferative phase; 3 with late/fibrotic phase diffuse alveolar damage, one of which with honeycombing). Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was positive predominantly in early-phase lesions. Histologic patterns and tomography categories were correlated: early/exudative phase was associated with ground-glass opacity, mid/proliferative lesions with crazy paving, while late/fibrous phase correlated with the consolidation pattern, more frequently seen in the lower/middle lobes. This study uses an innovative cryobiopsy approach for the post-mortem sampling of lung tissues from COVID-19 patients demonstrating the progression of fibrosis in time and correlation with computed tomography features. These findings may prove to be useful in the correct staging of disease, and this could have implications for treatment and patient follow-up.",

Presently, few case reports and series have described the lung pathology in cases of COVID-19 with tissue being sampled either from postmortem needle biopsies [8] , from infection unsuspected surgical resection specimens [9] , or from complete/in situ autopsies [10] [11] [12] . The descriptions available show diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with exudates and a predominantly lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate and large atypical pneumocytes.

Previous histologic reports have described bilateral DAD with intra-alveolar exudates, hyaline membrane formation, pneumocyte hyperplasia/atypia and loss with desquamation, as well as other early changes such as alveolar oedema and proteinaceous exudates, with major inflammatory infiltration [8, 9, 12] , possible consolidation with fibroblastic proliferation [10, 29] , and/or pulmonary thromboemboli [11, 30] . The increased fibrosis, reported in our patients compared with the previous studies, may be explained by different factors including general medical treatment, by the duration of mechanical ventilation or by the evolution of disease towards fibrotic phases. In our study, the duration of symptoms before death was longer than 20 days in all but two patients, with a maximum of 42 days, compared with other studies in which mean length of disease was just 5 to 7 days [10, 12] . Our data suggest that Fig. 3 Histology and radiology of mid-phase DAD pattern: a CK7 and Mallory trichrome, respectively, highlight marked intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates (red) and hyperplasia of the epithelial lining (brown) (CK7 immunoperoxidase and Mallory trichrome counterstain, \u00d7 40; scale bar 50 \u03bcm). b Numerous intra-alveolar macrophages are stained by CD163 (red), while CK7 highlights the epithelial lining (brown); also note the interstitial thickening (CK7 immunoperoxidase and CD163 alkaline phosphatase red; \u00d7 40; scale bar 50 \u03bcm). c Mural incorporation of the intra-alveolar fibrinous exudate (arrowhead) (H&E, \u00d7 40; scale bar 50 \u03bcm). d Intra-alveolar organization of hyaline membrane residues with organizing pneumonia (OP)-like pattern (H&E, \u00d7 40; scale bar 50 \u03bcm). e CT showing a \"crazy paving\" pattern (red arrowheads), characterized by thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines superimposed on a background of GGO resembling irregularly shaped paving stones. Peripheral fibrotic bands and traction bronchiolectasia are also present patients with longer spans of illness exhibit more interstitial fibrosis than those with shorter disease course. Furthermore, fibrosis was found even though all patients received antiinflammatory treatment during the course of the disease. In particular, regarding patient 1who showed a late/organizing fibrotic phase of DAD with micro-honeycombing, the parenchymal re-modelling finds no justification in previous pulmonary disease, as shown by a total body CT scan performed in 2013 following an accident, which revealed normal lungs; furthermore, the patient referred no respiratory symptoms whatsoever till the onset of COVID-19.",

Interestingly, as suggested by Merad and Martin [32] , subsets of macrophages in COVID- 19 may express activated genes associated with tissue repair and this would explain the evolution to fibrosis which we have observed in our patients.

Histology correlates with various imaging patterns. Briefly summarizing, we found that crazy paving pattern at CT was associated with mid-phase DAD while the consolidation CT pattern was mainly correlated with late-phase DAD. Ground-glass opacities may be seen isolated in the early phases or as part of a more complex pattern in later progressive disease. Any discrepancies between histologic and CT findings may be partly explained by lapse between CT scan and death (in some cases 10 days) or superimposed bronchopneumonia (patient 7 showed midphase DAD but had consolidated CT findings as a possible consequence of superimposed, diffuse, histologically proven, bronchopneumonia). We may expect that an, as yet, unknown number of COVID-19 survivors who required mechanical ventilation for a long period of time might present lung function impairment with unresolved fibrotic interstitial lung disease [34] . SARS epidemic data show that, within the first year from acute illness, a relevant rate of survivors (15-20%) showed reduced lung functional capacity [35] . Furthermore, a recent study with long-term follow-up demonstrated that, in patients with severe acute SARS related illness, lesions rapidly improved within the first year and then plateaued in the following 15 years with chronic CT lesions and lung function impairment [36] . In consideration of this, a complete and longterm follow-up, with functional studies, imaging and even cryobiopsies, could be necessary for COVID-19 patient management.",
