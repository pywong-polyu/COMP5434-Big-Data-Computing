Given that recent research suggests an alarming increase in alcohol consumption among women during the pandemic, an investigation into how this population represents alcohol use on social media is warranted. This study sought to describe and analyze posts focused on drinking among mothers on Instagram on several content dimensions (eg, promoting alcohol consumption, stress or struggle, social support), which may clarify the attitudes and motivating factors of an online subgroup of drinking mothers.",

Regarding the economic fallout, alarm bells were rung regarding the potential for a COVID-19 \"she-cession\" given that women constituted the majority of those who either lost employment in spring of 2020 or took a leave of absence from their positions in order to care for children learning from home [1] . A recent Census Bureau report [2] describes the labor market losses women have faced over the past year as \"devastating.\" The authors note that as of mid-January of this year, approximately 10 million women in the United States living with school-age children were not actively in the labor market, an increase of approximately 1.4 million since January 2019 [2] . Though mothers were hit harder by the economic effects of the pandemic compared to fathers, the gap in the work status between the two groups has narrowed substantially over the past several months [2] .",

First, as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics has documented, women continue to carry far more of the burden for domestic and childcare labor than do men [3, 4] . When mothers return to the labor market, they must once again balance domestic labor with paid labor [2] . This is complicated by the fact that across the country, many children continue to learn from home-whether because school districts are still operating in a remote format or because parents have chosen this mode of delivery out of an abundance of caution. This balancing act is made all the more complicated by pandemic-specific \"care economy\" work [5] undertaken by women wherein women are attending to the emotional well-being of family members. Second, previous studies have documented that a temporary departure from the labor force (eg, for childbirth) may have long-term negative effects on women's earning power [2] . Given this, pandemic-related labor-force participation gaps may suppress the economic position of women for years to come.",

Though the prevalence of drinking alcohol, including binge drinking, is generally higher among men than women [14, 15] , more women than men reported an increased consumption of alcohol since the pandemic began [16] . In fact, the level of pandemic-related distress has shown a positive association with the number of drinks consumed by females in both typical and heavier drinking episodes (16% and 13%, respectively) [17] . Pollard et al [18] found a greater increase in heavy drinking in particular for women compared to men.

            "text": "In a 2020 survey addressing changes since the onset of the pandemic, 27% of parents reported the emergence of mental health problems and 24% a loss of childcare from March to June. Although this pattern was found evenly across racial, ethnic, income, and education groups, women consistently reported worse perceptions of their own mental health than men [20] . Additionally, since the pandemic began, both men and women reported heavier drinking during the pandemic if children were sheltering at home. This stands in stark contrast to evidence that prepandemic drinking patterns were actually less risky among parents with children at home than those adults without children [21] . This increase in alcohol consumption may be related to the intensive demands of home schooling and daily childcare responsibilities, in addition to the financial and psychological stress already exerted by COVID-19-related lockdowns [12, [22] [23] [24] . Taken together, relevant studies suggest that the tendency of parents to drink alcohol during COVID-19 is likely to be moderated by pandemic related stress combined with the ongoing demands of childcare and home-based education, which are reportedly more burdensome for females than males.",

Yet, as the authors report, the transition to remote, telehealth-based psychological interventions has been slow, and moreover, \"most telehealth models do not concurrently treat mental health concerns and parenting risks, despite the evidence for the importance of addressing both\" [10] . It is in this context, as well as the fact that women are more likely to seek social support online [25] , that we have undertaken an examination of alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram. Instagram boasts over 1 billion users per month, with the majority being female [26] . Previous studies have found that posts featuring alcohol consumption are commonplace on social media; however, these studies have tended to focus on posts created by young people, rather than adults in general or mothers specifically [27] [28] [29] . At the time of writing, we did not identify any papers in the peer-reviewed literature that examined alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the pandemic. Addressing this gap was the purpose of this study, with the aim to better understand the elements of posts with the #winemom and #winejuice hashtags, and to be able to characterize the overall tone and elements of use of #winemom using systematic methods.",

The date, number of comments, number of likes, presence of a disclaimer (ie, a statement limiting responsibility for the post), and use of an illustration were recorded. The unit of analysis considered images and corresponding captions. Using content analysis, a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp) was created to manually analyze the presence of given themes.

It is currently unknown whether the derivation of the #winemom and #momjuice movement is simply a humorous meme with limited implications, or if there is more to the message that should take into account the undue pressure placed on all parents, particularly mothers, during the COVID-19 pandemic [34] [35] [36] [37] . In times of crisis, individuals who participate socially (eg, identify with groups, derive social support from others, feel a sense of belonging to a community) may benefit from enhanced personal resources [38, 39] . Online groups such as \"wine mom\" may thus function as a humorous protective buffer for its members. Along with the social connection provided by the group, the humorous aspect, as well as the situational reframing, may provide a relieving counterpoint to the strong negative emotions felt by many as the pandemic unfolded, lockdowns were mandated, and women in particular faced sudden and dramatic changes in roles and perceptions of mental health [40, 41] . This study is limited by the small sample size, the cross-sectional design, and the ever-evolving state of posts on this platform. Further study should focus on commentary generated on these posts as well as how these may change on a longitudinal basis. As with all cross-sectional studies, external validity is low. Further, our methodology was limited by the lack of profile data on the source of each post. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine this content in general, and specifically during a time of heightened stress and anxiety. The findings of this investigation suggest that though these hashtags ostensibly exist to valorize excess alcohol consumption, they may be serving as a support system for mothers who are experiencing increased burdens and role stress during the pandemic. Given the strains placed on mothers overall and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts must be taken to increase access to and affordability of telehealth-based mental health care. Social media forums such as Instagram are a place to potentially highlight the availability of such services.",
