Spiritual care is less prioritised and, consequently, this service, if offered, is mostly entrusted to volunteers. It therefore becomes prudent to understand who these volunteers are, what motivates them to volunteer, and how they see spiritual care being sustainable in the future. A cohort of spiritual care workers from a prominent hospice in Cape Town, South Africa, participated in this qualitative study. The participants made suggestions about formalising spiritual care as well as making a call for a basic entry requirement into spiritual care work.",

            "text": "There are many debates regarding how to classify countries. The \"Global North\" generally corresponds to countries categorised by the World Bank Atlas (World Bank Blogs, 2020) as high-income countries (HICs)-so, for example, Australia, which is a high-income country, is commonly viewed as part of the Global North, despite it being in the southern hemisphere. Countries in the \"Global South\" generally correspond to the World Bank low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) (World Bank Blogs, 2020) . South Africa is a middle-income country. The distinction here is based largely on financial resources, though of course other factors are associated with relative wealth. In the Global North, where there are more resources, spiritual care workers are commonly health care professionals such as trained nurses (Balboni et al., 2007) , medical doctors (Mati, 2016; Yang et al., 2017) , and social workers (Callahan, 2015) , or people with graduate qualifications in religion (Flannelly et al., 2003) , but the picture is different elsewhere. In the Islamic world, for example, there is not a great deal of systematic research on spiritual care, despite the importance of spirituality as part of the Islamic faith (Asadi-Lari et al., 2008) . In Africa, palliative care protocols tend to focus on more tangible aspects of palliative care such as medications and pain relief (Merriman & Harding, 2010) . In SA, where the current study is situated, spiritual care is slowly being incorporated into the training programmes for nurses (Chandramohan & Bhagwan, 2015) , social workers (Bhagwan, 2017) , trained traditional healers (Campbell & Amin, 2014) , and professional multidisciplinary teams (O'Brien et al., 2019) . Despite this, we found from a national hospice survey that spiritual care is generally not prioritised at hospices, with the exception of hospices which are better resourced than others (Mahilall & Swartz, under review) . Even in these better resourced South African hospices, though, unlike in the Global North, spiritual care services are often provided by volunteers rather than paid staff. These volunteers come from a range of backgrounds and may or may not have professional qualifications related to the provision of care.",

Much scholarly work talks about volunteers undertaking health care work in impoverished communities in SA (Akintola & Chikoko, 2016; De Wet, 2012; Nxumalo et al., 2016) . Many of the volunteers themselves come from lower socio-economic ranks of society (Akintola, 2011; Barnard & Furtak, 2020) . Care volunteers largely volunteer out of a desire to \"give back\" to their communities (Akintola, 2011) or extrinsically, in the hope of receiving a stipend (Morton et al., 2018) . By contrast, spiritual care volunteering in hospice settings in SA, according to the limited data we have (Mahilall & Swartz, under review) , seems more likely to be undertaken by older volunteers (some of them retired from formal employment) from higher socioeconomic sectors, not with the expectation of receiving a stipend or moving into formal employment (Mahilall& Swartz, under review) .",

One-on-one interviews were conducted which were approximately 90 min in duration. Prior to setting up the interviews, the participants gave both written and verbal consent. Ahead of the interviews the participants were given an Information Leaflet which highlighted, amongst other important information, confidentiality, protection of the data, and freedom to withdraw from the interviewing process or raise alternative views and arguments. As this is a sensitive topic, provision was made for psychological support for the participants at no cost to them. The interviews and subsequent three rounds of focus group discussions (FGDs) of approximately 120 min each were guided by a set of semi-structured questions (Appendix 1). Table 1 provides biographical data on the nine participants. Face-to-face interviews and FGDs were not possible due to lockdown regulations considering the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, interviews were conducted via virtual means such as Zoom and Skype, with the consent of the participants. As both authors are familiar with SLCH (one author works at SLCH and the other author conducted other research at the hospice), a co-facilitator knowledgeable in qualitative research was engaged to minimise researcher biase. The participants were informed and consented to this arrangement. The co-facilitator signed a pledge of confidentiality. The co-facilitator also facilitated the FGDs supported by the authors. The data obtained from the interviews and FGDs were recorded and transcribed. Through thematic analysis, a qualitative research method defined by Braun and Clarke as \"identifying, Table 1 Biographical information on research participants a In South Africa, as elsewhere, the use of \"racial\" terminology is complex and contested, and certainly still a source of debate and great pain. We make no claim for the scientific validity of the different \"racial\" categories, but the labels used still have social significance (Volmink et al., 2020) . In the South African context, the term \"Coloured\", which may well be the most contested, is an official term still used in government documents, refers to a very diverse group of people of mixed and diverse origin, with Afrikaans being the predominant language spoken (Volmink et al., 2020) . By contrast, the term \"Black African\" commonly refers to people who speak indigenous languages such as isiXhosa, spoken in the Western Cape. Under apartheid, the Western Cape was viewed as a preferential area in which \"Coloured\" people could live and work, whereas \"Black Africans\" were viewed as not being citizens of South Africa, but of racially defined \"homelands\" analyzing and reporting patterns within data\" (2006, p. 79) , the data were coded and reviewed for emerging themes and subthemes. The themes and subthemes were then defined and named and analysed thematically.",

We can pick up and enlarge a part of them that they are presenting in a creative way\u2026 We had an American woman, who came to St Luke's with her students and there were a couple that were with someone who was dying and she gave them a cello concerto that was such a beautiful farewell with the husband and the wife.

The participants in this study negotiated entry into spiritual care services at SLCH through diverse touch points and for various personal reasons. This was expected, as it is well documented, locally, and internationally that volunteers volunteer for a myriad of personal reasons (Akintola, 2011; Daute et al., 2019; Mati, 2016; Morris et al., 2015; Tapp et al., 2019) . We were struck by the seemingly diverse backgrounds and qualifications of the participants drawn to spiritual care work which intimated that there was no clear career path leading into spiritual care work and neither did it appear that there was a basic prerequisite qualification for entry into spiritual care work. Research abounds on the importance of spiritual care workers in palliative care, but this is largely premised on the presumption that spiritual care workers have a health care background (Best et al., 2020; Kestenbaum et al., 2017; Paal et al., 2018) .

Germane to this and emerging from a national study of training needs of spiritual care workers in hospice palliative care settings, a set of soft and hard skills were suggested as a key skills-set for spiritual care workers in SA (Mahilall & Swartz, under review) . Similarly, in the northern hemisphere, there is increasing consensus on the importance of training for spiritual care workers in spiritual care (Isaac et al., 2016; Paal et al., 2018; Puchalski et al., 2019) . Advocacy for postgraduate palliative care education for all health care workers in Europe has gained momentum by seeing the voices of the World Health Organization (WHO Global Observatory for eHealth, 2010) and European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) joining the call. In SA, while still very new as a recognised health care service, palliative care is gaining momentum, as the National Department of Health (NDoH) has prioritised palliative care at the primary, intermediary, and tertiary health care levels (Republic of South Africa, 2017). Consequently, the NDoH has also prioritised the scaled-up training of cohorts of different health care professionals, community health workers and care volunteers in palliative care . This is a positive step in the right direction in establishing palliative care, and especially spiritual care, as it begins to gain some ground towards professionalising and standardising this important work by providing some guidelines for spiritual care practice.",

(2020) suggest a more contemporary view that spiritual care is part of the human psyche and consequently forms part of human care, as well as care for society, families, patients, and care providers. Studies have also shown that patients' reliance on spiritual care increases during life-altering events (Mthembu et al., 2017) , but while many health care professionals recognise the value of spiritual care interventions for their patients, many felt inadequate in providing that care themselves (Mthembu et al., 2016) . While Roman et al. (2020) call for a collaboration of spiritual care practitioners to address the accelerated need for spiritual care during the COVID-19 pandemic, this pandemic has also shown that there is an immediate need to better equip existing health care professionals with skills and training in spiritual care as well as grow a volunteer force of adequately trained spiritual care workers, something the participants of this study called for as well.",
