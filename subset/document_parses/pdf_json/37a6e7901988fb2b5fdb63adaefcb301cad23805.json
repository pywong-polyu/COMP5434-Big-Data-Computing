To evaluate if combination of chest CT with RT-PCR can supplement the shortage of RT-PCR in diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a prospective study on 103 male patients. The study population were divided into two groups; early COVID-19 stage (number = 50 patients, with positive RT-PCR but mild symptoms) and progressive COVID-19 stage (number = 53, positive RT-PCR and sever symptoms including fever > 37.5 \u00b0C, cough, and shortness of breath). All patients underwent CT imaging. The early stage included typical category; 34% (17 out of 50 cases), 6% indeterminate category (3 cases), 10% atypical category (5 cases) and 50% (25 cases) were normal CT imaging. The progressive stage included typical category that was further divided to five subgroups; (i) peripheral bilateral lower lobe ground-glass opacity (GGO) in (37.7%), (ii) peripheral bilateral lower lobes GGO with peribronchovascular consolidation and bronchiolar dilatation in (18.8%), (iii) peripheral bilateral lower lobes GGO with crazy paving appearance in (15%), (iv) bilateral diffuse GGO in (18.8%), and (v) peripheral bilateral GGO with mediastinal lymph node enlargement (9.4%). Chest CT imaging could aid to supplement the shortages of PCR for clinically suspected patients of COVID-19 in the epidemic area as CT was positive in 50% of patients. Chest CT is very effective in detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the progressive stage of COVID-19 patients in 100%.",

(sensitivity was 77.00%, and the specificity was 96.33%) [29] . Our results suggest that CT imaging was performed in early period before lung injury starts to take place as CT shows lung changes at least one week after pathology starts [30] . The positive and negative predictive values in our study were 86.21% and 69.14%, respectively. Wen et al. reported different values of chest CT for COVID-19 as PPV and NPV were estimated at 92% and 42%, respectively, in a population with high pretest probability for the COVID-19 disease (e.g., 85% prevalence by RT-PCR) [31] . The relatively low negative predictive value suggests that CT may not be valuable as a screening test for COVID-19 at least in earlier stages of the disease.",

Chest CT alone is not recommended for early detection of COVID-19 by most radiological societies presumably due to lag of CT detection of lung injury behind clinical disease onset by one week. Chest CT examination is very effective (100%) in detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the progressive stage of COVID-19 pneumonia. Typical CT findings of COVID-19 include peripherally distributed multifocal GGOs with patchy consolidations and posterior part of lower lobe involvement predilection. The presence of crazypaving pattern, vascular enlargement (more than 3 mm diameter), bronchiolar dilatation, and peribronchovascular consolidation indicate disease progression.",
