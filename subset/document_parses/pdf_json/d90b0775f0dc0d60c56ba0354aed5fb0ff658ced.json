In this research, I aim to improve our understanding of elderly people's responses to the pandemic using data from 27 countries. Results are surprising and quite troubling. Elderly people's response is substantially similar to their fellow citizens in their 50's and 60's. This research (i) provides the first thorough description of the most vulnerable population's attitudes and compliance in a comparative perspective (ii) suggest that governments' strategies toward elderly people are far from successful and (iii) shows that methodologically, we should be more cautious in treating age as having a linear effect on COVID-19 related outcomes.",

That said, if my grandmother was alive, it would have been very hard to convince her not to go out and play cards at the social club even if the head of the government (that she voted for!) was urging elderlies to stay home. Beyond my anecdotical grandmother, we have seen many headlines in the media about generational differences. The Boston Globe titled an article \"Call Your Mom: The Generational Politics of Covid-19\" and The Telegraph wrote \"'Generation Me' Must Start Thinking About Others if We're to Stop the Spread of Coronavirus\" as a headline. Moreover, on top of the media coverage, there is a burgeoning number of data on age differences in attitudes and compliance to preventive measures in the context of the Covid-19.",

Moreover, the governments' and citizens' reactions and measures to minimize the consequences of that disease are of a totally different scale. Hence, it is very reasonable to expect that older people will be more dutiful when it comes to following the recommendation of public health agencies and governments. This is what one of the first studies in the United States showed: older Americans were more likely to perceive COVID-19 as a \"significant crisis\" and as a threat to people's health. [7] The effect was quite linear in both cases: the older the respondents, the more likely they were to perceive the COVID-19 as a threat. Several academic studies also examined the impact of age on attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and compliance with different preventive measures. Many studies measure the effect of age using linear models, which is consistent with the raw findings of the Pew Research Center cited above and is, in fact, very intuitive-see, among others, Painter and Qiu [8] for a study on the US, Pfattheicher et al. [9] for a focus on the United Kingdom and Germany, and Brouard et al. [10] for France. Some do allow non-linear relationships between age and COVID-19 related attitudes or behaviours, but they only do so as a control (i.e. they focus other explanatory factors and thus only include age to obtain more precise estimates) and do not discuss its implications. [11] [12] In other words, the majority of research does not include age as having a potentially non-linear effect on different variables related to COVID-19.",

Self-reported behavior regarding preventive measures will certainly entail a social desirability bias [16] That said, it would prevent inference only if there is systematic bias regarding who is affected by the social desirability bias. We do not have any theoretical reasons to believe so-this is confirmed by Larsen et al. [17] who made use of an experimental design to tackle this issue.

Some might worry about the impact of the national context and time (over the five weeks). It is likely that respondents' attitudes are shaped by what happens in their country, but I cannot think of convincing mobilizing national factors (or time) that would affect the relationship (and not the distributions) of age and attitudes toward COVID-19 and compliance to preventive measures. That said, I replicated the models for the main results using (logistic and OLS) regressions and used age as a categorical variable with values ranging from 18 to 90 to allow for non-linear effects. I then estimated the predicted probability to self-isolate for every two-years change (given the number of observations among respondents in their 80's). That strategy allows to include country fixed-effect and covariates for time and individual-level variables. The dataset does not include the exact date of the interview but as shown in S1 Table, the dates of the field are included. Hence, I included dichotomous variables capturing whether the survey was fielded the first two weeks of April, the last two weeks of April or in the first week of May. For individual-level variable, I include gender, However, one may also want to include region fixed-effects to adopt a more conservative approach in terms of within-country (regional) differences. The 27 countries vary in terms of how many 'regions' they have, but YouGov provides a variable indicating respondent's region based on what is used for the regional quotas (it can be state, L\u00e4nder, region, province, etc.). There are on average 8-9 regions per country. S6 Fig replicates the previous Figure with the only exception that I added 236 region fixed effects. This kind of estimation strategy controls for the fact that people in the UK are in the UK as opposed to another country. However, it also controls for a respondent in, for example, Wales (a region of the UK), for whom the reality related to COVID-19 might be different compared to respondents in other regions in the UK (such as Scotland or England, for example). As can be seen, this does not alter the substantial interpretation of the findings. One could think about adding covariates like 236 dummies to capture every region (minus one as a reference category) in the 27 countries included. Also, mixed-effects logistic and linear regressions could be used (where individuals are nested within countries-or within regions, then within countries). All these approaches do not alter the main findings.",

Hence, there is a burgeoning literature on age and COVID-19, which will be crucial in improving our responses to the pandemic. However, we have no systematic comparative perspective and most importantly age has been conceived to have a linear impact on a variety of dependent variables related to COVID-19. I am not blaming scholars, as even early rigorous work has shown results consistent with this view, in the US but not only.

This behaviour will become especially important when social distancing rules will be loosened. This is surprising because it is very reasonable to expect that those who are more likely to be hospitalized and/or die from the COVID-19 will be more disciplined and dutiful. Whether we focus on psychological reactions such as fear or rational calculus, we always have the same expectation. Not only is this surprising but it is also troubling. Why do we find such results? Clearly, it is not due to a ceiling effect. There is room for improvement in every Figure shown in this research, and especially when dealing with compliance (such as the index or wearing a face mask).
