By comprehensively analyzing the laboratory findings of 1,850 patients, we describe the dynamic changes of the total antibody, spike protein (S)-, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)-specific IgM and IgG levels during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. Our results indicate that the S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG generation of severe/critical COVID-19 patients is one week later than mild/moderate cases, while the levels of these antibodies are 1.5-fold higher in severe/critical patients during hospitalization (P<0.01). The decrease of these IgG levels indicates the poor outcome of severe/critical patients. The RBD-and S-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in virus-free patients (P<0.05). Notably, we found that the patients who got re-infected had a low level of protective antibody on discharge. Therefore, our evidence proves that the dynamic changes of antibodies could provide an important reference for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, and shed new light on the precise management of Pneumonia of China\" added that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibody levels could be used to diagnose the suspected cases. The antibody detection is more simple and faster than the virus RNA load test, and the specimen is more stable and easier to store 7 . Thus, antibody tests can provide an important complementary for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

It is widely recognized that IgM provides the first line of defense during viral infections, while the production of IgG lags behind IgM, and provides long-term immunity and memory. The coronavirus neutralizing antibodies primarily target the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on the viral surface that mediates entry into host cells 9 . The S protein has two functional subunits, the S1 subunit mediates cell attachment, and the S2 subunit mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membrane 10 . Neutralizing antibodies often target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit to block the interaction between the virus and host receptor 11 .

As shown in Table 2 , the patients were divided into three groups based on their age, young (Age<40 years), middle-aged (40-65 years), and older patients (Age>65 years). On admission, though not statistically significant, the RBD-specific antibody level in patients who were older than 65 years was relatively lower than in young and middle-aged patients, while the N-specific antibody levels of older patients were higher, probably because N protein had high immunogenic activity and was abundantly expressed during the early stage of infection, while the level of protective RBD-specific antibody was lower in older patients owing to their weak immune defense system. Besides, we observed that the S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG levels were gradually elevated along with the age increase during hospitalization and on discharge (P<0.05). For example, the median level of RBD-specific antibody in young, middle-aged and older patients was 7.7 AU/ML, 22.4 AU/ML, and 30.7 AU/ML, respectively (young vs. middleage: P<0.0001, middle-age vs. older: P=0.003) during hospitalization. Because the older COVID-19 patients were usually more severe 1 , the more activated immune defense was observed in these patients.",

We analyzed the total antibody level in patients who received CPT at different time points in our cohort. The total IgM and IgG level of 5 patients at 3 days before CPT, and 1-3, 4-7, 7-14 days after CPT were showed in Figure 3 . The results showed that although some fluctuations were observed in 2 patients, the total IgM levels decreased within 14 days after CPT. While the total IgG levels decreased during the first 7 days and increased eventually in the second week. These observations demonstrate that CPT therapy may provide the long-term antibody against the SARS-Cov-2 virus for patients and help the COVID-19 patients recover.

These IgG levels showed greater fluctuation during the hospitalization of non-survivors. The Gini indexes of S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG levels were 0.27, 0.47, and 0.16, respectively, in non-survivors. While in the survivors, these values were 0.08, 0.11, and 0.08, respectively. These results suggested that the S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG played important roles in helping the severe/critical COVID-19 patients recover, and the decrease of these antibody levels may indicate the poor outcome. The patient's disease progression can be monitored by tracking the dynamic changes in the antibody level in COVID-19 patients.According to the latest research, the ratio between neutrophil and lymphocyte percentage is an important index for the prognosis of COVID-19 13 . Patients with lower lymphocyte percentage and higher neutrophil percentage often have a poor outcome 13 .",
