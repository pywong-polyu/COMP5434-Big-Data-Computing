The empirical results show that (1) the joint degree of market efficiency changes widely over time, as shown in Lo's (2004) adaptive market hypothesis, (2) the COVID-19 pandemic may eliminate arbitrage and improve market efficiency through enhanced linkages between the asset markets; and (3) the market efficiency has continued to decline due to the Bitcoin bubble that emerged at the end of 2020.",

A particularly serious price bubble has persisted since 2020, and the market capitalization of Bitcoin reached approximately USD 1.2 trillion on April 14, 2021 1 . This means that Bitcoin's market capitalization has expanded more than 10 times that before March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The changes in market capitalization suggest that investors regard Bitcoin as an asset, but this does not necessarily mean that they do not regard it as, for example, a safe haven. Therefore, economists have been examining the Bitcoin market from two perspectives: (i) whether it is efficient in the sense of Fama (1970) and (ii) whether Bitcoin has the ability to hedge against other assets in the sense of Baur and Lucey (2010) .",

However, consider Fama's (1970) definition of efficient market: If prices are informationally efficient, then there are no arbitrage opportunities among financial assets, and if there are no arbitrage opportunities, then asset market linkages should be confirmed. The existence of linkages implies that there are no hedging abilities (as a safe haven) to reduce financial risk in periods of financial instability. Therefore, market efficiency and hedging abilities against other assets in the Bitcoin market are research issues that should be examined simultaneously. Additionally, we should consider the possibility that market efficiency and hedging abilities in the Bitcoin market vary with time, as discussed in Akhtaruzzaman et al. (2021) and Noda (2021) .",

Specifically, we focus on the market linkages of three financial asset markets (S&P500, Bitcoin, and gold), which have been examined in previous studies, and measure the joint degree of market efficiency based on Ito et al.'s (2014; 2017 ) GLS-based time-varying vector autoregressive (TV-VAR) model. The estimated time-varying joint degree of market efficiency may not only reveal changes in market linkages among the three markets, but also elucidate the time-varying hedging abilities in the three markets. Finally, we discuss what events in financial asset markets cause fluctuations in market efficiency and market linkages. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our method for studying market efficiency variation over time based on Ito et al.'s (2014; 2017) GLSbased TV-VAR model. Section 3 describes the daily prices in the three asset markets (S&P500, Bitcoin, and gold) to calculate the returns and presents preliminary unit root test results. Section 4 presents our empirical results and discusses the time-varying nature of market linkages from the viewpoint of the AMH, which indicates that market efficiency changes over time. Section 5 concludes the paper.",

Therefore, we call \u03b6 the joint degree of market efficiency. When a large deviation of \u03b6 from 0 (both positive and negative) exists, we can regard some deviation from one as evidence of market inefficiency. If there are no arbitrage opportunities between the three markets, we consider the degree to be improving because zeta should be close to zero. In other words, the deterioration of the degree implies that market linkages weaken over time. Furthermore, we can construct a degree that varies over time in this manner when we obtain time-varying estimates in Equation (2). Adopting Ito et al.'s (2014; 2017) method, we estimate the VAR coefficients in each period to obtain the degree defined in Equation (4) in each period. Following Ito et al.'s (2014; 2017) idea, we use a model in which all VAR coefficients except the one that corresponds to the vector of intercepts, \u03bd, follow independent random walk processes.
