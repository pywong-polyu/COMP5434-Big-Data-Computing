In the previous 30 years, the illness burden in the EMR has transmitted from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. In 2019, cardiovascular mortality in the EMR was mostly attributed to ischemic heart disease, the first reason for mortality in 19 countries in the region. Stroke was the second reason for death in nine countries followed by diabetes, which was ranked as the second reason for death in two countries. The prominent nutrition-related NCDs risk factors in EMR include obesity, hypertension, high fasting plasma glucose, and upregulated unhealthy diet consumption. Most of the EMR population are unaware of their NCDs risk factor status. These risk factors, even if treated, are often poorly controlled, therefore, inhibiting their existence by changing the lifestyle to proper dietary habits and sufficient physical activity is mandatory. In this review, the epidemiology and nutrition-related risk factors of NCDs in the EMR will be discussed and illustrated, aiming to scale up action and support decision-makers in implementing cost effective strategies to address obesity and NCDs prevention and management in the region.",

In 2012, the rate of death from NCDs in the EMR (654 per 100,000 persons) was higher than the global rate (539 per 100,000 persons) and is expected to peak by 2030.

Lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid (PA) are all major sources of SFA, and they all raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (60) . Increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and decreased nitric oxide and insulin signaling is some of the impacts of PA, which is found in palm oil (61, 62) . The American Heart Association recommends a healthy dietary pattern that achieves 5-6% of calories from saturated fat (about 13 g of saturated fat per day). In EMR, three countries have exceeded 13% of energy from saturated fats, Djibouti (15.2% of energy) followed by Yemen (13.9% of energy), and KSA (13.5% of energy) (63) (see Table 4 ). In Saudi Arabia, a significant positive association was found between the intake of fats, protein, and calories and the risk of breast cancer. Adjusted odds ratios for the highest quartile of intake versus the lowest were 1.88 for cholesterol, 2.12 for polyunsaturated fat, 2.25 for animal protein, 2.43 for saturated fat, and 2.69 for total energy from dietary intake (64) .",

In addition, because of their large consumed quantities besides their high contents of rapidly absorbable carbohydrates such as different forms of sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, SSB could be responsible for increased type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVDs incidence. Independent of obesity, SSB could serve as a contributor to a high dietary glycemic load leading to inflammation, insulin resistance, and impaired \u00df-cell function (92) . Fructose from any sugar or high-fructose corn syrup may also increase blood pressure, and enhance the cumulative effects of visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, and ectopic fat precipitation due to upregulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (93) .",

Excessive salt consumption is linked to adverse health outcomes, such as the increased risk of hypertension (raised blood pressure), which in turn leads to stroke and heart disease (94) . The current salt intake in the Region averages more than 10 g per person per day, which is double the recommended level set by WHO. In 2010, within EMR countries the highest mean salt intake has been recorded in Bahrain (14 g/day) followed by Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Syria, and Tunisia (11 g/day) (11) (see Table 4 ). Conversely, according to more recently collected data based on urinary excretion, the highest level of salt intake was observed in Morocco (10.6 g/day), while the lowest was observed in Lebanon (5.6 g/day) and the UAE (6.8 g/day) (19) . Based on dietary assessment questionnaires, the highest levels of salt intake were observed amongst Iranian children and adolescents (14.3-16.2 g/day) and adults in Bahrain (9.3-13.3 g/day) and Lebanon (10.9 g/day). Per capita estimates were also high in Oman (11.5 g/day) and Tunisia (10.2 g/day) (19) . Sodium is an essential nutrient necessary for the maintenance of plasma volume, acidbase balance, the transmission of nerve impulses, and normal cell function (95) . In our diet, the main source of sodium is salt, despite it can be attained from sodium glutamate, used as a food additive in many processed foods (95) . In 2019, a diet high in sodium (more than 3 g) was responsible for 44.9 million DALYs and 1.89 million deaths. It was the leading dietary risk factor for causing DALYs (96) . The highest mean sodium intake has been recorded in Bahrain (5.8 g/day) followed by Tunisia (4.43 g/day), then Morocco (4.31 g/day), Libya (4.24 g/day), Qatar (4.21 g/day), Syria (4.18 g/day), and Jordan (4.13 g/day) (11) (see Table 4 ). The EMR population should be aware of how much salt they consume as the disease burden of CVDs, resulting mainly due to salt and subsequent high blood pressure, is very high in the region (97) . In a recent study, the salt intake levels were estimated in 15 out of the 22 countries in EMR, national salt reduction initiatives were identified in 13 countries including Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, KSA, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Tunisia, and the UAE. The majority of countries were discovered to be implementing complex reduction measures, which included two or more implementation strategies. Taxation was the least popular implementation option, whereas reformulation was the most popular (100%), followed by consumer education (77%), initiatives in specialized situations (54%), and front-of-pack labeling (46%) (19) .",

It was the seventh-ruling risk factor for attributable DALYs in 2019 (98) . Being obese is usually linked to an increased risk of hypertension and many NCDs (including diabetes, CVDs, and cancers) (99) . Shifts in eating behavior toward diets containing energy-dense foods, high in fat and sugars, and less physical activity due to the sedentary nature of many forms of work and modes of transportation are contributing to the rise in obesity. The prevalence of obesity in the EMR is the third-highest across all global regions (4). The current prevalence of obesity is estimated at 25.1%, while the prevalence of overweight is around 56.41%. Among the EMR, the gulf countries revealed the highest rate of obesity. The highest prevalence of obesity in EMR has been reported in Kuwait According to the latest estimates, the prevalence of excess BMI in adults in EMR has increased by 3% between 2012 and 2016 (6) (Table 2; Figure 3) .",

The EMR has the highest prevalence of insufficient physical activity than any other region. There is a clear relationship between physical inactivity and country income group globally (4) . In 2016, high-income countries had more than double the prevalence of physical inactivity (37%) than low-income countries (16%), however, the situation is reversed among EMR countries where the insufficient physical activity was the highest in Kuwait followed by Saudi Arabia and UAE while the lowest was recorded in Jordan (6) . According to data from the UAE national health survey 2017-2018, 70.8% of the participants did not fulfill WHO standards for adequate physical exercise.

When compared to non-Emirates, Emiratis had a higher percentage of insufficient physical activity (80.2 and 69.2%, respectively) (105). Physical inactivity is also a modifiable factor that is involved in upregulating the magnitude of NCDs. People who are deficiently physically active have an enhanced risk of all-cause mortality, as compared to those who perform at least 30 min of moderateintensity physical activity on most days of the week. Additionally, physical activity lowers the risk of stroke, hypertension, and depression (106) .",

A study conducted in Jordan revealed that the prevalence of overweight/obese women was 70.6%. Furthermore, the association between age and overweight/obesity was significant (p < 0.0001). The high prevalence of overweight/obesity among women in Jordan was related to high parity and low education level (136) .

Obesity/central obesity was associated with higher educational attainment, physical activity, and being non-Kuwaiti. Smoking history, high blood pressure, higher income, and marital status are all linked to an increased risk of obesity/central obesity (138) . In another cross-sectional study conducted among 3,915 Kuwaiti adults, obesity prevalence was 40.3% (men, 36.5%; women, 44.0%); and overweight prevalence was 37% (men, 42%; women, 32.1%). Obesity prevalence was linked to female sex, age, diabetes history, and marital status in both men and women, but was inversely linked to education level in women. Men were more likely to have an increased waist-to-hip ratio (46.91%) as compared to women (37.9%).

Among the EMR countries, UAE followed by Jordan revealed a significant increase in the percentage change of nearly all the risk factors that are involved in NCDs causing morbidity and mortality (150) . The data and correlation figures included in this study represent evidence that constitutes a significant public health concern about the relationship between unhealthy diet consumption and obesity that further induces other risk factors including (hypertension, insulin resistance, and a systemic inflammatory milieu), leading to NCDs (Figure 1) . It is therefore important to recognize the key therapeutic modalities for treating and prohibiting NCDs, which are to fight against weight gain and obesity and to advocate lifestyle-based therapies; including proper nutrition and regular physical activity. These are the key therapeutic modalities that will reduce the risk of NCDs.

Every increase in dietary cholesterol by 100 mg/day predicted an increase in LDL-c from 1.90 to 4.58 mg/dl depending on the model(78). The 2015 National Lipid Association Recommendations for Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia, recommend limiting dietary cholesterol to <200 mg/d to lower LDLc and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) concentrations, however, insufficient evidence among populations doesn't exist (79). Within EMR, all of the countries are beyond the previous recommended level, particularly Egypt where the recorded dietary cholesterol level was 402 mg/day, followed by Iraq 288 mg/day, then Lebanon 287 mg/day, then KSA and Tunisia 286 mg/day (63) (",
