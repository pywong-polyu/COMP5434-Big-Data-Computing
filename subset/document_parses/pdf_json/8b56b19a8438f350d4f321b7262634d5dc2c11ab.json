            "text": "African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), a lethal hemorrhagic fever of the swine, poses a major threat to the world's swine population and has so far resulted in devastating socio-economic consequences. The situation is further compounded by the lack of an approved vaccine or antiviral drug. Herein, we investigated a novel anti-ASFV approach by targeting G-Quadruplexes (G4s) in the viral genome. Bioinformatics analysis of putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) in the genome of ASFV BA71V strain revealed 317 PQSs on the forward strand and 322 PQSs on the reverse strand of the viral genome, translating to a density of 3.82 PQSs/kb covering 9.52% of the entire genome, which means that 85% of genes in the ASFV genome have at least 1 PQS on either strand. Biochemical characterization showed that 8 out of 13 conserved PQSs could form stable G4s in the presence of K + , and 4 of them could be stabilized by G4 ligands, N-Methyl Mesoporphyrin (NMM), and pyridostatin (PDS) in vitro. An enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-based reporter system revealed that the expression of two G4-containing genes, i.e., P1192R and D117L, could be significantly suppressed by NMM and PDS in 293T cells. In addition, a virus infection model showed that NMM could inhibit the replication of ASFV in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (PAM) cells with an EC 50 value of 1.16 \u00b5M. Altogether, the present study showed that functional PQSs existent in the promoters, CDS, 3 and 5 UTRs of the ASFV genome could be stabilized by G4 ligands, such as NMM and PDS, and could serve as potential targets for antivirals.",

            "text": "African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is an arbovirus that causes African Swine Fever (ASF), a highly contagious and fatal hemorrhagic fever affecting domestic pig and wild boars (both species of Sus scrofa) (Arias and S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno, 2002) . The ASFV genome consists of 170-193 kb linear double-stranded DNA encoding more than 150 Open Reading Frames (ORFs). ASFV infection induces varying clinical forms of the disease ranging from acute to chronic infections, depending on the host's characteristics and the virus strain (Tulman et al., 2009) . Acute forms of the disease are characterized by high fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, anorexia, nasal discharge, increased pulse rate, skin cyanosis, spontaneous abortion in pregnant sows, vomiting, and diarrhea, with death occurring 7-10 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. The mortality rate is often 100% (Costard et al., 2013) . ASFV has severely impacted the global swine industry, as reflected by a hike in pork prices, shut down of export markets, and shortage of swine-derived heparin (S\u00e1nchez-Cord\u00f3n et al., 2018; Vilanova et al., 2019) . This situation is further aggravated by the lack of an approved vaccine or antiviral drug for the prevention or treatment of the disease. Countermeasures to contain ASF outbreaks are limited to strict animal quarantine and implementation of stamping-out policies (Gaudreault et al., 2020) .",

These drugs include: (i) nucleoside analogs that mimic endogenous nucleosides and block viral replication by impairing nucleic acid synthesis or inhibiting enzymes involved in the nucleoside metabolism, such as iododeoxyuridine (Gil-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1979) , rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (RAFIs) (Hakobyan et al., 2018) , and (S)-HPMPA (Arzuza et al., 1988) ; (ii) Interferons such as porcine IFN-gamma or as combined treatment with IFN-alpha (Esparza et al., 1988; Paez et al., 1990) ; (iii) Plant-derived compounds including genistein that impairs type II topoisomerase activity and apigenin derivatives such as genkwanin, a tubulin polymerization inhibitor (Freitas et al., 2016; Hakobyan et al., 2019) ; (iv) antibiotics such as rifampicin and coumermycin A1 that target DNA-directed RNA polymerase and type II topoisomerase, respectively (Dardiri et al., 1971; Salas et al., 1983) ; and (v) Small interfering RNA and CRISPR/Cas9. SiRNA targeting essential genes A151R and B646 L inhibits viral DNA replication (Keita et al., 2010) . CRISPR/Cas9 has been demonstrated to inhibit ASFV by targeting codons 71-78 of the phosphoprotein p30 encoded by the CP204L gene (Keita et al., 2010) . ASFV inhibitors with unidentified targets include lambda and kappa carrageenan, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol, lauryl gallate, and some marine microalgae extracts (Garc\u00eda-Villal\u00f3n and Gil-Fern\u00e1ndez, 1991; Fabregas et al., 1999; Hurtado et al., 2008; Galindo et al., 2011) . However, none of the above compounds has been approved as a treatment for ASFV. There is a dire need to identify or design more inhibitors of ASFV that would provide potential candidates for antiviral evaluation.",

            "text": "While further development of anti-ASFV drugs largely depends on the fundamental knowledge of viral gene properties and functions, comprehensive genomic characterization of ASFV has been obstructed by the complex nature of the virus genome and its lifecycle (Salas and Andr\u00e9s, 2013; Gaudreault et al., 2020) . We explored the value of targeting G-quadruplexes (G4s) in the ASFV genome as an alternative antiviral strategy to circumvent this limitation. G4s are non-canonical nucleic-acid structures formed by guanine-rich sequences that are stabilized through Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base pairing in the presence of monovalent cations such as K + (Burge et al., 2006) . G4s are thermodynamically stable and have much slower unfolding kinetics than other DNA hairpin structures (Lane et al., 2008) . Mounting evidence suggests their involvement in key biological processes, including transcription, replication, and regulation of gene expression, hence are of great therapeutic interest from a drug development perspective (Rhodes and Lipps, 2015; . Targeting G4s has the edge over other DNA structures. For example, it is possible to target G4s in the promoter regions of a gene regardless of the druggability of the gene product. Additionally, there is a likelihood of multiple existing targets since all clinically relevant genes harboring functional G4s are potential druggable targets.",

Targeting both PQSs with G4-binding ligands N-Methyl Mesoporphyrin (NMM) and pyridostatin (PDS) markedly repressed gene expression levels in 293T cells. Moreover, NMM exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the replication of ASFV in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (PAM) cells.

To further assess the response of these PQSs to G4-binding ligands, we examined the interaction of all eight PQSs, i.e., , with two typical G4-binding ligands, NMM and PDS. NMM is exceptionally selective for DNA-G4s compared to duplex DNA and shows rare effects on none-G rich DNA, minimizing off-target effects (Ad\u00e1mik et al., 2016) . PDS is a highly selective G-quadruplex stabilizing ligand that binds to polymorphic G4 structures regardless of sequence variability (Pagano et al., 2018) . To this end, the CD spectra of 5 \u00b5M of each PQS was recorded in the presence of 5 or 10 \u00b5M of each ligand. It was observed that PQS-199, PQS-210, PQS-239, and PQS-296 were non-responsive to both G4 ligands (Supplementary Figure 1) . For PQS-104, PQS-235, and PQS-255, the addition of NMM resulted in an upward shift of the negative peak (\u223c240 nm) and a downward shift in the positive peak (\u223c265 nm) which corresponded with an increase in G4 ligand concentration (Figures 4A-F) . As shown in Figures 4G,H , PQS-157 displayed a downward shift in the two positive peaks (\u223c265 and \u223c295 nm) and a minimal upward shift in the negative peak (\u223c240 nm). As excepted, similar interaction patterns were observed between these PQSs and PDS (Figure 4) . These results are indicative of a favorable interaction of these PQSs with the G4-stabilizing ligands.",

In this regard, the CD melting spectra of each PQS-ligand mixture was recorded at 265 nm over a temperature range of 25-95 \u2022 C with an increasing rate of 5 \u2022 C/min. As shown in Figure 5 , all four PQSs were responsive to stabilization by NMM and PDS, as indicated by a ligand-induced increase in melting temperature ( T m ). Specifically, an increase of 4.1-9.7 \u2022 C and 5.7-13.9 \u2022 C was observed in these four PQSs in the presence of NMM and PDS (Table 1) , respectively.",

The compound showed dose-dependent toxicity against PAM cells with a 50% cytotoxic concentration of 20.12 \u00b5M ( Figure 7A ). For the antiviral assay, PAM cells were infected with ASFV at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of various concentrations of NMM (0-10 \u00b5M). After 72 h of infection, the viral DNA in the supernatant was quantified by qPCR with primers targeting the P72 gene. Our results showed that NMM inhibits the replication of ASFV in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) value of 1.16 \u00b5M (Figure 7B) , suggesting that G4 ligands could serve as potential antiviral agents against ASFV.",

The number of PQSs with \u22653 G-runs (-GGG-) found on either strand was surprisingly low. G2 type of PQS was predominant in both strands. Multiple studies have proven that PQSs consisting of four contiguous GG runs can fold into stable two-quartet G4s (Qin et al., 2015) . Biophysical and functional characterization studies of two-quartet G4s have demonstrated critical roles associated with these G4 motifs. For example, in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, G2 motifs could detect and regulate cellular polyamine levels, forming feedback loops (Lightfoot et al., 2018) . In a separate study, G 2 -PQS located in the 3 UTR of the IE180 gene in pseudorabies virus could regulate the expression of the gene, thus regulating viral replication. This motif serves as a post-transcription regulation element in the presence of G4-binding ligands . Conservation analysis discovered some extremely conserved PQSs in both the coding and promoter regions of the ASFV genome. Conserved PQSs highlight their crucial roles in virus survival and may serve as universal targets for ASFV antiviral drugs.",

Of the 4, 2 G4s in the coding regions of P1192R and D117L could modulate gene expression in the presence of G4 stabilizers. Besides the characterized sequences, D117L and P1192R had 4 and 24 PQSs in their coding sequences, respectively. PQSs in these genes could have possibly served as multiple targets, thereby contributing to the excellent repression of gene expression in the presence of G4 ligands in vitro.

However, the cells die just after entering the mitotic phase. In the presence of an inactive form of Top2p, cells fail to complete DNA replication at the convergence site of the replication fork (Baxter and Diffley, 2008) . Given that P1192R is a key component of the ASFV replication machinery, a replication-defective vaccine has been proposed by generating mutations/deletions within this gene (Coelho and Leit\u00e3o, 2020) .
