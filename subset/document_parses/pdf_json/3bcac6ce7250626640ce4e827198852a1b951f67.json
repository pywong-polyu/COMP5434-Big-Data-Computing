Here, we develop a mathematical model that quantifies the probability of post-quarantine transmission incorporating testing into travel quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time of infection, and quarantine of cases with a known time of exposure. We find that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%, while testing on entry shortens quarantine by at most one day. In a real-world test of our theory applied to offshore oil rig employees, 47 positives were obtained with testing on entry and exit to quarantine, of which 16 had tested negative at entry; preventing an expected nine offshore transmission events that each could have led to outbreaks. We show that appropriately timed testing can make shorter quarantines effective.",

Current strategies to ensure safety often include a 14-day quarantine-either as a consequence of travel or following exposure to an infected person, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) 5 .

This burden is coupled with the associated economic toll and potential impacts on operational integrity. For example, the typical 14-day on-and-off cycle for offshore oil and gas employees is substantially disrupted when quarantine measures are required. These quarantines result in prolonged time periods that crew members are away from their homes. Given the impact of long quarantines on mental health 6,7 , we evaluated the potential that a shorter quarantine combined with testing optimization could achieve reduced transmission of COVID-19 within close-quarter environments where there is a potentially high risk for rapid spread.",

The probability of transmission can be reduced substantially through quarantine and testing 4 . Previous work has focused on the impact of quarantine and testing on population-level COVID-19 incidence and deaths [9] [10] [11] , shortened quarantines upon negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at entry from contact tracing or 7 days after exposure 12 and testing measures that are most appropriate for disease surveillance within a high-risk population (e.g., health-care workers) by examining various testing frequencies and their reduction of secondary infections 13 . Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal duration of quarantine or timing of testing that minimizes the probability of post-quarantine transmission (PQT), defined as one or more infections observed after the quarantine period. Many institutions are relying on testing at entry into quarantine combined with other measures such as symptom screenings, hand sanitizers, and face masks to reduce the risk of an outbreak. However, the majority of COVID-19 transmission is attributable to presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, making screening for symptoms alone inadequate to prevent or interrupt a COVID-19 outbreak 8 . In addition, testing too early postinfection is likely to produce a false-negative result 14 . Thus, symptom-based screening and one-time testing could still entail a significant probability of PQT.",

For example, Australia has implemented a compulsory 14-day quarantine, with testing within 48 h after arrival and between days 10 and 12 of quarantine, to reduce transmission from imported cases 16 . Although these multiple tests aid in case identification, this strategy does not include any reduction of the burden of long quarantine. Understanding the complementarity of quarantine and testing in reducing PQT would provide vital insight into effective strategies that mitigate disease spread in travel-based and contact-tracing based contexts. We applied a mathematical modeling approach to evaluate whether a less burdensome quarantine and testing strategy exist that would be epidemiologically equivalent to the standard 14-day quarantine protocol in reducing PQT. This model accounts for the infectivity profile of an infected individual as well as the temporal diagnostic sensitivity of RT-PCR testing. Across a variety of quarantine and testing scenarios, we estimated the probability of PQT for an infected individual who has not manifested symptoms by the end of the quarantine period. We considered three applications: (i) quarantine for travel, initiated at random times across the infectious course, (ii) quarantine prompted by contact-tracing and therefore initiated early in the infectious course, and (iii) quarantine when the time of exposure is known. We compared the probability of PQT under three testing scenarios: (i) on entry to quarantine only, (ii) on exit from quarantine only, and (iii) on both entry to and exit from quarantine for an infected individual. Across these scenarios, we varied the duration of quarantine and identified the optimal testing date based on that duration. As validation of our recommendations, we analyzed the real-world application of our model-based findings to protocols within the oil and gas industry that prevented offshore transmission.",

For quarantine periods of at least seven days and individuals entering quarantine uniformly across the time course of infection ( Supplementary Figs. 12-15 ), the probability of PQT was lower for shorter latent periods. For shorter quarantines, the relationship between the probability of PQT and latent period is more intricate. For traced contacts entering quarantines of 8 days or longer ( Supplementary Figs. 16-19) , shorter latent periods entailed a lower probability of PQT. For traced contacts entering quarantines of fewer than 8 days, the relationship of the latent period to the probability of PQT is more complex. However, 1day changes in the latent period affect the optimal day to conduct a single test by at most 1 day (Supplementary Fig. 4) .

For quarantines with durations of up to 7 days, we found that testing on exit provided the greatest marginal benefit in terms of reducing the probability of PQT. Testing on entry provided modest benefits in combination with quarantine or with testing on exit. For a quarantine with a duration longer than 7 days, the optimal testing time is on day five or six. Optimal testing times were fairly consistent between travel quarantines and quarantines of traced contacts, differing at most by a day. The benefits of testing later in quarantine were demonstrated by test results of oil crewmembers heading offshore that identified 16 cases testing negative on entry and positive on exit that could easily have resulted in costly and logistically difficult-to-handle offshore outbreaks. When the time of exposure is known, the optimal day for a test for quarantines of a week or more starts at day six of the quarantine, decreasing linearly to day-of-entry for individuals who have been infected for seven or more days. It may seem counter-intuitive that the optimal test for so many identified timings of exposure is on entry, yet testing on entry has so much less impact than testing on exit when the date of exposure is unknown. Indeed, for individuals that are tested after the incubation period (e.g., later than symptom onset), the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR test has started to decline. However, for individuals late in the disease, there is also far less infectivity left in their disease course. The high remaining infectivity of individuals early in the disease course markedly outweighs the low infectivity of individuals late in the disease course in influencing the optimal day of testing to prevent PQT.",

An offshore or military setting is one of the numerous close-quarters environments in modern society where an outbreak can seriously impact operational integrity, leading to compromised safety and adverse economic consequences. Hence, minimizing outbreak risk while maintaining staffing is critical. Testing may allow for the quarantine duration to be reduced without increasing the risk of PQT. For example, many universities have implemented plans for quarantining and frequent testing of students and employees, where resources allow 25, 26 . For businesses and close-quarters environments, the impact of false negatives is a substantially greater issue for operational integrity than false positives. Consistent with the results from our analytic model (Fig. 1A and Fig. 3A) , simulations from a recent agent-based model suggest that testing on exit-or entry and exit-of a 7-day quarantine can avert similar transmission as a 14-day quarantine with no transmission 12 .

Therefore, our qualitative finding of the optimality of testing later in quarantine than on entry are robust to settings with extensive PQT.

Addressing false negatives that inevitably occur at high prevalence can be aided by performing additional tests during quarantine; the impact of any specific set of tests can be quantified within our model framework. In future research, the theory can be applied to evaluate the impact of incorporating recent innovations such as saliva RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests. These alternate approaches could exhibit altered optima. We have not quantified more extensive testing strategies here due to the limited availability of testing, potentially high and largely unknown correlations among false-negative test results for individual cases, and the observed moderate marginal benefit of additional testing performed in the early stages of the disease with lower detection rates ( Supplementary Fig. 28 ).",

Alternatively, if an index case is isolated upon symptom onset, there would be on average 1.21 individuals infected (for an R 0 = 2.5) prior to symptom onset and potentially identified through contact tracing. With a significant chance of traced contacts being infected, reducing PQT becomes increasingly important. However, traced contacts are likely to enter quarantine earlier in disease ( Supplementary  Fig. 31 ). Such an earlier entry necessitates a consequently longer quarantine (generally).

Timely testing enables a shorter quarantine with equivalent benefits to the much longer 14-day quarantine in the prevention of PQT. Our study indicates that the strategy of testing upon entry into quarantine-currently implemented by many institutions and administrative bodies-conveys the least benefit if infection time is unknown. Testing at the exit can provide substantially higher dividends in reducing PQT; or at an optimal timing near one week for quarantines of a week or longer. Our result was substantiated both by our integrative analysis of infectivity and diagnostic sensitivity and by test results demonstrating the utility of tests 96 h into the quarantine of crew members of an offshore oil facility. In determining policies for the duration of travel quarantine and quarantine of traced contacts, full consideration of how timely diagnostic testing aids prevention of PQT is essential to the effective and transparent balancing of lives and livelihoods in times of a global pandemic.",

To infer the diagnostic sensitivity prior to symptom onset, we first used this function to perform a slight extrapolation of the diagnostic sensitivity back to the peak, which occurred slightly prior to symptom onset. Second, to determine the diagnostic sensitivity for the remaining portion of the incubation period, we specified the interpolation function determined by the infectivity and the diagnostic sensitivity from the postsymptom onset and used that interpolation function on the pre-symptom onset infectivity to determine pre-symptom onset diagnostic sensitivity (Supplementary Methods: Diagnostic sensitivity function). This process provides diagnostic sensitivity over the entire course of infection ( Supplementary Fig. 28 ). We assumed that the specificity of the RT-PCR assay was 100% 36 .",

For sensitivity analyses, we also computed the probability of PQT given Poisson-distributed PQT (Supplementary Figs. 29 and 30 ). In our additional analysis accounting for the underlying prevalence within the community, the probability of PQT was defined as the likelihood that at least one infected individual in a cohort became a source of PQT. Similarly, to calculate the probability of PQT given a negative test on the entry for N infected individuals, we estimated the probability that at least one of the cases contributed to PQT.",

Between April 11, 2020 and August 26, 2020, there were 4040 SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests conducted among employees of an oil and gas company coming from two regions (stratified by lab location). A third region that was monitored is not included in our data set, as there was low population prevalence entering quarantine and there were no positive tests. During the early stages of the epidemic, both regions used a 3-day quarantine with testing on entry. On August 13, employees from region A quarantined at home for 7 days, with testing occurring on both entry and exit. While employees were at home, they were asked to practice social distancing in public. Starting on June 25, employees from region B were quarantined in a hotel for 5 days prior to their departure offshore and tested on both entry and exit. The requirements of an employee to go off-shore were (1) passing the components of a screening form used to filter out symptomatic cases and those potentially exposed, (2) temperature screenings, and (3) completion of the quarantine with no positive RT-PCR test. Upon a positive test, the employee initiated a 14-day isolation period and followed through with the company's case management process. After the isolation period, individuals were able to return back to work contingent upon two negative RT-PCR tests. The crew members were 97% male, ranging from 24 to 64 years of age (average age 34 years). Each individual provided informed consent and signed a HIPPA release for the test ordered by XstremeMD, the medical group that collected the tests.

SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity rate between April 11 to August 26, 2020, within two regions where crew members were quarantined: A region A, with a 7-day quarantine, where testing on entry (black) and exit (red) was started on August 13, and B region B, with a 5-day quarantine, where testing on entry (black) and exit (red) was started on June 25. Initially, a 3-day quarantine with testing only on entry was conducted in both regions. The vertical dashed line separates the early strategy of testing on only entry (left) and the later strategy of testing on both entry and exit (right), including follow-up post-quarantine tests conducted 11 days after the initial test (i.e., on day 12). Negative and positive sequential symbols \u2212 and + indicate the test histories. In these results, negative symbols are always conveying results to tests that were previous to the results quantified by the bar above. The number of positive tests (numerator) and the number of tests conducted (denominator) is denoted above the bar in parentheses.",
