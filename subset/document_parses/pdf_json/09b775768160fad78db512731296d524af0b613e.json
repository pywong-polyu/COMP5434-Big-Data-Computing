            "text": "Testing surfaces in school classrooms for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can provide public-health information that complements clinical testing. We monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in five schools (96 classrooms) in Davis, California (USA) by collecting weekly surface-swab samples from classroom floors and/or portable highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) units. Twenty-two surfaces tested positive, with qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 36.07-38.01. Intermittent repeated positives in a single room were observed for both floor and HEPA filter samples for up to 52 days , even following regular cleaning and HEPA filter replacement after a positive result. We compared the two environmental sampling strategies by testing one floor and two HEPA filter samples in 57 classrooms at Schools D and E. HEPA filter sampling yielded 3.02% and 0.41% positivity rates per filter sample collected for Schools D and E, respectively, while floor sampling yielded 0.48% and 0% positivity rates. Our results indicate that HEPA filter swabs are more sensitive than floor swabs at detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in interior spaces. During the study, all schools were offered weekly free COVID-19 clinical testing. On-site clinical testing was offered in Schools D and E, and upticks in testing participation were observed following a confirmed positive environmental sample. However, no confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among students associated with classrooms yielding positive environmental samples. The positive samples detected in this study appeared to reflect relic viral RNA from individuals infected before the monitoring program started and/or RNA transported into classrooms via fomites. The high-Ct positive results from environmental swabs further suggest the absence of active infections. Additional research is needed to differentiate between fresh and relic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in environmental samples and to determine what types of results should trigger interventions.",

But while wastewater surveillance can inform policy and action at regional, city, neighborhood, and building levels, it cannot provide information about virus presence in interior spaces (e.g., building floors and rooms) and can provide only very limited assistance in identifying potential virus exposures. Surface sampling is a type of environmental monitoring that could fill this gap by providing decision-makers information at another level of resolution (between larger-scale environmental monitoring and individual clinical testing).",

Several groups, including ours, have also evaluated viral RNA in HVAC systems with mixed results (Mouchtouri et al., 2020; Nissen et al., 2020; Coil et al., 2021; Horve et al., 2021; Maestre et al., 2021) or with portable air samplers (Ang et al., 2021) . Complexities of HVAC systems (e.g., shared air between rooms, timed operation, difficult to access, variable filter types) have prevented filter-based monitoring from being widely deployed. Portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units have the potential to be an effective mitigation strategy for SARS-CoV-2 transmission indoors (Curtius, Granzin and Schrod, 2021) , and their widespread deployment through the pandemic creates a new opportunity for filter-based environmental monitoring.",

For other surfaces or items, a similar or smaller area, depending on surface or item size, was swabbed in a similar manner to floor samples. For the portable HEPA filters, the intake side filter cover was removed and the whole pre-filter mesh was thoroughly sampled by rotating the swab. After sample collection, the swab tip was snapped off by bending and rolling the swab at the 30 mm breakpoint without touching the sample. The swab tip was preserved in 500 \u03bcl of DNA/RNA Shield until laboratory processing.

We validated our sampling and analytical protocol by sampling in two locations (a private residence and a school classroom) where at least one COVID-19 positive individual was known to have been present within the past week. First, we sampled surfaces at a house where an asymptomatic person who later tested positive for COVID-19 was present for 2 hours. Of the ten surface swab samples collected four days after the exposure, the underside of the chair where the COVID-19 positive person had sat and the floor underneath this space were positive for the virus (Table S2) , with Ct values of 37.2 and 37.6, respectively. Our results confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected on surfaces a few days after the exposure, including surfaces that are not frequently touched (e.g., the floor). High-frequency touched surfaces in workplace environments have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus days after the detection of a positive individual (Marshall et al., 2020) .

In School A, eighteen rooms were monitored weekly from January 28 to August 12, 2021 through floor swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 positive environmental samples were intermittently detected only in Room 7 on March 11, April 22, and May 13, 2021 with negative results in between these dates on April 1, 8, 15, and 29, 2021 ( Figure 1A ). Two of 18 floor samples collected on May 6, 2021 in School A were also positive, but the tube labels were unidentifiable (excluded from Figure 1A) . A fresh set of samples collected from the 18 rooms on May 10 were negative. No clinical positive cases were reported from School A classrooms when surface samples were positive. However, an individual from Room 7 was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 in early February, 2021 (personal communication with school administrator), close to a month before the first positive environmental detection on March 11, 2021. Relic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, i.e., RNA in the environment from degraded and non-infectious virus that has little significance to public health, has been detected from a few weeks after the recovery or termination of quarantine for patients (Fern\u00e1ndez-de-Mera et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) , and up to two months after symptom onset in a single household with two isolated patients (Maestre et al., 2021) . As all identifiable positive environmental samples in School A originated from a single room and showed intermittent positive results throughout a period of more than two months, it is possible that relic RNA shed weeks before the initial detection led to intermittent positive tests during our pilot study. Air filter sampling from single HEPA units in all rooms in School A started on May 20, 2021 in parallel to the floor sampling. All HEPA filter and floor samples collected between May 20th and August 12, 2021 were negative for SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "In School C, eleven rooms were monitored weekly from March 2 to May 25, 2021 through floor swabbing. Preliminary sampling was conducted on February 23, 2021 when diverse surfaces were sampled in the same eleven rooms, and all of these samples tested negative. The only positive sample for SARS-CoV-2 throughout the weekly sampling was collected in Room 2 on April 20, 2021 ( Figure 1B ). Unlike our results in School A, no repeated positives in the same room were observed. All teachers, staff and students associated with the positive room were tested for COVID-19 after the positive floor swab, but no clinical cases were found. A family member of a Room 2 occupant did test positive following the environmental detection (personal communication with school administrator). This positive test for a family member raises an important possibility that needs to be considered: SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be shed by an \"outsider\" (i.e., not someone in the school) and then brought into the sampled environment by someone who is not actively shedding themselves. The mechanical transfer of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on fomites has not been rigorously tested; however, viral RNA has been detected on personal items like clothes, towels, bedding, mobile phones, and shoe soles (Jiang et al., 2020; Santarpia et al., 2020; Goodwin et al., 2021; Redmond et al., 2021) . Transfer of outsider SARS-CoV-2 genetic material to sampled rooms is thus an important possibility that should be considered in the context of environmental monitoring. .

            "text": "We established a different environmental monitoring strategy in Schools D and E, informed by the results from the HEPA filter sampling after a known exposure test detailed in section 3.1. From the first day of sampling, we collected one floor and two HEPA filter samples (one sample from each of two HEPA filtration units) per room. In School D, preliminary testing episodes were conducted in Rooms 11 and 20 on March 10, 16 and 30, 2021. All HEPA filter and floor samples collected during these episodes were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The weekly sampling in School D covered 25 rooms and ran from April 13 to June 8, 2021. Ten HEPA filter samples and one floor sample collected during this period tested positive (Figure 2A ). All positive detections were from a single filter or floor sample at a time; that is, no more than one sample per room ever tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same sampling episode. Positive air and surface samples in schools have been previously reported (Cordery et al., 2021; Crowe et al., 2021) . Air sampling through the use of air filter samplers, electrostatic precipitators and HVAC filters has been demonstrated (Barbieri et al., 2021; Crowe et al., 2021; Maestre et al., 2021; Moreno et al., 2021) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report portable HEPA filter sampling as a strategy for detecting environmental SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Limited participation in on-site clinical testing was observed after the reporting of positive environmental results on most episodes; therefore, no direct links were established between environmental and clinical results. Participation in testing varied between schools and no data is available for schools A, B, and C. Testing in School D varied week to week from 33% to 88% with similar but slightly lower numbers at School E.",

The goal of this sampling episode was to gather further information on the persistence of environmental SARS-CoV-2 RNA in previously positive classrooms. Rooms 5, 6, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 24 were sampled. Each of these rooms except for Room 17 (selected as a negative control) yielded a positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 at some point during the weekly sampling. During this episode, samples from a door jamb, teacher desk and center surface (either a desk, chair, podium, or projector located in the center of the classroom) were collected from each room alongside the two filter samples and single floor sample. One filter sample from Room 6 and one filter sample from Room 15 tested positive once more ( Figure  2A ). Unexpectedly, a filter sample from Room 17 (the negative control) tested positive as well. These results further confirmed the challenges of interpreting positive results in previously positive environments, since positive results could be caused by the resuspension and capture of relic RNA on air filters.",

Of all the samples collected during the campaign, only two-a single filter sample each from Rooms 16 and 24-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2B ). No repeated positives were observed. This cannot be attributed to the HEPA filter replacement strategy as results from School D show that relic RNA capture on new filters is possible.

For both air filter and floor positive samples, 12 out of the 22 Ct scores were in the 37.5-38.0 range. The similar Ct results in air filter and floor samples suggest comparable amounts of virus deposited on the two surface types as the same sample collection method was used for both strategies. Infectious virus has not been recovered from environmental samples with Ct values above 30 (Zhou et al., 2020; Krambrich et al., 2021) , and although possible, further testing is required to assess the state of virus viability on diverse surfaces. The high Ct values obtained in our study also pose a challenge for differentiating fresh from relic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. It is possible that all the positives detected were from relic genetic material as no infected individuals were found through clinical testing, although with the limited participation observed.",

For School D, the mean environmental positivity rate was 5.5% positive rooms per sampling episode (considering filter and floor samples together, and excluding the concluding sampling session). This positivity rate is seven times higher than the 0.78% positivity rate observed for School E. Self-reported positive case data from Schools D and E for the 2021 school year was provided to us by the school district. No positives were reported during the environmental sampling period (April 13 to June 8, 20201) in either of the two schools. However, two positive cases were reported in School D in early February, during limited in-person instruction. No in-person instruction cases were reported in School E throughout the school year. The larger number of prior clinical positive cases and subsequent higher environmental positivity rates in School D highlight the potential link between clinical and environmental results, although they also accentuate the possible role that relic RNA can have on the observed results. Relationships between environmental surface positivity rates and clinical cases in larger populations have been established (Harvey et al., 2021) , showing the potential for environmental monitoring regardless of clinical testing participation. In the present study, the number of positive rooms in schools D and E, eight and two respectively, was higher than the number of self-reported cases (including prior cases). Incomplete testing penetration and relying on self-reporting are likely to miss positive cases. In these situations, the environmental positivity rate may be a useful statistic to inform pandemic management strategies in the absence of a better metric.",

            "text": "The two strategies utilized in this study for SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in the environment, namely floor and HEPA filter sampling, yielded different positivity rates. There were 15 identifiable air filter positives throughout the sampling period in Schools D and E (including the final sampling episode in School D) but only a single positive floor sample. However, two HEPA filter samples were collected from each room, compared to one floor swab. Taking into account the larger sample size, the HEPA filter positivity rates in Schools D and E were 3.02% and 0.41%, respectively, while the floor positivity rates were 0.48% and 0%. These results suggest that HEPA filter sampling is more sensitive than floor sampling. This can be explained because air filters collect and concentrate particles that can contain SARS-CoV-2-including aerosols, droplets, and dust-on a relatively small surface area. These types of particles also deposit on floors, although collecting one sample from larger areas has a lower probability of picking up deposited SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This surface sampling challenge has been previously reported in a high-frequency touched surfaces study (Marshall et al., 2020) . Concentration is desired for environmental samples and has been shown to allow a higher sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples such as wastewater (Jafferali et al., 2021; LaTurner et al., 2021) . Finally, floors are cleaned more frequently than HEPA filters are replaced-although, as previously noted, we observed repeated detection of SARS-CoV-2 in School D classrooms even after filters were replaced.",

Many of these challenges, including near-limit-of-detection virus concentrations and the impacts of site-specific conditions, have also been reported for other types of environmental monitoring, such as wastewater surveillance (Hart and Halden, 2020) . However, the biggest challenge we encountered in our study was the differentiation between freshly shed, relic or outsider SARS-CoV-2. Based on our results, monitoring surfaces and air filters for SARS-CoV-2 can only be complementary to clinical testing if the goal is to find the source of the virus detected. However, when implementing this type of environmental monitoring, it has to be clear that individuals may test negative as the environmental detection could have been due to relic or outsider RNA. Clinical testing as a response to relic or outsider environmental RNA can be useful as it provides certainty that all individuals in the room are negative for the virus. SARS-CoV-2 environmental surface monitoring should also be complementary to clinical testing, if available, because viral shedding can be too low to be detected environmentally; issues that have been described previously (Marshall et al., 2020; Ryu et al., 2020) . If full clinical testing participation is not possible nor available, SARS-CoV-2 environmental surface monitoring is limited to detecting, but not differentiating between freshly shed, relic, or outsider RNA. This strategy can still provide useful information for the pandemic management by setting baseline environmental positivity rates, tracking rate changes through time and responding to those changes with mitigation measures.",
