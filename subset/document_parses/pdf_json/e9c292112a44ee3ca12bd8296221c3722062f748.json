Social work educators and practitioners in both the countries have proactively engaged in international short-term faculty and student exchanges and field placements, research activities and collaborative initiatives such as workshops, international conferences and joint publishing of social work texts. The authors, from Bharathidasan University (BDU) and James Cook University (JCU), noted the success of these original endeavors and particularly their potential to create momentum beyond the initial activity. They saw that focusing on collaborative social work learning in their own smaller contexts could create positive change and impact in ways they did not anticipate. This experience, replicated in other collaborative activities, provided enormous insights and learning on both sides, leading finally to the idea of documenting cross-cultural perspectives from India and Australia. In this chapter the authors present their perspective on the scenario of social work education, research and practice in India and Australia. Besides, brief summaries of all the chapters of the book are also presented.",

Over the past decade, we have collaborated together and with other social work colleagues from Bharathidasan University (BDU) and James Cook University (JCU). We found that our universities have much in common. JCU is located in the tropics and is \"dedicated to creating a brighter future for life in the tropics world-wide, through graduates and discoveries that make a difference\" (JCU, 2019, p. 1). BDU is also located in the tropics, with the goal of \"creating in the region a brave new world of academic innovation for social change\" (BDU, 2020). Our social work departments are both committed to social justice and enhancing the lives of people in our communities (Baikady, Pulla, & Channaveer, 2014) . This shared commitment has been the foundation of our successful collaborations. These commitments and activities align with a broad consensus across the literature (both Indian and international literature) that social work collaborative activity is valuable, that it plays an important role in establishing and increasing the global status of the social work profession and, most importantly, the standard of practice of its graduates.",

An MOU comes from consistent effort that has delivered recognised, valuable and beneficial outcomes for the institutions that subsequently reach a memorandum of understanding.

These various collaborative initiatives and outcomes from social work faculty at Bharathidasan University and James Cook University have occurred over the past eight years, and now culminate in this book project.

Our intention is to bridge the gap in social work education, research and practice by enhancing and creating more relevant learning opportunities for students and researchers. This book will share some of these initiatives, illustrate the need for academic rigour in social work education, enhancement of quality and standards of education, research and practice and share stories of innovation in practice.

This research chapter is based on qualitative data collected by interviews conducted with older persons which illustrates the role of the social work profession. There is a need to face, confront and prepare for death just like society prepares for all life events and happenings. The preparation to death is in the context of, medically and socially, how do we prepare for the \"End of Life\" situation. It is important to plan for death; this planning is also called 'advance care planning'. This has been discussed by incorporating voices from the research participants, and the thematic analysis provides a bird's eye view of the issues faced by older people and highlights the significance of advance care plans.",

Another suggestion could be utilizing some community practices from the many tribal and rural communities in India and blending them with the Western practice.
