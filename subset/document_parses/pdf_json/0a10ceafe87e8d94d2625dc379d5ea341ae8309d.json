In the current study we leveraged the previously discovered association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for circulating cytokine levels to investigate their causal role in severe COVID-19. To this end, we used the promising methodology of Mendelian randomization (MR) to infer potential causality of risk factor-disease associations. This method uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to test for the effect of exposures on outcomes while minimizing confounding bias. We selected a recently introduced, powerful MR approach, i.e., Generalized Summary-data-based MR (GSMR) (2), to detect any potentially causal links between baseline blood cytokine levels and severe COVID-19 disease. We then confirmed the observed links with MR sensitivity analyses and also validated the findings using replication in three independent datasets: 1) replication in an independent East Asian GWAS for severe COVID-19, 2) internal replication using subsets of the discovery GWAS for severe COVID-19, and 3) replication at transcript level using an independent set of SNPs as instrumental variables. Subsequently, for any cytokine showing a significant effect on severe COVID-19 we performed MR analyses with other cytokine levels as outcomes, to examine their regulatory role.",

IL-13 has previously been studied in asthma with its contribution to IgE production, histamine release and inflammation (7), as well as barrier damage in the airways (8) . An important observation supporting its role in severe COVID-19 is provided by a recent study reporting that COVID-19 patients receiving Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody which blocks IL-13/IL-4 signaling, had less severe disease (9) . Warranting further investigations, a study in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice has shown that IL-13 inhibition leads to reduced hyaluronan expression, a polysaccharide which deposits in lungs of severe COVID-19 patients, as well as reduced mortality and disease severity (9) . Our observation of a positive causal effect of IL-13 on a number of other cytokine levels is in line with a previously described key regulatory role of IL-13 in the cytokine storm of COVID-19 patients, where IL-13 recruits inflammatory cells (such as neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and lymphocytes) to the lung mucosae, leading to hyperproduction of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (10) .",

This can be due to the limited power of a modest number of suitable genetic instruments available for MR. Second, cytokines without sufficiently strong genetic instruments were not included in our MR analyses and therefore, our results do not reject potential causal associations for these cytokines. Third, the majority of study populations for our analyses are of European descent, which limits the generalizability of the results to other ancestries. While we independently replicated our findings using GWAS results of severe COVID-19 in an East Asian population (n = 203), we didn't have IL-13 GWAS in the same ancestry. Larger efforts using exposure and outcome GWASs from the same/similar populations are needed to unravel trans-ancestry portability of this finding.",
