Type III interferon (IFN-\u03bb), an innate cytokine that primarily targets the mucosal epithelia, is critical in fighting mucosal infection in the host and has been reported to potently inhibit PEDV infection in vitro. However, how PEDV escapes IFN-\u03bb antiviral response remains unclear. In this study, we found that PEDV infection induced significant IFN-\u03bb expression in type I IFN-defective Vero E6 cells, but virus-induced endogenous IFN-\u03bb did not reduce PEDV titers. Moreover, we demonstrated that PEDV escaped IFN-\u03bb responses by substantially upregulating the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) expression, which impaired the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and dampened the IFN-\u03bb antiviral response and facilitated PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells. We further showed that PEDV infection increased SOCS1 expression by decreasing host miR-30c-5p expression. MiR-30c-5p suppressed SOCS1 expression through targeting the 3 \u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of SOCS1. The inhibition of IFN-\u03bb elicited ISGs expression by SOCS1 was specifically rescued by overexpression of miR-30c-5p.

Interferons (IFNs) are the key components of innate immunity in response to viral infection . Among three types of IFNs (types I, II, and III), type III IFN-lambda (IFN-\u03bb) primarily acts on mucosal surfaces, including epithelial surfaces of the liver, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems, and plays vital roles in controlling viral infection within mucosal surfaces (Mordstein et al., 2010; Pott et al., 2011; Lazear et al., 2015) .

Deng et al. showed that type I and type III IFNs exhibit different modulation in response to PEDV infection and that the discrepancy of type I and type III IFN responses is independent of PEDV endoribonuclease activity (Deng et al., 2019) , suggesting that there are distinct strategies to modify host type I and type III IFN responses during PEDV infection. Because cells generally produce both type I and type III IFNs in response to viral infection, it is challenging to elucidate how viruses escape IFN-\u03bb response separately to type I response. In this study, we used Vero cells, a cell line with a defective function, to produce endogenous type I IFNs. Vero cells are widely used as an in vitro model to study the interactions between viruses and hosts including PEDV. We and others reported that Vero cells respond well to both porcine type I and type III IFNs Shen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017) . IFN-\u03bb is rapidly produced after infection and following engagement with its receptor induces IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to mediate antiviral activity (Kotenko et al., 2003; Dellgren et al., 2009; Lazear et al., 2015) . Binding of IFN\u03bb to its receptor, which consists of two subunits, IFN-\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2, leads to activation of JAK1 and Tyk2, which mediates the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins (Sheppard et al., 2003; Palma-Ocampo et al., 2015) . The suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of Janus family kinase (JAK) signal transducer, simultaneously binds the receptors and JAKs and prevents STATs from accessing the receptor kinase complex (de Weerd and Nguyen, 2012; Palma-Ocampo et al., 2015) . Previous reports demonstrated that SOCS1 is an inducible negative regulator of IFN-\u03bb-induced gene expression in vivo (Blumer et al., 2017) .

The knockdown of endogenous SOCS1 by shSOCS1 #3 resulted in a more than 3.4-fold decrease in PEDV titer ( Figure 3B ) and degraded to 7.2-fold of PEDV titers with IFN-\u03bb treatment in Vero E6 cells (Figure 3B) , indicating that SOCS1 knockdown increases the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bb. Inconsistent with the viral results, SOCS1 knockdown increased the mRNA levels of ISG15, MxA, and IFIT1 ( Figure 3C) . We subsequently investigated the role of SOCS1 overexpression on the anti-PEDV effects of IFN-\u03bb. The transient overexpression of SOCS1 in Vero E6 cells was verified by HA IFA (Figure 3D ). As expected, SOCS1 overexpression substantially elevated PEDV FIGURE 4 | mimics or inhibitor for 24 h, cells were pretreated with IFN-\u03bb or DMEM for 12 h and then infected with PEDV (MOI = 0.1) and harvested at 36 hpi for viral RNA quantification and TCID 50 .

In that study, PEDV actually upregulates IFN-\u03bb expression at 3 h post-infection and then decreased to minimal levels of IFN-\u03bb expression until 12 hpi FIGURE 5 | Mir-30c-5p inhibited the infection of PEDV by regulating the expression of SOCS1. (A) SOCS1 overexpression increased PEDV infection and undermined the anti-PEDV activity of IFN-\u03bb. Vero E6 cells were transfected as described with pCAGGS-HA, pCAGGS-SOCS1, and miR-30c-5p for 24 h, followed by incubation with porcine IFN-\u03bb (100 ng/ml) or DMEM for 12 h.

In agreement with this, we did not observe increased IFN-\u03bb expression at 12 hpi ( Figure 1A) . They did not show the IFN-\u03bb expression at the late stage of PEDV infection. In the current study, we observed that PEDV elicited substantially increased IFN-\u03bb expression in Vero E6 cells only after 24 hpi (Figure 1A) , which is consistent with the results observed in porcine enteroids following PEDV infection (Li et al., 2019) , indicating that PEDV has evolved mechanisms to escape IFN-\u03bb antiviral response instead of IFN-\u03bb production at the late stage of infection. It is possible that PEDV exploits varying strategies at different infection stages. This is also observed in other RNA viruses such as influenza virus (Chung et al., 2018) . To prevent over-activation of the IFN signaling pathways, the host evolves a few negative regulators of IFN signaling, and SOCS1 is one of the canonical inhibitors of IFN signaling (Shao et al., 2013) . SOCS1 has been reported to be exploited by multiple viruses to abrogate IFN antiviral signaling (Shao et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018) . We showed that PEDV significantly induced the expression of SOCS1 at the late stage of infection (Figure 2) . As expected, increased SOCS1 impaired the antiviral ISGs expression and impaired the anti-PEDV activity of IFN-\u03bb (Figure 3) . This is in agreement with the results of TGEV, another swine alphacoronavirus (Ma et al., 2018) . Therefore, unlike previously published studies with the modification of IFN production mediated by viral proteins such as nsp1, our study found that PEDV largely evades innate immunity of IFN-\u03bb by modulating the antiviral signal of IFN-\u03bb rather than manipulating the production of IFN-\u03bb at the late stage of infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1727, "end": 1744, "text": "(Li et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2057, "text": "(Chung et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2260, "text": "(Shao et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2378, "text": "(Shao et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2396, "text": "Wei et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2413, "text": "Ma et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2730, "end": 2747, "text": "(Ma et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1403, "end": 1413, "text": "Figure 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1632, "text": "(Figure 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2523, "text": "(Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2639, "end": 2649, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "MiRNA plays a vital role in regulating gene expression through post-transcription modification.

(F) Transient expression of SOCS1 disrupted the IFN-\u03bb antiviral response. Vero E6 cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03bb after being transfected with SOCS1 for 24 h. The cells were collected for RT-qPCR analysis of ISG15, MxA, and IFIT1 expression relative to that of GAPDH after 24 h of stimulation. Error bars, mean \u00b1SEM.

(A) Schematic diagram of the left panel is the predicted target sites of miR-30c-5p in the SOCS1 3 \u2032 UTRs of seven representative mammals. The predicted target sites and mutated target sites of miR-30c-5p are underlined and mutated as indicated (right panel). (B) Results of the luciferase assay. Vero E6 cells were co-transfected with SOCS1 wild-type or mutant luciferase vectors (500 ng) and 160 nM of miR-30c-5p mimics or NC mimics, miR-30c-5p inhibitor, or NC inhibitor, and the luciferase activity was analyzed at 24 h after transfection. FL, firefly luciferase; RL, Renilla luciferase. (C) The suppression of SOCS1 protein levels by miR-30c-5p under PEDV-uninfected and -infected conditions. Vero E6 cells were transfected as described in the legend for panel B for 24 h, followed by infection with PEDV (MOI=0.1) or mock infection with DMEM, and the samples were collected at 36 h for Western blotting of SOCS1 or \u03b2-actin. Quantifications were normalized to those of uninfected NC. (D,E) MiR-30c-5p increased the anti-PEDV activity of IFN-\u03bb.
