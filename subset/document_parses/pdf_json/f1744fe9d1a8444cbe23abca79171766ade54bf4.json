            "text": "Purpose of review Hepatitis C (HCV) is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in elderly individuals. This patient population previously experienced suboptimal outcomes with interferon-based regimens. Unfortunately, patients aged 65 years and older were underrepresented in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials with newer direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies. Since the advent of second-generation DAA in 2013, numerous robust realworld experiences highlighting the efficacy and safety of DAA in the elderly have been published. This review article summarizes the cascade of care for hepatitis C from diagnosis to cure from an evidence-based perspective of the aging population. Recent finding In a large study from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the overall sustained virologic response (SVR) of 15,884 patients treated with DAA regimens was 91.2%. These newer therapies remained highly effective in the subset of patients aged 65 years and older with SVR rates above 90%. A Spanish National Registry reported outcomes in patients \u2265 65 years old treated for HCV with oral DAA regimens over a 2year period. The overall SVR was 94% in the study of 1252 subjects. Summary Current real-world data imply DAA treatment regimens remain highly effective and safe in elderly patients when compared to the general population.",

The initial HCV antibody test, if positive, requires another specimen for hepatitis C RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a confirmatory test. Infrequently, patients exposed to HCV can spontaneously clear the virus during the initial 6 months of the acute phase. A positive HCV antibody proves exposure whereas a positive HCV RNA confirms diagnosis of active infection. Most laboratories now offer reflex HCV RNA testing, which allows a positive antibody test to trigger an automatic RNA test from the same specimen. Automatic reflex RNA testing shortens the screening process allowing for quicker linkage to care. Table 1 lists the CDC recommendations of who should be tested for HCV.",

The interactive video platform is used to build knowledge and expertise in rural areas allowing greater access to specialists in real-time collaboration with local community providers. Project Echo effectively tele-mentors 50 programs in 39 countries spreading knowledge beyond borders [16] . Alternatively, the Veterans Affairs (VA) system, the largest hepatitis C care provider in the United States, developed an interdisciplinary model. A VA medical clinic in Indianapolis increased hepatitis C treating capacity by incorporating pharmacists. After the initial visit with an HCV clinic provider, subsequent visits were referred to the pharmacist-run HCV clinic. Utilizing three pharmacists for five half days per week allowed up to 35 additional patient appointments. The implementation of this model doubled the number of HCV patients with comparable efficacy in regards to SVR [17] .",

Transmission of an HCV strain with preexisting resistance may also occur despite the patient lacking previous exposure to hepatitis C therapy. The clinically impactful resistance-associatedsubstitutions (RAS) mostly develop against NS5A inhibitors and NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens. RAS against NS5A inhibitors can persist for years and are more fit than others with Y93H being the most prevalent RAS across genotypes [18] . The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends baseline testing for NS5A RAS in genotype-specific cohorts. Genotype 3 treatment-na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis and treatment-experienced patients with or without cirrhosis, in whom sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is being evaluated, should receive NS5A RAS testing at baseline. If Y93H is present, weight-based ribavirin should be added or a different treatment regimen should be prescribed. With respect to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, baseline resistance testing should be considered in those infected with genotype 1a who are treatment-experienced with or without cirrhosis. If Y93H is present, a different treatment regimen should be prescribed. Lastly, baseline resistance testing is recommended in all genotype 1a patients, including both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced, for whom elbasvir/grazoprevir is being considered and a different regimen should be prescribed if Y93H is present [18] . In summary, the specific genotype and presence of NS5A RAS with certain treatment regimens may result in exponentially higher drug resistance, ultimately impacting SVR.",
