The subjects were classified by the Glittre-ADL test and handgrip strength according to the functional capacity. Results: This study has shown initially that subjects with abnormal functional capacity had a higher value for resistance (p < 0.05), reactance area (Ax, p < 0.01), impedance modulus (Z4, p < 0.05), and reduced dynamic compliance (Cdyn, p < 0.05) when compared with subjects with normal functional capacity. This resulted in significant and consistent correlations among resistive oscillometric parameters (R=\u22120.43), Cdyn (R=\u22120.40), Ax (R = 0.42), and Z4 (R = 0.41) with exercise performance. Additionally, the effects of exercise limitation in COPD were adequately predicted, as evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) obtained by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The best parameters for this task were R4-R20 (AUC = 0.779) and Ax (AUC = 0.752). Conclusion: Respiratory oscillometry provides information related to functional capacity in COPD. This method is also able to predict low exercise tolerance in these patients. These findings elucidate the physiological and clinical meaning of the oscillometric parameters, improving the interpretation of these parameters in COPD patients.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) accounts for 6% of deaths worldwide, with more than 90% occurring in low-to middle-income countries. 1 This disease is usually caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases, resulting in persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and alveolar abnormalities. 2 At present, spirometry is considered the gold standard in assessing airflow limitation in COPD. However, spirometry requires high cooperation on the volunteers and great effort in executing the expiratory maneuver. This may result in variation in the quality of the test results since this procedure can temporarily cause several changes in the bronchomotor tone, leading to underdiagnosis. [3] [4] [5] It was previously reported that only 30% of patients could perform maneuvers that meet all the quality standards defined by ERS/ATS, and the proportion is even lower in the elderly. 6, 7 The forced oscillation technique, also known as respiratory oscillometry, is a non-invasive approach to investigate mechanical properties of the respiratory system by assessing airway impedance (pressure/flow signal). The method is based on applying low amplitude oscillatory pressures into the airway entrance during spontaneous ventilation. 8 Another significant advantage is that oscillometry can provide detailed information on the respiratory system's mechanical characteristics that are complementary to that provided by spirometry. Due to these characteristics, oscillometry has emerged as a powerful method to extract clinically relevant information and provide insight into the mechanisms responsible for smoking-induced respiratory diseases. Since this method was introduced in the mid-1950s, 9 it has been applied in COPD by many investigators. 10 Areas of application included the diagnosis of precocious respiratory abnormalities in smokers and early-stage COPD, [11] [12] [13] [14] the categorization of airway obstruction level, 15 and the evaluation of bronchodilator response. 16 This method has been continuously improving in the last decades and has reached a high level of sophistication, currently representing the state-of-the-art in assessing lung function. 17 Despite several attractive characteristics of oscillometry, this method has not been widely introduced into clinical practice. 17 This limitation arises, at least in part, because the physiological or clinical meaning of the derived parameters is not clear. The functional abnormalities associated with COPD cause dyspnea on exertion, reduced exercise capacity, and poor quality of life. 18 The ADL -Glittre test is an effective, easy-to-apply, valid, and reliable test for assessing functional capacity in COPD 19 and interstitial lung disease. 20 It can be considered more descriptive than the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess functional capacity, as it involves, in addition to walking, activities such as sitting and getting up from a chair, going up and down steps, and arm movements with weight support, tasks considered difficult for these patients. 21 This method is sensitive and specific to distinguish COPD patients with abnormal and normal functional capacity. 22 The loss of muscle strength is directly linked to physical performance, mobility, and functionality in patients with COPD. The handgrip test proved to be valid in assessing the strength and is considered cheap, simple, easy and can be performed with a portable measurement tool. [23] [24] [25] Therefore, the ADL -Glittre and the handgrip test have the potential to elucidate the physiological and clinical meaning of oscillometric parameters.",

The studied indexes were obtained using the best curve, which was selected based on the higher values of FEV1 plus FVC.

The pressure input (P) was measured with a Honeywell 176 PC pressure transducer (Microswitch, Boston, MA, USA), and the airway flows (V') with a screen pneumotachograph coupled to a similar transducer. The signals were digitized at a rate of 1024 Hz by a personal computer, and a fast Fourier transform (F) was computed using blocks of 4096 points with 50% overlap to evaluate respiratory impedance [Zrs=(F (P)/F(V')]. Three acceptable tests of 16s were performed, and the result adopted was the mean score. To exclude outlying values, the coefficient of variation of respiratory resistance at the lowest oscillation frequency (4 Hz) for the three measurements was \u226410%. The test was considered acceptable if the volunteers presented stable tidal volumes and rates and were free of pauses. Common artifacts such as swallows, coughs, and leaks were identified by evaluating flow and pressure signals, and the acquisition was repeated until three stable and without artifacts were obtained. Only exams with coherence function \u22650.9 in the whole frequency range studied were accepted to reduce the influence of spontaneous breathing.",

            "text": "A functional limitation is a common and important finding in patients with COPD, 2 which is directly related to increased mortality, 43 a higher frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations, 44 and a reduction in quality of life. 21 The decrease in exercise capacity in individuals with COPD (Table 2 ) may be explained by ventilatory limitation, abnormalities in gas exchanges, and cardiovascular dysfunction. Figure 1 shows how the drop in physical performance detected by the Glittre-ADL test impacts the respiratory mechanics evaluated by oscillometry. It is generally agreed that abnormal changes affecting primarily the lungs will also have significant systemic effects. Figure 1 supports this hypothesis and adds new information, revealing increased resistance values (R4, R20) in patients with Glittre-ADL test >210 s. The observed increases in ventilation heterogeneity (R4-R20, fr), respiratory work (Z4), elastic properties (Ax), and reduced compliance (Cdyn) were also in line with the changes typically observed in patients with COPD and exercise limitations. These changes reflect the worsening of airway obstruction, increased secretion, and changes in the pulmonary parenchyma in these patients. 2 Considering the Handgrip as a reference method for detecting functional abnormalities, Figure 2 shows that the changes observed in oscillometric parameters were similar to those observed using the Glittre-ADL test as a reference. Interestingly, changes observed in oscillometry using Glittre-ADL test and Handgrip analysis are in close agreement with that previously observed using the 6MWD as a reference. 27 In agreement with the involved physiology, 2 Table 3 shows reasonable and significant direct associations between Glittre-ADL test time, Handgrip analysis, and parameters related to airway obstruction (R4), elastic properties (Ax), and respiratory work (Z4). The inverse association observed with Cdyn and Glittre-ADL test time and the direct correlation observed with Handgrip analysis are also consistent with these principles. The systemic effects due to lung abnormalities may also explain these relationships. The results presented in Table 3 are in close agreement with that obtained recently by Yamamoto et al 27 using the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) as an index of exercise tolerance. Reasonable and significant associations were obtained among oscillometric parameters and 6MWD. The cited authors attributed the observed changes and associations to airflow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation as predominant factors defining exertional dyspnea and disease severity in COPD. These results also reflect Zeng et al, 28 who recently found correlations between resistive and reactive parameters with 6MWD in COPD. They are also in line with that obtained by Yamamoto et al. 45 The authors observed that oscillometric parameters correlated with exertional ventilatory parameters and reflected exercise tolerance in COPD subjects during cycle ergometer tests. Similar results were also observed in adults with sickle cell anemia, analyzing the correlations among 6MWD and oscillometric parameters. 46 The new information in Table 3 shows that these correlations extend to the ADL -Glittre test and Handgrip analysis. The associations observed in Table 3 are also consistent with the weak to moderate correlations between respiratory mechanics evaluated by spirometric analysis and 6MWD 47, 48 and the ADL-Glittre test. 19 Table 4 and Figure 3A show that R4-R20 achieved the highest accuracy among the oscillometric parameters in predicting exercise limitation, as evaluated by the ADL-Glittre test. MLR revealed that R4-R20 was the most predictive parameter in line with these findings. This high performance probably occurs because this parameter reflects ventilation heterogeneity, which results in abnormalities in gas exchanges. Other interesting findings were that fr and AX could also predict exercise limitation. It is also noteworthy that the three parameters mentioned achieved high accuracy in predicting exercise limitation (AUC >0.90).",

First, it was a single-center study; hence, the results may not represent the entire patient population. One could argue that we only recruited 60 subjects and that the exact prediction accuracy remains unknown. Future studies should include a larger number of subjects. However, this preliminary analysis significantly contributes to an important debate in the literature concerning the clinical and physiological meaning of the oscillometric parameters and provides support for using these indexes in predicting the exercise performance in COPD.",

It has been shown that the oscillometric parameters adequately described the presence of exercise limitation. This resulted in significant and consistent correlations among these parameters and indexes of functional capacity. The ROC analysis demonstrated that oscillometric parameters achieved adequate accuracy and that R4-R20 and Ax achieved high accuracy in predicting poor Glittre-ADL test and handgrip strength. These results support and add new information concerning Glittre-ADL and Handgrip analysis to previous findings using 6MWD. These results suggest that oscillometric parameters are associated with abnormal exercise performance in COPD, and may help predict poor functional performance in these patients.",
