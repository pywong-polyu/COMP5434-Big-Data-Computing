[1] [2] [3] In contrast, less is known about the short-and long-term cardiac consequences of COVID- 19 . First, researchers in Italy described a high incidence of symptoms among recovered COVID-19 patients. 4 Then, researchers in Germany, China, and the USA described the extent of cardiac injury in recovered patients using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. [5] [6] [7] These studies, however, lacked baseline imaging. Lately, two longitudinal echocardiographic studies have analysed the occurrence of persisting cardiac pathology following COVID-19 infection. 8, 9 However, these studies had opposing results, and were subjected to selection bias because echocardiography was performed during hospitalization only secondary to clinical deterioration. Recently, we have described our experience in consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection undergoing routine and 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and lung ultrasound during hospitalization for acute COVID-19 infection. 10, 11 2D-STE is a major advancement in the understanding of myocardial function and provides additive value regarding prognosis and disease progression to the traditional echocardiographic imaging. It is more robust and sensitive in evaluating RV and LV dysfunction than other routine echocardiographic parameters in specific populations, such as patients with chemotherapy induced cardiac injury 12, 13 and heart failure. 14 Therefore, our primary aim was to evaluate RV and LV myocardial function and haemodynamics using routine and STE parameters in patients recovering from COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, we compared these parameters with those assessed during the hospitalization to analyse whether RV and LV function improve or deteriorate after recovering from the acute stage of the disease.",

Although all strain values are negative values, they were presented as absolute values where a decrease in strain (hence, lower absolute value) is observed when RV or LV function deteriorates.

The present longitudinal study is an extension of those studies, investigating for persistence of haemodynamic and/or STE echocardiographic abnormalities, $3 months after hospitalization for the acute infection.

During the acute phase of COVID-19 infection RV dilatation and dysfunction are associated with shortened pulmonary acceleration time suggestive of increased pulmonary vascular resistance. There are many reasons for increased pulmonary vascular resistance in hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 infection that may precipitate acute RV failure. These conditions include pulmonary embolism, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, decrease in lung volume, excessive positive end-expiratory pressure (in mechanically ventilated patients), super-infection with other types of pneumonia, the use of a-agonists, elevated left atrial pressure due to concomitant LV dysfunction, or combination of the above. Irrespective of its cause, the increase in RV afterload during acute COVID-19 infection results in decreased cardiac output and systemic blood pressure, which may result in decrease in coronary perfusion to the right ventricle, and additional reduction in RV contractility. 3 Furthermore, the decrease in trans-septal pressure gradient between the right and left ventricles may result in septal bowing at the expense of LV, resulting in abnormal orientation of helical myofibrils and further reduction in cardiac function. In this study, we show a marked increase in pulmonary acceleration time suggestive of substantial improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance 3 months after hospitalization with acute COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, reduction in RV strain was associated with poorer lung ultrasound score, suggesting that reduced RV STE during acute infection was related to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance imposed by the worsened lung involvement. The reversal of the spiral of events described above, during recovery from acute infection, probably explains the almost uniform improvement in RV function observed already 3 months after hospitalization.",

Interestingly, prevalence of cardiac involvement was independent of pre-existing conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness. 5, 7 Brito et al. 28 described patterns of myocardial involvement with varying degree of myocardial dysfunction in a young, otherwise healthy cohort of college athletes, assessing STE and CMR after an unknown recovery period from COVID-19 infection. However, Clark et al. 29 recently published a research letter showing a much lower prevalence than initially indicated, suggesting that the true burden remains unclear and might have been overstated by earlier CMR-based publications. Similar to these MRI-based reports, recent echocardiographic studies in survivors of COVID-19 had discordant results. Moody et al. 8 found that COVID-19 survivors had persisting adverse remodelling in $30% of their population. However, their cohort was extremely selected because they included only patients who had an echocardiography performed due to a clinical complication during their hospitalization. Furthermore, the baseline echocardiography performed during hospitalization was not performed using the same protocol, machine and personnel, as the follow-up echo. In agreement with Moody, \u00d6 zer et al. 30 recently published a comprehensive LV global function analysis with STE in patients recovered from COVID-19. Their findings, with a similar cohort to our study, demonstrated impaired LV-GLS values, in 30% at 1-month follow-up, and even 57% in those who developed myocardial injury during hospitalization.",

This suggests that EF should not be used as the lone routine echocardiographic parameter to follow-up these patients. Once STE was performed, a quarter of patients still had abnormal LV longitudinal function at the follow-up evaluation, based on an STE recommended cut-off. 11 Moreover, on contrary to RV, in the LV there is no significant improvement in the amount of patients with abnormal LV4CLS values (26 patients during the acute phase vs. 20 patients at the follow-up clinic). Recent data in patients with other types of myocarditis and cardiomyopathies demonstrated that conventional echocardiographic parameters, such as EF do not correlate with the amount of LV myocardial oedema or fibrosis by MRI. In contrast, global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain correlated significantly with the amount of oedema by T2-weighted imaging 31 and myocardial fibrosis by LGE. 32 Thus, it is clear that for optimal follow-up of patients with subtle myocardial injury after COVID-19 infection, STE is superior to conventional echocardiography. Interestingly, once STE was used, 33 An 'adult type' multisystem inflammatory syndrome similar to that described in older children and adolescents 34 might be another cause, however, further data and biomarker evidence are needed to support this.",

The fact that a significant proportion of patients did not show for follow-up probably led to selection bias and over-estimation of the severity of echocardiographic pathology in patients recovering from COVID-19 infection. Speckle-tracking echocardiography after COVID-19 recovery haemodynamics and even LV strain are within the normal range in the majority of recovered patients, and that clinically meaningful decrease in LV strain from normal to abnormal range, during the time period between hospitalization to 3-month follow-up, is very rare. Because LV systolic abnormalities are mostly subclinical, data on the value of interventions based on such changes are still lacking. However, such subclinical changes in LV function have been associated with a worse prognosis in other types of cardiac disease, 35 and even in the community, 36 thus it seems prudent to follow up carefully on patients with such subclinical LV dysfunction, preferably using speckle strain imaging. Furthermore, the use of beta-blockers, ACEinhibitors, and/or angiotensin receptor blockers may be warranted in some patients, especially if LV dysfunction persists, or worsens. Although we observed a significant degree of RV dysfunction at the time of acute infection with COVID-19, this study shows that RV function usually improves following convalescence from pulmonary disease. However, in the rare patient in which RV dysfunction persists, a thorough evaluation for persistence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance should be considered.",

Patients did not have echocardiography prior to their COVID-19 illness. Thus, it is not possible to exclude that persistent findings after COVID-19 infection may have been present and fixed prior to the initial illness. Moreover, STE analysis, has its own inherited limitations, including imperfect feasibility, mainly affected by image quality, load dependency, and re-test variability. Also, LV4CLS is not a clear substitute for LVGLS. Comparison between baseline and follow-up echo exams, especially for sub-group analyses, in our study should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of patients. We believe that our results should serve as incentive to further explore evolution of cardiac involvement in patients recovering from COVID-19 infection in larger series.The results of this study show that subtle LV dysfunction may persist after acute COVID-19 infection despite resolution of the pulmonary disease. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that LVEF, LV....................................................................................................................................................................................................................",
