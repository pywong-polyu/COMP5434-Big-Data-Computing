Groups are no longer meeting in person and so online meetings, webinars and zoom chats have become a regular occurrence. Fundraising was highlighted as an area of concern for such groups.

Adult representatives from any group supporting people with rare diseases were eligible to complete the survey which was open from mid-July until mid-September 2020. Rare disease collaborative groups who have been involved in research conducted by the Rare Disease Team at QUB previously, and provided consent, were emailed directly and invited to participate in this study. Ethical approval was provided by the Faculty of Medicine, Life and Health Sciences, QUB research ethics committee (MHLS 20_72).

The survey was promoted online via rare disease local charities and QUB; other methods of dissemination may have helped to generate more respondents. \u2022 The time constraints associated with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 restrictions meant the questions were only applicable for a short period of time. \u2022 It is possible that low staffing issues, due to current circumstances such as furlough, meant the survey was missed by many groups. Email responses from contacts within these groups often included the phrase, 'I am currently on furlough' . Resources are stretched at this time and many groups do not have the capacity to take part in activities beyond their basic duties. \u2022 Although the use of an 'online' survey has many advantages, it could also be a limitation for those who do not use online platforms and who are not familiar with browsing the internet. \u2022 The survey was only available in the English language; therefore it is possible that this may have introduced bias to the sample in that potential respondents may have been excluded.
