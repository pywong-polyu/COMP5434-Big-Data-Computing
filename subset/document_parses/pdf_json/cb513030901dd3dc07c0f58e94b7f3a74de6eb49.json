Inflammasomes comprise a sensor that detects pathogens (a Nod-like receptor protein, NLR), an adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and a protease that cleaves the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL) 1 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, which are then released from cells. Cells with active inflammasomes undergo a form of cell death called pyroptosis that results in the expulsion of pathogens from the cell and inhibits their intracellular replication. Mutations in the inflammasome sensor NLRC4 cause spontaneous activation of the inflammasome and result in autoinflammation with infantile enterocolitis (AIFEC). Patients with AIFEC experience episodic enterocolitis, fevers, arthralgias, and severe episodes of autoinflammation including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [1, 2] .",

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an inflammatory response that both is critical to providing protection against severe disease and contributes to morbidity and mortality. Notably, as compared to patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 disease, patients with severe disease exhibit increased levels of the inflammasome-regulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [3] , and recent observational studies have begun to assess the efficacy of blockade of these cytokines in disease outcomes [4] . Immunosuppressive therapies such as dexamethasone and the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab provide mortality benefits to patients with severe COVID-19 infection [5, 6] . Nevertheless, individuals who lack critical immune components may fail to clear the virus or become reinfected [7, 8] , demonstrating the balance of immune forces at play during infection. How chronic activation of signaling networks that regulate the secretion of IL-1 and IL-18, or their suppression in the setting of autoinflammatory diseases, contributes to COVID-19 remains an outstanding question.",

IL-1\u03b2 and inflammasome activation have been implicated as predictors of severe disease, and early evidence suggests that IL-1 inhibition may provide benefit to patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 [3, 4, 9, 10] . Indeed, this patient's disease course may have been improved by anakinra and prednisone and could explain his relatively mild infection. Further probing for possible exposures at the time of the initial fever, initially thought to be due to the vaccine, may have increased the suspicion of active SARS-CoV-2 infection and prompted earlier testing and treatment (eg, monoclonal antibody therapy).",
