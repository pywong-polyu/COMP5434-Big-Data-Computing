Despite newer antibiotics gaining light, there is an unending demand for more therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, substantial continuous endeavors are been undertaken to come up with novel strategies to curb the disease, the stepping stone being nanotechnology. This approach is instrumental in overcoming the anomalies associated with conventional therapy owing to their intriguing attributes and leads to optimization of the therapeutic effect to a certain extent.

The worst affected geography is the Asian subcontinent with India reporting the highest tally [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Owing to the limited number of approved anti-TB drugs, the emergence of multi and extensively drug-resistant strains of TB has been a problematic issue. In the case of drug-susceptible cases, the initial phase consists of 6 months of combinatorial treatment commonly called \"drug cocktail\" which consists of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA). This is further followed by a continuation phase of 2 months comprising of INH and RIF.

On the other hand, extensive drug resistance occurs on developing resistance to INH and RIF along with fluoroquinolones. In the case of INH resistance, the treatment regimen incorporates 6 months of RIF, EMB, PZA, and levofloxacin [7] [8] [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 593, "end": 596, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 597, "end": 600, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 601, "end": 604, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An extensive literature survey was carried out on databases such as Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar.

The inhalational route of drug administration serves as the primary option for delivering dry powder inhalers or aerosols, since they provide a preferential accumulation of drugs at the target site in addition to being non-invasive and overcoming gastrointestinal drug degradation. They can thus also restrict drug exposure to healthy cells. However, they were also associated with certain loopholes such as bolus drug release culminating into severe lung toxicity, short residence time, and poor aqueous solubility [10] . The other contemporary TB treatment includes oral and parenteral dosage forms. However, they lead to sub-therapeutic levels attributable to poor drug distribution to the lungs, ultimately causing drug-resistant strains [11] . The commercially available conventional anti-TB therapy is associated with innumerable glitches such as metabolic instability, low solubility, low permeability, a large number of allied side effects especially hepatotoxicity, and high drug load [3, 12] . Moreover, the combination therapy also leads to complex dosing schedules frequently causing inadequate therapeutic effect [7] . Therefore, these drawbacks with conventional therapy led to the paradigm shift towards nanotechnology-engineered delivery systems. The nanocarrier systems have established their supremacy over conventional therapy since they have the ability to incorporate both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. They offer advantages such as the drastic reduction in size hence providing high surface volume ratio, the protection of drug moiety from degradation, the targeted and site-specific delivery, follow a controlled release mechanism, and could be easily functionalized to modify drug therapeutic profile. Additionally, one of the prime outlooks might be the biocompatible nature of these systems [13, 14] . Furthermore, the lipid-based systems hold special significance, since the pathogen, i.e., Mtb, relies on the lipidic membrane to ingress with the host body and egress from the same [15] . Furthermore, nanoparticulate systems possess intrinsic antimycobacterial activity along with serving as a vehicle for various anti-tubercular drugs, hence being instrumental in reducing the dosing frequency along with associated side effects. Additionally, nanoformulations incorporating inorganic metals have antibacterial activity. Silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrated promising in vitro antimycobacterial activity [16] .

Furthermore, the hydrophilic outer core and hydrophobic inner core allow for varied drugs to be entrapped within it [20] . All these abilities explicitly justify the use of NPs in TB therapy. Therefore, NPs have been the favorite among the researchers, and abundant of them are available in the public domain. Praphakar et al. tailored RIF silver NPs on chitosan (CS)-grafted cetyl alcohol-maleic anhydride-PZA polymer for ameliorated drug efficacy. It was observed that 90% of the drug was released within a span of 12 days and the anti-bacterial activity was ameliorated by the formulation. The VERO cell line was used for the cytotoxicity analysis, while THP-1 cells were employed for cell apoptosis assay. The results established the supremacy of NPs [21] . Tenland et al. studied the effect of a novel antimycobacterial peptide, NZX, on the colonization of Mtb. A slow release of 7.6% was observed from the NPs in the duration of 48 h. Primary macrophages and THP-1 cells used for uptake studies unraveled the fact that primary macrophage cell lines had greater cellular uptake. There was decline in CFU values, i.e., 84% reduction in the NZX group; 88% in the NP group; and 90% in the RIF-treated group, which was taken as standard, thus establishing the effectiveness of the prepared formulation [22] . In the research carried out by Bachhav et al., RIF-loaded NPs were fabricated by conjugation with GantrezAN-119 and using ethyl cellulose as polymer. Lymph-mediated lung targeting was elucidated from the fluorescence microscopy. A 2-fold increment in the AUC/ minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio was observed for the prepared NP, whereas there is a 182.4 \u00b1 22.6% increase in relative bioavailability (BA). Additionally, hepatotoxicity was augmented by the formulation [23] . Bhusal and colleagues developed glycan-coated magnetic NPs for the detection of acid-fast bacilli in sputum by making use of NP-based colorimetric biosensing assay. This biosensing technique might bear fruitful results through adequate implementation and facilitating the health care process. The outcome clarified that the designed system was in conformation with the established benchmark Xpert Mtb/RIF in terms of specificity and selectivity [24] . In the research carried out by Saifullah et al., EMB was loaded in graphene oxide-iron oxide magnetite NPs. A sustained in vitro release was observed along with potent anti-tubercular activity [25] . Rawal et al. developed RIF CS NP to be delivered as an inhalational system. The safety analysis was carried out using J774macrophage cells, whereby the % cell viability was calculated to be 75-80% at a dose of 0.125 mg/mL. The formulation also did not show any trace of toxicity [26] . In a different study envisaged by Thomas et al., they developed alginate cellulose nanocrystal hybrid NPs of RIF. A slow initial drug release of only 10-15% was observed in 2 h, which gradually increased up to 100% in 12 h on increasing the pH to 7.4. The L929 cell lines were used to perform the MTT assay, which demonstrated the % cell viability to be nearing 100% [27] . In a different study, Viswanathan and his colleagues developed mannosylated gelatin NP of licorice. The in vitro studies revealed enhanced cellular uptake in RAW 264.7 from the formulation. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic (PK) study of the formulation showed the existence of the optimal drug level in the body even after 24 h of drug administration. The in vivo antitubercular activity was confirmed since there was a significant decline in bacterial load in the lungs and spleen when Mtb H37Rv-infected mice were treated with mannosylated NP on the contrary to the untreated mice [28] . Malik and colleagues formulated poly (lactic-co glycolic) acid (PLGA) NPs by loading bivalent H1 antigen, which is a fusion of Mtb Ag85B and ESAT6 proteins. The developed NPs were internalized by THP-1 human macrophages and later used for immunizing C57BL/6J mice. There was a significant increase in the total serum IgG level when compared with H1 alone. A 2.4-fold increase in cytokine level and 1.6-fold increment in IL4 level were also observed demonstrating the efficacy of the NPs [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 320, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 955, "end": 959, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1507, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1991, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2443, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2639, "end": 2643, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2925, "end": 2929, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3299, "end": 3303, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3889, "end": 3893, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4383, "end": 4387, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Apart from the aforementioned studies, there were uncountable researches undertaken pertaining to NP.

In order to make the formulation accepted by the masses, numerous researches were undertaken. Costa and associates fashioned a conventional SLN formulation of INH and also by functionalization with mannose for contrasting evaluation. The outcome revealed that both the SLNs prepared curtailed the possibility of any toxicity on the human lung epithelial cell line (NCI-H441) and differentiated THP-1. Nevertheless, the functionalized SLN has enhanced uptake caliber in macrophagic cells and demonstrated receptor-dependent internalization [44] . Gaspar et al. developed RFB SLN using two different lipid constituents, namely, glyceryl dibehenate and glyceryl tristearate. In vitro uptake studies from THP1 cells in the macrophagic system showed 46 \u00b1 3% for glyceryl dibehenate and 26 \u00b1 9% for glyceryl tristearate, directing preferable proportion towards glyceryl dibehenate. The cell viability study conducted on A549 and Calu-3 cells gave evidence of low cytotoxicity nearing 20% [45] . Nemati et al., taking into consideration the astounding characteristics of SLN, developed EMB SLN as an inhalational delivery system.
