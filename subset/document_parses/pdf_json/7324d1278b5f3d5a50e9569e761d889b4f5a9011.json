Although sonographic imaging has the potential for detecting major intracranial bleeding and ischemic cerebrovascular disease, 12,13 it was not conclusive for intracranial pathology in our case. However, when SAH was diagnosed by CT imaging, duplex sonography became a part of our POCUS routine and, in the following days, detected cerebral vasospasm as a complication of SAH. In our tertiary care hospital ICU, TCCS is an integral part of our POCUS training and is a daily practice to monitor for the development of vasospasm in all aneurysmal SAH patients.",
