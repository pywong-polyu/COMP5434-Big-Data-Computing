            "text": "Robots assist in many areas that are considered unsafe for humans to operate. For instance, in handling pandemic diseases such as the recent Covid-19 outbreak and other outbreaks like Ebola, robots can assist in reaching areas dangerous for humans and do simple tasks such as pick up the correct medicine (among a set of bottles prescribed) and deliver to patients. In such cases, it might not be good to rely on the fully autonomous operation of robots. Since many mobile robots are fully functional with low-level tasks such as grabbing and moving, we consider the mixed-initiative control where the user can guide the robot remotely to finish such tasks. In this paper, we proposed a novel haptic-enabled mixed reality system, that provides haptic interfaces to interact with the virtualized environment and give remote guidance for mobile robots towards high-level tasks. The system testbed includes the local site with a mobile robot equipped with RGBD sensor and a remote site with a user operating a haptic device. A 3D virtualized realworld static scene is generated using real-time dense mapping. The user can use a haptic device to \"touch\" the scene, mark the scene, add virtual fixtures, and perform physics simulation. The experimental results show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed haptic-enabled mixed reality system.",

            "text": "Networked mixed reality has become popular for all kinds of the applications such as distributed collaborations [1] , training [2] , and video streaming [3] . Such a networked mixed reality system can merge the real and virtual worlds to produce new environments where physical and virtual objects interact with each other in real-time. Many researchers have applied mixed reality for robot teleoperations [4] , [5] , human-robot interaction control [6] , [7] , [8] and mixed-initiative control [9] , [10] . Among all these robot controls, mixed-initiative control is a hot topic that has drawn much attention. [11] , [12] , [13] introduced the different levels of autonomy: full autonomy (robot-initiative), mixed-initiative and teleoperation (humaninitiative). In reality, more control systems are designed with the capability to \"sliding autonomy\", which means the system supports the seamless transfer to different levels of control. Mixed-initiative control is to give the robot high-level commands instead of teleoperation, as shown in Figure 1 . It becomes more important in particular for improving situational Yuan Some previous methods have introduced haptic feedback and mixed reality for mixed-initiative control [9] , [10] , most of them applied haptic device as a multidimensional teleoperation controller or used haptic guidance force and environment force as the feedback of robot motions. In this paper, we consider how 3D haptic interaction in the mixed reality could be expanded to help the robot mixed-initiative control. Haptic interaction with the 3D virtual environment is very popular in computer graphics applications to provide immersive experiences, which is to use a haptic avatar to explore freely in a 3D world and interact with 3D objects (push, touch) and feel the force feedback. Combining haptic interaction with mixed-initiative control will provide more flexibility towards the control.",

Haptic devices provide more degrees of freedom for cursor motions and provide force feedback for more immersive experiences. Using haptic devices, users can remotely \"touch\" and mark the virtualized environment from the streaming data [16] .

            "text": "Researchers have worked hard towards the haptic-enabled Tele-operation field to deal with the challenges of communication delay, control strategy [4] , [5] , [8] . Networked mixed reality platform is widely introduced to provide a remote immersive platform to improve the robot control, and enable the interactions between the physical robots and virtual objects [18] , [14] , [19] . [6] presented a mixed reality (MR) platform: an integrated physical and virtual environment, in which the user interacts with a teleoperated robot by passing a graphical object. [7] proposed a mixed reality interface for a remote robot using both real and virtual data acquired by a mobile equipped with an omnidirectional camera and a laser scanner. The MR interface can enhance the current remote robot teleoperation visual interface. Son et al. [20] investigated 3 haptic cues for bilateral teleoperation of multiple mobile robots, and found force cue feedback best support the maneuverability. In [14] , dense geometry and appearance data were used to generate a photorealistic synthetic exterior line-of-sight view of the robot including the context of its surrounding terrain. This technique converted remote teleoperation into a line-of-sight remote control with the capacity to remove latency. Chouiten et al. [18] proposed a distributed mixed reality system that implemented the real-time display of digital video stream to web users, by mixing 3D entities with 2D live videos by a teleoperated ROV. Some methods introduced the haptic feedback into the mixed reality control platforms. A mixed reality system [9] is developed with GUI interfaces and force feedback including path guidance forces, collision preventing forces or environmental force to improve the performance of high-level tasks operations. Later, Cacace et al. [10] proposed a mixed-initiative control system to add a human loop to control the velocity of aerial service vehicles, and force feedback is used to enhance the control experience. Different from these methods, our system introduced the haptic interaction with 3D scenes into mixed reality, which will bring more flexibility. Lee et al. [21] proposed a visual guidance algorithm that dynamically manipulates the virtual scene to compensate for the spatial discrepancies in a haptic augmented virtuality system. In [19] , an interface based on Microsoft HoloLens is proposed, which can display the map, path, control command, and other information related to the remote mobile robot, also provide interactive ways for robot control.",

KinectFusion [24] , [25] is one of the most popular methods, which fuses the streaming RGBD data from the Kinect camera, and saves it as a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF). KinectFusion can provide the full-scene dense geometry to enable mixed reality. [16] firstly introduced the real-time haptic rendering with streaming deformable surface generated by KinectFusion. Besides the simulation of surface deformation, this method provided a haptic rendering pipeline including collision detection, proxy update, and force computation. The collision detection is performed by ray casting in the TSDF data structure that is saved in GPU. At each time step, based on the haptic interaction position (HIP), this method finds the corresponding proxy: the nearest surface point to HIP. Finally, the haptic force is computed by the positions of proxy and HIP. This method is computationally efficient and integrated well with the KinectFusion framework. However the force rendering of this method only works well with the planes, and it will be unstable at the intersecting boundary of two or more planes. In the real-world scenes, the complex geometry nature harnesses the stability using this method. We borrowed the idea of haptic interaction with the streaming dense surface and proposed a new pipeline of haptic rendering to keep both the stability and efficiency.",

There is a low-level task executor to execute the control commands that are sent by the controller in the Execution Layer. \u2022 The Execution Layer gets the RGBD images and performs simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using KinectFusion [24] . Then KinectFusion generates a point cloud every time step for visual rendering. It will combine the object segmentation module to segment and mark the object if necessary. The layer also includes a separate thread for haptic rendering. This module will compute the force feedback and send it to a haptic device. The physics simulation module handles the situation that a haptic interaction interface is enabled to interact with a virtual object. The Execution Layer also includes the path planner to generate a path based on the user's marking or the virtual obstacles that the user adds. The controller module is used to generate a predicted position and commands for the robot to follow. \u2022 The User Layer provides all the interfaces and outputs. The user can either use the teleoperation interface to directly operate the robot, or use haptic interfaces to interact with the 3D environments. Haptic guided object segmentation interface is only used for segmentation. Haptic interaction interface enables the user to use haptic to push the virtual object as the target or the obstacle. Haptic marking can either define a path on the ground or mark one object, then the robot will try to follow the path or approach the object. The virtual obstacle interface enables the user to add virtual obstacles (any form of geometry) into the scene, then the path planner will search for a new path to avoid the obstacle. The Robot Layer and Execution Layer are connected over the Internet. The dense mapping is done in Execution Layer instead of Robot Layer since the RGBD image data has a smaller size than the 3D point cloud. Another reason is that haptic rendering with TSDF data has very good performance [16] .",

Instead of the gradientbased iterative method proposed in [16] , we integrate the task of finding the nearest surface point into the ray casting step in KinectFusion. The reason is that our application will not consider the deformable property for the surface, therefore the ray casting is performed after the haptic rendering. Per-pixel ray marches in TSDF to generate the point cloud for the whole surface. During this procedure, the distances between the HIP and every point on the surface are computed and saved. The nearest surface point finding problem now becomes a parallel problem that finds the minimum in the distance array. This problem can be solved through parallel reduction [37] . This algorithm is shown in Algorithm. 1.",

After the HIP penetrates into the surface, the subsequent proxy position needs to be updated since the HIP will penetrate further into the volume. As shown in Figure 4 , the nearest surface point is not appropriate for this scenario, a more correct way is to constrain the successive proxy. The previous time step normal n i\u22121 is used to define a tangent plane, the normal of proxy will be computed every time step. Tracking this normal is like tracking a tangent gliding plane over the surface physically. As shown in the right of Figure 4 , the tangent plane T i\u22121 is \"dragged\" by the new proxy position h i while attached on the surface. So, the tangent plane can be treated as a constraint plane for the proxy. First, we drop a perpendicular from h i to this constraint plane to get a goal position g i , which is the first approximation of the proxy. Then, the nearest surface finding in the ray casting step will find the new proxy p i . This two-step method is similar to the force shading method [36] . The core of the method is to use the tangent plane to constraint the new proxy in a physically plausible way, then refine it as the nearest surface point. The whole procedure is shown as Algorithm. 2.",

Similar to [38] , the friction force can be simulated by a simple change using the known friction cone. The angle \u03b1 defines a cone starting from the current HIP h i , as shown in Figure5. The friction cone has an interaction circle with the tangent plane. \u03b1 = arctan(\u00b5), where \u00b5 is a user-defined friction coefficient. If the previous time step proxy p i\u22121 is inside the circle, the new proxy will be directly set the same as before: p i = p i\u22121 . If outside, then the goal position (approximated proxy) g i = c i , where c i is the point closest to p i\u22121 on the circle. The two scenarios correspond to static friction and dynamic friction. The haptic texture can be easily extended by using the bump texture method [39] . It can generate constraints for each point to change the normal.

This method takes extra processing time. Another way is to perform the segmentation based on TSDF data and save the segmentation information into the TSDF. In the KinectFusion pipeline, the depth image is fused for surface reconstruction at each time step. Based on this observation, we propose a two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, the 2D segmentation is performed from both depth image and color image. After the 2D segmentation, a label image L i is generated. In the second phase, the segmentation is fused into the TSDF together with the depth image. In this way, the segmentation is seamlessly integrated into the KinectFusion and reduces the time cost. Moreover, the segmentation information will be fused by weight, which generates robust segmentation results. The whole pipeline is shown as Figure 6 . In the first phase of our method, firstly user uses the haptic avatar to touch and mark an object of interest in a 3D scene. Then the 3D mark is transformed to the current color image coordinates. At the next time step, starting from the mark point in the image, the pixels are clustered through a region growing method until there are no pixels to be added. The region is treated as a cluster, then the distance between the neighboring pixels and the cluster center is computed as the combination of two Euclidean distances as shown in the Equation 1:",

Network delays may influence the mapping and localization from KinectFusion. To compensate for the delay, we propose a method to generate a predicted goal position. Assuming the current velocity of the robot is v i = (a i , b i , c i ) at ith time step, the straightforward way to predict the next velocity is to compute the velocity and acceleration with the last several frames. Most Kalman filters are based on an empirical model of this linear form. In this paper, we applied the general linear model to predict the next velocity v i+1 :",

We recorded the realtime robot positions and also the predicted positions generated from the proposed linear model. The error is defined as the Euclidean distance along X-axis since robots are moving along the x-axis in two experiments. If big error means the newly planned position sent from server to robot is very far from the real position. Based on the control test, if this error is beyond 20cm then the trajectory will be influenced. As shown in Figure 12 , the trajectory planner might generate a costly trajectory, and the robot may move back and forth because of the delay. The robot positions are computed for each frame from the odometry. Figure 16 shows two-position curves (along X-axis) over the Internet with 200ms latency. The average position error for 100ms is 2.34cm, and 3.47cm for 200ms. The maximal error for both latencies is lower than 7.0cm, which shows good control performance. To further test the latency, we have one more experiment that adding timevarying network delay from 100ms to 200ms as shown in Figure 17 . The difference between the two curves is very close, and lower than 7.0cm. These results show that our latency compensation can handle up to 200ms network latency. The Kuka YouBot robot used in the previous section is great for applications requiring maneuvering in-house and precise control. However, the robotic arm has a limited degree of freedom and will not be able to replicate human-like actions from remote locations. Here, we describe the essential elements that are needed for improving the capabilities of our current work and use them to solve engineering/healthcare problems. These are listed as follows: 1) designing a robotic hand with five fingers, 2) Use the hands for special operations such as healthcare and military applications.

We have designed such hands using the 3D printing method and using parametric-based CAD software [46] , [47] . The parametricbased hand design can be easily customized and scaled as needed, we can print big adult size hands or small child size. It is a low-cost but highly dexterous robotic hand that can carry out complex tasks, the robotic hand can be actuated using novel actuators such as TCP muscles. Twisted and Coiled Polymer (TCP) muscles or actuators are soft polymers that enable the realization of low-cost and high-performance humanoid robots [46] , [48] . TCP muscles contract when heated and return to their original shape, like natural muscles. They do not produce any noise, as a result, can be used for silent operations. This is the key advantage of designing robotic arms using soft actuators rather than motors and pneumatics. We have been studying the TCP materials to develop a novel musculoskeletal system. TCP muscles could provide large strain (20-49%), large stress (1-35MPa) and high mechanical work (5.3 kW/kg) [46] , [49] . More importantly, the material cost for making the muscle is low compared to shape memory alloy actuators [49] . Therefore, it is worth studying this material further to develop high-performance and low-cost robots including the closed-loop control systems [50] . Fig. 18 : Grasping objects using our robotic hand, UTD Hand that is made out of TCP muscles [46] . When referring to literature, several robots and robotic hands have been developed in universities and research institutes [51] , [52] , [53] , [54] . The actuators typically used in these robots are expensive and are not biomimetic. Some of the advanced humanoids include Boston Dynamics's Atlas, ASIMO, Robonaut, HUBO and HRP-4C. These robots are extremely expensive and most of them are not available commercially. For example, ASIMO costs about $1 million and even $100,000 for a rent [55] mimetic and affordable. We have made several efforts in the last 10 years in creating humanoids using various smart actuation technologies: piezoelectric, conducting polymer, shape memory alloy actuators and the latest humanoid hand that is actuated by TCP muscles and using additive manufacturing technology Figure 18 . The key feature of the design is that 1) it can grasp various daily used objects, 2) the actuators do not require large space , they are kept in the forearm, 3) The structure is lightweight as it is polymer based and 4) No electromagnetic noise generated. Key scientific challenges and performance of smart materials were described in our previous works [56] , [57] , [58] , [59] . The TCP muscles are used for actuation of fingers of the robots [46] , [48] and hence we will investigate this hand with the proposed mixed-initiative method in the future.",

This aspect makes the proposed command and control of a robotic hand transformative because of the tradeoff between cost, overall system size, weight, operation noise, and performance in handling objects.

We would like to experiment with the hand developed in the previous section to take temperature measurement of a patient simulator using hand-held Braun ThermoScan\u00ae (Figure 19 a) . Patient simulators are a great way to expedite such research as human subject tests typically require multiple processes of IRB approval at this initial stage. First, we will perform simple experiments to let the robot grasp ThermoScan and manipulate it by developing algorithms. Inverse kinematics [60] , [61] , [62] , camera and hand coordination will be employed to direct the thermometer to the patient simulator's forehead, and the robot will read the instrument display. We will use Object Character Recognition (OCR) [63] program to detect the actual temperature reading. The temperature and other procedures require multiple actions of the robot following particular algorithms and experiments. We will also determine the reachable positions (workspace) of the robot hand using the Denavit-Hartenburg (DH) method, a convention used to represent the relationships of linkage parameters in robotic manipulators. We have done some preliminary tests on the actuation of the robot locally, without using the teleoperation, to see the practical issues and identify the actuation variable. Some of the prior works are presented in [64] . Our humanoid robotic with the specialized hands (Figure 20 c) will be mounted on a mobile and it can accomplish such a task by performing a series of experiments. We will customize our robots to perform these tasks. We have some representative video of our robot can be found from https://youtu.be/WKc32gcdgj0.",

They can be made again if it is destroyed during operations or field trials. Our team has designed and developed a 3D printed robot, HBS-1 robot (Figure 20 a) that has mechanical systems, electrical and mechatronic systems. The materials cost of this robot is $10,000-$15,000 [46] , [65] . The overall dimension of robot HBS-1 is 120 cm x 33cm x 14 cm, which match closely a 7-year-old boy [66] . HBS-1 consists of two 4-DOF legs, a 2-DOF waist, two 4-DOF arms, two 15-DOF hands, and a 3-DOF head (51 DOF in total). The robot is powered by a DC power supply connected through wires while tethered. HBS-1 utilizes 14 Dyanmixel servos. Shape memory alloy and TCP actuators have been used for the design of the fingers since they can be installed in the limited volume of the forearm. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to actuate all five fingers. HBS-1 is equipped with Firewire stereo cameras which are housed in the head. The torso is equipped with an orientation sensor (UM7-LT), which combines gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetic sensors, and an onboard 32-bit ARM Cortex processor to compute sensor orientation. Two servo controllers in the torso actuate the 21 servo motors. The other robot called Buddy (Figure 20b) consists of a wheeled mobile base, a cloud camera, an ultrasonic position sensor, battery, wireless communication module, flexible touch sensor skin, two 4-DOF arms, and a 2-DOF neck (15-DOF in total). The overall dimensions of the robot are a height of 580 mm, an arm space of 925 mm, a shoulder width of 230 mm, and a chest thickness of 172.5 mm [67] , [68] . These components took 56% of the total material cost. The total material cost of this robot is $3000 including the mechanical and off-the-shelf mechatronic components. This robot can be modified and used for experimenting the teleoperation and handling dangerous substances.",

The system provides an efficient haptic rendering method with smooth and stable force feedback. The haptic rendering also supports the simulation of the surface properties such as friction and texture. The haptic rendering enhances the immersive environments and supports more haptic user interfaces for more flexible control commands such as pushing a virtual obstacle to change the robot's motion. An interactive 3D object segmentation method is also provided to segment objects fast and accurately. This segmentation result can be treated as the input for the high-level semantic classification of objects. The system also provides different types of haptic interactions in the mixed reality platform, and a prediction method to compensate for network delays. The delay can be compensated to support the complex interaction such as placing obstacles during the robot movement. The experimental results show the efficiency and functionality of our system. This system expands the user interfaces using haptic devices. In the future, the following user study will be performed to compare different user interface configurations. It is very meaningful to verify which haptic interface mode contributes more to task completion. Also, the prediction method can be tuned by using more complicated methods such as a non-linear model. Haptic-guided segmentation can be augmented by incorporating a learning method for semantic labeling. Our system provides haptic-guided mixed-initiative control. It can be naturally extended to more levels of autonomy using our mixed reality platform.",
