The gingival crevicular fluid being representative of systemic status and having a proven track record of detecting viruses and biomarkers forms a logical basis for evaluating the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The study aimed to assess gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in 33 patients who were deemed to be COVID-19 positive upon nasopharyngeal sampling. An attempt was also made to comparatively evaluate it with saliva in terms of its sensitivity, as a diagnostic fluid for SARS-CoV-2. GCF and saliva samples were collected from 33 COVID-19-confirmed patients. Total RNA was extracted using NucliSENS easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux) and eluted in the elution buffer. Envelope gene (E gene) of SARS-CoV-2 and human RNase P gene as internal control were detected in GCF samples by using the TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 RT qPCR kit V-2.0 (I) in an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time machine. A significant majority of both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients exhibited the presence of the novel coronavirus in their GCF samples. Considering the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab sampling as gold standard, the sensitivity of GCF and saliva, respectively, was 63.64% (confidence interval [CI], 45.1% to 79.60%) and 64.52% (CI, 45.37% to 80.77%). GCF was found to be comparable to saliva in terms of its sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2. Saliva samples tested positive in 3 of the 12 patients whose GCF tested negative, and likewise GCF tested positive for 2 of the 11 patients whose saliva tested negative on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results establish GCF as a possible mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is the first such report in the literature, and also provide the first quantifiable evidence pointing toward a link between the COVID-19 infection and oral health.",

Being a never before encountered pathogen, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has afforded no luxuries to those attempting to build knowledge in the face of this continuously mounting challenge. An essential part of improving understanding is to extrapolate what is already known. This has prompted the search for viral loads in various body fluids paralleling the presence of other viruses in these secretions. The search has entailed an assessment of viral titers in every fathomable body secretion such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, urine, feces, semen, breast milk, tears, and peritoneal fluid, of which samples of saliva, urine, feces, breast milk, and peritoneal fluid have demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (Hung et al. 2003; Al Saiegh et al. 2020; Coccolini et al. 2020; Gro\u00df et al. 2020; Paoli et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2020 ). The evidence for most of these has so far been inconclusive. This, however, is true for most evidence pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, with most of the literature base being built upon a foundation of opinions, correspondence, and isolated clinical experiences. Valuable as these may be, there is a necessity to conduct proper clinical studies with standardized methodologies if we are to begin to draw some much-needed conclusions about how this virus behaves. A systematic review conducted on such meager data reveals olfactory and gustatory symptoms to be present in most patients with COVID-19, with a substantial majority of these even preceding general symptoms of the disease (Samaranayake et al. 2020) .",

Oral bacteria, periodontopathogens, and, in general, periodontal disease have been associated with respiratory conditions and adverse outcomes thereof, particularly acting in a synergistic mechanism along with viruses. There is now definitive evidence of the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs so much so that these form the basis of testing methodology. The utilization of saliva as an alternative to naso-and/or oropharynx swabs and blood sampling has been recommended based upon the clinical advantages of it being less invasive and more convenient for patients, particularly in terms of disease monitoring and cases where multiple testing is required (Sapkota et al. 2020) . However, saliva is not the only fluid present in the oral cavity.",

An attempt was also made to compare the sensitivity of GCF sampling results with those of saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs and do a comparative evaluation of results obtained with GCF sampling to those with saliva sampling in the same cohort of patients. It seems logical to make such an effort into the role GCF might play in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and how it behaves as not only a possible mode of infection transfer but also a possible body fluid to be purposed for diagnostics. The established gold standard of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sampling, as advantageous as it may seem, is not without its drawbacks, the most glaring of which is the possibility of inducing a gag reflex (an aerosol-generating act) during sample collection, which poses a threat of infection transfer to health care professionals and others in the vicinity of sample collection. Some reports from over the world have mentioned the thin running supply of test swabs, which are a necessity for naso/oropharynx sampling.",

Also, such saliva collection methods are not suitable for patients who cannot expectorate saliva, such as patients who are unconscious. For these patients, suction aspiration of saliva is required (To et al. 2017) . Moreover, a number of saliva sampling practices, even in self-collected samples from patients, mandate that this be done preferably in a condition wherein the patient has not had any food or drinks or has brushed his or her teeth after waking in the morning until the sample is collected, a somewhat cumbersome set of instructions to follow.",

Micropipettes were perceived to be better at sample collection in light of the inherent limitation of paper strips having nonspecific analytes attached to them (Pradeep et al. 2011) . Even though such an analyte attachment has not yet been proven for paper strips as far as SARS-CoV-2 sampling is concerned, the fact that it is an established drawback while sampling for others led us to abstain from using this methodology. In patients with periodontitis, the sample was collected from the deepest periodontal pocket, whereas in healthy mouths, the sample was pooled from multiple sites until the required amount of 2 \u00b5L was obtained. One sample was discarded due to contamination with blood, and subsequent sampling was done from a similar pocket depth site at a different location in the mouth.

Armed with this knowledge, studying the GCF for the possibility of estimating the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 would seem only logical. Not only this, but GCF sampling has also been used to be reliably deterministic of the serum immune response and could further be extrapolated to be reflective of cytokine levels that seem manifest in COVID-19 cases (Sahni and Gupta 2020) . A significantly justifiable yet unanswered question seems to be why certain patients have more severe consequences of COVID-19 compared to others. While age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities do explain a number of these cases, a significant proportion of the population seems to comprise relatively young, healthy patients who do not fall into any of these traditional groups yet have adverse outcomes (Shi et al. 2020) .

It has been expressed in the epithelium of the oral cavity, particularly in that of the oral tongue, buccal mucosa, and gingival tissues (Xu et al. 2020) . It can be argued that the expression of the ACE2 receptor in the gingival epithelium and viral recovery in the GCF could form a basis for understanding a potential route of infection exhibited at this level and how the inflammatory status of the periodontium, which is essentially determined by oral hygiene, might influence the COVID-19 infection. Other probable mechanistic links have been presented in detail in the Appendix. The present study, however, did not seem to find a direct link between the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 in GCF and the presence/absence of gum disease. Probably greater sample sizes would be required to conclusively report on this association. The results of the study also suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from both asymptomatic carriers and those who were mildly symptomatic. This seems to point toward a concerning subject wherein a number of dental practices are looking to open up across the world. The fact that there is a fluid in the gingival crevice that harbors SARS-CoV-2, even in asymptomatic individuals, is a troubling thought as this could potentially infect unwary health care professionals. In light of this, the results of the present study become important not only for practitioners but in framing of policy and screening measures to be instituted as dentistry begins to open up. It would be a severe blow to the credibility of our profession if, due to a lack of evidence, we were to somehow unknowingly contribute to a blunting of the response to the pandemic. Aerosol-generating procedure or not, the GCF would be involved in conceivably every procedure in the vicinity of the gingival sulcus, which for all practical purposes covers the entire purview of dentistry. By demonstrating recovery of SARS-CoV-2 in the GCF, this study establishes that this fluid contributes to the viral load being recovered in saliva samples.

The comparability of GCF and saliva in terms of their sensitivity, as well as the advantages that GCF has over saliva sampling in certain cases, suggests that GCF could very well be purposed for diagnostics. It would not be unreasonable to state that procedures such as ultrasonic scaling or any procedure performed without a rubber dam would expose the dental health care provider to GCF (as it does to saliva) and pose a risk of infection transfer. In light of this knowledge, the demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 in GCF is a significant finding that goes a long way in understanding the COVID-19 infection and how it relates to oral health and the practice of dentistry.",
