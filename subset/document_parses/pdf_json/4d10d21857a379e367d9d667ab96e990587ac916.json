One previous paper [12] has 233 looked at burns at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and 234 estimated the costs of caring for burns both as an inpatient and 235 outpatient.

Modern vaporisers use electricity to power a heating 275 element, boiling water and creating steam for inhalation. This 276 hypothetically eliminates the risk of spilling hot water from an 277 open vessel. Whilst only 2 out of 19 of the burns in this series 278 sustained injuries with modern vaporisers, this demonstrates 279 that they are still not risk free. This has been confirmed in a 280 previous paper which showed that even with modern vapor-281 isers, scald burns to the hands are a serious risk [4]. 282 If steam inhalation is to be practised in children, an 283 alternative, safer method advocated in respiratory text [13,14]284 is steam inhalation by close contact. This involves cuddling the 285 child whilst running a bath or shower with the windows and 286 door closed. Whilst one study [15] found no benefit in 287 symptoms from this method, it has been shown to be safe 288 and associated with much less scald injuries [4]. 289 Steam inhalation scalds are not an issue unique to our 290 burns centre. A recent International Burns Injury Database 291 (IBID) request found that over the same two year time period, 292 there were 201 steam inhalation related scald injuries 293 sustained nationally. Subset analysis showed in 2018 there 294 were 47 paediatric related injuries, 37 adult and 8 elderly 295 related injuries. This is compared to 2019, when there were 296 49 paediatric injuries, 48 adult injuries and 12 elderly burns. 297 Whilst there has only been a modest increase from 2018 to 298 2019, the constant number of injuries is of significant the widespread use of steam inhalation and the public's 302 belief in it's apparent benefits, primary prevention is vital in 303 avoiding steam inhalation related scald injuries. This has been 304 acknowledged in several countries, including The Netherlands 305 where several patient brochures have warned of the risks of 306 steam inhalation [16\u00c018]. 307 In the UK, the advice from NICE [5] is that during steam 308 inhalation \"care should be taken to avoid scalding\". It also 309 advised \"sitting in the bathroom with a running hot shower is a 310 safe option.\" However, the worry is whether the government's 311 advice is being passed on to patients. A previous study [11] in 312 2016 looked at steam inhalation scalds in the paediatric 313 population. In it's survey of GPs in Wales, it found that 81% ( 314 n=17) had advised patients to use steam inhalation in their 315 career. More worryingly, only a small proportion of GPs were 316 aware of evidence pertaining to the use of steam inhalation, 317 and none were aware of the results of the 2013 Cochrane 318 review [1]. Less than a quarter of GPs reported the potential risk 319 of scalds using steam inhalation [11]. 320 More recently, The British Association of Plastic, Recon-321 structive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) has instigated a 322 Twitter campaign to minimise the frequency of typical injuries 323 encountered by plastic surgeons, to reduce the burden on the 324 NHS during the coronavirus pandemic. the warnings do not seem to be having the 333 desired effect. A recent letter published in The Lancet [21] 334 expressed concern over the increased use of steam inhalation 335 for symptomatic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, 336 with a subsequent increase in paediatric scald injuries. The 337 authors reported 30-fold increase at their centre in the number 338 of paediatric scalds directly resulting from steam inhalation 339 since the start of UK lockdown. In their survey of English burns 340 centres, they also found that 50% of centres have had an 341 increase in scalds relating to steam inhalation. However, it is 342 worth bearing in mind the authors relied on an ad hoc survey of 343 only a proportion of the burn services, did not specify the 344 nature of services who did not respond and relied on the 345 recollection of those contacted. 346 In the aforementioned paper by Al Himdani et al. [11] most 347 scalds were sustained by tipping hot water from bowls, a 348 mechanism also backed up by other papers [4,10]. It is obvious 349 most GPs would not recommend steam inhalation by placing 350 vessels of boiling water directly on laps or on unstable 351 surfaces. It is likely that misunderstandings and miscommu-352 nications may occur during consultations when advice on 353 steam inhalation is given, meaning patients then go on to 354 practice steam inhalation in an unsafe manner. 355 Further research is needed into the general public consen-356 sus on steam inhalation and it's perceived benefits. This 357 research could then be used to design and implement 358 educational resources targeted at reducing incidence of steam 359 inhalation related scalds. 360 Another possible area of research could focus on the 361 communication of steam inhalation in GP consultations, 362 investigating the difference between what GPs recommend 363 and what patients actually do. paper, patients were first identified from the burns 366 audit database and subsequent data could be extracted from 367 the patient's electronic files. Detailed documentation of the 368 patient's admission, dressings and subsequent treatment 369 allowed the authors to collect a wide range of data.370 Data collection was limited by the fact it was a retrospec-371 tive, single centre study. Furthermore, the retrospective 372 nature of the study introduced an element of selection bias 373 for a number of reasons.374Firstly, the database did not contain patients that were 375 treated in the outpatient department but not admitted for 376 scald burns secondary to steam inhalation. Similarly, any 377 patients admitted for less than 12h could not be identified 378 using the database search, as only patients that spent more 379 than twelve hours in hospital were classed as admitted.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF18": {"text": "First do no harm\" is a fundamental principle of medicine.
