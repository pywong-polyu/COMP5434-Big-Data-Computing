Governments are facing an urgent mandate to mobilize quickly and comprehensively in response, drawing not only on public resources and coordination capabilities but also on the cooperation and buy-in of civil society. Political and institutional legitimacy are crucial determinants of effective crisis management, and low-trust states lacking such legitimacy suffer a profound disadvantage. Social and economic crises attending the COVID-19 pandemic thus invite scholarly reflection about public attitudes, social leadership, and the role of social and institutional memory in the context of systemic disruption. This article examines Hong Kong as a case where failure to respond effectively could have been expected due to low levels of public trust and political legitimacy, but where, in fact, crisis response was unexpectedly successful. The case exposes underdevelopment in scholarly assumptions about the connections among political legitimacy, societal capacity, and crisis response capabilities. As such, this calls for a more nuanced understanding of how social behaviours and norms are structured and reproduced amidst existential uncertainties and policy ambiguities caused by sudden and convergent crises, and how these can themselves generate resources that bolster societal capacity in the fight against pandemics.",

Underlying the functionality of institutional capacity, particularly during a crisis whose resolution is dependent on the behavior of individuals, is public trust and political legitimacy. By this measure, Hong Kong could have been predicted to falter in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the year preceding the outbreak saw sociopolitical tensions spill over into mass street protests against the government's perceived facilitation of Chinese Communist Party control over the city. Despite these circumstances, Hong Kong endured the early stages of the crisis with minimal effects on public health, casting doubt on the applicability of academic theories about response capacity focused primarily on government (Capano & Woo, 2018; Howlett, Capano, & Ramesh, 2018; Peters, 2015; Pierre, 2014; Woo, Ramesh, & Howlett, 2015) .",

It includes but also extends the concept of 'civil society', which refers primarily to the capacity of non-government and non-profit organizations. An example of community capacity is the mobilization of the mass protest movement in Hong Kong, which occurred not through formal, hierarchical, organisational decision-making structures but through diffuse and decentralized activities mediated largely via social media. Community capacity is thus characterised by a lack of (i) organised leadership; (ii) formal organisational structures; and (iii) centralised financial or coordinating resources -distinguishing it from more canonical forms of government-centred capacity. Importantly, we argue, because of its diffuse, often wide-spread mobilizing impact, community capacity can compensate for the lack of formal state capacity. Additionally, it can compensate for situations of poor or low socio-political legitimacy where trust in government is low, providing an important social resource that can help either 'do the job of government' or garner public compliance to collective objectives beyond official government policy or the exercise of formal political and policy capacity.",

Indeed, the government has been relatively slow to institute intrusive measures to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 and the measures eventually adopted have been relatively light. For example, the government declined to institute the type of population-wide lockdown common in countries across Europe and other parts of Asia (Wuhan, China, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore). Despite having its first cases in late January, Hong Kong did not institute the closure of certain private commercial establishments (pubs and bars) until early April, instead opting for social-distancing guidelines for patrons and permitting business to remain open. In a move widely considered more political than practical (Ting, 2020) , the government also refused to fully close all borders with China, instead opting for virus screening measures and selective restrictions based on trip origin; full-scale closures had been urged by Hong Kong's medical community since shortly after the identification of the first cases in January (Mahtani, 2020) . By contrast, schools (local and international kindergartens, primary, secondary and special schools) were closed on 25 January, in part reflecting concerns that parents and children returning from Chinese New Year celebrations in the Mainland would act as a major vector of transmission. At the same time, the government's equivocation about the use of protective facemasks, along with the contentious facemask ban introduced in 2019 in response to the social protests, drew public criticism, ridicule on social media and disapproval from press commentators (Chung, 2020; Davidson, 2020) . The rollout of government responses to COVID-19 has thus been far from seamless or without controversy.",

A month thereafter, the Hospital Authority instituted more aggressive measures for early detection and diagnosis, targeting any individual with standard symptoms. A ramping-up of testing efforts, including additional equipment and testing capacity, was announced in late March, followed by the establishment of additional triage and test centres and a specimen collection centre near the airport (the operation was discontinued on 19 April).

In late March, the government appealed to firms in certain business sectors (e.g., bars, fitness centres, and cinemas) to institute contamination-prevention procedures and maintain flexible work arrangements.

By early February, a mandatory two-week quarantine was instituted for all arrivals from the Mainland, followed by arrivals from high-risk cities in South Korea; countries were incrementally added to the list throughout March and ultimately all countries were included. Quarantine restrictions were modestly loosened on 11 April, with fewer days required to be served in quarantine centres. An Indian businessman became the first foreigner to face prosecution for trying to break quarantine orders (Siu, 2020) ; by early May, dozens were under investigation from similar allegations (Lau, 2020) . On 28 April, compulsory quarantine for arrivals from the Mainland was extended into June, with exceptions for individuals involved in certain educational endeavours, manufacturing and business activities, and professional services (considered economically crucial). In mid-May, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development stated 'there's still a need for a lot of business travelling, so business travellers would be the first among others [to be given exemptions]' (Yau, 2020) .",

In early March, rent concessions were introduced for retail and factory tenants, followed by an HKD 1 billion (US$129 million) measure for the aviation industry and ancillary services (added 27 March). Bank capitalization programs were instituted in early April, along with relaxed capital reserve requirements and pressure to favourably renegotiate loan repayment terms. An additional phase of the stimulus plan, worth an additional HKD 138 billion (US $17.779 billion), was announced on 8 April that included an employment and job support, an enhanced SME financing scheme, transportation fare discounts, and student loan repayment deferrals, among others .",

At their height, upwards of 2 million people took to the streets in defiance of government bans on street protests, with public sentiment increasingly at odds with the government which was widely seen as serving the interests of Beijing rather than those of Hong Kong (SCMP, 2019a, 2019b). Public sentiment was further inflamed by the police shooting of a student protester and the death of another protester who was killed when he fell from a wall near a protest site (Cheng, 2019) , with allegations of excessive police force being used in dealing with the protesters (H. Woodhouse, Liu, & Wong, 2019) . Violent confrontations on some university campuses (Chinese University of Hong Kong), culminating in the siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University which saw police shoot thousands of rounds of rubber bullets, tear gas and 'sponge grenades' into the campus, along with the studentforced closure of the central cross-harbour tunnel (a major thoroughfare connecting Kowloon to Hong Kong island) adjacent to the university, highlighted the severity of the political crisis and the extent of anti-government and anti-Beijing sentiment in the territory (Ng, 2019; Yu, 2019) . 5 Trust in government was also eroded by widespread perceptions of government inaction in dealing with the demands of protesters, with the government slow (some claimed recalcitrant) in withdrawing legislation that would allow Hong Kong citizens to be extradited 6 to Mainland China and subject to the Chinese criminal legal system -5 Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 July 1997, having been ruled by Britain since 1842 when it was ceded by the Chinese Qing dynasty after its defeat in the first Opium War (Kowloon and the New Territories were subsequently ceded after the Second Opium war in 1860 and 1998 respectively (Tsang, 2004) ). At the time of its handover to the PRC in 1997, the territory was given a large degree of autonomy guaranteed under the 'Basic Law' which enshrines the principle of 'one country, two systems' and serves as the de facto constitution of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). The Basic Law specifies the rights of Hong Kong citizens, the relationship of Hong Kong SAR government to the central, Beijing government, the political and institutional structure of government in Hong Kong, and the legal system. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's distinctive political system, common law tradition, and institutional structures would be preserved for a period of 50 years (2047), giving Hong Kong relative discretion in setting domestic policies.",

A first wave of protests in 2014, popularly labelled the 'umbrella movement', expressed many of these concerns, which crystallised around proposals by China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee to limit (screen) the types of candidates eligible to run in future Chief Executive elections. This move by the NPC was rejected by democracy advocates, who closed streets in downtown Hong Kong, held mass sit-ins, creating disruptions to business and transportation lasting for several months (Augustin-Jean, 2018; Davis, 2015; Ortmann, 2016) . The Umbrella Movement represented the first, large scale social protests in Hong Kong against mainland Chinese authority over the territory. legislation that many claimed breached the spirit of the 'Basic Law' and the principle of 'one country, two systems' struck at the time of the handover in 1997 and which guaranteed a high level of independence to Hong Kong (Lo, 2014 see also en 1). Coupled with the refusal of the Hong Kong government to meet with the protesters, whom the government pejoratively termed 'rioters', 7 or engage in pro-active dialogue addressing widespread community concerns about the future of Hong Kong's relationship with Mainland China, anti-government sentiment and public distrust continued to grow. Territory-wide district council elections on 24 November 2019, confirmed this, witnessing a record-high voter turnout (71.23%), with the pro-democratic camp gaining control of 17 of the 18 district councils, winning 388 seats compared to the progovernment/pro-Beijing camp's 89 seats (HKSAR, 2019; Lam, Sum, & Ng, 2019) .",

Wong & Liu, 2020; Woodhouse & Liu, 2020) . 9 The approval rating for the Chief Executive (CE) Carrie Lam, the head of the Hong Kong government, for example, fell to just 9.1% in a poll conducted between 17-19 February, reflecting ongoing fallout after months of political protest as well as concerns that the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic (especially management of the border with Mainland China) was ineffectual, slow and uncoordinated (Straitstimes, 2020; Taylor, 2020; N. Wong & Cheung, 2020) . Indeed, popular disquiet against the government soon surfaced at the outset of the first confirmed cases in Hong Kong, with a 4-day strike organised by 7,000 front-line hospital staff who demanded the government immediately close the border with Mainland China to help control the spread of the virus, and with ongoing strike action threatened if shortages of personal protective equipment for medical staff were not addressed (AFP, 2020; Cheng, 2020b). The depth of social division, distrust and hostility toward the government is worth emphasising, since it might be expected to be an important source of policy failure or, at the very least, a potential catalyst eroding public health measures contributing to the spread of the virus and negating institutional capacity in the fight against the pandemic. In Hong Kong, the body-politic is divided not only by political sentiment but also by deeply held fidelity, with the city split between what is termed the 'yellow-ribbon' (prodemocracy, pro-autonomy/independence) camp and the 'blue-ribbon' (proestablishment, pro-government, pro-Beijing) camp -political colours that impact everyday life, including where one eats, shops and the financial institution residents bank with (or boycott) and not just how one votes or self-identifies. 10 This political fissure, however, has also been an important source of community-based-political mobilisation, morphing from an initial focus on anti-government street demonstrations to the organisation of political campaigns in the district council (November 2019) and up-coming Legislative Council elections (September 2020), and, as of January, also manifesting as a communitybased-political response to COVID-19 in an attempt to overcome what was identified as government ineptitude, dithering and unresponsiveness to the needs and wellbeing of citizens. A comparative global survey of citizen perceptions of government performance in the management of COVID-19, for example, placed Hong Kong the third worst performing jurisdiction (out of 23 major economies studied), behind countries such as Vietnam, India, the United States, the UK, and Italy, and only slightly ahead of France and Japan (Sim, 2020) . For many, and especially those who identify with the yellowribbon camp, the government was seen as either guilty of disinterest in the safety and health security of Hong Kong people, doing the bidding of Beijing in terms of trying to downplay the severity and impact of the virus, or otherwise incompetent to coordinate an effective response. Large swaths of Hong Kong residents simply had no trust or faith in government to do the right thing. According to polling data from the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI), for example, the rate of public dissatisfaction never fell below 50% between in the first five months of 2020, reaching its highest (76%) in late February and early March but declining steadily thereafter.",

Government legislation in 2019, for example, outlawing the wearing of facemasks in response to protesters concealing their identity due to fears of electronic surveillance, facial recognition and possible arrest or retribution, was widely pilloried, prompting the mass-adoption of surgical mask wearing as soon as reports of a new virus in the Mainland surfaced (Bradsher, Victor, & May, 2019; K. Leung, 2019, June 28; Tufekci, 2020) . It also exposed contradictory, muddled and poor messaging by the government, allowing the yellowribbon camp to exploit government shortcomings in the response to the pandemic. In the early phase of the pandemic (January-February), for example, the CE refused to wear a facemask and ordered government officials to similarly abstain, playing into concerns 10 The depths of social division cannot be overstated, with retail premises throughout the city caught up in the social divide between pro and anti-government/Beijing sentiment. Retail premises, for example, either covertly list their identification as yellow-or blue-ribbon (often via an App or listing on a webpage) or overtly display their colour ribbon at the entrance to the premises (Chen, 2019; Pao, 2019 ; see also Riordan, 2020) . Indeed, even in the city's international financial and banking sector, the social fissures have been evident, with continuing physical attacks on Mainland Chinese banks, while local banks perceived to be pro-Beijing or pro-government such as HSBC, have been forced to suspend branch operations, often in response to pro-democracy customer boycotts (Liu, McMorrow, & Hammond, 2019; Riordan, 2020) .",

With no government provision of facemasks, grassroots activists, including Joshua Wong (a central youth figure in the Umbrella Movement who was subsequently convicted and served jail time for his role in organising the demonstrations in 2014), seized the opportunity to import facemasks and distribute them free of charge to underprivileged Hong Kong residents, while other yellow-ribbon-affiliated individuals and organisations commenced local production and distribution of facemasks to help Hong Kong residents avoid being price-gouged as demand surged (Cheng, 2020a; Chow, 2020; Ortmann, 2016; Victor, 2019; Yiu, 2020) . Community organised facemask distribution systems were also set in place, providing free facemasks to marginal groups and poor residents throughout Hong Kong by late January and early February, while the government and CE dithered, conflicted by their outlawing of facemask wearing in the hope of controlling the protesters (N.

Indeed, the organising, coordination and communication resources that arose out of the anti-government protests have been leveraged to criticise the government response to COVID-19, fact-check information, and develop community responses to the pandemic. The mass adoption of the encrypted Telegram App, for example, which allowed protesters to keep ahead of government and police attempts to crackdown on planned protests and 'illegal gatherings', has also been used to disseminate COVID-19 information, organise assistance to marginal groups, support yellow-ribbon business impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, organise meals to aged and marginal people, as well as raise an 'army' of volunteers to help disinfect some 4,000 high density tenement buildings and install hand sanitiser dispensers (Banjo, 2019; R. Cheung, 2020) . The App was also used to circulate messages mocking the CE for her comments about wearing facemasks and her eventual appearance at a news media conference wearing a facemask but incorrectly, with messages then circulating about how to wear facemasks correctly and safely (Yap & Wang, 2020) Despite low levels of political legitimacy, governmental authority, and widely held perceptions of government ineptness in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, or perhaps because of them, community-based-political mobilisation has thus been a key resource organising social resources in the fight against the pandemic. While government responses to COVID-19 have emerged, as Tufekci notes, 'it was always a step behind the people' (Tufekci, 2020) .",

Amoy Gardens, a private housing estate comprising 19 high-rise tower blocks and 10,000 residents, became infamous as a SARS 'hotspot', recording 329 confirmed cases which eventually claimed the lives of 33 residents, forcing authorities to lock down high risk tower blocks (Hung, 2003; Siu & Wong, 2004) . At the height of the outbreak, infections in eight separate public hospitals and in more than 170 housing estates across the city brought the city to a virtual standstill, with restaurants, shopping malls, and hotels experiencing huge falls in demand along with air travel and tourist arrivals.",

Several important findings and recommendations were subsequently published in 2004, including scathing criticism of the then Secretary for Health, Dr Yeoh Eng-kiong, noting his poor oversight of the Hospital Authority, the lack of contingency plans by the Hospital Authority for the management of large-scale communicable disease outbreaks, and the failure of health authorities to proactively monitor for Mainland Chinese communicable disease outbreaks, with the report also noting that administrative command structures for the coordination of a whole of government response and mechanisms for public communication of health information were not optimal. The political fallout from the report was such that the Secretary for Health was forced resign, while the head of the Hospital Authority also offered his resignation (Lee, Ann, & Benitez, 2004; Select Committee, 2004; Taylor, 2020) Occurring soon after the Asian Financial crisis (1997-98) which itself had wrought widespread economic dislocation on Hong Kong, the SARS virus permanently changed the attitudes of the Hong Kong government and general public toward infectious disease management, public health preparedness, public health communication practices, and the need for proactive community disease monitoring. In a sense, SARS helped re-make the public health infrastructure of Hong Kong, highlighting the need to emplace public communication protocols, administrative coordination and command structures, and public health monitoring programs (specifically 'an Expert Group on Exchange and Notification Mechanism on Infectious Diseases' under the 'Hong Kong and Guangdong Cooperation Joint Conference' and statutory reporting of communicable diseases between Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong on a monthly basis) in order to provide early warning of new infectious diseases (see, for example, the recommendations of the Select Committee, 2004, which were adopted by the government and health authorities). Together with the emplacement of public health and Hospital Authority contingency plans for the management of large-scale communicable disease outbreaks, the establishment of a new infectious disease program and School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong (2004) , and the subsequent adoption of legislation (the 'Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance'), the institutional capacity of public health authorities and systems was greatly enhanced -remaining in place to the present (see section 15.40 Select Committee, 2004) .",

Cheung & Cheung, 2020) . Apart from an obvious awareness of the dangers of infectious disease associated with high density living, and of Hong Kong's proximity to Mainland China where many transmissible diseases originate, and especially since Hong Kong has been a major transit point into and out of Mainland China, there is an implicit social consciousness and social memory that disposes Hong Kong residents to a heightened alertness to infectious disease outbreaks. The social sensitivity to the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, for example, was far ahead of government announcements or public messaging, with the voluntary and virtually instantaneous adoption of facemasks, social-distancing practices, refusal to attend school in-person, adoption of work-from-home arrangements, and avoidance of public transport, shopping malls, and public gatherings.",

Much of the 'job of government' in terms of public health messaging, social distancing, and the adoption of hygiene measures was thus largely already being observed by citizens, private and public organisations before they were officially introduced. Universities, for example, moved immediately to adopt on-line teaching, disallowing students to return to campus after the Chinese New Year (25 January), advising staff to work from home, closing classrooms, campus facilities, and all face-to-face meetings without any formal directive from the government or health authorities. Private sector organisations were also quick to adopt 'flexible work' practices, allowing employees to work from home before the introduction of any formal government directives or closure of government offices. Public awareness and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic thus led government policy responses, with government policy 'catching up' to community sentiment.",

A canonical assumption is that the standard dimensions of policy capacity (i.e., analytical, managerial, and political across individual, organizational, and systemic levels) encompass the manifold characteristics and complexities of the state. The concept of legitimation capacity has since been introduced to enrich the notion of political-systemic capacity by accounting for public trust in government institutions; no longer are the administrative characteristics of the state the sole determinant of its effectiveness. Recognition of a state-society dialectic, while far from novel in policy studies, was due an introduction to theories about policy capacity specifically, and legitimation capacity filled that need. We extend this progress by arguing that community capacity supplements existing understandings of policy and legitimation capacity, and should therefore be incorporated more systematically into capacity studies; this is a justifiable undertaking as the boundary between state and society in pandemic response can become blurred -especially where policy action lags and the public perceives and responds to an existential threat.",

Just as the Hong Kong protest movement lacked a leader or central coordinating mechanism beyond social media communications, so too did the public's response to the COVID-19 crisis. The latter is distinguishable by the independent behaviors of individuals and reflects elements of formal mobilization where, for example, individual volunteers and ad hoc groups or 'brigades' assisted in making and distributing facemasks (Tufekci, 2020; US News, 2020; Wong, 2020) . Despite apparent and measurable cases, community capacity in response to COVID-19 has thus far been explicitly addressed in only a few studies (Abir et al., 2020; Pitas & Ehmer, 2020; Cheng, 2020b; World Health Organization, 2020) and in only one that examines Hong Kong (specifically, the role of media messaging in community capacity (Buheji & Ahmed, 2020) ). As such, the community capacity perspective is a potentially fruitful opportunity for continued studies of COVID-19 response and crisis resilience more generally. Furthermore, the Hong Kong case offers a unique opportunity to analyze community capacity in a developed context characterized by low public trust and political legitimacy -a combination of factors that may in time describe an increasing number of country cases.",

Hong Kong's COVID-19 response illustrates, however, that legitimation capacity in a democratic or quasi-democratic system is not necessarily the cornerstone of crisis mitigation and broader policy effectiveness. Based on capital from social memory and trust from the solidarity of political action, Hong Kong witnessed a type of emergent community capacity as collective mobilization for anticipatory crisis response that initially outpaced the efforts of government. The result was a relatively successful earlystage mitigation that placed the city on a stable footing and thereby eased the burden on ramped-up policy measures that followed. The Hong Kong government was saved in this instance from the potential failings of its own weak legitimation capacity. To rephrase a quote attributed to Lao Tzu, people are best when the government barely knows they exist, and when their work is done, their aim fulfilled, the government will say 'we did it together.'",

            "text": "In closing, community capacity is by no means limited to settings with low legitimation capacity, and its role in precipitating a collective outcome independent of or even in contradiction to formal policy efforts displays itself worldwide in numerous examples of civil society action on crisis response, social welfare, and local resilience to climate threats, among others. Such conversations are well developed in the literature about civil society mobilization and its variants. What makes this case and theoretical contribution unique, however, in the context of a global crisis whose successful response is contingent on fluid discourse between science and policy, and between fact and ideology more broadly. The resources that inform Hong Kong's community capacity include a collective proprietary wisdom and social memory forged through the traumatic experience of the SARS crisis. Layered onto this is the acutely compromised credibility of the Hong Kong government in the eyes of many residents -particularly among younger generations. Given that people turn in times of crisis to government for credible scientific information and related guidance for individual behaviour, it is indeed notable that Hong Kong saw earlystage progress mitigating COVID-19 through community initiative, without an early and aggressive policy posture to prompt it. In short, the urgency of government, as displayed through eventual policy action, lagged that of the public. This evident effectiveness of community capacity suggests new ways of viewing and operationalizing elements of the policy capacity framework -a task deserving further research. More broadly, the case lends additional nuance to discussions about state-society relations at a time when convergent crises test the durability of fossilized governance models. The crisis response capacity of society, as built on social memory and solidarity, invites policy scholarship to extend the conceptual boundaries of policy capacity, capturing not only public sector capacity and private sector capacity in service to policy needs but also the pent-up capacity of a society that, in Hong Kong's case as increasingly in others, possesses copious social memory but little trust in government. These elements coalesce into a complex and durable form of policy capacity and crisis preparedness.",

Despite the Bill eventually being withdrawn due to large scale and often violent protests, the social protests persisted for several months until the end of 2019. Similar protests returned in 2020, but constrained by the needs of social distancing and community concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic(Liu, 2020;S.-L. Wong & Liu, 2020).",
