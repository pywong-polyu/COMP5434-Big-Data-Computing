A sample of 1,929 participants answered an online survey, however 1,874 were included in the analysis. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits was assessed inquiring about participants' intake of fruits, vegetables, fried foods, and sweets during the pandemic. Physical activity was assessed by asking participants about their weekly frequency, intensity and number of minutes/hours engaging in structured physical activities per week. Participants were then stratified into categories based on moderate-to-vigorous intensity (0-30; 31-90; 91-150; 151-300; and >300 min/week) and into active (\u2265150 min) or inactive (<150 min). Increased sweets consumption was the most commonly reported change to eating habits (42.5%), followed by an increase in the consumption of vegetables (26.6%), fruits (25.9%), and fried foods (17.9%). Physical activity practice was related to lower consumption of fried foods (OR = 0.60; p < 0.001) and sweets (OR = 0.53; p < 0.001). A cluster analysis revealed subjects with higher the level of physical activity was more likely to follow a healthy diet (p < 0.001). Thus, physical activity was positively associated with healthier eating habits. Health authorities must recommend regular physical as a strategy to improve overall health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should address the physical activity interventions to improve health status during a pandemic.",

Subsequently, clusters using the sum of \"increased consumption of healthy foods\" (fruits + vegetables) and \"unhealthy foods\" (sweets + fried foods) were created. The score variation ranged from zero to two. After the creation of these two clusters, the difference in the \"healthy eating habits\" cluster was calculated by subtracting from it the \"unhealthy eating habits\" cluster. A comparison of differences in the eating habits clusters and physical activity levels [(a) 0-30 min/MVPA; (b) 31-90 min/MVPA; (c) 91-150 min/MVPA; (d) 151-300 min/MVPA and (e) >300 min/MVPA] was performed using a One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

For example, if a participant answered that he or she performed physical activity for 30-60 min, we determined that at least 30 min of activity was performed. We then multiplied 30 min by the frequency of physical activity reported for the week. Bonferroni's post-hoc test was used to detect possible differences.

Preliminary research has shown that regular physical activity during COVID-19 has been essential for maintaining health (Chen et al., 2020a) . We discovered the prevalence of moderate to vigorous physical activity was higher in women. The vast majority of the literature has reported that men are more likely to engage in regular physical activity (Fernandes et al., 2010; Christofaro et al., 2019) . One of the reasons for these findings may be due to history effects. In May 2020, in response to social distancing requirements, gyms were closed and activities such as team sports and football, which are widely practiced in Brazil were restricted. Men most often participate in these forms of physical activity. In addition, one of the study hypotheses is that moderate intensity physical activity related to domestic services (American College of Sports Medicine., 2018) were increased, which disproportionately affect women and lead to increased physical activity levels within this group, specifically. In addition, previous studies show that the practice of physical activity has been related to better eating habits (Pavi\u010di\u0107 \u017de\u017delj et al., 2019) , which seems to have been confirmed during quarantine, as indicated by the results of the present study. This relationship could perhaps be caused by the fact that women are more concerned with health when compared to men and because they often concerned about health status (Werneck et al., 2020) .",

Torres and Nowson (2007) showed that stress can alter food intake and subsequently contribute to obesity. Mattioli et al.

The cross-sectional design prevents any determination of cause-and-effect between participation in regular physical activity and eating habits. Additionally, more women than men completed the survey, which reduces our ability to generalize these results. Another potential limitation is that the questionnaire did not provide an option for respondents to report decreased food intakes Finally, all measures were self-reported and the physical activity measurement tool was not previously validated. However, the large sample size and the fact that these data examined health behaviors during social isolation and widespread quarantine, may help us understand how behaviors may change during such an unprecedented period in time.",

Health promotion actions aiming at increasing/maintaining physical activity and the consumption of fresh foods and reduction of ultra-processed foods must be developed and tested, especially in times of pandemic in which these problems may be accentuated.",
