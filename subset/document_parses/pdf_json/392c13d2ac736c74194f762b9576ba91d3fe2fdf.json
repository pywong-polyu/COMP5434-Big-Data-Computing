The first goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of germination to improve the nutritional composition (proximate composition and levels of vitamins B1 and B2), content of bioactive compounds (glucosinolates, phenolics and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and antioxidant activity of moringa seed. Germination improved protein, fat, fiber, riboflavin, phenolics, some individual glucosinolates (GLS) and GABA contents, as well as the antioxidant potential in moringa sprouts, but the extent of the improvement depended on germination conditions. The second objective of this work was to identify the optimal germination conditions to maximize nutritional and bioactive quality of moringa by applying multi-response optimization (response surface methodology, RSM). RSM models indicated that 28 \u2022 C and 24 h were the optimal conditions to enhance the accumulation of riboflavin, phenolics and antioxidant activity of sprouts, while the highest GABA and total GLS contents were observed at 36 \u2022 C for 96 h and thiamine achieved the maximum content at 36 \u2022 C for 24 h. These results show that moringa sprouts are promising functional foods that might be also used as ingredients for the elaboration of novel foodstuffs.",

The high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the fact that an effective strategy to reduce the scaling of these pathologies in to control the activity of inflammatory mediators via modifiable risk factors such as diet [4] , make the consumption of moringa an attractive approach for preventing the development of NCDs. The health-promoting properties of moringa have been attributed to their high content of bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, alkaloids and terpenes, which have been reported to be the most abundant metabolites in moringa leaves [5] . Although moringa leaves have been deeply studied, information on moringa seeds is less abundant. Most of the studies performed in seed have been focused on the evaluation of the proximate composition in defatted moringa seed and oil [6] , as well as on the utilization of seeds and isolated seed proteins for animal feeding [7] . Several studies have demonstrated the high nutritional value of moringa seeds due to their content in proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals [8] and the presence of phytochemicals such as alkaloids (moringine), phenolic compounds, sterols, and glucosinolate derivatives [9, 10] suggesting their great potential for development of novel and healthy food products.",

            "text": "Germination is a natural physiological plant process that starts with water uptake and concludes with the appearance of the radicle [11] . This process enhances the nutritional value and phytochemical content in diverse edible seeds [12] . It has been evidenced that germination causes a remarkable increase of the content of group B and C vitamins [13] , proteins and the levels of several bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in grains [14, 15] . Biochemical and physiological changes in seeds strongly depends on soaking time and germination conditions (presence/absence of light, temperature and time) [14, 16] . Therefore, the careful selection of the most suitable germination conditions for each seed is crucial to improve its nutritional value and health-promoting properties [17] . It has been reported that moringa sprouts obtained at 30 \u2022 C for four days exhibited higher lipid (26%) and protein (9.5%) contents than ungerminated seeds [18] . However, to our knowledge, there is no information in the literature regarding the influence of germination conditions on nutritional and phytochemical composition of moringa seeds. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of germination temperature and time on the proximate composition and content of thiamine, riboflavin, free phenolic compounds and GABA as well as on the antioxidant activity of moringa sprouts. A multi-response optimization approach was applied to identify the optimal germination conditions that improve nutritional and health-promoting features in sprouted moringa seed. Since naturalness and minimal processing are two of the most desired attributes by consumers nowadays [19] , the identification of optimal germination conditions in moringa seeds will help to develop, through an economical technology, novel ingredients from moringa in line with current consumer preferences.",

Ash content (3.3 g/100 g) in moringa seed is in agreement with literature data [23, 24] and it was decreased during germination, suggesting a slight decrease of mineral content in moringa sprouts. The protein content in moringa seed (~28 g/100 g d.m) was within the range of values earlier reported [25, 26] . In general, protein content increased significantly during germination, and the extent of such increment depended on the germination conditions. Moringa sprouts obtained at 32 \u2022 C for 60-96 h and at 36 \u2022 C for 60 h exhibited the highest protein levels. Ijarotomi et al. [18] reported an enhancement of protein content in moringa germinated at 30 \u2022 C for 4 days. The rise in protein levels might be explained by the loss of carbohydrates through respiration, causing perceptual increase in other nutrients, such as proteins. The increase in protein levels observed in moringa sprouted at different germination conditions is less than 15%, results that match with those previously reported in cereal sprouts [27] .",

Moringa seeds exhibited levels of thiamine of 1113.5 \u00b5g/100 g d.m., which fell within the range of values previously found [25] . Sprouting did not substantially affect the thiamine content in moringa, with exception of germination at 32 \u2022 C for 24-96 h and 36 \u2022 C for 96 h that showed 10-12% reduction. It has been reported that sprouting stimulates de accumulation of B vitamins in cereal seeds to support seedling development and growth [30] . However, there is no scientific data concerning the effect of germination conditions on thiamine content in moringa seeds. Our results suggest that de novo synthesis of thiamine in moringa is only initiated at lower temperatures in later germination stages, as it has been concluded by Moongngarm and Saetung [31] in sprouted rice, or at high temperatures for short germination times. The leaching of thiamine in water during moringa soaking might explain the slight reduction found in some moringa sprouts. Riboflavin content in moringa seeds was higher than values previously reported in other moringa varieties [28] . The content of riboflavin in moringa did not change or even increased during germination, and the highest values were observed at 28 \u2022 C and 24 h. It has been found that the content of riboflavin increased gradually throughout the germination period up to the fifth day in rapeseeds [32] and wheat seeds [33] .

            "text": "The content of total and individual GLS identified in moringa seeds and sprouts is presented in Table 3 . Glucomoringin (4-\u03b1-rhamnopyranosyloxy-benzyl GLS) (Figure 2 ) was the main GLS found in moringa seeds, as reported earlier [9, 34, 35] . Small amounts of sinalbin (p-hydroxybenzyl glucosinolate) ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ) were also present in the seed in agreement with a previous study [36] . Table 3 . Content of glucomoringin, sinalbin, glucotropaeolin and total glucosinolates (GLS) (\u00b5mol/g d.m.) in moringa seed and their sprouts obtained at different germination conditions. Significant differences (p \u2264 0.05) in the levels of individual GLS between moringa seed and their sprouts were observed. Sprouts exhibited a significant (p \u2264 0.05) lower content of sinalbin than seed, whilst changes in glucomoringin depended on germination conditions. Moringa sprouts obtained at 28 \u2022 C for 24-60 and 32-36 \u2022 C for 96 h presented smaller levels of glucomoringin than seed, while germinated moringa obtained in the rest of germination conditions showed an increase in the content of this compound. Moreover, moringa sprouts obtained in all temperatures at germination periods of 60-96 h also exhibited low amounts of glucotropaeolin (Figure 2 ), compound that was not found in moringa seeds. These results are consistent with those reported by Maldini et al. [36] , who also found small levels of glucotropaeolin in 12-day-old seedlings of moringa but not in seed pulp and coat. Total GLS significantly decreased (p \u2264 0.05) in moringa sprouts, with the exception of those produced at 32 \u2022 C for 24-60 h and 36 \u2022 C for 60 h. These results indicate that longer germination periods cause higher diminution of GLS content. As previously reported, postharvest processing strongly affects GLS content in brassica vegetables [37] . Upon cellular injury of plant tissues during processing, GLS are enzymatically degraded by a thioglucosidase enzyme (myrosinase) to a wide variety of breakdown products such as glucose, sulfate, isothiocyanates, epithionitriles, nitriles, indolic alcohols, oxazolidinethions, amines, and thiocyanate [38] . The reduction of total GLS amount observed in most of the moringa sprouts can be attributed to the selective metabolism of some individuals GLS such as sinalbin by myrosinase enzyme [39] during germination. In agreement with our results, recent studies have reported a diminution of total GLS content during sprouting of brassica vegetables such a broccoli and rocket [40, 41] . Our results also evidenced that germination in selected conditions activates the biosynthesis of glucomoringin and glucotropaeolin, findings in accordance with those observed by other authors, who reported the increase of levels of some individual GLS in different germinating brassica seeds [42, 43] . The branched chain amino transferase, methylthioalkylmalate synthase, and sulfotransferases are key enzymes involved in GLS synthesis, while BCA, CYP and AOP are the most important genes in GLS biosynthetic pathway [44] . Our results suggest that certain germination conditions may influence the expression of these genes, thus affecting the activity of enzymes involved in GLS synthesis pathway.",

            "text": "GLS are sulfur-containing secondary metabolites that alongside with their breakdown products exert chemopreventive, anti-tumor and antimicrobial activity [45] . Current literature has shown that glucomoringin derivatives are able to counteract the inflammatory cascade involved in multiple sclerosis [46] and exert antibacterial activity [47] . Sinalbin has been shown to exhibit in vitro antiproliferative, proapoptotic and antimicrobial effects [48] , while glucotropaeolin derivatives showed preventive activity against breast and prostatic cancers in animal models [49, 50] . Thus, moringa sprouts can be considered a good source of health-promoting GLS. Table 4 summarizes the GABA content in moringa seeds and sprouts obtained at different germination temperatures and times. Non-germinated moringa seeds showed a GABA content of 50.07 mg/100 g d.m., value notably higher than levels reported in other seeds such as pseudocereals [16] and legumes [51] . Germination improved notably the levels of GABA in moringa, showing sprouts increments between 1.8-8.8 fold in the levels of this compound, depending on germination conditions. The only exception was observed when moringa seeds were germinated at 32 \u2022 C for 24 h, conditions in which sprouts showed lower GABA concentration than seeds. In general, an increase in GABA was observed with longer germination times, which indicated the strong influence of germination period on its biosynthesis in moringa. The highest GABA accumulation was observed after germination at 36 \u2022 C for 96 h (219.19 mg/100 g d.m.). GABA is a non-protein amino acid that acts as an important depressive neurotransmitter in the nervous system and also as a potent blood pressure and heart rate regulator. Other GABA-related health functions include diabetes prevention, diuresis, and sedation [12] . During germination, endogenous enzyme systems are activated, and proteins are hydrolyzed into free amino acids such as glutamic acid, a GABA precursor. Additionally, glutamate decarboxylase and diamine oxidase, enzymes involved in GABA biosynthesis through decarboxylation of glutamic acid and polyamines, respectively, are activated during germination [50] . The highest GABA content found in moringa sprouts obtained at 36 \u2022 C observed in this work is consistent with a previous study showing that the optimal activity of glutamate decarboxylase occurs at temperatures close to 40 \u2022 C [52] . Table 4 collects the FPC in moringa seeds and sprouts produced at different germination conditions. FPC observed in moringa seeds (418.02 mg GAE/100 g d.m.) was higher than that reported for a moringa variety grown in Mexico [53] . Moringa seed is an excellent source of phenolic compounds, exhibiting levels of these phytochemicals much higher than those found in other grains such as cereals, pseudocereals, and other less known sources of sprouts such as teff, evening primrose, phacelia and fenugreek [14, 16, 54, 55] .",

Temperatures ranging 28-32 \u2022 C for periods of 24-60 h enhanced the levels of FPC significantly (p \u2264 0.05) in moringa. However, 28 \u2022 C applied for 96 h and 36 \u2022 C for 24-60 h led to lower phenolic contents in the soluble fraction compared to the ungerminated seed. The enhancement of activity and gene expression of key enzymes involved in phenolics biosynthesis during germination have been well documented [56] . The activity of enzymes participating in phenylpropanoid pathway, one of the routes responsible for phenolic accumulation in plants, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), is drastically influenced by germination time and temperature. In this sense, Tesfay et al. [57] observed that the activity of PAL enzyme is maximal at temperatures of 20-30 \u2022 C. These findings support the results of the present work, were the highest phenolic content was found at germination temperature of 28 \u2022 C for short periods of time. Moreover, activation of cell wall-degrading enzymes (cellulases, endoxylanases and esterases) that hydrolyze phenolic compounds bound to cell wall during germination at temperatures in the range 28-32 \u2022 C might also contribute to the increase of phenolic levels in moringa sprouts obtained at these temperatures, as it has been previously reported in other plant sprouts [30] .",

(Table 4) , which was remarkably enhanced during all germination conditions assayed, with the exception of 36 \u2022 C for 96 h. Our results indicate that the accumulation of phenolic compounds in moringa sprouts was positively influenced by mild temperatures and shorter germination times (Table 4) , thus contributing to the antioxidant activity of sprouted moringa. It has been shown that germination promotes the antioxidant potential in other plant seeds [16, 58] . During germination, there is an uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can cause oxidative stress and severe cellular deterioration and, therefore, plant antioxidant enzymes are activated at the early stage of germination [59] . In fact, it has been reported that superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the major antioxidant defense system against the superoxide radical, is activated during the first day of germination of peanut seed and its activity decrease dramatically afterwards [60] . These findings are in accordance with the highest antioxidant activity of moringa sprouts obtained after 24 h in this work.",

The contribution of each factor to the properties of moringa sprouts is important in order to optimize the conditions of germination process to maximize their quality. Response variables (contents of thiamine, riboflavin, GLS, GABA, FPC and antioxidant activity) were modelled as a function of germination temperature and time. The regression models obtained are presented in Table 5 . All models exhibited a non-significant (p > 0.05) lack-of-fit and were significant (p \u2264 0.05), as evidenced by ANOVA analysis (results not shown). The values of the coefficient of determination higher than 0.75 for all models indicate their suitability to explain the variability of experimental data ( Table 5 ). Both germination time and temperature exerted a strong linear and quadratic influence on the response variables analyzed, being the interactive effect between both factors also significant. Optimal germination conditions determined by RSM were a temperature of 28 \u2022 C for 24 h to enhance the contents of riboflavin, FPC and antioxidant activity in moringa sprouts, while 36 \u2022 C in combination with times of 24 and 96 h maximized the levels of thiamine and GABA, respectively (Table 5) .",

Time and temperature exhibited important interactive effects on thiamin content during germination of moringa, and temperature of 36 \u2022 C combined with shorter germination times were the conditions that caused the highest accumulation of this vitamin (Figure 3a) . Riboflavin content was mainly influenced by germination temperature, while the impact of time was less relevant (Figure 3b ). Combinations of low temperatures and short germination times produced moringa sprouts with the largest levels of riboflavin. Germination time was the most important factor influencing the GLS content in moringa sprouts, as previously reported [61] , being the effect of temperature less notable (Figure 3c ). Short germination times favored the retention of GLS, while longer times caused the reduction of total GLS levels possibly due to the activation of myrosinase enzyme. GABA increased steadily in moringa with germination time, regardless of the temperature used (Figure 3d ). Longer germination times and higher temperatures resulted in the most pronounced accumulation of GABA. A decreasing trend was observed for FPC at germination temperatures up to 32 \u2022 C with increasing germination time (Figure 3e) . However, the opposite behavior occurred at temperatures from 32 to 36 \u2022 C, in which FPC content was enhanced as germination time augmented. Germination temperature was the most important factor affecting the antioxidant potential in moringa, being its influence more important at shorter germination times (Figure 3f) . Optimal germination conditions determined by RSM were a temperature of 28 \u2022 C and 24 to enhance the contents of riboflavin, FPC and antioxidant activity in moringa sprouts, while 36 \u2022 C in combination with times of 24 and 96 h, maximized the levels of thiamine and GABA, respectively ( Table 5) .",

Germination enhanced the content of fiber, fat, riboflavin, GABA and FPC, as well as the antioxidant potential of moringa sprouts. Total GLS decreased during germination at 96 h while some individual GLS (glucomoringin and glucotropaeolin) increased during moringa sprouting at selected conditions. Multi-response optimization carried out by RSM allowed to identify the optimal germination conditions that maximize the quality of moringa sprouts, which were 28 \u2022 C for 24 h for enhancing the accumulation of riboflavin, free phenolics and antioxidant activity, while the highest thiamine levels were observed at 36 \u2022 C for 24 h. The accumulation of GLS and GABA was favored by higher germination temperatures and longer germination times (36 \u2022 C for 24 h). These results provide interesting insights for the production of moringa sprouts with high content of nutrients and bioactive compounds and large antioxidant potential that can be consumed as such or used as functional ingredients in novel foodstuffs such as pasta, instant powdered foods, snacks, bakery products and drinks.
