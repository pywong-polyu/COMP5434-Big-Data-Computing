Methods: Anti-S IgG/IgM was determined by a semi-quantitative fluorescence immunoassay in the plasma of COVID-19 patients at the manifestation and rehabilitation stages. The immunoreactivity to fulllength S proteins, C-terminal domain (CTD), and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 fragments were determined by an ELISA assay.

Anti-S IgG and IgM were not apparent until day 14 and day ten, respectively, according to Simple Moving Average analysis with five days' slide window deduction. More than 90% of the rehabilitation patients exhibited IgG and IgM responses targeting CTD-S1 fragments. Decreased total peripheral lymphocytes, CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts were seen in COVID-19 patients at admission and recovered after the rehabilitation. Conclusions: Anti-S IgG and IgM do not appear at the onset with the decrease in T cells, making early serological screening less significant. However, the presence of high IgG and IgM to S1-CTD in the recovered patients highlights humoral responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be associated with efficient immune protection in COVID-19 patients.",

It is caused by a newly identified human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 transmitting mainly through an airborne pathway (Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . Clinical manifestations include fever, tiredness, dry cough, and sometimes diarrhea. One out of six patients becomes a severe case with shortness of breathing, rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and difficult-to-tackle metabolic acidosis, which become the principal causes of death (Lan et al., 2020) . A rapid increase in the number of patients caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 as a pandemic after the outbreak. Disease control thus became a challenge.",

            "text": "Virological investigations reveal that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a positive-strand RNA virus with 29.8 kilo-bases of the whole genome, consisting of six major open-reading frames (ORFs) encoding the replicase (ORF1ab), the spike (S) glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Wu et al., 2020) . It shares nearly 80% identity with SARS-CoV and 96% with BatCoV RaTG13 at the wholegenome level Zhu et al., 2020) . Similar to SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) , the S protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virion mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules (Walls et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . It contains three fragments, including an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular segment. The ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit (S1) and a membrane-fusion subunit (S2). During viral infection, the C-terminal domain of the S1 fragment (S1-CTD) binds to the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 to facilitate viral attachment to the surface of target cells. The N-terminal domain of the S1 fragment (S1-NTD) is reported to bind to the glycans. The attachment triggers the cleavage of S protein between S1 and S2 fragments by cellular proteases, which in turn initiates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes by the S2 unit (Li, 2016) . In humans, ACE2 is mainly expressed on type II pneumocytes, epithelial cells of colon and kidney, etc. (Hamming et al., 2004) . Although the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells is directly from RNA-to-RNA replication, molecular epidemiological investigations demonstrate that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 among different geographic locations or individuals is low (Ahmed et al., 2020) . D164G is the main reported mutation site in S protein (Korber et al., 2020) , which is favorable for vaccine development as well as the dissection of immunological processes.",

Although most of the viral proteins are able to induce specific antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibodies targeting viral S protein are more noteworthy because they can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. The generation of anti-S antibodies is also an important indicator of infection, the amelioration, and the rehabilitation of the disease. Serological characteristics of anti-S IgG in the serum in COVID-19 patients have been reported . A previous study using seven confirmed cases reported an increase of viral antibodies from day five after illness onset . Several reports described the properties of anti-S antibodies and their interaction with ACE2, based on crystal structures (Cao et al., 2020b; Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b) , which supported the concept that antibodies targeting S protein in the rehabilitation individuals are functional enough for plasma transfusion-based therapy (Shen et al., 2020a) .",

Using the 5-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) trajectory of anti-S IgG median values, it was found that anti-S IgG remained at a very low level from the onset of the disease until day 12, where there exhibited an apparent increase in fluorescence signals. The signal values increased until day 22 and remained at that plateau later on (Figure 2A) . When we subgrouped the samples by day 14, a typical time point for antibody generation after a viral infection, it showed that the average value of anti-S IgG since day 14 was dramatically higher than that before day 14 (P < 0.0001) ( Figure 2B ).

At admission, the average total lymphocyte counts were (1.11 AE 0.06) \u00c2 10 9 /L. 51.52% of the onset patients (17/33) had lymphocyte counts below the lower limit (1.10-3.20 \u00c2 10 9 /L). A significant increase in lymphocyte counts was observed up to the average (1.81 AE 0.10) \u00c2 10 9 /L at discharge when compared to the admission point (P < 0.0001) ( Table 3 and Figure 4A ). Among 17 patients with lowered lymphocyte counts at admission, 15 (15/17, 88.90%) were recovered to the normal levels, whereas two patients remained below the cutoff value (1.00 \u00c2 10 9 /L and 0.32 \u00c2 10 9 /L, respectively) ( Figure  4A ).

It was shown that the counts of CD4 + T lymphocyte at discharge increased dramatically in 13 patients (average: 882.31 AE 73.10 cells/mL) when compared to that at admission (average: 445.40 AE 36.51 cells/mL) (P < 0.0001) except for one patient (from 398 to 475 cells/mL) ( Figure 4B ). While total CD3 + (P < 0.0001) and CD8 + T cell counts (P = 0.0003) of 13 patients also increased at discharge ( Figure S1A and S1B), the increase in CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0.0051) ( Figure 4C ) was apparent, indicating that the restoration of the CD4 + T cell pool was more significant. Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between the days of hospital stays and the patients' anti-S IgG titer (Pearson r = \u00c00.4036, P = 0.0198) ( Figure 4D ). These data revealed that although COVID-19 patients exhibited a decrease in lymphocyte pools at the onset of the disease, most of them could restore T cell pools after recovery. The moderate increase in CD4/CD8 ratio implies the expansion of CD4 + T cells to a greater extent.",

            "text": "Unlike low transmission and high mortality of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections that occurred some years ago (WHO), SARS-CoV-2 spreads more prevalently, leading to substantial more infected cases in China as well as worldwide. The virological property of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the development of serological assays upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we have explicitly analyzed anti-S IgG and IgM generation dynamics in COVID-19 patients. At the early stage of the illness, both IgG and IgM levels were very low and reached a high level after recovery. When we analyzed the clinical information collected in parallel (Supplementary Tables S1-S4), it was found that impaired cell counts of peripheral lymphocytes including CD3 + , CD8 + , and CD4 + T cells were the notable features of SARS-CoV-2 patients, which is similar to HIV infection (Gottlieb et al., 1981) . Together with the restoration of periphery lymphocyte pools, the anti-S IgG and IgM increased and reached a certain level after treatments. Therefore, the recovery of lymphocyte numbers might be a significant event associated with the induction of viral-specific anti-IgG and IgM antibodies. This is entirely rational. It is well known that CD4 + T cells play an essential role in mediating adaptive humoral immunity. Upon viral infection, host CD4 + T cells are activated and differentiated into functional subsets, including type 2 help T cells (Th2) to assist B cell activation and trigger humoral immunity. With a deficiency of CD4 + T cells, humoral immunity is impaired (Xin et al., 2018) . In fact, our previous study reported that CD4 + T lymphocyte count at admission was inclined to predict the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection (Ling et al., 2020) . In this study, total lymphocyte and CD4 + T cell counts and the CD4/ CD8 ratio increased in almost all patients, with the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 at discharge. Interestingly, we also observed that the hospital stay was negatively correlated with the anti-S IgG titer, suggesting that anti-S IgG might be protective in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the recovery of T cell homeostasis with antibody induction might be indicative of the clearance of the virus in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients. Being a newly emerging virus, the generation kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG is very important for diagnosis and treatment. According to the WHO's recommendation, the estimated latent period for COVID-19 infection is suggested to be around five days ranging from 1-14 days (WHO). We have observed that the durations to induce high levels of both anti-S IgG and IgM upon SARS-CoV-2 infection were 14 days and ten days, respectively. Another interesting issue is whether viral-specific IgA levels are generated earlier due to the airborne infection, which can be investigated (He et al., 2015) . How long antiviral antibodies will exist after the recovery is more important. A cohort study of 56 convalescent patients with SARS-CoV has shown that virus antigen-specific IgG antibodies peaked at month four after the onset of disease but decreased after that (Liu et al., 2006) . For SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, a recent investigation reveals that a similar duration of antiviral responses exists after the recovery (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020) . Because of the occurrence of re-infection cases in Europe and the USA (Hoang et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) , whether the existing antiviral antibodies exert Figure 3 .

At present, no antiviral drug is demonstrated to be completely effective in treating COVID-19 (Cao et al., 2020a) . Antibody-based treatment is one of the promising ways with more specificity and success in several studies, such as Zika virus Heffron et al., 2018) , Hepatitis Virus C (Brown et al., 2007) , SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection (Butler, 2015; Hui et al., 2018; Mo and Fisher, 2016; Shang et al., 2007) . Since patient plasma contains polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple epitopes of different viral proteins, convalescent plasma therapy's success mostly relies on the broad spectrum in different individuals. Fortunately, the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains genome-stable among infected populations (Shen et al., 2020b ). When we investigated the possible targets of convalescent plasma, especially in the S protein, it was found that the fragment targeted by anti-S IgG and IgM was mainly S1-CTD, whereas very low immunoreactivity was observed to S1-NTD. S1-CTD is mainly responsible for binding to ACE2, while S1-NTD is responsible for binding sugar (Wrapp et al., 2020) . The possible reasons for the dramatic difference in immune reactivity to two S1 fragments may lie in the fact that the S1-NTD fragment displays a ceiling-like structure that would protect their sugar-binding site from host immune surveillance (Li, 2016) . However, the exact mechanisms of the difference in the diverse immunoreactivity to S1-CTD and S1-NTD needs to be further investigated. Nevertheless, the high positivity of anti-S IgG and IgM to the S1-CTD fragment in convalescent patients provides strong support for the plasma transfusion therapy.",
