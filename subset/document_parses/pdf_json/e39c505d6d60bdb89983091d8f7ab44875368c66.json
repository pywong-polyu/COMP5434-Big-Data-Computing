However, the use of these models is a bit difficult for clinical application because they need some poorly definable variables such as hypertension, SAH thickness, and detailed physiologic scores. In 2019, Donkelaar et al. reported SAFIRE score [3] for prediction of SAH outcomes using only four items, which are easy and relatively objective; age, WFNS grade, [34] size of the aneurysm, and Fisher computed tomography (CT) scale [ Table 1 ].

We use WFNS grade on admission, but not Hunt and Hess nor Hunt and Kosnik grade. We mainly performed clipping, but endovascular coiling was considered when it seemed superior to clipping, such as in the posterior circulation aneurysm. Patients with severe hydrocephalus and WFNS Grade IV or V underwent cerebral ventricular drainage, and clipping or coiling was performed when their neurological status improved. Other patients who were not suitable for surgical treatment were treated conservatively. Patients with SAH due to trauma, arteriovenous malformation, or dissection were excluded from this study.

We also measured albumin, white blood cell, lymphocyte, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and brain natriuretic peptide levels at admission. Albumin, lymphocyte, and total cholesterol are known factors for controlling nutritional status score to assess the nutritional status of the patients. [17] We determined the location (anterior cerebral artery, anterior communicating artery, internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, basilar artery, vertebral artery, or undetermined due to severe neurological status treated by conservative therapy as well as diffuse SAH with multiple aneurysms which we could not be judged as ruptured) and size (mm) of the aneurysm, Fisher CT scale, [5] temporal muscle thickness (mm), and area (mm 2 ) as an indicator of systemic skeletal muscle mass [8] [9] [10] [22] [23] [24] 26, 43] based on the results of the CT or CT angiography at admission. We used the Aquilion ONE (Canon Medical Systems Corporation, Tochigi, Japan) to take CT and CT angiography images of 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 1.0 mm voxels. \ue062e slice thickness was reconstructed to 5 mm. \ue062e window width was adjusted to 90 and the window level to 40 for Fisher CT scale evaluation, while window width was adjusted to 300 and the window level to 20 for temporal muscle measurement. Volume rendered images of the CT angiography were made using Ziostation2 (Ziosoft, Tokyo, Japan). SYNAPSE V 4.1.5 imaging software (Fujifilm Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was used for measurement of the aneurysm size and Fisher CT scale. Temporal muscle area and thickness were also measured using SYNAPSE V through the methods described previously. [24, 26] We also investigated the treatment strategy (clipping, coiling, or others, including cerebral ventricular drainage or conservative therapy). To evaluate the outcomes, mRS scores at 6 months after the treatment of all 153 patients were collected by either personal outpatient interviews, reports from the rehabilitation hospital or home doctor, or interviews over the telephone, once the ethical approval was obtained for the study. We dichotomized mRS scores into favorable (mRS 0-3) or poor (mRS 4-6).",

Furthermore, some of the serological test results like glucose level were judged to be important among many other previously reported important factors such as aneurysm location and Fisher CT scale.

Furthermore, the quality of the data itself may be poor, such as items measured manually, qualitative, or subjective. Furthermore, we should perform dimension reduction for clinical use.
