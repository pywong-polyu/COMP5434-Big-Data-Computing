Participants (n = 150) from the main study were recruited, with secondary information on demographic, clinical, and tumor variables collected from the study database. A questionnaire was used to gather data on other socioeconomic variables, herbal consumption, number of healthcare visits, knowledge-attitude-practice of BC, and open-ended questions relating to initial presentation. Presentation delay (time between initial symptom and first consultation) was defined as \ufffd3 months. Diagnosis delay was defined as \ufffd1 month between presentation and diagnosis confirmation. Impact on disease stage and determinants of both delays were examined. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the length and distribution of delays by disease stage. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between delays, cancer stage and factors.",

Visit to providers \ufffd3 times was significantly attributed to a reduced diagnosis delay (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.37, p <0.001), while having a family history of cancer was significantly associated with increased diagnosis delay (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.03-5.04, p = 0.042). The most frequent reasons for delaying presentation were lack of awareness of the cause of symptoms (41.5%), low perceived severity (27.7%) and fear of surgery intervention (26.2%).",

In the region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, breast cancer patients are generally diagnosed at stages III and IV [2, 3] . The 5-year overall survival rate is generally unfavourable.

We conducted a discussion with the participants and gained helpful suggestions for determining which questions required refinement. Through this process, from an initial set of 27 questions, one question about the type of facilities visited to check their symptoms was removed due to redundancy. We also added nine questions to accommodate issues that had not been covered in the initial set of questions. These questions were about patients' address based on their ID card, whether patients still lived at the same address, date of initial symptom, date of first medical contact, distance from their place of residence to the site of first medical contact, and four questions about herbal medicine consumption (the type, dose, and frequency of consumption). While the date of the first breast cancer symptom was already provided in the database, we asked it again in the questionnaire to confirm the information. Five questions were re-worded to improve readability and clarity, and open-ended questions were included at the end of the questionnaire to elicit participants' reasons for presentation delay. The process of face validity resulted in a total set of 35 questions.",

Diagnosis delay was used to define the number of months between the first visit to a medical professional and the date of the first pathology report confirming a diagnosis of breast cancer. When respondents could not remember the date of when the symptoms first appeared or the date when they first visited a health facility, we asked for a time span in months. After providing the range of months, we sought to direct the patient to remember the distance between those dates from important dates/events such as family/respondent's birthdays, or religious holidays, to further narrow the range and improve the recall closer to the exact date. When provided with a single month, we tried to ask about the exact day or its distance with other important events in the month, to further narrow the date into a single exact day. We also set breast surgery/procedure dates that were recorded in clinical notes as a benchmark, because it was considered by most patients as an important event. Participants were asked the date of first symptom and first medical visit, based on surgery date as a benchmark. When respondents were unable to provide a date for when their symptoms began or the first provider visit, they were asked to provide a month or month range and year. If they provided a month, the date was estimated as the 15th of that month; if they provided a month range, the estimated date was the midpoint between the 15th of those months. If patients were only able to provide a year, the estimated date was June 30th of that year [13] .",

We also collected information on the use of herbal medicine before the first consultation after breast problem recognition. Knowledge about breast cancer risk factors was interviewed and classified as not know any risk factor or know at least one of the risk factors that are determined elsewhere [31] . The frequency of breast self-exam was categorized as rarely or never, at least once every 6 months, at least once a month, and at least once a week. Features of the patient's experience with the breast problem were categorized as breast lump, other complaint, and breast lump and other complaint. Family history of cancer (none or presence) and the presence of comorbidities (none, 1, or \ufffd2) were categorized based on self-report from the existing database. Comorbidities included diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis, heart failure, or other health problems. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and height. We used the World Health Organization Asia-Pacific body mass index classifications, which classified BMI into underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-22.9), overweight (23-24.9) and obese (\ufffd25). For analysis purposes, we further stratified BMI into two groups: underweight to normal (<23) and overweight to obese (\ufffd23). Information of performance index (determined as ECOG 0-1 or \ufffd2) was obtained from the database. Breast cancer was staged using the 7th edition AJCC staging system and then simplified as early (stage I-II), locally advanced (stage III) and metastatic (stage IV) disease [32] . A content analysis of the interview transcripts [33] was performed to assess the patients' reasons for a delay in presentation. We coded the interview transcripts by open coding, organising responses into a meaningful set of categories that covered all relevant data.",

A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to elucidate the factors that are attributable to both presentation and diagnosis delays.

Variables with a p-value <0.25 in the univariate logistic regression plausibly related to a presentation or diagnosis delay were included in the multiple logistic regression models. Variables that correlated highly with another variable in the model was removed. A similar approach was used to explore the association between presentation and diagnosis delay with cancer stage at diagnosis. The statistical significance was based on a two-sided p-value of <0.05.

We conducted two analysis models for each type of delay to investigate the correlation between delays and presenting with a more advanced stage at diagnosis. Model 1 for presentation delay is adjusted for education level, monthly income, number of risk factors of breast cancer known, habit of breast self-exam, first presenting symptom and number of comorbidities. Model 1 for diagnosis delay is adjusted for education level, monthly income, frequency of medical visit before diagnosis, number of risk factors of breast cancer known, habit of breast self-exam, first presenting symptom and number of comorbidities. Model 2 for presentation delay is an analysis of model 1 for presentation delay which also adjusted with diagnosis delay. Model 2 for diagnosis delay is an analysis of model 1 for diagnosis delay which is also adjusted with presentation delay. When focused on model 2, \ufffd3 months of delay in the presentation was associated with an increased risk of having a more advanced stage disease (III-IV) (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.97-5.01, p = 0.059), although significance was not reached. Patients with a delay in diagnosis of \ufffd1 month were more likely to present with a more advanced stage (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.28-7.19, p = 0.012). When extended to various presentation and diagnosis time, it is demonstrated that more participants with longer delays presented with more advanced stages (see S1 Table) . Delays also increased the risk of having a lower BMI. The risk of BMI \ufffd23 at the time of diagnosis was significantly higher in participants with \ufffd3 months of delay in presentation (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.07-4.01, p = 0.030) compared to those with no delays. Nevertheless, the risk was not significantly increased in participants with \ufffd1 month of delay in diagnosis when compared to their counterparts (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.43-1.69, p = 0.644) (see S2 Table) . Table 6 displayed reasons for 65 patients who waited for \ufffd3 months to seek help from health professionals after their first breast complaint. When asked why they did not go to a health facility earlier, the most frequent reason was not that the initial symptom did not cause bother and thinking that it was not a serious problem (27, 41 .5%). This was followed by assuming that the symptoms were not cancer or a serious condition that required medical attention (18, 27 .7%) and fear for surgery (17, 26.2%) . For the whole cohort, there were two participants, one presented within 3 months and the other waited for \ufffd3 months, who stated that they were afraid of going out because of the possibility of contracting COVID-19 in the health facility (see S3 Table) .",

Delays in presentation were found for 43.3%, with delays potentially associated with a monthly household income of <3,000,000 IDR (equivalent to~USD 200). Delays in diagnosis were experienced by 64.7% of participants, attributable to visiting a healthcare centre >3 times and family history of cancer. Our findings highlighted those women who presented late often presented with an advanced stage of the disease.

However, their impact and mitigation strategies are yet to be described and evaluated in Indonesian settings. In our local setting, lower-income is potentially associated with a presentation delay, supporting findings in other countries [10, 19, 29] . The introduction of national universal health coverage in 2014 sought to increase access to healthcare to the population [35] . However, various out-of-pocket expenses remain, not covered by universal health coverage, such as transportation and logistics linked to presentation, diagnosis and subsequent treatments. Despite a large proportion of medical-related costs covered, there is still a financial burden placed on families with lower economic status. In addition, patients from lower socio-economic groups may have less health awareness and suboptimal family support [10] .",

Although we explored patientlevel factors, we did not specifically explore elements of the health service surrounding provider delays. The main factors for system-oriented delay include failure of medical practitioners to act on clinical findings, maltreatment of symptoms as benign breast disease, falsenegative or misinterpretation of mammogram, and false-negative results of fine-needle aspiration cytology [9, 10, 12, 16, 36] . These factors may be targets for inclusion in future investigation and improvement initiatives. In the research literature, delays in diagnosis may be reduced through the provision of more efficient training programmes for members of the medical profession. Furthermore, our findings indicate a need for simpler and more efficient referral systems to access centres providing cancer care. As a response to long referral and waiting times in cancer care, the Swedish government launched a national policy called \"standardized cancer patient pathways\" [37] . This policy assigned all phases, from the first suspicion of cancer until the point of receiving treatment, with an appointed maximum time-scale, based on the optimal time for the patients and variation between diagnoses. Similar policies have been introduced across countries including Denmark and Norway [38, 39] . Furthermore, a family history of cancer is also associated with an increased risk of diagnosis delay in our local cohort, supporting other reports [40, 41] . Fear of treatment and its side effects that may have been witnessed in other family members could be a reason for delaying diagnosis and requires further exploration.",

            "text": "Most patients tend to ignore symptoms, are not alarmed when they initially appear and do not limit daily activity. This may lead individuals to believe it is not harmful and thus delay seeking medical help. As much as 41.5% of women discredited the symptom due to the absence of pain and 27.7% thought it was not serious and thus did not require any medical attention. Delays in help-seeking behaviour have a major effect on a patient's prognosis and survival, yet, are potentially preventable. Recent studies reported a low awareness level of breast cancer risk factors, barriers, attitudes and breast cancer screening among Indonesian women. This may reflect an inadequate or a lack of breast cancer awareness in the country [42, 43] . Additional education programs aiming to increase awareness and public education has been recommended [43] to improve awareness of breast cancer signs and symptoms. There is an urgent need to develop communication and education strategies regarding breast cancer symptoms and early detection for Indonesia, such as specifically motivating early detection practices and breast self-examination [44] . Various methods could be explored, including mass media, various forms of literature, and programmes. One example is the 'Be Cancer Alert Campaign', using mass media for raising breast and colorectal cancer awareness conducted in Malaysia [45] . In one systematic review, a breast cancer awareness campaign was found to increase the initiation of breast self-examination behaviours and increase the attendance of breast cancer screening [46] . There is scope to explore the feasibility and wider evaluation of similar campaigns in Indonesia. For example, a policy of breast cancer self-examination was introduced by the Indonesian Ministry of Health in 2015 but has yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Our findings reemphasize the need for cancer prevention programs to focus on making women aware of any symptoms in the breast, especially in those with lower economic status. Others indicated that women living in urban areas have a poorer level of knowledge of breast cancer risk factors compared to those living in more rural areas. This group may also serve as a target for future awareness programs [43] .",

Inclusion from the existing cohort study may introduce some limitations. The study mostly recruited women with good ECOG index, without terminal disease, and who were chemotherapy-naive. Some patients have died because of a terminal disease that developed after diagnosis and treatment administration. Patients with very poor clinical performance and heavily pretreated cases were not included due to the exclusion criteria of the main study. Furthermore, the vast majority of patients underwent staging in the hospital site in which the research team is based (type A hospital) so that there were time intervals between diagnostic confirmation in the district hospitals (type B hospitals) and stage establishment. Some cases possibly have already developed a more advanced stage during the elapsing time. However, a 1-month interval is indicated as representative staging time after being diagnosed in the previous health care [47] . Those who did not experience diagnosis delay in our cohort had a median referral time interval from type B hospitals to ours of 54 days. Many interviews carried out in this study were completed months after participant recruitment to the main study. The first case was recruited in May 2018 while interviews began in September 2020. As a consequence, there is a 1-29 month interval between the first intake in the main study and interviews for this study.
