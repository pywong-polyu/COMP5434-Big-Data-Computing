In the current study, we screened for genes associated with the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and positively correlated with antigen-presenting cell infiltration and identified KLRG1 and CBFA2T3 as potential tumor antigens for mRNA vaccines in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Further analyses of immune subtypes revealed that patients with early-stage LUAD, high immune cell infiltration, high immune checkpoint expression, and low tumor mutation burden might benefit from mRNA vaccination. Moreover, we identified four biomarkers that can be used to assess mRNA vaccination suitability. We also identified potentially sensitive anti-cancer drugs for populations not suitable for vaccination by means of anti-cancer drug susceptibility prediction. Overall, we provided a new perspective for mRNA vaccine treatment strategies for LUAD and emphasized the importance of precise and personalized treatments.",

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common lung cancer pathological subtype and great progress has been made recently regarding individualized and precise treatments. To date, surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage LUAD but surgical opportunities are often missed in asymptomatic patients (Tanoue et al., 2015; Abbas 2018) . Therefore, alternatives are required for those lung cancer patients that cannot undergo surgery. In these cases, other important treatment strategies can be used, such as targeted therapy (e.g., targeting EGFR mutations) and immunotherapy (Mayekar and Bivona 2017; Osmani et al., 2018) . However, resistance to EGFR-TKI or low immune checkpoint expression remains challenging (Wu and Shih 2018; Santarpia et al., 2020) . Hence, a new strategy for the precise treatment of LUAD needs to be developed.",

Among the different types of vaccines, mRNA vaccines have advantages such as being easy to prepare; mRNA does not integrate into the host's genome and they can be degraded by RNases in cells, increasing their long-term safety (Pardi et al., 2018) . The clinical safety of mRNA vaccines was indeed confirmed after their vast clinical application in COVID-19 prevention (Polack et al., 2020) . Currently, several mRNA cancer vaccines are undergoing clinical trials (Li et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Cafri et al., 2020) , but no relevant reports on mRNA vaccines for LUAD have been reported.",

Eventually, we used 1-Tom as the distance to cluster the genes. The minimum number of genes per module was set to 20. To further analyze the modules, we calculated the dissimilarity of the module eigengenes, set the sensitivity to 2, and no modules were merged. Nine modules were identified after the soft threshold was set at three. Then, the correlation between modules and cluster classification were analyzed. KEGG functional enrichment analysis of genes in modules of interest was performed using \"Clusterprofiler\". The predictive ability of each gene for prognosis was assessed using ROC curves plotted by the \"timeROC\" R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/ package=timeROC).

Also, tumor cell heterogeneity caused by these variations drives phenotypic adaptation during tumor progression, leading to drug resistance (Sansregret et al., 2018) . Therefore, to find tumorspecific antigens in LUAD as potential mRNA vaccine targets, we first investigated the chromosomal variation landscape in LUAD using the GISTIC software (Mermel et al., 2011) . We considered genes affected by regions with significant chromosomal amplification and/or deletion as potential mRNA vaccine targets ( Figures 1A,B) . Moreover, we analyzed the landscape of gene mutations in LUAD patients. We found that missense and nonsense mutations occurred at higher frequencies and a single nucleotide variant was the most frequent mutation type ( Figure 1C ). Next, we performed a KEGG enrichment analysis of the copy number variant genes. Results showed that these genes were involved in the regulation of different cancer and immune-related pathways, demonstrating that these genes could be used as potential targets for cancer mRNA vaccines ( Figure 1D ). We also used all genes with mutations in the TCGA database as candidate targets for mRNA vaccines. Relevant genes retrieved from the GEPIA database that could affect patients' overall survival and disease-free survival were used for screening. Fianlly, we obtained 13 LUAD-specific antigens (TTK, BUB1B, ASB2, HJURP, CBFA2T3, PTGFRN, HSPA4, ST6GAL1, CENPU, KLRG1, GTF3C6, OIP5, VDAC3) that could affect patients prognosis ( Figure 1E ).

            "text": "The immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine is the key to whether it can effectively activate the immune system. The higher immunogenicity represents that it can be recognized and processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented to T cells, which plays an important role in the immune recognition, immune response, and immune regulation. Antigen presenting cells are a major route for mRNA vaccine-mediated lymphocyte generation of immune memory and anti-tumor immunity (Cafri et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the antigen candidates obtained above and three immune cell types that act as antigen-presenting (B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages) to screen for optimal LAUD antigens. Dendritic cells play a vital role in the initiation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunities (Wculek et al., 2020) . Moreover, B cells act as antigenpresenting cells by mediating memory T cells activation (Popi et al., 2016) . We found that the expression of two, CBFA2T3 and KLRG1, of the 13 antigen candidates was significantly positively correlated with APCs expressions (Figures 2A,B) . This result suggested that mRNA vaccines based on these two antigens might induce immune system activation after injection. After grouping based on the expression of these two potential antigens in LUAD patients, we observed that patients with high CBFA2T3 and KLRG1 expressions had a better prognosis. This also indicated that patients with high expression of these two genes may have a more conducive immune microenvironment for survival ( Figure 2C ). Then, we investigated the expression of KLRG1 and CBFA2T3 in different tumor stages ( Figures 2D,E) . The results show that these two genes are highly expressed in earlystage patients, reflecting that mRNA vaccines designed based on these two tumor antigens may produce better immunogenicity in early-stage patients. After grouping the cohorts according to the expression of these two potential antigens and performing a GSEA-based KEGG enrichment analysis, we observed an enrichment of multiple immune-related pathways in the highly expressed population (Figures 3A,B) . In contrast, their low expression was associated with active cell cycle pathways ( Figures 3C,D) . Compared with other disease vaccines, therapeutic cancer vaccines mainly play a therapeutic role rather than prevention (DeMaria and Bilusic 2019), which should be clarified for the appropriate population, so we next identified the characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma patients suitable for mRNA vaccination.",

Hence, we used immune-related genes in the TCGA-LUAD cohort to identify different patient populations and to assess their suitability for mRNA vaccination. Using consensus clustering, we identified four LUAD patients subtypes with different immune characteristics ( Figures 4A-C) . Clusters A and B had the best prognosis among the four subtypes, suggesting that the LUAD tumor microenvironment might affect prognoses ( Figure 4D) . The enrichment analysis of cancer hallmarks comparing Clusters A and B (better prognoses) to C and D subtypes (worse prognoses) also showed multiple immune-related pathways enriched for A and B ( Figure 4E) . Therefore, vaccination of Clusters A and B patients might produce a robust immune response. Additionally, after analyzing patients in different stages, we observed a higher proportion of Clusters A and B in patients with stages I and II, consistently with the results in Figures 2D,E. These results demonstrated that early-stage tumors patients are more sensitive to vaccination ( Figure 4F) . Notably, KLRG1 and CBFA2T3 were highly expressed in Clusters A and B ( Figure 4G ). Our results indicate that patients with Cluster A and B have an active current immune status and higher expression of the two tumor antigens identified. Cluster A and B may therefore have better immunogenicity for mRNA vaccines. Altogether, these results suggested that patients from Clusters A and B are more suitable for mRNA vaccination using these antigens.",

Clusters A and B had higher immune and stromal scores, while tumor purity was lower, suggesting that the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells was higher in these samples. Also, we quantified various infiltrating immune cells using previously published immune cell gene sets ( Figure 5E ). After contrasting Clusters A and B with C and D, the data suggested that A and B might behave as \"hot\" immune subtypes, while C and D as \"cold\" subtypes ( Figure 5F ). Additionally, along with high KLRG1 and CBFA2T3 expressions ( Figure 3G) , clusters A and B may have a higher responsiveness to mRNA vaccination. Further, we contrasted Clusters A and B and showed that most immune cells were more infiltrated in Cluster A than in B. Therefore, Cluster A patients might be the most appropriate population to be vaccinated ( Figure 5G ). Moreover, we found a range of immune checkpoints and high expression of immunogenic cell death modulators in Cluster A, indicating that this population would also have better effects on immunotherapy ( Figures 5H,I) .",

Therefore, this low TMB could be correlated with vaccination suitability. We also used the MutSigCV algorithm to assess tumor-driver gene mutations and determined their location on the chromosome ( Figure 6C ). After visualizing the driver mutation genes in each patient, we observed that the comutation frequency of EGFR and KRAS was rare in Cluster A, indicating that EGFR-TKIs are still a promising treatment strategy for these patients.

For Cluster A and B (suitable for vaccination), we observed a low IC50 for gefitinib ( Figure 8F ). This might be associated with the higher EGFR mutation frequency observed above ( Figure 6D) . Similarly, we found other potentially sensitive anti-cancer drugs suitable for Clusters A and B ( Figure 8G-L) . The TIDE score effectively reflects the potential benefit of immunotherapy and is superior to the prediction of immune checkpoint expression and mutations. When we used the TIDE online tool for immunotherapy response prediction in the overall cohort, we found that Cluster A and B tumor immune dysfunction scores were high (Supplementary Figure S1A-B) , which reflects that they may not be sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, so although Cluster A and B have higher immune checkpoint expression, but they may not be effective for immunotherapy. The mRNA vaccine may be a potentially effective alternative therapeutic strategy. Altogether, immune Clusters A and B were not only suitable for mRNA vaccination but also may be sensitive to targeted therapy. On the other hand, immune Clusters C and D might be more sensitive to chemotherapy. Differences in treatment sensitivity between different immune clusters also reflected the heterogeneity among tumors, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatments.",

These vaccines have good prospects in cancer treatment, but more research is needed (Sahin and Tureci 2018) . Mining tumor antigens with better immunogenicity and immunoreactivity in different cancers is the key to mRNA vaccine development. In the current study, we identified KLRG1 and CBFA2T3 as potential antigenic targets that could be used to develop mRNA vaccines for LUAD. Further analyses of immune subtypes identified a patient population that would benefit the most from vaccination. We also identified four biomarkers (BECN1, RAET1E, PTGS2, and TAPBP) that could be used to monitor vaccine response.

            "text": "Tumor antigens can activate various antigen-presenting cells. Thus, inducing tumor-specific immunity and immune memory can be used in the development of tumor mRNA vaccines (Khan et al., 2021) . KLRG1 has been reported as a prognosis biomarker in LUAD patients and is associated with response to immunotherapy . Additionally, combined blockade of KLRG1 with PD-1 can promote NK and T cell anti-tumor immunity (Tata et al., 2021) . On the contrary, there has also been reported that high KLRG1 expression is associated with low proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells, however, KLRG1 expression is often low in lung adenocarcinoma cells, and associated with adverse effects of immunotherapy . The cancer-promoting and cancersuppressing effects of KLRG1 appear paradoxical in response to immunotherapy and the effects of the cell cycle of the tumor cells themselves. But an article reported that KLRG1+effector CD8+T cells can effectively promote anti-tumor immunity after differentiation and loss of KLRG1 expression (Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018) . Therefore, we believed that the development of KLRG1 as an mRNA vaccine could help to stimulate KLRG1+Effector CD8+T Cells to differentiate into memory T cells of other lineages and produce effective antitumor immunity. Using KLRG1 as an mRNA vaccine can achieve anti-tumor immunity by activating the immune system without altering KLRG1 expression in cancer cells themselves to affect the cell cycle. In our current study, we found a positive correlation between KLRG1 and the infiltration of different antigenpresenting cells, revealing that KLRG1 could induce tumor immunity and immune memory, and could be used as a potential tumor antigen for mRNA vaccines. Also, KLRG1 can be a marker of immune cell senescence, and the expansion of oligoclonal senescent T cells may negatively impact immunotherapy (Ferrara et al., 2021) . Therefore, using KLRG1 as a tumor antigen, APCs will be trained to recognize and remove KLRG1-expressing tumor cells and senescent immune cells, becoming a new LUAD treatment strategy. CBFA2T3 has been reported as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and can be an independent prognostic marker in LUAD Chen et al., 2021) . Furthermore, we showed that CBFA2T3 expression was positively correlated with higher antigenpresenting cell infiltration. Hence, CBFA2T3 can potentially be used as a tumor antigen in future mRNA vaccines. In recent years, tumor antigen receptor chimeric T-cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) has also become a hot topic, and its main mechanism is to Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 815596 engineer T cells isolated from patients to directly recognize and kill tumor cells (Feins et al., 2019) . However, due to the low expression of the two genes in lung adenocarcinoma, the benefit of CART-T therapy may not be as good as that of mRNA vaccine, and mRNA vaccine also has the advantages of easier preparation and more economy. Compared with live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, mRNA vaccines reduce problems associated with endotoxin and infection, and mRNA vaccines do not cause insertional mutagenesis caused by genomic integration compared with DNA vaccines and viral vector-based vaccines (Kim et al., 2021) . Although mRNA vaccines are promising, they are easily degraded by extracellular ribonucleases (RNases) due to the difficulty of mRNA as an anionic molecule to counteract the electrostatic repulsion of cell membranes (Kowalski et al., 2019) . Therefore, the design of delivery vectors is the key to whether mRNA vaccines can work.",

Thus, we classified LUAD patients by immune-related gene expression and identified four immune subtypes with different prognoses. Also, we described the different immune subtype landscapes and analyzed the potential benefits of using mRNA vaccines for each subtype. Notably, we identified a population of patients suitable for mRNA vaccination. This population was formed by early-stage patients with high immune cell infiltration, high immune checkpoints, immunogenic cell death modulators expression, and low TMB. The most relevant characteristic gene modules of this population were found by WGCNA, and four biomarkers that could be used as vaccination responses were found in these modules. Although previous studies have described LUAD immune subtypes (Wu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021) , in the present study, we associated immune subtypes and mRNA vaccination for the first time. Drug sensitivity analysis of different immune subtypes showed significant differences in drug sensitivity among different subtypes, not only providing a reference for treatment strategies for populations not suitable for vaccination but also revealing the importance of individualized treatment.",
