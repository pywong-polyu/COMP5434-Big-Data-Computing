Newer initiatives including improved cookstove (IC) and cleaner fuels are being implemented to improve HAP effects. Methods: A literature review was conducted for household air pollution related to biomass cookstoves in resource limited countries. In January 2018, we electronically searched the PubMed database for the term cookstoves with no date restrictions. We included cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, conference abstracts, editorials, and reviews; studies that assessed the emissions related to cookstove and factors affecting HAP emissions. Results: Twenty-three articles met the objectives of the review. Fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the major HAP emissions. Emission factors are based on the stove and fuel used while the activity is based on cooking practices. Changes in composition and sources of PM2.5 causes modification to its resulting toxicity. Many PAHs and their metabolites released by HAP have carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic potential. Improving ventilation decreases concentrations of PM2.5 and CO in the household air. Few standard tools are available to measure ventilation and continued IC efficacy in long term. Conclusion: Unavailability of tools to measure ventilation and continued IC efficacy in long term affect uniformity and comparability of IC study results. Community education about the health effects of HAP and importance of ventilation in decreasing HAP is an important aspect of public health policy to prevent HAP effects.",

            "text": "Almost three billion people are exposed to household air pollution (HAP) through cooking with biomass based cookstoves [1] . Two thirds of the HAP exposure risk population reside in South East Asia and Africa [2] . Some of the major areas with high HAP exposure occurs near Smoky coal mines in China and Indo-Gangetic plains near Himalayas in India [3, 4] . Further, a study on global atmospheric impacts of residential fuel burning found emissions like PM2.5, organic compounds and black carbon are dominated by transport in North America, by open burning in Africa and by residential solid fuels in Asia [5] . An estimated 2.6 million premature deaths are attributed to HAP [2, 6] . Additionally, HAP caused 5 million deaths annually and 110 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 [7] . As per Global Burden Disease (GBD) Assessment, 3-5% GBD in terms of DALY is caused by HAP with almost two thirds occurring in children less than 5 years and the rest in the adult population. Health effects associated with HAP mostly include increased blood pressure (BP), dyspnea, childhood pneumonia, lung cancer, low birthweight and cardiovascular diseases [6, 8] . This exposure and health effects is highest for the vulnerable population of women and children resulting in significant cumulative health effects. More recently, emission including particulate matter exceeding safe levels has been associated with higher number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) infection and mortality. This pollution could also be conducive to the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the strain of novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 [9] .",

Hence, CO measurements were used in HAP studies as a proxy for PM2.5 [24] . Though CO and PM2.5 had good correlation, their reported correlations varied across settings. The largest correlations were noted where both pollutants were largely derived from biomass burning, and lower correlations were observed in rural settings and in settings with probable multiple sources of pollution [25] . Similarly, the indoor and personal CO measurements corelated highly with each other making it less cumbersome for study participants to wear the monitor [22] . A study comparing cookstoves, showed when 1 kilogram of dung is burnt containing 334 g carbon, 26 .35 g of carbon in the form of CO is released. On the other hand, if a cleaner fuel like 1 kg of biogas containing 396 g of carbon is used, it releases 0.836 g of carbon as CO. Consequently, CO release was significantly decreased with cleaner fuels [26] .",

The data showed that both the personal CO levels and kitchen CO levels are reduced in the presence of newer cookstoves except studies scoring low in the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP). The metanalysis showed substantial heterogeneity but there was no evidence of the small study effect which was confirmed further by the trim and fill method [15] . HAP related CO levels are a function of activity and emission factors. Emission factors are based on the stove and fuel type used while the activity is based on cooking practices, such as the timing, duration of cooking and the types of dishes prepared [29] . These factors are more difficult to control for in a randomized cookstove study and hence significant heterogeneity is noticed in systematic review or meta-analysis of cookstove studies. Consequently, most cookstove studies are designed as pre-post study design [6] . Only few studies have reported kitchen exposures not corelating with personal CO exposures by 30-40% that may be related to significant environmental air pollution [4] . Nonetheless, CO is an easy to measure objective biomarker of HAP that is independent of outdoor ambient environmental pollution and noncumbersome to study participants.",

These were stable compounds containing carbon and hydrogen with two or more fused aromatic rings [30] . These compounds existed in both gaseous and particulate forms based on their volatility or the prevalent ambient conditions. Low molecular weight PAHs (SPAH) like naphthalene were more volatile and existed as gas while the heavier weight PAHs (LPAH) like e.g., benzo[a]pyrene existed primarily in particulate form and these were of significant concern to human health [30] . Many PAHs and their metabolites are classified as carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, or possibly carcinogenic to humans, as well as teratogenic and mutagenic [31, 32] . Studies have shown that ambient PAHs levels correlate with cooking events, eventually demonstrating cookstove emissions were an important source of PAHs in both indoor and outdoor air [33] . In a study by Leavey A. et al, the PAH emissions were least for solid fuels' combustion of pellets and largest for combustion of coal through all phases of cooking including, start up, steady state and extinguishing phase [33] .",

This brings into notice a debatable point about HAP. Dried biomass or wood used for better fuel efficiency may lead to increased release of PAH, causing detrimental health effects with concurrent decrease in emission of particulate matter and organics like Chloride, Ammonium, Nitrate and Sulfate. Further, the study found that the cumulative PAH released with the different phase of combustion times and the levels of PAH still remained high for the dried biomass [33] .

Consequently, measuring these intermediate PAHs was critical in evaluating HAP related to cookstoves [35] . Most of the intermediate PAHs were associated more closely with finer particles compared to the parent PAH because of lower vaporization, diffusive ability, differences in absorption, adsorption, degradation reaction rate and gas-particle transformation rate [36] .

For IC with a chimney, an additional direct pathway of exfiltration for PM existed through chimney ductwork, increasing the exfiltration of PM by an average of 56%, though there was no significant difference within the newer cookstoves. Chimney exhaust losses (direct ventilation) of PM could be calculated as a difference in average indoor PM concentration measured using the IC with and without a chimney [43] .

More objective methods to assess ventilation in research studies are needed. Further, studies are needed to assess the effect of shifting indoor air pollution to ambient air pollution.

Stove stacking is wherein IC were added to the traditional stoves as a parallel cooking device when the IC malfunctioned, was unrepairable, irreplaceable and during periods of fuel shortage for IC [50] . The durability of IC was increased by promoting good IC safety profile, accessible good servicing and repairing without much specialized tools. Fuel type also affected the stove design and maintenance. Research on better fuel efficiency led to development of IC using natural draft or forced draft for cooking. Forced draft IC used processed biomass fuels in the form of pellets. Though these ICs provided superior performance, their higher initial cost and limited fuel distribution networks remained a major challenges for their widespread use [26] . On the other hand, forced draft gasifier stoves needed electric fan or some form of continuous air supply and specialized solid fuels to improve combustion and emission performance Most of these stoves did not require fuel refeeding during the cooking process which has its own associated risk. Dung cakes and agricultural residues resulted in higher emissions than the fuelwood; densified briquettes had lower emission as compared to loose fuels [26] . The amount of fuel used per weight of food cooked and the cooking time varied with type of IC, fuel used and the type of food being cooked [51] . Biogas digesters seemed a good feasible fuel option for resource limited countries since they were considered alternative sustainable energy source that help reduce HAP associated with cooking, provide fertilizer for reuse and work as a sustainable waste disposal. In general, households are perceived as units for installation, however, more research is warranted for community biogas digesters. Thus biogas could provide cleaner fuels to these communities concomitantly to curtail solid fuel usage [27, 52] . This would lead to improved health benefits to the community.",

            "text": "An analysis of ten low-and middle-income countries by Arku et al. found solid fuels to be the primary cooking fuel in forty-six percent of women. Further stratification showed 73% of the women were from rural areas and 23% from urban areas. Thus, solid fuels were predominantly used in rural homes. By fuel categories in this subset of charcoal and wood users, there was 0.67 mmHg and 0.51 mmHg higher systolic BP than electricity users respectively, but the difference was non-significant for systolic BP between gas and electricity users. This effect persisted with stratification by rural-urban location [2] . There is also a higher mortality noted among people using wood as compared to electricity with similar risk for ischemic heart disease related mortality. And further stratification by sex, showed a potential trend for increased risk for both all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in women compared with men [53] . Initial studies, including one from India emphasized earlier research for IC were prioritized towards fuel efficiency with intention to decrease fuel usage and deforestation. Consequently, the emissions levels associated with the IC were similar to traditional cookstoves [28] . Though the data showed the financial benefits of installing improved cookstoves with cost saved in decreased fuel usage, there were some shortcomings in the estimation because some households may use crop residues/agricultural waste instead of wood as fuels and would not contribute towards decreasing fuel cost [54] . Another important factor is the life of an IC i.e. the number of months of continuous use without appreciable loss of the original efficiency. Most traditional cookstoves are rebuilt several times. The ICs are mostly made of steel. The stove would be considered dysfunctional if significant deterioration occurs either in the structure or in thermal efficiency. Subsequently, good data is needed about the interaction of different biomass fuel with IC and their effects on the life of IC for good stove sustainability [54] . In the natural draft IC, the combustion of fuel is dependent on ambient conditions. Therefore, the thermal efficiency or the heat transfer efficiency is largely affected due to inconsistent air fuel ratio leading to low combustion temperature. Thus, the combustions process alternates between sooting (PM emission) or smoking, wherein both could have negative effect on either the IC or the household person doing the cooking [26] . HAP effect by fuels is one of the most volatile factors in IC study. Fuel supplies affect stove stacking behavior; smoking and sooting behavior of fuel affect the life of the IC which may not be same as testing in controlled settings. Water boiling test standardizes the fuel factor in laboratory-controlled studies, however few field studies could have similar standardization. Table 1 summarizes the biomass cook stove emissions and its interaction with improved cook stove studies.",

This would further help in establishing the efficacy of IC for health mitigation and improve its uptake by public health policy.
