This paper focuses on the incidence of the disease in Italy and Spain-two of the first and most affected European countries. Using two simple mathematical epidemiological models-the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model and the log-linear regression model, we model the daily and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the two countries during the early stage of the outbreak, and compute estimates for basic measures of the infectiousness of the disease including the basic reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time. Estimates of the basic reproduction number were found to be larger than 1 in both countries, with values being between 2 and 3 for Italy, and 2.5 and 4 for Spain. Estimates were also computed for the more dynamic effective reproduction number, which showed that since the first cases were confirmed in the respective countries the severity has generally been decreasing. The predictive ability of the log-linear regression model was found to give a better fit and simple estimates of the daily incidence for both countries were computed.",

            "text": "Aside from many of the classical models mentioned above, recent developments in the econometrics and statistics literature have led to a number of new models that could potentially be applied in the modelling of infectious diseases. These include (but are not limited to) mixed frequency analysis, model selection and combination, and dynamic time warping. Mixed frequency analysis is an iterative approach proposed for dealing with the joint dynamics of time series data which are sampled at different frequencies [24] . In the economic literature, the common example is quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) and monthly inflation. [25] notes that studying the co-movements between mixed frequency data usually involves analysing the joint process sampled at a common low frequency, however, this can mis-specify the relationship. [24, 25] propose vector autoregressive models for mixed frequency analysis that operate at the highest sampling frequency of all the time series in the model. These models allow for the modelling of the joint dynamics of the dependent and independent variables using time disaggregation, where the low frequency variables are interpolated and time-aggregated into a higher frequency. In the context of infectious diseases, such models could be beneficial for modelling the relationship between higher frequency data such as the number of daily cases or deaths and lower frequency data relating to, say, weekly cases or deaths, news and information about health prevention measures, etc. [26, 27] propose the use of Bayesian Predictive Synthesis (BPS) for model selection and combination. They note that there are many scenarios that generate multiple, interrelated time series, where the dependence has a significant impact on decisions, policies, and their outcomes. In addition, methods need to learn and integrate information about forecasters and models, bias, etc. and how they change over time, to improve their accuracy [26] . Decision and policy makers often use multiple sources, models, and forecasters to generate forecasts, in particular, probabilistic density forecasts. However, although complex estimation methods may have useful properties for policy",

The aim is to use the dependencies between time series to improve forecasts over multiple horizons for policy decisions [27] . For example, in the economic literature, setting interest rates based on utility or loss that account for inflation, real economy measures, employment, etc. BPS relates to a decision maker that accounts for multiple models as providers of \"forecast data\" to be used for prior-posterior updating. The decision maker learns over time about relationships between agents, forecasts, and dependencies, which are incorporated into the model, and dynamically calibrate, learn, and update weights for ranges of forecasts from dynamic models, with multiple lags and predictors [26] . In epidemiology, BPS could potentially be used in a similar context to analyse the dependency between various interrelated time series such as daily cases and deaths, hospital capacity, number vaccinations, etc. Different models and sources of data could then be combined and characterised in one single model improving the accuracy of forecasts. Dynamic time warping as noted by [28, 29] is a technique that has not been widely used outside of speech and gesture recognition. It can be used to identify the relation structure between two time series by describing their non-linear alignment with warping paths [28] . The procedure involves a local cost measure characterising the sum of the differences between pairs of realisations of data at each time point, where an optimal warping path gives the lowest total cost. The optimal path is found under a variable lead-lag structure, where the most suitable lag can then be found [28] . This then reveals and identifies the lead-lag effects between the time series data.",

It can be seen that there is a slight difference with Italy in that it appears as though most Spanish regions were affected at approximately the same time-when the country's first cases were confirmed. This is reflected by the majority of plots starting from the very left of the xaxis, with the exception of the plots for a few regions such as Ceuta and Melilla.

It is confirmed that the true peak daily incidence does indeed occur on 31st March 2020 and we return to this point later on in the analysis. In comparison to other Spanish regions, it seems that Madrid and Catalonia are the exceptions as the majority of regions exhibit an exponential rise in daily incidence and peak around 26th and 27th March 2020 before falling. Plotting the daily incidence of all regions on the same scale in Fig 9, it is clear that Madrid and Catalonia are the most affected regions contributing the largest share of the national cumulative incidence.

In reference to the SIR model, [74] note that it \"examines only the temporal dynamics of the infection cycle and should thus be appropriate for the description of a well-localised epidemic outburst\", therefore, it would appear to be reasonable for use in analysis at city, province, or country level. In the form above, the dynamics of the model are controlled by the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, representing the rates of transition from S to I (susceptibility to infection), and I to R (infection to recovery or death), respectively. By solving this system of differential equations, it is possible to obtain estimates for the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3. A number of methods can be used to fit the SIR model to incidence data including the least squares method and method of maximum likelihood-in this analysis, the former is chosen. The least squares method focuses on minimising the residual sum of squares -in this particular case, the sum of the squared differences between I(t) (true number of infected individuals at time t) and the predicted number of infected individuals\u00ce\u00f0t\u00de from the fitted model, expressed as:",

The system of differential equations, Eqs (1) to (3) , are set up as a single function. The model is then initialised with starting values for S, I, and R, with parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 unknown. We obtain the daily cumulative incidence for the sample period, total population (N), and the susceptible population (S) as the total population minus the number of currently infected individuals. This is defined as the cumulative number of infected individuals minus the number of recovered or dead, however, these exact values are difficult to obtain. Thus, the cumulative number of infected individuals at the start date of the sample period is used as a proxy-since at the start date of the disease, this is likely to be close to the true value, as the number of recovered or dead should be very small (if not zero).",

More specifically, we use the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS-B) algorithm for the minimisation, which allows us to specify box constraints (lower and upper bounds) for the unknown parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3. The lower and upper bounds of zero and one, respectively, were selected for both parameters. The optim function then searches for the \u03b2 and \u03b3 that minimise the RSS function, given starting values of 0.5 for both parameters. The optimal solution is found via the gradient method by repeatedly improving the estimates of RSS to try and find a solution with a lower value. The function makes small changes to the parameters in the direction of where RSS changes the fastest, where in this direction the lowest value of RSS is. This is repeated until no further improvement can be made or the improvement is below a threshold.",

In the case where convergence is not achieved, or there is some related error, then we use the parscale function in the optimisation. As the true values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 are unknown, in the default case, the parameters are adjusted by a fixed step starting from their initial values. Most common issues were addressed using the parscale function to rescale-alter the sensitivity/magnitude of the parameters on the objective function. In other words, it allows the algorithm to compute the gradient at a finer scale (similar to the ndeps parameter-used to adjust step sizes for the finite-difference approximation to the gradient). In most cases, issues were solved by using a step size of 10 \u22124 . Of course, smaller step sizes could be used, but there is a risk that selecting too small a step size will lead to the optimal values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 being found at their starting values. However, the results should be interpreted with caution. It is possible that estimates will vary with different population sizes N and the starting values specified for \u03b2 and \u03b3, which may also cause the optimisation process to be unstable.",

It is generally assumed that R 0 corresponds to an environment in which there are no individuals who are infected or immune to the disease. This may be more realistic at the beginning of an outbreak, however, outbreaks are rarely observed and modelled at the exact point where infected individuals mix with those who are susceptible. In addition, R 0 values computed under different models can vary, thus the value is dependent on the specific model and its parameters. In particular, R 0 derived from systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be problematic and may not represent the true R 0 value. Instead, they may simply be representing a threshold value. Furthermore, it is entirely possible for infectious diseases with R 0 < 1 to continue to grow and those with R 0 > 1 to die out [81] .",

As we do not have access to more detailed COVID-19 patient data, we are not able to compute the parameters of the serial interval distribution directly. However, a number of existing analyses of COVID-19 patient data report some preliminary estimates of the best fitting serial interval distributions and their corresponding model parameters. These are: i) gamma distribution with mean \u03bc = 7.5 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 3.4 [81] ; ii) gamma distribution with mean \u03bc = 7 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 4.5 [2] ; iii) gamma distribution with mean \u03bc = 6.3 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 4.2 [86] . By using these three serial intervals in conjunction with the above method, we are able to obtain estimates of R 0 from estimates of the growth rate r. It should be noted that serial interval distributions are not only restricted to the gamma distribution-other common distributions used include the Weibull and log-normal distributions, and that the parameters are dependent on a number of factors including the time to isolation [86] .",

In reality, the reproduction number will vary over time but it will also be influenced by governments and health authorities implementing measures in order to reduce the impact of the disease. Therefore, a more useful approach for measuring the severity of an infectious disease is to track the reproduction number over time. The effective reproduction number R e is one way to achieve this, and thus allows us to see how the reproduction number changes over time in response to the development of the disease itself but also effectiveness of interventions. Although there are numerous methods that can be used to analyse the severity of a disease over time, the majority are not straightforward to implement (especially in software) [85] .",

Thus, the incidence at time t is defined to be Poisson distributed with mean equal to the average daily incidence (number of new cases) at time t. This value is just for a single time period t, however, estimates for a single time period can be highly variable meaning that it is not easy to interpret, especially for making policy decisions. Therefore, we consider longer time periods of one week (seven days)assuming that within a rolling window the instantaneous reproduction number remains constant. Note that there is a potential trade off, as using longer rolling windows gives more precise estimates of R t but this means fewer estimates can be computed (requires more incidence values to start with) and a more delayed trend reducing the ability to detect changes in transmissibility. Whereas shorter rolling windows lead to more rapid detection in changes but with more noise. Using this method, it is recommended that a minimum cumulative daily incidence of 12 cases have been observed before attempting to estimate R e . For the data sets used, this does not pose a problem as a cumulative total of 16 and 17 cases, respectively, exist on the first day of the sample at the country level, and by the seventh day the totals are around 200 and 650 for Spain and Italy, respectively.",

This suggests that, according to the thresholds described above, the disease is spreading and growing in all Italian and Spanish regions during the 14 days after the first localised cases were confirmed. At a national level, the estimated values of R 0 are greater than two for both countries, again, suggesting a spreading and growing disease. This is perhaps not surprising since this time period reflects the early stages of the spread of the disease, thus we would expect it to be growing and spreading quickly before any preventative action is taken. We note that in Tables 1 and 2 , there are some cases where the estimated value of \u03b2 is very close to or at the upper limit of 1.000-e.g. Lombardy (Italy) and Madrid (Spain). This leads to the consequence that the parameter estimates appear to be bound by the upper limit. However, all parameter estimates are dependent on the starting values defined for \u03b2 and \u03b3, and the upper and lower bounds specified. For all cases of estimating the parameters in Tables 1 and 2, we used the same optimisation procedure and criteria for determining a satisfactory estimate that is the convergence in the minimisation of the RSS (Eq (4) ). In all cases, convergence was achieved but this is still slightly problematic. For cases where the estimated value of \u03b2 is 1.000, although convergence was achieved, this indicates only that it generates the lowest RSS within the upper and lower limits defined. Therefore, there may or may not exist values of the parameter outside of this range that may be more optimal. Indeed, the results may vary depending on the upper and lower bounds, and the starting values that are selected. Thus, there is also the question of how to change the starting values and bounds appropriately (instead of, say, simply increasing them). Furthermore, as the R 0 value in the SIR model is computed as \u03b2/\u03b3, another consequence of the estimated value of \u03b2 being 1.000 is that the true value of \u03b2 may actually be larger than this, and so the true value of R 0 may be larger than the estimated value.",

As a result, no estimates are computed for the first 7 days of each respective sample period. In all cases, we analyse and compute the R e values over the whole sample period available allowing us to see how the infectiousness of COVID-19 varies during the initial outbreak stages and the effect of any interventions implemented by the respective governments. In Fig 17, we observe that for both Lombardy and Italy, R e is generally decreasing over the time (under any of the three serial distributions), and although it is initially larger for Italy, after approximately the first 7 days the R e values are similar. However, the trend of R e both to the left and right (before and after) of the nationwide lockdown (indicated by the dotted line) shows some differences. Prior to the nationwide lockdown, R e decreases rapidly towards a value of between three and four, which could be attributed to the fact that northern Italy (including Lombardy) was the most affected area in the early stages of the outbreak and lockdowns local to the area were already being enforced from 21st February 2020. Thus, this is likely to have contributed (in part) to the initial reduction in the R e value. After the nationwide lockdown came into force on 9th March 2020, R e continues to decrease but at a slower pace and appears to level off approximately 14 days later-this coincides with the peak in daily incidence on 21st March 2020. After this point, it is likely that the effects of the nationwide lockdown are starting to appear with R e appearing to decrease again more rapidly towards the critical value of one (solid horizontal line)-suggesting that the disease is still spreading but stabilising.",

The trend in the estimated R e values before and after the nationwide lockdown again show some differences, but also differ to those for the cases of Lombardy and Italy. Prior to the nationwide lockdown (indicated by the dotted line), the trend of the estimated R e values is very erratic: decreasing, increasing, and then decreasing again. This could be due to the daily incidence for Madrid, Catalonia, and Spain, showing greater variation compared with that for Italy before the respective lockdowns. It is found that in the period before the lockdowns, Spanish daily incidence appears to show more alternation between increases and decreases compared with the previous day's incidence, whilst Italian daily incidence shows much less. After the nationwide lockdown on 14th March 2020, for all three cases the estimated R e decreases significantly towards a value of two. More specifically, in mid-March 2020 daily incidence for Madrid, Catalonia, and Spain, levels off corresponding to the reduction in R e , but in the run up to 23rd March 2020 daily incidence again becomes more variable and alternates between significantly larger and smaller daily incidence, with R e levelling off. After 23rd March 2020, this levelling off is more sustained for Madrid and Spain compared with Catalonia. This may be attributed to the daily incidence initially peaking and then decreasing much more significantly for Catalonia, leading to a more significant decrease in R e at the latter end of the sample period.

Predictions about the daily incidence in the decay phase can contribute to determining whether health interventions are working, but can additionally provide time frames for when daily incidence may reach certain thresholds-e.g. below which the disease may be considered under control. To compare the predictive ability of the SIR and log-linear models, we use the projections package [89] in R [75] . As this section acts to provide only a brief analysis of the predictive ability of the models, we refer the readers to [89] for in-depth documentation regarding the finer details of the computations. The initial step is to consider which of the two models provides the best predictive ability in the growth phase of the COVID-19 outbreak and for simplicity, we analyse only Italy and Spain at country level. Using the estimated R 0 values for Italy and Spain from the SIR and log-linear models above, we combine these with the three serial distributions mentioned earlier.

In each figure, the first row plots the predictions using the SIR model; the second row plots the predictions using the log-linear model. For the case of Italy, the plots in Fig 19 appear to show that the predictions using the R 0 value estimated from the SIR model and the serial interval of a gamma distribution with mean \u03bc = 7.5 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 3.4 [81] provide the most accurate general predictions. However, although using the R 0 value estimated from the log-linear model generates predictions which are accurate up until the last 7 days of the growth phase (where all three cases show over prediction), these results are more consistent compared with those using the SIR model. For the case of Spain, the plots in Fig 20 show that the predictions using the R 0 value estimated from the SIR model are consistent but significantly under predicting the observed daily incidence. In contrast, predictions using the R 0 value estimated from the log-linear model are consistent and accurate up until the initial peak in daily incidence a few days before the true peak at the end of the growth phase. Based on these results for the growth phase of the outbreak, we propose to use the log-linear model to compute basic predictions for the decay phase. At the time of conducting this part of the analysis, approximately one month of daily incidence data was available for the decay phase (following peak daily incidence) of both Italy and Spain. Similarly, we follow the methodology for fitting the log-linear model but now apply it to the decay phase daily incidence. The model is fitted to the decay phase daily incidence in the same way, and model parameters can be computed. Note that for the decay phase, the values and interpretation of the estimated parameters change-the growth rate takes a negative value and the doubling time becomes the halving time (both reflecting the decay and decrease in daily incidence). The fitted log-linear regressions for Italy and Spain are shown in the left hand plots of Figs 21 and 22, respectively. The fitted models appear to provide reasonable fits to the observed decay phase daily incidence much like the case for the growth phase.",

Distributions of these estimates are plotted in S2 Fig and it can be seen that (in contrast to the growth phase) the mean estimates of R 0 for Italy and Spain, individually, are very similar (under the three serial distributions)-between 0.85 and 0.87 for Italy, and 0.77 and 0.83 for Spain. Using the mean estimated R 0 values and the three serial distributions, we computed projections of the daily incidence for the 180 days immediately following the end of the decay phase sample period on 22nd April 2020. The paths of these projections for Italy and Spain are shown in the right hand plots of Figs 21 and 22, respectively.",

Observed daily incidence for the remainder of the decay phase was obtained from [44, 90, 91] . In general, it appears that the predictions for future daily incidence (under all three serial distributions) in both Italy and Spain are significantly greater than the observed daily incidence. At the one month time point (21st May 2020) projections of daily incidence for Italy are approximately twice as large as the true incidence; projections of daily incidence for Spain are approximately two to three times as large as the true incidence. Moving forward to the two month time point (21st June 2020) projections of the daily incidence for Italy are approximately two to three times as large as the true incidence; projections of the daily incidence for Spain are up to twice as large as the true incidence. However, the projection of Spanish daily incidence using the serial interval of a gamma distribution with mean \u03bc = 6.3 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 4.2 [86] is almost identical to the true incidence.",
