A survey-questionnaire approach was used to collect the point of view of frontline employees that work in five-star hotels in a metropolitan city of Korea. Four independent variables that were extracted from valid theoretical backgrounds along with four demographic variables were used in the study. The regression analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses, which revealed that job stress directly affected the employees' desires to leave their organization. It also showed that perceived supervisor support mitigates employee turnover, and there were significant correlations between turnover intention with the employees' marital status and job position. Gender and years of service did not affect the employees' thinking of quitting their job. Our findings help hotel entrepreneurs better understand how to deal with customer incivility and employee job stress, and better comprehend the factors that minimize employees' negative behaviors for the organization.",

Even though various empirical studies have been conducted that analyze these factors e.g., [9, 12, 13] , the effect of each of these factors evolves as society, customer behavior, and the pursuit of the employees change over time. For instance, factors, such as low wages and long working hours that were pointed out as the causes of the turnovers in the past have been mitigated by government laws. Customer incivility, which is unreasonable behaviors and demands of the customers are still part of the consumer's role in the exchange situation [14] , but some actions diminish as society becomes more mature and civilized. Therefore, investment to cultivate employee satisfaction and reduce employee turnover is essential to implement the standards for quality customer service [9] . Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to explore the relationships between the turnover intention of hotel FLEs in five-star hotels that are located in Seoul and the major factors that are taken into academic consideration. The study aimed to examine the influence of customer incivility, job stress, social support on the employee turnover intention, and how the demographic features, such as gender, marital status, years of service, and job position influence turnover intention.",

A rather important classification of turnovers within the organizations was presented by Wanous, Stumpf, and Bedrosian [23] , which classified turnovers into two categories, voluntary turnovers, and involuntary turnovers. Voluntary turnovers are turnovers that are avoidable, which are caused by factors such as the salary, benefits, workplace stress, relationships with other staff, and the working hours, whereas involuntary turnovers are turnovers that are unavoidable due to contract expiration, retirement, illness, or death [18, 23] . Involuntary turnovers are aroused by the inevitable factors that do not consider the individual's intent, so the employee turnover intention, meaning the employee's \"conscious and deliberate willfulness to leave a certain position in the organization after a certain period of time\" [24, 25] , is used to represent the intentions of only the voluntary turnovers in this study.",

Lovelock [33] used the term jay-customers to refer to the customers who \"deliberately act in a thoughtless or abusive way\" and defined six categories of jay-customers, which include thieves, deadbeats, vandals, rule breakers, belligerents, and family feuders. Fullerton and Punj [14] defined the consumer misbehavior as actions that are against the generally accepted norms made during the consumption process. Harris and Reynolds [34] extended the types to include compensation letter writers, undesirable customers, property abusers, service workers, vindictive customers, oral abusers, physical abusers, and sexual predators, which they later defined the various acts of those customers as \"dysfunctional customer behavior\" [1] . Berry and Seiders [5] emphasized that unfair customers should be considered independent of illegality, and Boo, Mattila, and Tan [35] categorized deviant customer behavior as grungy, inconsiderate, rule breaking, crude, violent or physical abusive, and verbal abusive.",

When the job stress feeling becomes severe with the employees, it negatively affects the company outcome, the service they provide to the customer, and it draws negative attitudinal and behavioral outcomes [44, 46] . Job stress is also injurious to the employee themselves. It is associated with many physical and psychological health problems [47] , such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immune disorders, obesity, and depression. Additionally, since work constitutes a major source of people's daily lives [48] , it may affect the employees' intentions to withdraw from stress arousing environments for the sake of their own well-being [39, 45, [49] [50] [51] .",

As a result, employees tend to form a community to share their true feelings with fellow co-workers in order to reduce stress. Having people around who can truly understand and sympathize with the incidents that occur in the workplace and the emotions that follow for both enjoyable and challenging encounters may mitigate the effects of stressors, and the employees that do not have any perceived co-worker support can suffer more from the effects of the work stressors. The researchers have also explored the role of co-worker support and proved that it would either significantly or insignificantly affect the employees' job performance, satisfaction, and organizational commitment [55, 63, 64] . Susskind, Kacmar, and Borchgrevink [65] specified the term defining co-worker support as the extent of employees' beliefs that their co-workers would help themselves with work-related issues or provide task-related information. Hochschild [62] emphasized the socioemotional assistance from co-workers, and Susskind et al. [65] illustrated the actual work-related support from co-workers.",

The job stress that the employees felt at work was measured using four items, which were adapted from the research of Parker and Decotiis [79] studying the stressors that could arouse first-level outcome \"job stress\". Some included items such as \"I have too much work and too little time to do it\" and \"sometimes when I think about my job, I get a tight feeling in my chest\". Both the perceived supervisor support and the perceived co-worker support of the frontline employees were measured using the items that were used in the previous study by Tsui, Pearce, Porter, and Tripoli [80] (six items (e.g., \"My supervisor is friendly\", \"There is no 'team spirit' in my group\") were removed because their factor loadings were lower than 0.30 or not significant). There were three items for each construct. The employees were asked items that included \"my supervisor seems willing to listen to my problems,\" \"my supervisor is considerate of subordinates' feelings,\" \"we have confidence in one another in this group,\" and \"members of my workgroup show a great deal of integrity\". The employees' desire to leave the current workplace was measured using three items from the study of Karatepe Osman [73] , which include \"I often think about quitting\" and \"I will probably quit this job next year\".",

In regard to the marital status, 64.9% (n = 196) of the respondents were married, which is a significantly higher proportion than the 35.1% (106) of the respondents that indicated that they were single. The highest proportion of respondents indicated that they worked in the Front Office (59.3%), which was followed by Food and Beverages (37.7%), and others, such as Sales and Marketing (3%). In total, 59.9% (n = 181) of the participants indicated that they have a university degree, which was followed by 25.2% (n = 76) indicating that they held a two-year/community college degree, 13.9% (n = 42) stipulated that they have a graduate degree, and only 1% (n = 33) indicated that they held a high-school degree or less. A total of 69.2% (n = 209) of the respondents were regular employees, whereas 30.8% (n = 93) were contract employees. In regard to the years of service, 50% of the respondents indicated 2-5 years, which was followed by 10 years or more (30.5%), less than 2 years (12.9%), and 6-10 years (6.6%).

The Eigenvalue was adopted as a criterion to select the questions, which focused on extracting factors that can explain more than 1.0. The item could only be included in the final factor structure with Eigenvalue greater than 1 and factor loadings with covariance greater than 0.400 [84] . Therefore, after excluding items that were not sufficiently standard, further analyses were conducted on the 18 items ultimately filtered out. The results of the analysis indicated that the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 85.9%, which was above the criterion of 0.600 [85] , thus, the results of the factor analysis of the model were considered acceptable. In addition, after the analysis, the items that had factor loads under 0.3 were excluded from the scale, which left a total of 18 questions to be analyzed. The data set was considered to be appropriate with the support of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value of 0.859, which a value higher than 0.5 indicates supportive. All the factor loadings and communality were statistically significant and were greater than 0.6, which indicated the existence of convergence validity in the data. The AVE (average variance extracted) of the five factors, which is another criterion to test the validity, showed a range that was between 0.636 and 0.803. All the constructs displayed AVE values that were higher than 0.5, which supported the convergent validity of the constructs [86, 87] . The reliabilities for the items and the result of the factor analysis are presented in Table 2 . The means, standard deviations, and correlations of the study variables are presented in Table 3 . As reflected in the corresponding correlation coefficients, the fit of constrained models, which the correlations between the constructs were set to equal 1, and their unconstrained counterparts, which are correlations between the constructs that vary, for the 10 pairs associated with the five constructs.

Findings from the analysis of employees' turnover intention as the dependent variable showed that R square was 26.8% and adjusted R square was 25.8%. The overall F-value was 27.180, which significantly supports the model fit at the 1% statistic level (p < 0.000). In addition, the analysis yielded Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic of 2.212. Thus, it was able to indicate that there was no first-order autocorrelation in the residual term of the data in this study. The details of the regression analysis outcome for the hypotheses in this study are as follows. Hypothesis 1 suggested that there would be a positive relationship between customer incivility and the employee's turnover intention, and Hypothesis 4 suggested that there would be a negative relationship between the perceived supervisor support and the employee's turnover intention. However, both results showed that (customer incivility \u2192 turnover intention, \u03b2 = 0.061, t = 0.992; perceived coworker support \u2192 turnover intention, \u03b2 = \u22120.006, and t = \u22120.107) the impact of customer incivility and the perceived co-worker support were insignificant. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 4 were rejected. Hypothesis 2 suggested that there would be a positive relationship between job stress and the employee's turnover intention. Job stress was found to be positive predictor of turnover intention (\u03b2 = 0.244, t = 3.858, and p < 0.001) as predicted. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was supported. Additionally, as Hypothesis 3 predicted, the significant t-value (\u03b2 = \u22120.345, t = \u22125.960, and p < 0.001) indicates that the perceived supervisor support impacts the employee's turnover intention negatively. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was supported.",

Not only that, many previous studies have validated the existence of significant differences in demographic variables [75] [76] [77] . Therefore, building on the results of these previous studies, this study examined the differences between gender, marital status, job position, and years of service on turnover intention by using crosstabulation analysis. Two of the four hypothesized relationships linking the study variables including Hypotheses 2 and 3 were supported, which indicated that job stress has a significant influence on increasing turnover intention, and it showed that the perceived supervisor support had a negative relationship with the turnover intention of the employees. Hypotheses 1 and 4, which included customer incivility and perceived co-worker support, did not significantly influence turnover intention directly.",

The reason why a mediator is usually necessary in order to explain the positive relationship between customer incivility and turnover intention is unknown, but it can be argued that customer incivility is widely expected in the service industry, which confronts the actions itself and does not harm the employees in any way. Additionally, it can be thought that in many cases several hotel properties now place some kinds of disadvantages to those customers who have shown uncivil actions that are severe enough to damage the employee either physically or psychologically, such as no compensation, blocking further reservations, and implementing lawsuits. However, having to face these serious and minor incivilities constantly will surely influence the employees' state of being [32] , which can eventually affect the decision-making process regarding an employee quitting their job.",

Additionally, for foreign workers, the perceived co-worker support was more proximal than the supervisor support, which resulted in less psychological stress [72] . De Clercq, Azeem, Haq, and Bouckenooghe [90] pointed out that the important reason co-worker support helps lower turnover intention is because it lowers the stress that the employees perceive in the work process. However, the perceived co-worker support was found to have no significant role that influenced turnover intention in this study. Additionally, the results from the present study provided considerable insights regarding the importance of the perceived supervisor support to reduce the turnover intention, which is in line with the existing research that explains that the supervisor support is an important factor regarding the employees' job satisfaction [58] , health, well-being at work [91] , and quality of life [92] . The employees' perceived supervisor support can determine whether their work effort is considered and cared about [58] . In other words, recognition and positive emotions the supervisors show to the employees can enhance their self-confidence, which in turn increases the workplace commitment. In the meantime, the effect of receiving recognition, praise, and support from co-workers can be less than that of the supervisors because the co-workers are at the same organizational level [72] . The perceived co-worker support can also be diluted because there are usually several co-workers at the same workplace, and some co-workers will be supportive, and others will not be. The perceived supervisor support can have a stronger effect on the level of support employees perceive since it usually comes from one important person who is in charge of direct supervision.",

The higher turnover intention was found from the female employees, and as the employees' number of working years increased, their turnover intention decreased. However, neither gender nor the years of service affected turnover intention in this research. This result can implicate several changes in society. One can argue that because society is more competitive, the motivation for a higher job position is more important than having safe long working years. Additionally, the conventional perception of a life-time job/workplace has faded over the years, which could urge the employees to change their workplace even after long working years. The result can also implicate that women are more active with their career development than in the past. These changes and their influence on employee behavior and the outcomes are all open for future research.",

It could be possible because they are not satisfied with their current position at work, and they feel that they are not awarded enough or think a better opportunity lies elsewhere for their career development.

Therefore, the findings of this study regarding the relationships between the variables should be considered with caution, not to be generalized since the prodigious discrepancy lies within the way people behave and react in different countries and different cultures. Additionally, the sample was restricted to the hotel employees who were working in five-star hotels only, and five-star hotel employees can be considered to have more work pressure due to the high-quality service demand that could influence the relationships between the variables. Extending the research to other regions and cultural contexts will improve the generalizability of the results.
