The detailed interactions between the stilbenolignan analogues and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors were determined as hydrophobic bonds, hydrogen bonds and electronic bonds, inhibition activity, ligand efficiency, bonding type and distance and etc. The binding energies of the stilbenolignan analogues were obtained from the molecular docking of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lehmbachol D, Maackolin, Gnetucleistol, Gnetifolin F, Gnetofuran A and Aiphanol were found to be -7.7, -8.2, -7.3, -8.5, -8.0 and -7.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Osirus, Molinspiration and SwissADME chemoinformatic tools were used to examine ADMET properties, pharmacokinetic parameters and and toxicological characteristics of the stilbenolignan analogues. All analogues obey the Lipinski's rule of five. Furthermore, stilbenolignan analogues were studied to predict their binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular modeling and simulation techniques, and the binding free energy calculations of all complexes were calculated using the molecular mechanics/Poisson\u2212Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. With the data presented here it has been observed that these analogues may be a good candidate for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in vivo studies, so more research can be done on stilbenolignan analogues.",

Afterwards, COVID-19 spread from person to person particularly in Wuhan, and then spread to other cities in Hubei province and other provinces of the People's Republic of China and lastly to other world countries [3] . COVID-19 is a virus defined as a result of a research conducted in a group of patients in whom such as fever, cough, shortness of breath were observed on January 13, 2020. COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) globally first on March 11, 2020 and WHO named SARS-CoV-2 Mpro pathogen as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) as a type of coronavirus [4] . No specific effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19 has been found. Although in most COVID-19 patients a mild or moderate course is observed, in up to 5-10% there can be a severe, potentially life-threatening course, and effective medications are urgently needed.",

Moreover, these plants have an important role in the production of drug raw materials or new drugs in modern pharmacy since the compounds obtained by these plants constitute the basis in particular of pharmacology [12, 13] . Studies on medicinal plants will continue as long as humanity exists since studies on important medicinal plants have contributed to the treatment processes of diseases for many years. It is important to determine the biological activities of these plants, which have not been sufficiently studied as a result of herbal medicines. Stilbenelignans produced by plants is a group of natural products formed from a stilbenoid and a lignan, intersecting moiety of non conventional lignans [14, 15] . Stilbenes having an important biologic activity are composed ofa Cinnamoyl-Coenzyme A group and three malonate units. Therefore, these structures formed by the unification of C6-C3 stilbenes with the Cinnamoyl-CoA are regarded as stilbenolignans.",

It has been seen that hydroxyl moieties in the stilbenolignan structure have different properties such as meta-oriented or orto-oriented because of the different binding sites [16] . Moreover, only six stilbenolignans have been identified in the literature. The stilbenolignans used in this work were found to be from three different plant families. As shown in Fig.1 , Lehmbachol D, Gnetifolin F and Gnetofuran A are identified from Gnetum cleistostachyum (Gnetaceae). Maackolin is identified from Maackia amurensis (Fabaceae) and, Aiphanol is identified from Aiphanes aculeata (Arecaceae).

The ion concentration was maintained at 0.15 M and the net charge of system were neutralized by adding 67 Na + and 55 Clions. Langevin dynamics with periodic boundary conditions were applied in the simulation. Van der waals and electrostatic interactions were truncated at 12 \u00c5 with a switching function from 10 \u00c5. Particle Mesh Ewald was applied for long-range electrostatic interaction calculations. First, the system underwent a 5000-step minimization with a fixed backbone, and then a subsequent 5000-step minimization without constraint. Then, all atoms in the protein were fixed for 100 ps equilibration of the water. Harmonic constraint of 1 kcal mol -1 \u2022\u00c5 -2 was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and stilbenolignan analogues' complexes alpha carbon atoms, and the system was then gradually heated from 0 K to 310 K with 1000-step/K in the canonical ensemble simulation. The system was maintained at 310 K for 1 ns equilibration with alpha carbon atoms constraints and another 2 ns equilibration without constraints in canonical ensemble system. The system was switched to an isothermal-isobaric ensemble simulation and all constraints were removed for the 50 ns production run.",

The cLogP values of the stilbenolignan analogues were found smaller than 5.0 which means these analogues have rational good absorption and permeability. Solubility is a significant parameter for drug design and pharmacology due to the potential absorption and distribution characteristics, so preparing well soluble drugs is always preferred in drug industry [40] . and drug-induced toxicity properties of the stilbenolignan analogues were calculated using SwissADME database as shown in Table3. The mutagenicity and carcinogeniticy of the stilbenolignan analogues were evaluated using the SwissADME server [42] .

Besides, the toxicity results of the SwissADME suggest that Maackolin, Gnetifolin F and Gnetofuran A analogues were nonmutagenic and noncarcinogenic and also these analogues might have potential activity in the SARS-CoV-2 disease due to good binding energy and pharmacokinetic properties.Moreover, as result of binding free energy calculations, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-Maackolin analogue complex showed the highest negative binding free energy value of -103.61 kJ/mol, followed by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-Gnetifolin F analogue complex with value of -99.59 kJ/mol.
