            "text": "Encouraged by the crucial need to understand merchant adoption of mobile payment, this study explores the role trust play in the adoption of mobile payment by merchant and the enablers for merchant's trust in mobile payment systems. This was done by Conceptualising the characteristics of the service provider and technology characteristics as the two dimensions that could influence merchant adoption of mobile payments. The study was done through the lenses of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Trust-Theoretic Model and adopted a qualitative approach where two merchants were selected from the health sector. The findings demonstrate that the role of merchant trust is very critical for adoption due to m-payment technology and security risk. Hence, sufficient trust-building structures in mobile payment space are essential for the adoption of mobile payment by merchants. Moreover, the findings indicate mobile service provider characteristics and the mobile technology characteristics are both imperative toward building trust in mobile payment systems for merchants' adoption. The study also found that the trust of both technology and service provider has a far more critical influence on merchants' adoption of mobile payments than perceived usefulness or ease of use. The study, therefore, recommends that service providers should consider the opportunity to nurture merchant trust because merchant trust acts as a fundamental enabler for the adoption of mobile payments. Other implications are also discussed.",

            "text": "Mobile technology evolution and the extensive diffusion of mobile phones in performing several functions and tasks, has led to the phenomenal growth in the ownership of mobile phones globally. Notable among these everyday tasks is the use of mobile phones in making payments for goods and services without the need for cash or participation of banking institutions (Li\u00e9bana-Cabanillas and Lara-Rubio 2017; Dahlberg et al. 2015; Chandra et al. 2010 ). This rising interest in mobile payment usage from the consumer to the merchants has become a strategic tool that facilitates positive business outcomes (Congdon 2016) . Further, this innovative payment solution is considered a bedrock for competitive advantage, productivity, and growth, providing a way for businesses to achieve efficiency (Hsiao 2019) . The high penetration of mobile payments within society, its accessibility and ease of use has led to experts classifying mobile payments as the potential payment of choice (Li\u00e9bana-Cabanillas and Lara-Rubio 2017; Cabanillas et al. 2016) . This makes mobile payments deployment relevant to the growth and development of businesses across the world (Oliveira et al. 2016 ). More importantly in developing countries, the mobile payment revolution is transforming households and businesses by providing a business solution to small and medium-sized businesses as well as mobile phone-related financial services to the underserved population, and help developing economies leapfrog poor non-existing payment infrastructure (Asongu et al. 2018) .",

            "text": "Trust, which is an essential adoption enabler in different IS situations, has not been adequately looked at in the environment of merchant adoption of mobile payment. However, mobile payments, transactions can occur among unknown entities, since mobile payments are regarded as a type of an online transaction completed over a mobile network and an accepted progression from electronic payment systems. This makes trust a significant facilitator for the merchant adoption of mobile payment (Rouibah et al. 2016 ). Therefore, this study seeks to understand the merchant adoption of m-payment systems and explore the trust-theoretic perspective to examine the enablers of merchant trust in mobile payment systems (Mallat 2007) . The questions underpinning the study are: what is the enabler of merchant trust and what is the role of merchant trust in m-payment adoption. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section reviews the literature on mobile payments and briefly discusses the theoretical underpinnings. The third section presents the conceptual framework guiding the study; the section that follows details the methodology employed. Subsequently, the findings are analysed, and discussions of the findings presented. Finally, the paper concludes with specific contributions and directions for future research.",

The vibrant nature of evolving technologies and the dynamic circumstances calls for the basic question in adoption \"what factors affect the intended user to adopt various technologies?\" Because research on IT innovation adoption is extensive, this fundamental question is examined from various dimensions such as technological, and security features, individual adopters, organisations and environment (Miao and Jayakar 2016; Dahlberg et al. 2015; Madan and Yadav 2016) . Generally, scholars have used different theories to explain the adoption of innovation in technology. The study used literature on \"trust\" in combination with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to establish a trust-theoretic model for payment adoption. TAM has been extensively used in studying IS adoption behavior (Hsiao 2019; Upadhyay and Jahanyan 2016; Merhi 2016; Shanko et al. 2016) . The theory stipulates that individual's adoption of an innovation in an information system is dependent on the intention of the individual to use the system and an extent to which a customer accept that adopting an innovation will improve his effectiveness and job performance (Davis 1993; .",

Several innovation studies have validated the instructive supremacy of TAM for technology acceptance which is proven for multiple IS types (Davis 1993; Davis et al. 1989 ). The two key belief concepts of PU and PEOU in the theory might not sufficiently explicate the effect of additional usage issues that can influence individual intention to adopt (Davis 1993; Moon and Kim 2001) . However, limited studies have examined \"trust\" as an additional concept. Nevertheless, trust is a fundamental concern in the mobile payment context due to the apprehensions associated with the mobile service provider and the environmental uncertainties associated with mobile technology. Chandra et al. (2010) examined trust in consumer adoption of mobile payment and the role of trust by contextualising the trust antecedents to the m-payment situation proposing a trust-theoretic m-payment adoption model. Drawing from Chandra et al. (2010) , the study contextualises the antecedents of trust in mobile payment situation to merchant adoption based on the trust-theoretic m-payment adoption model.",

The concept of trust has attracted a considerable amount of research due to its significant role in information systems research, especially in the e-commerce environment. Mobile payments, which are a kind of online transaction, involve virtuality, anonymity and temporal and spatial separation, which can lead to considerable uncertainty and risk. Therefore, trust is very relevant for mobile payment technology adoption. According to Zhou (2013) merchants usually have concerns about security when it comes to the use of mobile payment. Nevertheless, merchants consider trust in payment services providers and the security of mobile payment solutions as necessary criteria for the adoption of mobile payment. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate trust in examining the merchant adoption of mobile payments (Zhou 2013) . Therefore, in the mobile payment environment, the two enablers of merchant trust consist of trust in provider of mobile service as well as trust in technology-enhanced by characteristics of the service provider and characteristics of the mobile technology (Chandra et al. 2010; Broutsou and Fitsilis 2012) .",

This can be likened to the concept of the \"halo effect\". The concept of the halo effect is based on the explanation that an individual's perception or views about a product or a person is based on previous experiences and the sort of interpretation which leads to cognitive bias. For instance, one can explain that Apple's other products are successful and people have confidence in it, due to the positive influence and how successful iPod was (Chong et al. 2018; Wilcox 2008) . Thus, merchant perceptions on MSP as fair and honest translates to beliefs and trust for the mobile payment system controlled by the MSP. Research demonstrates that based on the halo effect, merchant trust has a positive relationship with the perceived reputation of the provider of the service, which leads to trusting beliefs in the merchant.",

There are several benefits of M-payment systems to merchants irrespective of place and time, self-regulating transactions, which leads to effective payment transactions to the merchant.

As such, a case study was used as the research method. A case study is considered suitable for this study grounded on Yin's (2009) assertion of a case study where \"why and how\" questions are asked. In addition, case studies help in areas where the researcher does not have much control over the situation or where the issues under investigation are new and there is not much theory to explain issues adequately (Yin 2009 ). Empirical research on merchant adoption of mobile payments is spiral, in this case, the phenomenon is new and needs an in-depth understanding from the perspective of a developing country experience. The descriptive case study approach was used to enable theory to guide the data collection process (Yin 2009 ); as a result, the trust-theoretic stance and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were reviewed as the theory underpinning the case study design (Chandra et al. 2010 ). Face to face interview was used as a data collection method. The interview guide consisted of both open and close-ended questions. According to Walsham (1993) and Yin (2009) case study research has no universally accepted number of cases. It can be a single case or multiple cases. This research was based on a case study of two merchants from the service sector in the health industries. The case was strategically selected to enhance its external validity but not based on statistical consideration. The case was analyzed using Miles and Huberman's (2013) approach to data analysis.",

This ensures confidentiality, anonymity, and integrity (see Yang and Lin 2016; Xin et al. 2013) .

Moreover, the characteristics of the service provider of mobile payment and the mobile technology features are both imperative to build trust in mobile payment systems for merchants' adoption.
