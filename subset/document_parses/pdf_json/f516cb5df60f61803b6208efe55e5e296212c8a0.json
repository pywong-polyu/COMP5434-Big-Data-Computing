            "text": "Pooled testing is widely used for screening for viral or bacterial infections with low prevalence when individual testing is not cost-efficient. Pooled testing with qualitative assays that give binary results has been well-studied. However, characteristics of pooling with quantitative assays were mostly demonstrated using simulations or empirical studies. We investigate properties of three pooling strategies with quantitative assays: traditional two-stage mini-pooling (MP) (Dorfman, 1943) , mini-pooling with deconvolution algorithm (MPA) (May et al., 2010) , and marker-assisted MPA (mMPA) (Liu et al., 2017) . MPA and mMPA test individuals in a sequence after a positive pool and implement a deconvolution algorithm to determine when testing can cease to ascertain all individual statuses. mMPA uses information from other available markers to determine an optimal order for individual testings. We derive and compare the general statistical properties of the three pooling methods. We show that with a proper pool size, MP, MPA, and mMPA can be more cost-efficient than individual testing, and mMPA is superior to MPA and MP. For diagnostic accuracy, mMPA and MPA have higher specificity and positive predictive value but lower sensitivity and negative predictive value than MP and individual testing. Included in this paper are applications to various simulations and an application for HIV treatment monitoring.",

It is often used to identify low-prevalence conditions such as rare diseases, infections, and defects. The most commonly-used pooling strategies are a two-stage testing procedure referred to as mini-pooling (MP), wherein samples of equal amount from K individuals are first combined to form a pool, and a single test is conducted on the pool; and at the second stage, individual samples are tested only if the pool test is positive (otherwise all samples are classified as negative). MP and its variants such as pyramid pooling (Bilder et al., 2010; Quinn et al., 2000) and matrix pooling (van Zyl et al., 2011; Litvak et al., 1994) are valuable particularly when the conditions to be detected are rare and resources such as testing facilities and assays are constrained. There is abundant literature on pooled testing with qualitative assays that yield binary, or so-called Boolean, results (e.g. yes/no, true/false, and positive/negative) (c.f. Du and Hwang, 1999) .",

For example, quantitative RT-PCR assay is routinely used for quantification of viral RNA (e.g. HIV, Ebola, and COVID) by measuring the number of copies of specific cDNA targets. Pooling with quantitative assays is similar to pooling with qualitative assays, but some fundamental differences exist. One difference is that pooling with qualitative assays can be described using a Boolean summation process. In the ideal case with no measurement errors, one or more positive samples in a pool imply that the pool is positive and vice versa. In contrast to this, pooling with quantitative assays can be described by a convolution process. Because of the dilution effect, a pool is defined as positive if the test on the pool is greater than C/K (instead of C). We proceed to the second stage testing if the pool possibly contains one failure (e.g. one sample has V > C and all the others have V = 0). This difference suggests that for pooling with quantitative assays, we cannot draw a conclusion that a pool contains at least one failure if the pool tests positive. Moreover, the quantitative nature of assays makes it possible to incorporate a deconvolution algorithm in the second stage of individual testing after a pool tests positive (May et al., 2010) and to further incorporate external information that is associated with V (Liu et al., 2017) . We review these methods in the context of HIV treatment monitoring as follows.",

            "text": "Routine and global use of VL testing is not feasible, even though the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended such practices (WHO, 2014; Piot et al., 2015) . Thus, HIV treatment monitoring strategies that make the effective use of limited VL assays are needed (Liu et al., 2013; Koller et al., 2015; Cerutti et al., 2016) . May et al. (2010) proposed a pooling method called \"MP with algorithm\" (MPA) for HIV treatment monitoring, which involves two-stage testing as MP but at the second stage (when a pool tests positive), individual samples are tested sequentially with a stopping algorithm. The stopping algorithm is based on the pool result 'subtracting' the results of individual samples that have been tested. The remainder recovers partially the virological status of the remaining individual samples; when the remainder is sufficiently low, all remaining samples are concluded as negative. For example, consider a pool containing three samples. If the pool test result is 500, and testing the first sample yields a result of 1300, then it can be readily deduced that the test results of the remaining two samples cannot exceed 500 \u00d7 3 \u2212 1300 = 200, even if their actual values cannot be determined. If a cutoff C > 200 is used, the remaining two samples can be classified as negative without testing. Properties of MPA has been demonstrated using Monte Carlo and clinical studies (Tilghman et al., 2011 (Tilghman et al., , 2015 Schooley, 2007; Kim et al., 2014) , Building on May et al's method, we proposed another pooling strategy called \"marker-assisted MPA\" (mMPA), which incorporates information from one or more markers that are correlated with V into testing procedure (Liu et al., 2017) . The marker values are used to determine the risk of failure and following a positive pool, individual samples are tested sequentially in their decreasing risk order. The concept is similar to the work of Bilder and colleagues on informed Sterrett pooling method with qualitative assays (Bilder et al., 2010; McMahan et al., 2012) . By testing individuals with a high risk of failure first, mMPA can identify failing individuals more rapidly and efficiently, hence accelerating the deconvolution process.",

Yet the general statistical properties of these methods have not been fully characterized. This paper makes the following contributions to the literature. First, we show that the concept of incorporating additional information into pooled testing can be applied to mMPA for quantitative assays in a similar, but fundamentally different, manner as informed Sterrett retesting for qualitative assays. Second, we quantify the testing efficiencies of MP, MPA, and mMPA in terms of the average number of assays needed per individual. Third, based on the testing efficiency, we establish the superiority of mMPA to MPA and the bounds on their relative efficiency. Fourth, we establish the difference in the diagnostic accuracy of the three methods compared to individual testing. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to evaluate various factors that affect the testing efficiency of the pooling strategies, such as the prevalence of failure, pool size, assay measurement error, and choice of risk score for mMPA.",

Suppose that C = 1000, K = 5, and the true results of all individuals are 400. Then, V pool = 400 which is greater than C/5 = 200. This pool is positive but contains no failures. The rationale to call this pool positive is that the pool result alone does not allow us to distinguish this pool from other pools that may contain failures (e.g. a pool with one sample being 1200 and the other four being 200). Secondly, for pooling with quantitative assays, the pool test result contains information about the possible number of failures, which is different from pooling with qualitative assays wherein the only information that can be learned from a positive pool is that the pool contains at least one failure.",

When a large pool size is used (e.g. K \u2265 8), MP can be less efficient and need more assays than individual testing. The testing efficiency of MPA is higher than MP but lower than mMPA. Figure 5 compares MP and MPA with mMPA. The 95% CIs of their differences are calculated using \"paired\" bootstrap samples: With each bootstrap resample, we estimate \u03c6's for MP, MPA, and mMPA and their pairwise differences, and then calculate the bootstrapped 95% CIs based on the pairwise differences. As shown in Figure 5 , the testing efficiency of mMPA is significantly higher than those of MPA and MP even though in Figure 4 their corresponding 95% CIs overlap.",

For this reason, the testing efficiency and accuracy of mMPA on one population may not be directly generalizable to another population, even though the same risk score is used.

For reference, \u03c6 MP and \u03c6 MPA are also shown in theFigure.Clearly, stronger risk scores lead to a higher testing efficiency of mMPA. With a stronger risk score, a larger pool size also could possibly be used to improve testing efficiency.Figure 2 (D) shows the testing efficiency of mMPA versus the Spearman's correlations of (Y, S) for pool sizes of 3, 4, and 5. The Figure shows that the choice of risk score impacts the testing efficiency of mMPA with Spearman's correlation being a reasonable metric for evaluating risk score's strength. Simulation Study IV : We evaluate the impact of measurement error on classification accuracy by simulating the errors on individual and pool samples using log-normal distribution.

Overall, the sensitivity (Figure 3(A)) and NPV (Figure 3(D)) of IND and MP are higher than those of MPA and mMPA. MPA and mMPA have higher specificity (Figure 3(B)) and PPV (Figure 3(C)) than IND and MP. These findings are consistentwith our results in Section 5. Moreover, in terms of total misclassification rate, mMPA is better than the other methods, although the differences are small(Figure 3(E)).",

MPA uses a deconvolution algorithm to accelerate the process of ascertaining individual failure statuses in a positive pool. mMPA improves upon MPA and uses information from other available markers to rank-order individual samples contributing to the pool, resulting in faster and more efficient deconvolution and fewer tests than MP and MPA.These pooling strategies can be applied in a similar fashion as pooled testing with qualitative assays, but have different statistical properties. In this paper, we formulate the pooling procedures of MP, MPA, and mMPA. We derive and compare their testing efficiencies in terms of the average number of assays required per individual, and establish the superiority of mMPA to MPA and MP. We investigate the impact of different choices of risk scores on mMPA and derive the testing efficiency bound of the methods. We also investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the three methods compared to individual testing.Our results on MPA and mMPA are derived based on a convolution of quantitative results. However, not all pooling with quantitative assays can be conceptualized as a convolution of individual results. For example, another commonly-used measure of virus concentration in a sample is 'cycle time value' (CTV), which essentially counts the number of duplications needed for the virus can be detected by machine. Although CTV can be transformed back to virus concentration, the deconvolution algorithms used by MPA and mMPA cannot be directly applied to CTV.",
