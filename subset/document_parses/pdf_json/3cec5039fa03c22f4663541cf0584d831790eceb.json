In this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration social distancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission. The model is simulated on small-world networks and the role of social distancing in controlling the infection is explained.",

COVID-19 is found to be easily transmitted via close contact with an infective person, even during the incubation period [8] . The basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ) is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infective person; it is a measure of the infectiousness of a disease. A recent study [9] showed that COVID-19 has an R 0 of 3.28 in average; however, this has to be confirmed in further studies due to the novelty of the virus. Additionally, this pandemic has brought the concepts that community behavior has a primary role in the transmission or containment of the virus, and even the competing organizations have to collaborate among each other to contain the crisis [10, 11] .",

In some cases, vaccine-induced immunity wanes with time. Also, some viruses learn to mute and evade the immunity induced by vaccines. In the case of containing COVID-19, the most suitable strategy, for now, is to reduce its infectiousness by limiting contact with infective people and polluted surfaces in what is contemporarily popular as \"social distancing (SD)\" including the quarantine of infected individuals. The degree of SD can be regarded as the fraction of the entire population complying with the policies. Another interpretation considers the gradation of SD policies, i.e., closing borders to international travel; partially closing social venues, large malls, schools and universities, and prayer places; or total lockdown. The awareness of the community in applying these policies will have a great impact on the viral transmission control.",

SD policies in particular can reduce the peak of infection and delay the peak time leading to offer ample time for the development of a vaccine, and prevent hospitals from reaching their maximum patient capacity. Moreover, SD policies can reduce the effects of non-local interactions that can turn the infection to be endemic. With a vaccine, SD practices can reduce the vaccination rate required to eradicate infection. Subsequently, vaccine priority can be given to the health-care providers and those in direct contact with infective individuals. Long-term SD practice is crucial to avoid a relapse, as immediately loosening SD rules may provide an avenue of recurrence of the infection. Community awareness is also important in the transmission process; low community awareness destroys the herd immunity, which spreads the infection endemically. Appropriately implementing an external SD program reduces the degree required for the internal SD program to contain the infection, which has a positive impact on the local economy.",
