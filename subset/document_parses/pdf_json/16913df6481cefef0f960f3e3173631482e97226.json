The study is quantitative in nature, and the data were collected from 544 respondents through online survey who were studying the business management (B.B.A or M.B.A) or hotel management courses in Indian universities. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the proposed hypotheses. The results show that four independent factors used in the study viz. quality of instructor, course design, prompt feedback, and expectation of students positively impact students' satisfaction and further student's satisfaction positively impact students' performance. For educational management, these four factors are essential to have a high level of satisfaction and performance for online courses. This study is being conducted during the epidemic period of COVID-19 to check the effect of online teaching on students' performance.",

Coronavirus is a contagious disease, which is spreading very fast amongst the human beings. COVID-19 is a new sprain which was originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Coronavirus circulates in animals, but some of these viruses can transmit between animals and humans (Perlman & Mclntosh, 2020) . As of March 282,020, according to the MoHFW, a total of 909 confirmed COVID-19 cases (862 Indians and 47 foreign nationals) had been reported in India (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) . Officially, no vaccine or medicine is evaluated to cure the spread of COVID-19 (Yu et al., 2020) . The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education system leads to schools and colleges' widespread closures worldwide. On March 24, India declared a country-wide lockdown of schools and colleges (NDTV, 2020) for preventing the transmission of the coronavirus amongst the students (Bayham & Fenichel, 2020) . School closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have shed light on several issues affecting access to education. COVID-19 is soaring due to which the huge number of children, adults, and youths cannot attend schools and colleges (UNESCO, 2020) . Lah and Botelho (2012) contended that the effect of school closing on students' performance is hazy.",

Results of the studies show that the students perform much better in online learning than in traditional learning. Henriksen et al. (2020) highlighted the problems faced by educators while shifting from offline to online mode of teaching. In the past, several research studies had been carried out on online learning to explore student satisfaction, acceptance of e-learning, distance learning success factors, and learning efficiency (Sher, 2009; Lee, 2014; Yen et al., 2018) . However, scant amount of literature is available on the factors that affect the students' satisfaction and performance in online classes during the pandemic of Covid-19 (Rajabalee & Santally, 2020) . In the present study, the authors proposed that course design, quality of the instructor, prompt feedback, and students' expectations are the four prominent determinants of learning outcome and satisfaction of the students during online classes (Lee, 2014) .",

Instructor quality refers to a professional who understands the students' educational needs, has unique teaching skills, and understands how to meet the students' learning needs (Luekens et al., 2004) . Marsh (1987) developed five instruments for measuring the instructor's quality, in which the main method was Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ), which delineated the instructor's quality. SEEQ is considered one of the methods most commonly used and embraced unanimously (Grammatikopoulos et al., 2014) . SEEQ was a very useful method of feedback by students to measure the instructor's quality (Marsh, 1987) .",

Feedback is defined as information given by lecturers and tutors about the performance of students. Within this context, feedback is a \"consequence of performance\" (Hattie & Timperley, 2007, p. 81) . In education, \"prompt feedback can be described as knowing what you know and what you do not related to learning\" (Simsek et al., 2017, p.334) . Christensen (2014) studied linking feedback to performance and introduced the positivity ratio concept, which is a mechanism that plays an important role in finding out the performance through feedback. It has been found that prompt feedback helps in developing a strong linkage between faculty and students which ultimately leads to better learning outcomes (Simsek et al., 2017; Chang, 2011) .",

These findings were backed by previous research model \"Student Satisfaction Index Model\" (Zhang et al., 2008) . However, when the expectations are students is not fulfilled then it might lead to lower leaning and satisfaction with the course.

Elliott & Dweck (1988, p11) define that \"an achievement goal involves a program of cognitive processes that have cognitive, affective and behavioral consequence\". This theory suggests that students' motivation and achievement-related behaviors can be easily understood by the purpose and the reasons they adopted while they are engaged in the learning activities (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Ames, 1992; Urdan, 1997) . Some of the studies believe that there are four approaches to achieve a goal, i.e., mastery-approach, mastery avoidance, performance approach, and performance-avoidance (Pintrich, 1999; Elliot & McGregor, 2001; Schwinger & Stiensmeier-Pelster, 2011 , Hansen & Ringdal, 2018 Mouratidis et al., 2018) . The environment also affects the performance of students (Ames & Archer, 1988) . Traditionally, classroom teaching is an effective method to achieve the goal (Ames & Archer, 1988; Ames, 1992; Clayton et al., 2010) however in the modern era, the internet-based teaching is also one of the effective tools to deliver lectures, and web-based applications are becoming modern classrooms (Azlan et al., 2020) . Hence, following section discuss about the relationship between different independent variables and dependent variables (Fig. 1 ).",

Zeithaml (1988) describes that satisfaction is the outcome result of the performance of any educational institute. According to Kotler and Clarke (1986) , satisfaction is the desired outcome of any aim that amuses any individual's admiration. Quality interactions between instructor and students lead to student satisfaction (Malik et al., 2010; Mart\u00ednez-Arg\u00fcelles et al., 2016) . Teaching quality and course material enhances the student satisfaction by successful outcomes (Sanderson, 1995) . Satisfaction relates to the student performance in terms of motivation, learning, assurance, and retention (Biner et al., 1996) . Mensink and King (2020) described that performance is the conclusion of student-teacher efforts, and it shows the interest of students in the studies. The critical element in education is students' academic performance (Rono, 2013) . Therefore, it is considered as center pole, and the entire education system rotates around the student's performance. Narad and Abdullah (2016) concluded that the students' academic performance determines academic institutions' success and failure. Singh et al. (2016) asserted that the student academic performance directly influences the country's socio-economic development. Farooq et al. (2011) highlights the students' academic performance is the primary concern of all faculties. Additionally, the main foundation of knowledge gaining and improvement of skills is student's academic performance. According to Narad and Abdullah (2016) , regular evaluation or examinations is essential over a specific period of time in assessing students' academic performance for better outcomes. Hence the hypothesis that satisfaction significantly affects the performance of the students was included in this study.",

These attributes were taken from previous studies (Yin & Wang, 2015; Bangert, 2004; Chickering & Gamson, 1987; Wilson et al., 1997) . The \"instructor quality\" was measured through the scale developed by Bangert (2004) . The scale consists of seven items. The \"course design\" and \"prompt feedback\" items were adapted from the research work of Bangert (2004) . The \"course design\" scale consists of six items. The \"prompt feedback\" scale consists of five items. The \"students' expectation\" scale consists of five items. Four items were adapted from Bangert, 2004 and one item was taken from Wilson et al. (1997) . Students' satisfaction was measure with six items taken from Bangert (2004); Wilson et al. (1997) ; Yin and Wang (2015) . The \"students' performance\" was measured through the scale developed by Wilson et al. (1997) . The scale consists of six items. These variables were accessed on a five-point likert scale, ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree). Only the students from India have taken part in the survey. A total of thirty-four questions were asked in the study to check the effect of the first four variables on students' satisfaction and performance.

The data were collected in the pandemic period of COVID-19 during the total lockdown in India. This was the best time to collect the data related to the current research topic because all the colleges across India were involved in online classes. Therefore, students have enough time to understand the instrument and respondent to the questionnaire in an effective manner. A total of 615 questionnaires were circulated, out of which the students returned 574. Thirty responses were not included due to the unengaged responses.

This is a multivariate statistical analysis technique, and it includes the amalgamation of factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. It is used to analyze the structural relationship between measured variables and latent constructs. Table 3 represents the structural model's model fitness indices where all variables put together when CMIN/DF is 2.479, and all the model fit values are within the particular range. That means the model has attained a good model fit. Furthermore, other fit indices as GFI = .982 and AGFI = 0.956 be all so supportive (Schumacker & Lomax, 1996; Marsh & Grayson, 1995; Kline, 2005) . Hence, the model fitted the data successfully. All co-variances among the variables and regression weights were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Table 4 represents the relationship between exogenous, mediator and endogenous variables viz-quality of instructor, prompt feedback, course design, students' expectation, students' satisfaction and students' performance. The first four factors have a positive relationship with satisfaction, which further leads to students' performance positively. Results show that the instructor's quality has a positive relationship with the satisfaction of students for online classes (SE = 0.706, ; p < 0.05). Hence, H1 was supported. The second factor is course design, which has a positive relationship with students' satisfaction of students (SE = 0.064, t-value = 2.395; p < 0.05). Hence, H2 was supported. The third factor is Prompt feedback, and results show that feedback has a positive relationship with the satisfaction of the students (SE = 0.067, t-value = 2.520; p < 0.05). Hence, H3 was supported. The fourth factor is students' expectations. The results show a positive relationship between students' expectation and students' satisfaction with online classes (SE = 0.149, t-value = 5.127; p < 0.05). Hence, H4 was supported. The results of SEM show that out of quality of instructor, prompt feedback, course design, and students' expectation, the most influencing factor that affect the students' satisfaction was instructor's quality (SE = 0.706) followed by students' expectation (SE =5.127), prompt feedback (SE = 2.520). The factor that least affects the students' satisfaction was course design (2.395). The results of Table 4 finally depicts that students' satisfaction has positive effect on students' performance ((SE = 0.186, t-value = 2.800; p < 0.05). Hence H5 was supported. Table 5 shows that students' satisfaction partially mediates the positive relationship between the instructor's quality and student performance. Hence, H6(a) was supported. Further, the mediation analysis results showed that satisfaction again partially mediates the positive relationship between course design and student's performance. Hence, H6(b) was supported However, the mediation analysis results showed that satisfaction fully mediates the positive relationship between prompt feedback and student performance. Hence, H6(c) was supported. Finally, the results of the Table 5 showed that satisfaction partially mediates the positive relationship between expectations of the students and student's performance. Hence, H6(d) was supported. ",

The study also explored the direct linkage between student's satisfaction and their performance. The present study's findings indicated that instructor's quality is the most prominent factor that affects the student's satisfaction during online classes. This means that the instructor needs to be very efficient during the lectures. He needs to understand students' psychology to deliver the course content prominently. If the teacher can deliver the course content properly, it affects the student's satisfaction and performance. The teachers' perspective is critical because their enthusiasm leads to a better online learning process quality.",

Students might have some expectations during the classes. If the instructor understands that expectation and customizes his/her course design following the student's expectations, then it is expected that the students will perform better in the examinations. The third factor that affects the student's satisfaction is feedback. After delivering the course, appropriate feedback should be taken by the instructors to plan future courses. It also helps to make the future strategies (Tawafak et al., 2019) . There must be a proper feedback system for improvement because feedback is the course content's real image. The last factor that affects the student's satisfaction is design. The course content needs to be designed in an effective manner so that students should easily understand it. If the instructor plans the course, so the students understand the content without any problems it effectively leads to satisfaction, and the student can perform better in the exams. In some situations, the course content is difficult to deliver in online teaching like the practical part i.e. recipes of dishes or practical demonstration in the lab. In such a situation, the instructor needs to be more creative in designing and delivering the course content so that it positively impacts the students' overall satisfaction with online classes.",

Some of the previous studies suggest that the technology-supported courses have a positive relationship with students' performance (Cho & Schelzer, 2000; Harasim, 2000; Sigala, 2002) . On the other hand, the demographic characteristic also plays a vital role in understanding the online course performance. According to APA Work Group of the Board of Educational Affairs (1997), the learner-centered principles suggest that students must be willing to invest the time required to complete individual course assignments. Online instructors must be enthusiastic about developing genuine instructional resources that actively connect learners and encourage them toward proficient performances. For better performance in studies, both teachers and students have equal responsibility. When the learner faces any problem to understand the concepts, he needs to make inquiries for the instructor's solutions (Bangert, 2004) . Thus, we can conclude that \"instructor quality, student's expectation, prompt feedback, and effective course design\" significantly impact students' online learning process.",

This study was different from the previous studies (Baber, 2020; Ikhsan et al., 2019; Eom & Ashill, 2016) . None of the studies had examined the effect of students' satisfaction on their perceived academic performance. The previous empirical findings have highlighted the importance of examining the factors affecting student satisfaction (Maqableh & Jaradat, 2021; Yunusa & Umar, 2021) . Still, none of the studies has examined the effect of course design, quality of instructor, prompt feedback, and students' expectations on students' satisfaction all together with online classes during the pandemic period. The present study tries to fill this research gap.",

There was an extra obligation for instructors who taught online courses during the pandemic. They would have to adapt to a changing climate, polish their technical skills throughout the process, and foster new students' technical knowledge in this environment. The present study's findings indicate that instructor quality is a significant determinant of student satisfaction during online classes amid a pandemic. In higher education, the teacher's standard referred to the instructor's specific individual characteristics before entering the class (Darling-Hammond, 2010) . These attributes include factors such as instructor content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, inclination, and experience. More significantly, at that level, the amount of understanding could be given by those who have a significant amount of technical expertise in the areas they are teaching (Martin, 2021) . Secondly, the present study results contribute to the profession of education by illustrating a realistic approach that can be used to recognize students' expectations in their class effectively. The primary expectation of most students before joining a university is employment.",

The instructor can then use that to balance expectations to improve student satisfaction. Study results can be used to continually improve and build courses, as well as to make policy decisions to improve education programs. Thirdly, from result outcomes, online course design and instructors will delve deeper into how to structure online courses more efficiently, including design features that minimize adversely and maximize optimistic emotion, contributing to greater student satisfaction (Martin et al., 2018) . The findings suggest that the course design has a substantial positive influence on the online class's student performance. The findings indicate that the course design of online classes need to provide essential details like course content, educational goals, course structure, and course output in a consistent manner so that students would find the e-learning system beneficial for them; this situation will enable students to use the system and that leads to student performance (Almaiah & Alyoussef, 2019) . Lastly, the results indicate that instructors respond to questions promptly and provide timely feedback on assignments to facilitate techniques that help students in online courses improve instructor participation, instructor interaction, understanding, and participation (Martin et al., 2018) . Feedback can be beneficial for students to focus on the performance that enhances their learning.",

The future research can use a longitudinal study to handle this limitation. Further, the data was collected from one type of respondents only, that is, the students. Therefore, the results of the study cannot be generalized to other samples. The future research can also include the perspectives of teachers and policy makers to have more generalization of the results. The current research is only limited to theory classes; therefore, it can be implemented to check students' performance in practical classes. The study is done on the Indian students only; thus, if the data is collected from various countries, it can give better comparative results to understand the student's perspective. This study is limited to check the performance of students, so in the future, the performance of teachers can be checked with similar kinds of conditions. There may be some issues and problems faced by the students, like the limited access to the internet or disturbance due to low signals. Some of the students may face the home environment issues such as disturbance due to family members, which may lead to negative performance. The above-mentioned points can be inculcated in the future research. ",
