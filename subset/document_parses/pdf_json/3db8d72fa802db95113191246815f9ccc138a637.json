            "text": "The widespread Coronavirus Disease 2019 is caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Currently, we have a limited toolset available for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 in cells and tissues, particularly in tissues from patients who died from COVID-19. Generally, single-molecule RNA FISH techniques have shown mixed results in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues such as those preserved from human autopsies. Here, we present a platform for preparing autopsy tissue for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RNA FISH with amplification by hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We developed probe sets that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF1a and N) as well as probe sets that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs. We validated these probe sets in cell culture and tissues (lung, lymph node, and placenta) from infected patients. Using this technology, we observe distinct subcellular localization patterns of the ORF1a and N regions, with the ORF1a concentrated around the nucleus and the N showing a diffuse distribution across the cytoplasm. In human lung tissue, we performed multiplexed RNA FISH HCR for SARS-CoV-2 and cell-type specific marker genes. We found viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell marker gene (SFTPC) and the alveolar macrophage marker gene (MARCO), but did not identify viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell marker gene (AGER). Moreover, we observed distinct subcellular localization patterns of viral RNA in AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages, consistent with phagocytosis of infected cells. In sum, we demonstrate the use of RNA FISH HCR for visualizing different RNA species from SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and FFPE autopsy specimens. Furthermore, we multiplex this assay with probes for cellular genes to determine what cell-types are infected within the lung. We anticipate that this platform could be broadly useful for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathology in tissues as well as extended for other applications including investigating the viral life cycle, viral diagnostics, and drug screening.",

            "text": "Critical to defining the distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in humans is determining which organs and cell types become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several studies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] have made predictions on the tissues and cell types infected by SARS-CoV-2 based on host expression of factors known to facilitate viral entry into the host cell for closely related betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. While this approach has helped to narrow down targets in humans, the confirmation of these predicted organs and cell types as true targets of SARS-CoV-2 remains an ongoing process. Accordingly, in a limited set of human autopsy studies, SARS-CoV-2 components (RNA and proteins) have been detected in multiple organs and organ systems including the upper airway 10, 11 , lung 11, 12 , gastrointestinal tract 13 , placenta 14, 15 , spleen 16 , myocardium 17 , and lymph node 16 , using different combinations of RT-PCR, immunostaining, electron microscopy and in situ hybridization techniques. A number of these studies that use techniques with single-cell resolution (such as immunostaining and in situ hybridization) have identified alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and alveolar macrophages in the lung 11 , glandular epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract 13 , cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in placenta 18 and macrophages in the spleen and lymph nodes 16 as specific cell types containing SARS-CoV-2 viral components. Ultimately, defining the full range of SARS CoV-2 tropism requires direct detection approaches to validate the predictions from bioinformatic analyses in large sets of human tissue samples from COVID-19 patients.",

With the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we sought to use RNA in situ hybridization techniques to visualize the viral RNA transcripts in both cell lines and tissues. To overcome limitations from background autofluorescence and for robust RNA detection, we used hybridization chain reaction v3.0 (HCR) to achieve amplification of the RNA FISH signal 24 . We developed probe sets consisting of multiple probe pairs that are tiled along the RNA sequence of interest. Each probe pair, termed \"split-initiator\" probes, contains a region of complementarity to the viral RNA and half of the initiator sequence for signal amplification via polymerization of dye-conjugated DNA hairpins. Because the initiator sequence is divided between the two split-initiator probes, amplification only occurs if both of the probes bind adjacently, providing additional specificity for the target of interest (Fig.  1a) . As previously described 24 , we used a two-stage protocol in which we first hybridize the split-initiator probes and then amplify the signal using fluorescently labeled DNA hairpins. We can multiplex the assay for multiple targets by using distinct hairpin sequences labeled with different fluorophores for each RNA target.",

We found high intensity fluorescent labelling with both the ORF1a and N probe sets in the infected, but not in mock-infected samples (Fig. 1b) . Staining from both probe sets was confined to the cytoplasm of cells and did not stain inside the cell nucleus. Interestingly, we observed that the ORF1a probe set (which labels only genomic RNA) showed the highest intensity of staining in a region around the periphery of the nucleus of each cell. This staining pattern is consistent with reported coronavirus RNA replication at replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), which are networks consisting of host endoplasmic reticulum-derived, perinuclear, double-membrane structures [27] [28] [29] . Meanwhile, the N region probe set showed more diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm, but higher intensity in the perinuclear region. Such a pattern could be expected for the N region probes as they are likely binding both genomic RNA species in the RTCs and all the subgenomic mRNA species (Fig. 1a) . These subgenomic mRNAs are translated by the host ribosome, and thus are more diffuse through the cytoplasm rather than largely confined to viral replication centers.",

            "text": "To further resolve the localization of genomic and subgenomic mRNA, we designed probes to uniquely label the subgenomic mRNA species without simultaneously targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. Such a probe design is difficult because the subgenomic mRNA sequence is also contained within the genomic RNA, and thus subgenomic and genomic transcripts would be simultaneously targeted with conventional probe designs. Thus, to develop subgenome specific probes, we leveraged a feature of coronavirus transcription biology. To generate subgenomic mRNAs, the viral polymerase first transcribes negative-strand intermediates from which it then transcribes the subgenomic mRNAs. During this synthesis of negative-strand intermediates, the polymerase terminates transcription when it encounters transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) upstream of each subgenomic mRNA open reading frame and resumes at a TRS located further towards the 5' end of the genomic template. This interrupted form of transcription, known as discontinuous transcription 19, 30 , adds an antisense copy of the genomic leader sequence to each subgenomic mRNA intermediate. Therefore, in the subgenomic mRNAs only, there is a unique junction formed between the 3' end of the leader sequence and the 5' end of their gene sequence. To target each individual subgenomic mRNA, we designed HCR probe pairs that span the unique junction sites, with one of the split-initiator probes positioned on the leader sequence and the other split-initiator probe on the gene sequence (Fig. 1a) . Because each split-initiator probe contains half the initiator sequence, amplification should only occur if the two probes bind adjacent to each other, which would be the case for each target subgenomic mRNA but not genomic RNA. With this strategy, we achieve highly specific detection of the fusion transcripts containing the leader and each subgenomic sequence. We designed these subgenomic probes for each of the eight different canonical subgenomic mRNA species and used them together on A549 ACE2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b) . We found that the subgenomic mRNA probe sets showed a diffuse staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm that is distinct from both the ORF1a and N probe sets. This diffuse staining pattern is consistent with the subgenomic mRNAs being distributed throughout the cytoplasm for translation by free ribosomes or ER associated ribosomes (rather than concentrated in the replication/transcription complex as seen for the ORF1a probe set).",

We again found with single-molecule RNA FISH that the ORF1a probe set had a perinuclear staining pattern, while the N probe had a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Compared to non-amplified single-molecule RNA FISH, the RNA FISH HCR signal was significantly brighter, requiring much shorter exposure times for imaging. Thus, we selected RNA FISH HCR for subsequent experiments in tissues in which we expected higher background compared to cell culture conditions. We next sought to use this assay in human tissues to localize sites of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. We analyzed human autopsy specimens from research autopsies of COVID-19 patients performed at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2020. The tissues were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and then probed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig. 2a) . We analyzed a total of 14 different lung specimens from eight patients and found one case that showed extensive staining of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lung tissue (Supp. Table 1 ). Of note, the patient with extensive virus staining in the lung was immunosuppressed, and decompensated within 2 days of arriving at the hospital. In this specimen, we observed discrete regions of the lung containing infected cells (Fig. 2b , Lung) as well as regions with bright fluorescence signal, but no nuclei present (Supp. Fig 2a) . To find areas with SARS-CoV-2 staining, we developed a computational pipeline (described in methods) to segment cells and then quantify the fluorescence staining from the ORF1a viral probe set (output of the analysis is shown in Supp. Fig. 3 ). As a control, we also examined lung tissue from patients who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2. In these controls, our computational analysis did not identify any cells passing the threshold of significant ORF1a viral RNA staining (Supp. Fig. 4 ).",

We used single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the human lung atlas 36 to identify genes that would uniquely label alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, and alveolar macrophages within the lung. For our analysis, we considered the specificity of the marker gene, the fraction of cells that expressed the marker, and the expression level (as we needed genes with high enough expression for accurate detection in situ). We only considered markers that were present in all of the human lung cell atlas subjects to avoid genes with heterogeneous expression between individuals. We developed HCR probes for 1 marker of each cell type (AGER for AT1 cells, SFTPC for AT2 cells, and MARCO for alveolar macrophages, Supp. Fig. 6 ).",

We observed AGER-and SFTPC-high cells throughout the tissue (Fig. 3c) . Reassuringly, we did not find many cells showing high levels of both genes (only 1 observed), allowing us to identify AGER-and SFTPC-high cells as AT1 and AT2 cells, respectively. Furthermore, the cells labeled by the AGER and SFTPC probe sets had morphologies consistent with AT1 and AT2 cells, respectively. For each marker gene, we selected a threshold number of mRNA molecules per cell to identify cells as either AT1 or AT2 cells (described in methods). We then analyzed the fluorescence intensity of the ORF1a SARS-CoV-2 probe set signal across all 252,820 cells in the dataset from patient 2 with high levels of infection in the lung. We found that a large fraction of the SFTPC-positive AT2 cells also stained as positive for ORF1a RNA (27.4%) but that none (0%) of the AGER-positive AT1 cells were positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 3b,d) . There were also a substantial number of cells (647) that were ORF1a RNA positive, but did not have expression of either SFTPC or AGER. Additionally, there were a number of cells with viral RNA staining that lacked nuclear DAPI staining suggesting that these represent dead cells that were previously infected (Supp. Fig. 2b ). In sum, we demonstrated highly specific discrimination of AT1 and AT2 cells, and found that only the AT2 cell population had robust SARS-CoV-2 RNA consistent with these cells being the major target of infection We next sought to determine what other cell types contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lung. We multiplexed a probe set for a macrophage specific gene (MARCO) with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a probe set (Fig. 4a ). We found a large number of MARCO-positive cells that contained staining with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a probe set (Fig 4b) . However, in many of these cells, the subcellular localization of the signal was distinct from the staining that we previously observed in SFTPC-positive AT2 cells (Fig. 4c) . In many examples, the staining within alveolar macrophages appeared to be compartmentalized within a smaller region of the cytoplasm (compared to the AT2 cells). In AT2 cells, the ORF1a virus probe set typically stained the entire cell cytoplasm and around the entire periphery of the nucleus. It is possible that in the alveolar macrophages these smaller regions of staining represent restriction of the viral RNA to a subcellular compartment such as the phagolysosome. This difference in RNA localization suggests that viral RNA enters alveolar macrophages through phagocytosis of other infected cells or infected debris, which has been suggested by others 37-39 .",

Through subcellular visualization of the RNA localization, we found that the subcellular localization of ORF1a-containing transcripts is different between AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages. This finding further supports previous studies suggesting that alveolar macrophages acquire SARS-CoV-2 RNA through phagocytosis rather than receptor mediated entry 37, 38 .

In the setting of a pandemic with a new virus, the speed of antibody development, which can take weeks to months, can present significant challenges. Furthermore, antibody development can be costly, and even after production, antibodies still require extensive validation to prove that they are correctly targeting the protein of interest. In contrast, with modern sequencing-based epidemiologic surveillance, a novel agent's genome may be available in days, and simple rules govern design of suitable hybridization probes. Thus, it is cheaper, easier, and faster to develop RNA probes using oligonucleotides. Since IHC/IF and RNA FISH target different molecules (protein vs. RNA, respectively), they also provide different and complementary information about the virus. With SARS-CoV-2, a number of studies have found viral protein staining by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry in different tissues, but have not provided sufficient evidence to confirm that there is replicating virus present [11] [12] [13] . As RNAs are more labile than proteins, one potential strength of RNA-based techniques is that they may be a more reliable readout of ongoing viral infection.",

The primary strength of RT-PCR is sensitivity as it can detect down to the scale of tens to hundreds of transcripts 41, 42 . While sensitivity makes RT-PCR very useful for diagnostics, it requires that the entire sample is combined into one tube. With RT-PCR, different cell types are mixed, subcellular localization of RNA is lost, and the global tissue architecture is also lost. Furthermore, these techniques work better on viable or fresh frozen samples, which are often limited, as most tissue banking resources largely contain FFPE specimens. Thereby, while RNA FISH HCR is unlikely to have the same sensitivity as RT-PCR, it offers direct visualization of RNA which allows for single-cell analysis to identify infected cell types, subcellular localization of different RNA transcripts, and spatial analysis of viral and cellular RNA across infected tissues.",

In the setting of a new viral threat, custom probes can be quickly designed to target the virus, only requiring knowledge of the viral sequence. Our probe design approach here ensures that the probes are specific only to the desired virus by querying sequence databases of other viruses. After designing the probe sequences, the synthesis of oligonucleotide probes is both inexpensive and fast such that the entire assay can easily be set up for a new virus in a relatively short period of time (3-5 days). As we do in this paper, RNA FISH-based probes can be designed to different RNA species generated by the virus and even used to discriminate between closely related virus strains through both bioinformatic probe design strategies and different probe conformations. Examples include this study in which we target both genomic RNAs and subgenomic mRNAs, and other studies with probes to positive and negative RNA strands 40 , different segments of the influenza genome 21, 22 , and even probes that detect single-base pair variants within the virus 22 .",

We then log-transformed the median-normalized data and used the MClust function in R to fit a two-state lognormal mixture model with unequal variance. We evaluated the model fit by an F test and selected an appropriate intensity gate that captured only the positive cells in the leftmost distribution.
