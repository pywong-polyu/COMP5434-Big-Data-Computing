            "text": "The novel SARS-CoV-2 has quickly become a global pandemic since the rst reported case in December 2019, with the virus infecting millions of people to date. The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, In uenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (\u039419-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the \u039419-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via \u039419-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the \u039419-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel enveloped single-stranded RNA virus that causes Coronavirus-disease 2019 . It is part of the Coronaviridae family and since the initial report of the virus in 2019, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. As of March 18th, 2021, there have been over 120 million con rmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2.6 million deaths, globally (WHO COVID-19 Dashboard. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2020. Available online: https://covid19.who.int/ (last cited: [03/18/21])). SARS-CoV-2 contains four types of structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope glycoprotein (E), and spike glycoprotein (S). Among these structural proteins, the S protein is highly conserved across human coronaviruses and is involved in viral attachment, fusion, and entry into cells [1] . S protein can mediate cell membrane fusion and viral entry into target cells upon binding to the host receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), following proteolytic priming by TMPRSS2 [2, 3] . The structure of S protein consists of an Nterminal ectodomain, a transmembrane anchor, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The ectodomain contains the S1 subunit, which encodes the receptor-binding domain (RBD). RBD, as well as the S2 subunit which is necessary for membrane fusion, are key potential targets for treatment and vaccination strategies against COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] . Notably, the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the S protein encodes a presumptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retention motif (known as KxHxx), which has previously been shown to enable the accumulation of SARS CoV-2 S proteins at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and facilitate their incorporation into new virions [6, 7] . ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that controls blood pressure by regulating circulatory homeostasis and vascular functions [8] . It is a type I transmembrane protein that can act as both a peptidase and a viral receptor. ACE2 is mainly expressed on the cell surface of epithelial and endothelial cells of the heart, kidney, testes, lung, and gastrointestinal tract [4] . In RAAS, ACE2 acts to convert angiotensin-2, which can lead to vasoconstriction and in ammation, into active angiotensin homologs that has vasodilating and anti-in ammatory effects [9] . Therefore, ACE2 can regulate abnormal activation of the RAAS, preventing the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure [8]. In COVID-19, ACE2 is the dominant host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [10] .",

            "text": "Of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the S protein plays a key role in the process of ACE2 receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion [11] . Cell fusion events are either cell hybrids, in which chromosomes are combined into a single nucleus, or syncytia, where distinct nuclei are maintained within a single cytoplasm and plasma membrane [12] . Homotypic cell fusion occurs between cells of the same type. Heterotypic cell fusion occurs between cells of different types [13] . To demonstrate if S protein and ACE2 interaction can lead to cell-cell fusion in different scenarios, we generated cell lines expressing either wild-type S protein or \u039419-S conjugated to EGFP and hACE2 conjugated to mCherry. In \u039419-S, the 19 amino acids from the C terminus are deleted which results in the loss of S protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Different cell lines (293T, A549, K562 and SK-Hep1) expressing either S-WT-GFP or S-\u039419-GFP have been co-cultured with cells expressing ACE2-mCherry. These cell cultures were then observed using confocal microscopy to determine if cell fusion has occurred. The key ndings in this study: 1) The interaction between S and ACE-2 can mediate cell fusion among different tissuederived cell lines. 2) Interaction between the \u039419-S variant and ACE2 show defects in nuclear fusion during syncytia formation.",

Both cells were co-cultured together in glass chamber slides. In the co-culture combinations performed, we could observe cell fusion events and larger-than-normal cells (the controls). Using confocal microscopy, we could visualize fused cells in detail with more than ten S-EGFP and hACE2-mCherry cells per sample fused with intact cell membranes and containing multiple lysed nuclei (Fig. 2) . However, in 293T-S-\u039419-GFP with 293T-ACE2-mCherry co-cultures, we observed fused cells that had individual, non-fused nucleus. This phenomenon may be explained by the deletion of the ER retention motif in S-\u039419 cells. Therefore, in S-\u039419 cells, translated S proteins are not retained in the ER, but instead tra cked to the cell surface or secreted as viral particles. Because there is no Spike protein retained in the ER, we hypothesize that there will be minimal Spike protein and hACE2 interaction juxtaposed to the ER of contacting cells and therefore no fusion of captured nuclei. However, Spike WT expressing cells have normal ER signaling retention of S proteins. Therefore, when ACE2 and S proteins are both present in a fused cell, it may lead to ER fusion which can lead to clumped or fused nuclei due to the close proximity between ER and nucleus.",
