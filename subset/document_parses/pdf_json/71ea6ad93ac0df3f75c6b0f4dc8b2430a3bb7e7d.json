Receptorbinding domain (RBD), present in S1 subunit, recognizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) peptidase domain of host cell and initiates direct binding with it, while membrane fusion is attributed to the basic elements present in S2 subunit [22] . ACE2 are considered as the target receptors of SARS-CoV -2 [23] . After binding, the host protease cleaves and activates S proteins to allow the insertion of viral fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. After that, the three pairs of heptad repeat region (HR1 and HR2) interact leading to formation of a six-helix coiled bundle, which pulls the viral membrane towards that of the host cell, leading to their fusion. This results in the entry of viral genome into the host cell [24] . Presence of 5\u02b9 methylated cap and a 3\u02b9 polyadenylated tail in viral genome permits the attachment of RNA to the ribosome of host cells for translation. Replication of viral genome and transcription of the negative-sense sub-genomic mRNA are mediated by RNA polymerase [25] . Host ribosomes translate these RNAs into structural and accessory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein-protein interactions required for virus assembly are initiated by M proteins, leading to the formation of progeny viruses which are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis [26] .",

            "text": "Computational tools have been utilized to design novel peptides capable of inhibiting the interaction between ACE2 receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and thus preventing the virus entry into host cells. A portion consisting of 23 amino acids between Glu23 and Leu45 of the ACE2 PD N-terminal region is mainly involved in their interaction with spike protein. Computation alanine scanning further shortened the peptide chain containing 23 amino acids to 18 amino acids peptide (18aa peptide) that was found to be non-toxic in comparison with mutated peptides in the in silico toxicity evaluation [22] . In another study, protein-peptide docking revealed a stronger affinity of peptides toward ACE2 over RBD. Peptides generally associate with the residue binding motif (RBM), which, in turn, facilitates their binding to ACE2. On the other hand, peptides preferentially bind the core for ACE2. Among various peptides, AVP1244 and AVP0671 at ACE2 and RBD interfaces, respectively, decrease the binding affinity to a significant extent. They are also reported to alter the orientation of binding by RBD and ACE2 binding [30] . Chimeric peptide design strategy has been utilized for the designing of novel peptides, based on the analysis of key residues interacting with SARS-CoV-2-RBD and human ACE2, as well as screening of antibacterial peptides against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Among them, peptides DBP6, AC23, AC20, and cnCoVP-1-cnCoVP-7 are expected to show potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 [31] . Badhe et al. created a series of peptides with a tendency to bind RBD of virus S protein and inhibit its binding on the ACE2 receptors. Two of the designed peptides exhibited both good RBD affinity as well as aqueous stability. However, for all the above studies, the peptides that have been designed by the in silico approach need to be synthesized and evaluated in in vitro and in vivo studies, before their use in COVID-19 therapy is proposed [32] .",

As ACE2 regulates many cellular functions including blood pressure and other cardiovascular parameters, its modulation with hrsACE2 could result in dysregulation of these key functions, leading eventually to serious side effects in patients. To overcome this, a series of peptides (22-44, 22-57, 22-44-g-351-357 and 351-357) were prepared and evaluated for their binding inhibition properties. All the synthesized peptides exhibited IC 50 values in the \u03bcM range (1-10 \u03bcM). Peptide was able to inhibit the formation of S1-ACE2 to the maximum extent (~76% reduction in binding probability) followed by peptide (~74% reduction) and ~60% for the remaining peptides, pointing at their high therapeutic potential [21] . Three short peptides (pep1c, pep1d and pep1e), based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, were designed and evaluated for their affinity to RBD of S protein. Two of these peptides (pep1c, pep1d) associate with the RBD of S protein. Dissociation constant for this binding was reported to be in nM range (<300 nM). In in vitro RBD-ACE2 interaction inhibition assay, IC50 value of 3 \u00b7 3 \u00b1 0 \u00b7 8 mM was exhibited by pep1c. This is considered to be too high for any pharmacological application.

In biodistribution studies in humanized K18 hACE2 mice, both the peptides achieved similar lung concentration after intranasal administration in the first hour, followed by longer retention of dimeric peptide in lungs after 24 h as compared to that of monomeric peptide. On intranasal administration, this dimeric peptide was found to show thorough distribution throughout the lungs. Cellular toxicity assay in primary human airway epithelial cells, exhibited minimal toxicity even after 6 days at the highest concentrations tested while at its 90% maximal inhibitory concentration any kind of toxicity was absent. The dimeric peptide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry into VeroE6 cells or VeroE6 cells overexpressing transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).

Among them, cathepsin L is reported to be critical for entry of virus into the host cells by activating the viral S protein in the endosome or lysosome [86, 87] . For optimum activity, cathepsins require acidic pH (between 4 \u00b7 5-5), such as found in the lysosome [88] . Inhibition of cathepsins L is expected to be a potential approach for the prevention of infection. A number of drugs already in the market for different indications such as clofazimine, rifampicin, saquinavir, chloroquine, astaxanthin, dexamethasone, clenbuterol, and heparin are reported to exhibit cathepsin inhibitory activity [89] . P9, a short peptide (30 amino acids) obtained from mouse \u03b2-defensin-4, showed potent and broad-spectrum activity against a number of respiratory viruses including influenza A virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This is attributed to highaffinity binding to S protein along with the presence of abundant basic amino acids in its composition, which do not allow acidification in endosomes and thus, inhibit release of viral RNA [10, 90] . In order to further improve the potency of P9, Zhao et al. developed P9R by substituting histidine and lysine that possess weak positive charge, with arginine at three positions i.e. 21, 23, and 28. This increases the net positive charge on the molecule. The developed peptide showed strong antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses, including enveloped pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), and the non-enveloped rhinovirus. Mechanistic studies revealed that P9R shows potent antiviral activity via dual mechanisms i.e. direct binding to viruses and inhibition of virus-host endosomal acidification in contrast to PA1 (only binding to viruses) and P9RS (only inhibiting endosomal acidification) [91] . Recently, dual-functional cross-linking peptide 8P9R developed from P9 and P9R has been reported to inhibit virus entry mediated by TMPRSS2 surface pathway and endocytic pathway. Moreover, 8P9R is also demonstrated to enhance the antiviral efficacy of arbidol (a spike-ACE2 fusion inhibitor) at a strength lower than its normal IC 50 [92] . However, further clinical trials are required for the assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of this combination therapy in COVID patients.",

Bioactive peptides, because of their satisfactory bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and negligible off-target activity seem to be strong candidates for mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 etiopathology at different steps of viral infection. Moreover, rapid and large-scale cost-effective synthesis (depending on peptide composition), high target specificity and better tolerability makes them an attractive alternative to small synthetic molecules. A number of peptide-based drugs have been rationally designed and few to them have been synthesized and tested in in vitro and in vivo studies. These peptides act on various processes from virus entry to replication in host such as binding to ACE2, fusion mechanism, and proteolytic activation of S protein by targeting furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsins L. However, emergence of virus mutants and reduced antibodies titers after recovery, LGKGDFR -(Continued ) [92] PCSK: Pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin enhance the probability of COVID-19 infection in healthy individuals as well as patients already recovered from this infection.

This has been attributed to a number of factors like development of viral resistance, co-infections, and the emergence of new viral strains [96] . Development of novel antiviral agents that are effective either in combination with the currently used drugs or in a stand-alone manner is, therefore, the need of the hour.",

Along with more than 100 peptide-based drugs already in the global market, a number of peptide drugs are undergoing clinical trials [11, 97] . Approval of peptide-based antiviral therapeutics for the Human immunodeficiency virus (Enfuvirtide and Maraviroc) [98] , and Hepatitis virus (Myrcludex b) [99] indicates their potential in the treatment of life-threatening viral infections. The extensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and their cellular targets resulted in rational designing and optimizing of AVP against this deadly virus. These peptides inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cells virus by targeting its binding to ACE2 or integrins, fusion mechanism as well as activation of proteolytic enzymes (cathepsin L, TMPRSS2, or furin). It is pertinent to mention here that targeting the virus entry is the most pragmatic approach for combating the infection as it does not require cell-penetration property. Moreover, it minimizes the detrimental effects of infection because it is able to inhibit the viral replication cycle in its early stages. Notably, the S-proteintargeting peptides EK1C4, SARS HRC -PEG 24 -chol (monomeric peptide), [SARS HRC -PEG 4 ] 2 -chol (dimeric peptide), LCB1, and LCB3 exhibited promising antiviral potency against SARS-CoV -2 without affecting the function of the host protein. Therefore, application of these peptides via oral, intranasal, or inhalational routes directly at the site of replication may obviate the systemic administration and therefore, the need for optimization of their properties such as tissue-penetration, plasma stability, or half-life.",
