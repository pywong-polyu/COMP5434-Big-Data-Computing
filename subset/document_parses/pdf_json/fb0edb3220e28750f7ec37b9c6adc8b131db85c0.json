            "text": "Multidomain lifestyle interventions targeted at communitydwelling older persons, such as the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) study (1) , have shown that multiple aspects of health (e.g., diet, exercise, cognitive training, and metabolic/vascular risk monitoring) are important for reducing the risk of cognitive decline. Recent guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 for reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia emphasize the need to control vascular and metabolic risk factors and lifestyle-related factors. Many of these risk factors are common to other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) (2) , and indeed, the FINGER study reported that multidomain interventions can also help to prevent or delay other negative health outcomes, including decline in physical functioning and multimorbidity over 2 years of followup (3, 4) . In light of the restrictions enforced in many counties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic to control the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we must consider if these initiatives have a short-and/or long-term effects on risk factors for NCDs and cognitive impairment, especially in older individuals. It has been hypothesized that changes in diet, levels of physical activity, cognitive and social stimulation, and access to routine NCD management may occur in some individuals during the pandemic and that this may affect their long-term health (5) , potentially altering their risk of developing NCDs in the future. Surveys conducted during the first wave of the pandemic have reported reduced physical activity, dietary changes, and disruptions to NCD care, among others, in various countries (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, as each country applied varying strategies to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, information is needed concerning how these initiatives have affected persons living in different countries. 1 Available online at: https://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/dementia/ guidelines_risk_reduction/en/ (accessed October 23, 2020).",

On 16 March 2020, the Emergency Powers Act was implemented, with decisions to suspend contact teaching; limitations to public gatherings; closure of public services such as museums, libraries, and sports facilities; ban of visitors to care institutions and hospitals; instructions to work remotely; reduction of non-acute health and social services; and further travel restrictions. A strong but not compulsory guideline for persons over 70 years of age was given in that they must refrain from contact with other persons to the extent possible (quarantine-like conditions). Some restrictions were gradually lifted during May and June 2020, including opening of, first, outdoor, and, then, indoor recreational facilities. On 23 June, the age-based strong recommendation to avoid personal contact was lifted.",

Ongoing population-based longitudinal studies can provide important insight into how the pandemic has affected the general population: first, because they provide quick access to already established research participants and, second, because they provide pre-pandemic data on individuals' health and functioning to allow for accurate measures of change. The FINGER study (1, 13) , described later, was a 2-year multidomain intervention aimed at delaying cognitive decline in community-dwelling persons aged 60-77 who were at risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. The study was initiated in 2009, and until now, participants have undergone a comprehensive follow-up evaluation to assess cognitive and health status at 2, 5, and 7 years of follow-up. A 10-year follow-up was planned in 2020 but was halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within the context of the WORLDWIDE-FINGERS-SARS-COV-2 INITIATIVE of multidomain prevention trials (14) , which is an initiative to test and adapt the FINGER intervention model in over 25 countries worldwide, we developed a postal survey to assess how COVID-19 and associated infection-control measures (such as quarantines and lockdowns) would affect participants in terms of changes in lifestyle, risk factors, social stimulation, and access to medical care. Preliminary data from the Finnish FINGER COVID-19 survey are now available.",

Specific objectives are to describe whether participants experienced a change in risk factors that are relevant for the prevention of cognitive decline, dementia, and other NCDs, including diet, physical activity, access to medical care (and, thus, opportunities for controlling vascular and metabolic risk factors), socially and cognitively stimulating activities, and emotional health and well-being.",

They underwent screening with a short neuropsychological examination with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test battery (17) and medical examination by a study physician. Participants with a CAIDE dementia risk score of 6 or higher were invited to the trial, if they were free of dementia and conditions affecting safe engagement in the intervention and had cognitive performance at average level or slightly below than expected for age. They were randomized 1:1 to multidomain lifestyle intervention or regular health advice. All participants in the multidomain intervention group received intervention in four domains: dietary counseling, exercise training, cognitive training, and management of cardiovascular and metabolic factors (13) .",

For each item, we asked if it was similar before the pandemic, decreased or increased, or not applicable/relevant to the participant. For the current analyses, no change and \"not applicable\" were merged to focus on changes experienced during the pandemic. Items for which decrease was considered a positive change (i.e., loneliness, discordance in the family, fear of violence, sleeping problem, smoking, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy snacks) were recoded to ease interpretation of results, and change in all items is categorized as no change, worsening, or improvement. 5) Changes in Engagement in Social and Cognitive Activities as a Result of the COVID-19 Pandemic or Related Infection-Control Measures Social and cognitive activities were evaluated with the same questions that we used previously in the FINGER trial (13) and included questions concerning average frequency of reading, doing crosswords, writing, games, listening or playing music, communal activities or participation in societies, studying, handicrafts, gardening, looking after children (other people's; either family or friends), and voluntary work. Frequency of engagement in those activities was measured on a 7-point Likert scale with alternatives from daily to never (daily; four to six times per week; two to three times per week; once a week; two to three times per month; a few times per year; and never). The same items and same scale were presented twice; first, the participants were advised to evaluate their life before the pandemic and then during the pandemic. For the current analyses, we defined change as transition in frequency categories between the two timepoints and categorized as any decrease, the same frequency, or any increase. Any increase in activities was considered positive, and changes in these activities are referred as no change, worsening, or improvement. 6) Changes on Self-Rated Health and Quality of Life Participants were asked to evaluate if their quality of life, physical condition, functional status, memory, or overall health had changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Options for each question included better, worse, or similar compared with prepandemic time or \"I do not know.\" Similar and not being able to say were combined in these analyses.

About three quarters of participants practiced social distancing measures, over an average of more than 9 weeks, with older participants more likely to practice total isolation than younger ones. Importantly, despite the relaxing of infection-control measures, about two thirds of participants were still practicing some social distancing measures when they sent their survey responses, mostly partial distancing. In terms of behaviors and factors that can affect cognitive decline, we found different patterns depending on the type of activity. Cognitively stimulating activities such as using the internet, doing handicrafts, and solving crosswords were largely unchanged or increased. However, attending concerts, theater, or other cultural events of participating in activities of clubs or associations decreased, as expected. In terms of diet, fruit and vegetable consumption mostly improved or remained unchanged. Leisure time physical activity was reduced for a third of the survey participants. Although most of the participants in the sample have one or more chronic health conditions; health care for chronic conditions was not hugely affected during the pandemic, with <10% missing planned health-care visits.

The results of our study suggest that, mostly, these lifestyle factors did not change dramatically in our sample during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most relevant change was a reduction in leisure time physical activity, as expected, because most sports and leisure facilities were closed. Another study in community-dwelling older adults in Japan also reported a decline in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic (6). However, it was a positive finding that many dietary aspects improved in our study population, including vegetable and fruit intake. In contrast, a study on Italian older persons with subjective cognitive deficits or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) found that they were more likely to engage in lifestyle changes that were potentially harmful to their future cognitive decline during compared with before the pandemic (20) . Approximately half of this population underwent a dietary intervention as part of the FINGER trial and may, thus, have been more aware of the risks of unhealthy diets and possibly more likely to adopt healthier dietary changes during a period when they may have been worried about ill health as a result of being indoors. Furthermore, during lockdown, people were likely to spend more time at home and may have had more time for cooking.",

Interestingly, despite the Government action to cancel non-urgent health care, a quarter of our participants had a normal medical appointment during the first wave of the pandemic. This is in contrast with studies from other countries that report significant disruptions to non-acute, routine NCD care during the first wave of the pandemic (9, 10). However, the restrictions in Finland were gradually lifted in May-June, and there is a possibility that these appointments were postponed, although completed by the time of the questionnaire. A study from the Netherlands identified patients who are at risk of adverse outcomes of the corona measures, that is, discontinued care, social isolation, psychological, and behavioral problem (21) . The survey revealed some important results on social distancing. Although the Finnish Government made strong recommendations for social distancing, they did not enforce any rules. About 75% of participants practiced social distancing measures over an average of more than 9 weeks, which suggests that this sample was quite compliant with Government recommendations. Importantly, despite a relaxing of infection-control measures occurring in the summer, about two thirds of participants were still practicing some social distancing measures when they sent their survey responses (most persons returned their surveys in June-July).",

Similarly, although a quarter of people experienced less closeness with others, 14% had a positive change. This reflects how individual experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic can vary greatly. It will be interesting to establish which factors affect an individual's emotional response. For example, the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study reported that women; younger participants; and those who were single, widowed or divorced reported more feelings of loneliness and poor sleep, while those living alone were more likely to indicate poorer changes in depression and/or anxiety symptoms (24) . Differences in levels of cognitive impairment are likely to also cause differences.

It could be expected that everyday lives of older people, who are no longer working, are less affected by the pandemic than persons who are of working age and may tend to move outside their home more and engage more in activities with other people. However, restrictions in meeting family and friends may be more difficult to manage for older people, especially those living alone.

            "text": "The strengths of our study are that we conducted a survey in an already established research cohort, with a large sample, using a questionnaire designed within the World-Wide FINGERS Network (14) , to allow future international comparisons. Response rate was high (71%), and the pre-pandemic data from previous waves of the FINGER project (since 2009) will allow for us to evaluate objective changes in health and lifestyle status in the future. However, the data are preliminary. Currently, we only have access to self-reported behavior change, whereas in the future, we will be able to compare with participants' previous comprehensive data from FINGER project. However, no other ethically acceptable alternatives than self-reports were available at the moment of the survey to avoid risk of infection of participants or staff via face-to-face interviews. The generalization of our results may be limited. First, there were some differences in respondents; those who sent back responses were younger and more likely to be living with someone. Second, the FINGER participants were originally selected due to their age and risk of developing cognitive impairment, and therefore, our results are only generalizable to this group of adults. There is also a potential selection bias because almost half the participants were part of the original FINGER intervention group, and therefore, they may be more aware of the importance of risk factor control and less likely to engage in negative health behaviors than other populations, even during the pandemic. Another potential limitation is that our survey was sent out to participants in June 2020, at the end of the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were asked to respond in terms of their behavior during the first wave of the pandemic, and therefore, their responses may have been less accurate because they had to recall their behaviors. Further, it is possible that behaviors may have changed over the period; some people may have been more active or engaged in more health behaviors in the beginning or vice versa. Therefore, we aimed to assess an overall change in behavior before and during the pandemic. Finally, we used simple statistical methods for comparing age groups and those living alone vs. not living alone, without adjusting for other covariates. These are preliminary descriptive data of the cohort, and we will later be able to combine these data with data collected from earlier FINGER follow-ups and also adjust for more covariates.",

Further, although we did not find many cancellations in routine NCD health-care appointments, it has been highlighted that changes in routine medical care, especially in older persons, will have a significant effect on risk factor management, potentially increasing risk of future NCDs and affecting mortality due to delays in diagnosis (26) . Further, research into changes in lifestyle risk factors as a result of the pandemic are important, not only because these risk factors are relevant for NCDs but also because they can play a role in viral infections and viruses such as COVID-19.

Therefore, it is imperative to understand how infection-control measures will affect lifestyle behaviors and NCD risk factors, and how to manage these in the short and long term. Future comparisons of country-specific policies and infection-control measures are therefore imperative to understand how people behave as a result of different measures. Indeed, it is interesting that the majority of participants in the current study practiced social distancing, despite no enforcement of recommendations by the Finnish Authorities. A recent Eurobarometer released in October 2020 suggested that Finnish people were one of the European nationalities that were more likely to report finding it easier to cope with confinement measures than other European countries 7 .
