A primary mechanism may relate to quantitative and qualitative disruption of tumor suppressor proteins such as pRb. It was shown that SARS-CoV-1 Endoribonuclease Nsp15 both downregulates and impairs pRb function, and promotes its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [6] . The same authors have demonstrated these changes favor cellular proliferation due to loss of cell-cell contact inhibition. While these data are yet to be replicated for SARS-CoV-2, the structure of NSP15 endonuclease is highly conserved as it shares 88% homology and identical quaternary structure to that of SARS-CoV-1 [7] . Thus, similar effects of SARS-CoV-2 NSP15 endonuclease on pRb are expected. Concomitantly, destruction of p53 tumor suppressor protein seems to be promoted by SARS-CoV-1 [8] . While this has yet to be shown in SARS-CoV-2, it could prove to be an additional contribution towards carcinogenic risk.",

            "text": "Another mechanism that may lead to carcinogenesis is oxidative stress. One of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be viral internalization through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This carboxypeptidase is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, promoting conversion of angiotensin II into angiotensin-1,7. This offers ACE2 an anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-oxidative role. When bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, ACE2 is internalized but not activated. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 binding may deplete ACE2 on cellular surface, contributing towards an imbalance that favors the pro-inflammatory and oxidative action of angiotensin II [9] . It is also believed that the macrophage might be an important player in acute COVID-19 [10] , through significant cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Indeed, inflammatory response, cytokine storm and oxidative stress may be the cause of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, rather than direct viral cytopathic damage. A third source of ROS may come from treatment, as high tidal volumes and FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation are associated with increased oxidative damage in lung tissue [11] .",

While much is still unknown regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, empirical indication for reinfection/reactivations and evidence for persistent infection due to closely related viruses raise the hypothesis of possible long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the most relevant, based on pathophysiological knowledge, is the risk for malignant neoplasms that may become a public health concern in the coming decades. Further investigation is needed to clarify this risk. It will also be important to monitor \"cured\" patients for possible viral reactivation. Serial RT-PCR could be offered to a cohort of patients over time to clearly determine if persistent SARS-CoV-2 is indeed possible and the frequency of this phenomenon. Additionally, in vitro and animal studies for direct mutagenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 should be carried, but interpretation must be cautious, as much of DNA damage comes from sustained immune response. Looking into the natural hosts of closely related zoonotic Coronaviridae may also shed some light into this matter. While definite answers are not available, patients affected by COVID-19 should maintain long-term follow-up as the possibility for late complications cannot be yet excluded.",
