Three time spans were defined: the last 10 min before helicopter take-off (Tref ), time spent airborne (Tair), and the first 10 min after landing (Tground). Tref served as reference for Tair and Tground. Our longitudinal study has the distinguishing feature that the physiological variables are measured numerous times on each patient. To account for the within-subject correlation of repeated measurements, we used generalized linear mixed-effects models. Such a model allows to analyse the effect of time span on the physiological response variables. Critical thresholds were defined for MAP, SpO 2 and HR [3, 4] .",

Fig. 1 Box-and-whisker plots for the measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), heart rate (HR) and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (P ET CO 2 ) obtained at 1-min intervals. Each box presents measurements averaged per patient over a 5-min time block. Three consecutive time spans used for statistical analysis are shown: the reference 10 min just before take-off (Tref ), the time span when patients are airborne (Tair), and the first 10 min after landing (Tground). The number of patients (N) per 5-min time block declines with increasing time on board. Note that there is no time gap between Tref and Tair or between Tair and Tground. A box represents the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile, while a cross within the box is the mean. Whiskers denote the 5th and 95th percentiles. Outliers are plotted as individual points. If N < 5, only individual values and their median are plotted. N = 1 for the last time block in Tair (#20) of only 2 min. The horizontal dashed lines are the thresholds used to analyze the occurrences of MAP < 65 mmHg, SpO 2 < 90%, and HF < 50 beats min \u22121 or HR > 120 beats min \u22121 In conclusion, being airborne aboard a helicopter had minimal and clinically irrelevant impact on the physiological variables, compared with the reference period prior to take-off. Noteworthy, a simulation study showed that variations in invasive blood pressure readings during accelerations or decelerations can be artifacts resulting from inevitable physical phenomena [5] . The time courses of physiological variables and absence of complications suggest that helicopter transport can contribute to safe inter-hospital transfers of ventilated COVID-19 patients. Although we cannot exclude that sicker patients may have been triaged away from air transport, our findings may be of relevance in deciding how to transport critically ill patients.",
