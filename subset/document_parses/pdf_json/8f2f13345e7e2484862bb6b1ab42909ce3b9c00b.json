METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the date of inception until May 2019. RCTs were eligible if they used OC therapy on VLBW infants. The primary outcomes included ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), late-onset sepsis, and death.

RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 682 patients (OC group: 332; non-OC group: 350) were included in the meta-analysis.

[12] [13] [14] Recent studies on oral and pharyngeal colostrum administration in preterm infants have revealed a rise in the number of immune components in preterm infants. Based on this evidence, NICUs have begun colostrum therapy for premature infants to further enhance immune protection. 15, 16 Oropharyngeal colostrum (OC) is a novel feeding strategy to prevent complications of prematurity. Previous studies revealed that the OC procedure is easy to implement and does not require enteral feeding. 16 The breast milk required is small in amount for the baby to swallow. A small amount of milk (usually 0.2 mL divided into two cheeks) is placed on the mucous membrane of the mouth for absorption. Sterile cotton swabs or oral applicators are used for each application of human milk. 17 Colostrum contacts the mouth and oropharyngeal pouch and produces immune protection and stimulation of oropharyngeal receptors by the abundant anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines detected in the mother's colostrum and milk. Gastrointestinal movement, secretion, and absorption capacity are enhanced. 18 Previous studies have suggested that OC can effectively increase the immune factors of premature infants and has major implications for preventing complications of prematurity.

It is generally known that the occurrence of VAP in premature infants is largely attributed to the immaturity of the immune system. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of the risk factors for VAP in neonates reported that low birth weight, prematurity, and parenteral nutrition were independent risk factors for VAP development. 7 The major findings of our meta-analysis evidenced the protective factors of oral colostrum against the development of VAP. There are many risk factors affecting the occurrence of VAP, among which one of the most important factors is the duration of mechanical ventilation. 7 We summarized the baseline risk for VAP in Table 1 , and the baselines of mechanical ventilation in the intervention and control groups were consistent. As an outcome indicator, Abd-Elgawad's study 22 showed that colostrum could significantly shorten the length of mechanical ventilation, which indirectly proved our point. Although we would like to extract more data on mechanical ventilation for deeper discussion, the lack of raw data in the article is our main difficulty, and it appears that most articles have not shifted their focus to the benefits of oral colostrum in premature infants with mechanical ventilation. Thibeau's study, 15 which we excluded because it is a retrospective study, directly investigated human milk and mechanical ventilation-related pneumonia, and there were no statistically significant differences.

Although the incidence of NEC was not statistically significant in the eight articles included, it was observed that the intervention group had a slight downward trend in each study, which may also be the reason for our potential statistical significance.

This reveals that the stimulating effect of colostrum on lactoferrin is not persistent.

Second, colostrum contact between the oropharyngeal mucosa and this fluid may have immunomodulatory effects resulting in a decrease in inflammation. The nonstatistical significance of colostrum administration for sepsis may indicate that colostrum has an upregulating effect on the immune function of newborns, but may overexaggerate the downregulatory ability of inflammation. In this regard, colostrum administration may facilitate the prevention of VAP. Although we just found that OC was associated with a trend toward downregulating proven sepsis, we believe that low birth weight infants with proven sepsis may benefit from OC, so we hope that future studies will pay more attention to this part of the population and finally obtain a more certain answer. It was found that OC administration significantly reduced the time to reach full enteral feeding, which agrees with five studies. 22, 24, 27, 29 Such a finding is of great implication, since it shows that early enteral feeding of breast milk has a long-term beneficial effect on intestinal atrophy, lowering the risk of local inflammation, feeding intolerance, NEC, and hospital infection. 16 Accordingly, colostrum administration to preterm infants who cannot be fed intestinally may be a potential immunotherapy for VLBW infants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 238, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 645, "end": 647, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 700, "end": 702, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 806, "end": 808, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 823, "end": 825, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 837, "end": 839, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1357, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1376, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1393, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1407, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1426, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1442, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1473, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1489, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1511, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1530, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1546, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1563, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1580, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1594, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1610, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2597, "end": 2600, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2604, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2608, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2611, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2857, "end": 2859, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1073, "end": 1079, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In addition, we need to attach importance to the feeding type, breast milk consumption, and duration of breastmilk feeding.
