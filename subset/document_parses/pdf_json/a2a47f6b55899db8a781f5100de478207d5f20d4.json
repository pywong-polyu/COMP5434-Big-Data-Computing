Thus, the impact on the eligibility of those models from a statistical and economic point of view. Especially for the models used in the peer-to-peer lending platforms, since their rejection rate is extremely high. The method of inferring rejected applicants information in the process of construction of the credit scoring models is known as reject inference. This study proposes a semisupervised learning framework based on hidden Markov models (SSHMM), as a novel method of reject inference. Real data from the Lending Club platform, the most used online lending marketplace in the United States as well as the rest of the world, is used to experiment the effectiveness of our method over existing approaches. The results of this study clearly illustrate the proposed method's superiority, stability, and adaptability.",

            "text": "Fintech is emerging rapidly worldwide. Despite the economic shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, global Fin-tech investments remained strong, with over $ 25.6 billion in the first half of 2020 (https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/02/pulse-offintech-archive.html). The pandemic has significantly accelerated digital trends and the demand for digital platforms such as digital banking, peer-to-peer lending platforms and other fintech-related services. The peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) online platforms (https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action ), allows borrowers to obtain loans directly from other people. For lenders, it is an alternative to lend customers without going through banks and credit organizations which are very demanding in terms of guarantees and expensive in terms of bank transaction charges. Despite its many advantages, P2P lending is associated with a high level of risk for lenders. As a result, credit scoring systems are commonly used by P2P lending platforms to evaluate potential borrowers. This is generally done by building models using only data from previous accepted applicants without taking into account the applicants who have been rejected. As a result the credit scoring models are biased (B\u00fccker et al. 2013) , as well as statistical and economic consequences (Chen and Astebro 2001; Marshall et al. 2010) . Reject inference as a method of inferring the credit worthiness status of the rejected applications, has raised a lot of interest in the P2P lending domain, where rejection rate is extremely high. For example, between June 2007 and December 2018, Lending Club P2P lending platform (https://www.lendingclub.com/ info/download-data.action ), accepted 2;260;701 loans and rejected 27;648;741 loans. As a result, only 8% of loans are issued by the platform. The majority of reject inference methods uses statistical techniques. However, semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are in growing use in this research topic (see Table 1 ). This study proposes a semi-supervised hidden Markov model (SSHMM) as a novel method to evaluate the usage of semi-supervised machine learning for reject inference in credit scoring. We compare the performance of the SSHMM model with a set of state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning algorithms used for reject inference. In addition, supervised machine learning models are used to evaluate the performance gain of reject inference. Finlay, by sampling the rejected data set to generate several samples with varied rejection rates, we conduct a full-sensitivity study on reject inference. The following is a breakdown of the paper's structure. Section 2 discusses related work on credit scoring and reject inference strategies, followed by Sect. 3's discussion of HMM models and introduction to the proposed SSHMM model. Section 4 summarizes the data, experiments sets up, and discusses the major findings. Finally, we give the primary conclusion as well as some suggestions for further research.",

As a result, estimating p(y | x) is an important part of any credit rating process. Generally , the two types of standard credit scoring models, statistical and machine learning based models (Siddiqi 2017; Lessmann et al. 2015) , uses only the information on loan records of accepted applicants. The reject inference process of inferring the good or bad loan performance of rejected applicants in the construction of credit scoring models, have been explored as a missing data problem and categorized into three types (Feelders 1999) , based on the modelling of p(z | x, y), where z is a binary variable which indicates if the applicant has benefited from a credit (his request has been accepted) or the customer has not benefited from a credit (his request has been refused):",

In this situation, applicants are approved or denied independently of their loan records or personal information, implying that applicants' good or bad behaviour is independent of applicant characteristics x and class y. It basically means that platforms or financial institutions choose whether or not to accept applicants at random, without considering their characteristics or repayment history. As a result, under the MCAR condition, there is no selection mechanism, and thus no sample bias in the lending process. The way platforms and financial institutions handle loan applications is totally inconsistent with this mechanism. As a result, in credit scoring models, it is always disregarded.",

The most common statistical methods used in early reject inference studies are augmentation and extrapolation (Banasik et al. 2003; Anderson 2007) . In augmentation, the weights of accepted loan applications are increased by augmenting them. In extrapolation the creditscoring model is initially built based solely on accepted applications, then predicts the classes of rejected applications before creating a new credit-scoring model based on both samples. However, according to relevant research, augmentation and extrapolation methods do not increase the performance of credit scoring models in most circumstances when compared to the original credit-scoring model trained with solely accepted loans (Banasik and Crook 2007; Crook and Banasik 2004) . Survival analysis techniques (Sohn andShin 2006) are another extensively used approach to reject inference. However they have only been found to be of use if there are a majority of rejected applications (Banasik and Crook 2010) .",

Only the aforementioned characteristics shared by accepted and rejected applicants are used in this study. Although the rejected data sets features provide a lot of information about applicants' creditworthiness, if only the six characteristics were used to build the credit scoring model, some important information might have been missed. Only loans with a completely paid or defaulted status were considered, and records with missing values or obvious errors were removed.

Using a semisupervised modified HMM model, this study offers a novel approach to the problem. The SSHMM model outperforms other models in terms of applicability, stability, and performance when tested on real P2P lending data. More crucially, by using the prospective information of rejected candidates, the prediction performance of the underlying HMM classifier has improved using the suggested framework. We can look into the following directions for future research. First, because the Baum-Welch algorithm is recognized to convergence towards local optimums, we can use different algorithms to estimate HMM parameters (El annas et al. 2022) . Second, we can consider building an ensemble method incorporating the existing machine learning methods together with SSHMM to do the reject inference.",
