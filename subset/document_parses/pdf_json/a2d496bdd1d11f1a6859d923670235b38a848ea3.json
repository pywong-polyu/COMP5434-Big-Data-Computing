Methods: This was a pragmatic, historically controlled study in 3 nursing homes (181 total beds) in Melbourne, Australia. Results: The number of PCR tests of respiratory specimens (over 12 months) increased from 5 to 67 when nurses could initiate the tests. Residents with RTI symptoms had a virus identified by PCR in 50.7% of tests, including 14 positive for influenza. Six outbreaks were identified.

However, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and possibly rhinoviruses can all cause serious lower RTIs in older adults. [2] [3] [4] [5] A 2013 study of pneumonia in hospitalized nursing home residents identified 50 viruses in 108 episodes of pneumonia. 6 Despite these findings, to date, there have been no etiologic studies using sophisticated techniques such as nucleic acid amplification (ie, polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ) testing in residents with RTI who may be safely treated in nursing home settings by general practitioners (GPs) and nurses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 553, "end": 556, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 557, "end": 560, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 561, "end": 564, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 855, "end": 860, "text": "[PCR]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Antibiotics may be beneficial for bacterial infections but are unlikely to provide any benefit to nursing home residents with viral infections.

Recent guidelines for AMS in longterm care facilities from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America promote the need to design AMS activities to impact on prescribing for specific infections, such as RTIs. 17 PCR testing of respiratory specimens can be utilized to test for the presence of viral and bacterial RTI pathogens, when clinically indicated. 18 In Australia, PCR tests performed on nose and throat specimens are recommended by Therapeutic guidelines: antibiotic 19 for the assessment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and pneumonia in residents of high-level care nursing homes and in the presence of influenza-like illness. Evidence suggests that, for RTIs, investigations such as PCR testing are infrequently initiated by GPs who provide services to Australian nursing homes. 20 As such, it is important to encourage testing for suspected RTI pathogens prior to prescribing antibiotics. Empowering the nursing workforce to recognize when respiratory testing is appropriate and to initiate specimen collection may be an efficient mechanism in nursing homes when offsite GPs are unavailable or do not have responsibility for infection prevention oversight.
