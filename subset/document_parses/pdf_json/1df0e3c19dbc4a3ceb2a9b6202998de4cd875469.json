In this study, an essential enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), is targeted in a virtual screening assay using a set of 1,664 FDA-approved drugs, including sets of botanical and synthetic derivatives. A set of 22 drugs showed a high docking score of >\u22127. Notably, approximately one-third of the top hits were either from natural products or biological molecules. The FDA-approved phytochemicals were sennosides, digoxin, asiaticoside, glycyrrhizin, neohesperidin, taxifolin, quercetin and aloin. These approved natural products and phytochemicals are used as general tonics, antioxidants, cell protectives, and immune stimulants (nadid, thymopentin, asiaticoside, glycyrrhizin) and in other miscellaneous systemic or topical applications. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on standard precision and extra precision docking, two-step molecular dynamics simulations, binding energy calculations and a post dynamics analysis. The results reveal that two drugs, docetaxel and neohesperidin, showed strong binding profiles with SARS CoV-2 RdRP. These results can be used as a primer for further drug discovery studies in the treatment of COVID-19. This initiative repurposes safe FDA-approved drugs against COVID-19 RdRP, providing a rapid channel for the discovery and application of new anti-CoV therapeutics.",

The four structural proteins include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (Shi et al., 2015) . Approximately 14-16 nonstructural proteins are encoded at the 5\u2032-terminal of the polyprotein. The proteins are essential for virus replication, mRNA synthesis, and processing of viral proteins (Brian & Baric, 2005) . Coronaviruses have recently evolved from a causative agent of mild respiratory symptoms to severely pathogenic forms. Three major pathogenic and fatal CoVs have emerged in the last two decades: SARS CoV, MERS CoV, and lastly, SARS-CoV-2 (Guarner, 2020) .",

The assessment of docking protocol was confirmed by docking of remdesivir monophosphate (RMP). The redocked pose was compared with the co-crystalized ligand (Fig. 1) . It is was evident that the presence of magnesium ions increased the docking scores of RMP in both of the standard precision and extra-precision docking. In the absence of magnesium ions, the SP and XP docking scores of RMP were \u22128.9 and \u22129.7, respectively. These scores was decreased by about 15% in the absence of magnesium ions. In contrast, the docked ligands from the FDA approved drugs dataset showed higher scores in the absence of magnesium ions. This might be attributed to the favorable interaction of magnesium ions with the phosphorylated substrates. Table 1 shows the 26 compounds with the highest docking scores, which were \u22127 or higher.

It was noticeable that the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the docked ligands with the active is affected by the presence of magnesium ions. While metal coordinates is evident with the docked poses, this was underscored by lower hydrogen bonds interactions (Fig. 2) . This might contributed to the observed lower docking scores in structures containing magnesium. Statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the docking score and the hydrogen bond, lipophilic interaction, and ligand efficiency scores (p < 0.001; Table 2 ). There was a negative low but significant correlation between the obtained docking scores and the molecular weights of the compounds. This explains the superior docking scores of the selected set of drugs over the standard inhibitor remdesivir, which involved the lower molecular weights and improved hydrogen bonding and lipophilic interactions.",

The estimated MM/GBSA binding energies were \u221267.273 and \u221263.669 for docetaxel and neohesperidin, respectively. These values imply superior binding for both of the compounds.
