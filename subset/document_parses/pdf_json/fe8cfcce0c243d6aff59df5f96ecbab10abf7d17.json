Recent data challenge the appropriateness of providing standard amounts of calories and protein during acute critical illness. Restricting calorie and protein intakes seemed beneficial, suggesting a role for metabolic pathways such as autophagy, a potential key mechanism in safeguarding cellular integrity, notably in the muscle, during critical illness. However, the optimal calorie and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. NUTRIREA-3 will be the first trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding. We hypothesised that nutritional support with calorie and protein restriction during acute critical illness decreased day 90 mortality and/or dependency on intensive care unit (ICU) management in mechanically ventilated patients receiving vasoactive amine therapy for shock, compared with standard calorie and protein targets.",

We will include 3044 patients in 61 French ICUs. Two primary end-points will be evaluated: day 90 mortality and time to ICU discharge readiness. The trial will be considered positive if significant between-group differences are found for one or both alternative primary endpoints. Secondary outcomes include hospital-acquired infections and nutritional, clinical and functional outcomes. Ethics and dissemination The NUTRIREA-3 study has been approved by the appropriate ethics committee. Patients are included after informed consent.

            "text": "Severe critical illness is associated during the acute phase with anorexia, metabolic disorders, endocrine dysfunction and a major catabolic response responsible for severe skeletal and diaphragmatic muscle wasting. 1 Among critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and catecholamines for shock, nearly 40%-50% die, and functional recovery is often delayed in survivors. 2 Nutritional support is crucial, as malnutrition is associated with poor outcomes. Prescribing nutritional support in the critically ill is the result of a complex decision-making process designed to optimise three key parameters: the timing, the dose and the route of artificial feeding. International guidelines encourage early nutritional support (\u226448 hours after admission), via the enteral route if not contraindicated, with 20-25 kcal/kg/day, and 1.2-2 g/ kg/day protein at the acute phase. 3 4 These targets are rarely achieved in patients with severe critical illnesses, who frequently experience gastroparesis responsible for intolerance to enteral nutrition (EN). 5 Observational studies have indicated that calorie and protein deficiencies were associated with nosocomial infections, intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness, delayed weaning off MV, longer stays and higher mortality. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] However, recent data challenge the appropriateness of providing standard amounts of calories and protein during the acute phase of critical illness. 13 14 Studies showed no outcome benefits with higher intakes. 15 16 Instead, adding parenteral nutrition (PN) to increase intakes was associated with longer ICU stays and more infectious complications. 17 18 Higher protein intakes during the acute phase may be associated with greater muscle wasting and ICUacquired weakness. 1 19 Restricting calorie and protein intakes seemed beneficial, suggesting a role for metabolic pathways such as autophagy, a potential key mechanism in safeguarding cellular integrity, notably in the muscle, during critical illness. 20 21 The recent EDEN and PERMIT trials showed no differences in patient outcomes between hypocaloric and standard feeding. [22] [23] [24] However, in both studies, calorie intakes were below-target in the standard groups. Moreover, patients in both PERMIT trial groups received similar protein intakes, as protein solutions were added in the hypocaloric group. Last, the TARGET trial demonstrated no benefit of delivering 100% vs 70% of the recommended calorie intake on outcomes of critically ill patients. 25 Thus, the optimal calorie and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. 14 26-29 We designed the NUTRIREA-3 trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding in a well-defined group of severely ill ICU patients requiring at least MV and vasoactive drugs. These patients typically have poor outcomes with long ICU stays, high frequencies of ICUacquired weakness and infections, and high mortality. 1 30 Reported impacts of nutritional support were greatest in the most severely ill ICU patients. 3 4 31 32 Our hypothesis is that, in those severe critically ill patients, low-calorie low-protein feeding at the early phase of critical illness improves muscle preservation, thereby improving outcomes, and most notably diminishing mortality and dependency on ICU care.",

First, treatment with a prokinetic agent is initiated after confirmation that there are no contraindications. The study ICUs use the prokinetic agent of their choice, according to their standard practice. The prokinetic agent is discontinued when EN at the highest prescribed flow rate has been well tolerated for 48 hours. Second, if gastric intolerance persists despite prokinetic therapy, the flow rate is decreased by 25 mL/hour every 6 hours until the signs of intolerance resolve. Therefore, EN is stopped (and the gastric tube placed under suction) only in patients with intolerance despite a flow rate \u226425 mL/hour. All interruptions in EN delivery must be reported to the physician in charge of the patient. This precaution is particularly important in patients receiving insulin. EN is resumed at the prescribed flow rate (appropriate to the patient's needs) after 6 hours have elapsed with no further signs of intolerance. Patients at high risk for gastric intolerance, such as those turned in the prone position for acute respiratory distress syndrome, receive prophylactic prokinetic treatment starting at the first turn in the prone position. 36 37 Parenteral nutrition Ternary admixtures packaged in bags and containing the three groups of macronutrients are used according to standard practice in each participating centre.
