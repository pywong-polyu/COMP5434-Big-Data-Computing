Potentially high-risk procedures include noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), both continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as well as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), high-flow oxygen therapy, nebulized medications and pre-oxygenation for endotracheal intubation. 1 Although fully enclosed NIPPV hoods are commercially available they have not been widely used in the United States.",

Endotracheal intubation is generally performed in minutes with the intubating clinician at highest risk. NIPPV may be needed for hours and potentially days, with physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other staff at risk throughout.",

The goal of the device is to provide an additional layer of personal protection for front-line healthcare workers caring for the high volume of patients with acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19.",

Experience with the \"aerosol barrier hood\" in our emergency department has suggested that the hood is well tolerated by patients requiring NIPPV and nebulized medications. Additionally, the large plastic enclosure allows easy access to the patient for routine care during these procedures (Figure 2 ). Our anecdotal experience, although positive, has not been validated and the hood should be considered an adjunct to standard PPE. There has been strong support from nursing and ancillary staff members.",
