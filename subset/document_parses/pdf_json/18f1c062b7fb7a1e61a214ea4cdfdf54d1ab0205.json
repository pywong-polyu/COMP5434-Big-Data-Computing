In addition, the virus dynamic in the host -including the time-to-peak and the final monotonically decreasing behavior -is chracterized as a function of the treatment initial time. Simulation results, based on nine real patient data, show the potential clinical benefits of a treatment classification according to patient critical parameters.

Section 2 proposes a general three-states \"in host\" model to represent COVID-19 infection dynamic and formalizes the concept of virus spreadability. Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium sets of the system, and its asymptotic stability, for the untreated case (i.e., when no pharmacodynamic is considered), considering the system from the infection time t = 0. Then, in Section 4, the pharmacodynamic of antivirals is included, to analyze their effectiveness to avoid the virus to spread in the host. Both, the inhibition effect on the replication rate of the virus and the inhibition effect on the infection rate of healthy cells are studied. In Section 6, the results of Section 4 are extensively demonstrated by simulating different treatments scenarios for nine patients from the literature. Finally, Section 7 gives the discussion of the work, while several mathematical formalism -necessary to support the main results of article -are given in Appendix 8.",

Basic models usually include the cells the pathogen infects, the pathogen particles, and their life cycle [25] and, opposite to one can expect, they vary little in its structure from one infectious disease to another. Indeed, the well known target cell-limited models (i.e., models that incorporate the immune response just as a parameter) was successfully used to represent and control HIV [26, 27, 20] , influenza [28, 16, 29, 30] , Ebola [18] and dengue [31, 32] , among others. A main distinction between target cell models can be done according to the virus life cycle [25] : chronic infection models (long-lived and persistent virus in comparison with cells life cycle) include production and death rates of healthy/susceptible cells, while acute infection models (shortlived virus) only consider the clearance of susceptible cells produced by the infection. This latter -which was firstly introduced in [16] for the influenza -is used to describe the COVID-19, as it is detailed next.",

The parameter \u03b2 (mLday \u22121 /copies) is the infection rate, \u03b4 (day \u22121 ) is the death rates of I, p ((copies)/(cellmL)day \u22121 ) is the viral replication, and c (day \u22121 ) is the viral clearance rate. The effects of immune responses are not explicitly described in this model, but they are implicitly included in the death rate of infected cells (\u03b4) and the clearance rate of virus (c) [16] . System (2.1) is positive, which means that U (t) \u2265 0, I(t) \u2265 0 and V (t) \u2265 0, for all t \u2265 0. We denote x(t) := (U (t), I(t), V (t)) the state vector, and value V 0 at t = 0 (formally, V (t) has a discontinuity of the first kind at t 0 , i.e., lim t\u21920 \u2212 V (t) = 0 while lim t\u21920 + V (t) = V 0 > 0). This way, for the time after the infection, the virus may spread or being clear depending on its infection effectiveness. To properly determine what such a spread means, the following (mathematical) definition is given Definition 1 (Spreadability of the virus in the host). Consider system (2.1) , constrained by the positive set X, with V (t) = 0, I(t) = 0, and U (t) = U 0 > 0, for t < 0. Consider also that at time t = 0, V (t) jumps from 0 to a small positive value V 0 . Then, it is said that the virus spreads (in some degree) in the host for t \u2265 0 ifV (t) > 0 for some t > 0. If the virus does not spread in the host, it is said that it is cleared for t \u2265 0.",

On the other hand, the virus is cleared for t \u2265 0 if V (t) is strictly decreasing for all t > 0, which means that V (t) has neither local minima nor local maxima at any t > 0 (latter on it is stated that V (t) has at most one minimum and one maximum). An infectious disease can be related to the virus peak and/or the period of permanence of the virus in the host [18] , and both effects are related to an increase of the virus load at some time after the infection. This is the reason why the spreadability is defined based on the virus positive derivative. A second reason supporting Definition 1 is its use in the determination of antiviral effectiveness (Section 4). Antivirals able to clear the virus can be considered effective.",

Antivirals have the potential to inhibit the virus replication, reducing the advance of the infection over the target cells of infected host (i.e.: epithelial cells in the respiratory tract for H1N1 [16] ). Several antivirals are being tested for COVID-19 treatment, with different results concerning both, their inhibition effect on the virus replication and their toxicity. Among them, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Umifenovir, Chloroquine, Oseltamivir, etc. [36, 10, 37, 38, 39] can be mentioned. The antiviral effect can be modeled as a reduction of the virus infectivity in the presence of inhibitors (by reducing the infection rate \u03b2) and/or as a reduction in the replication of infectious virions (by reducing the replication rate p) [4, 15] . In any case, the effectiveness of a treatment is limited and depends on the patient parameters (which in turn depends on his/her clinical state). Next, two different inhibition effects \u03b7 \u03b2 (t) and \u03b7 p (t) are considered, one affecting the infection rate \u03b2 and the other affecting the replication rate p.

The effect of \u03b1(t tr ) may be significant only for t tr close tot V and, in such case, the viral dynamic can be slightly different from the one prescribed by Theorem 4.1 (and Lemma 1). Remark 6. Item (iii) of Theorem 4.1 establishes just the existence of t e >\u0165 V such that for treatments starting at t tr \u2208 (\u0165 V , t e ], the new virus peak time is larger than the one corresponding to the untreated case, i.e.,t V,tr >t V . However, it should be noted that for parameters coming from real patient data, (the maximal) t e is indeed close tot V . This means that the time period where treatments can be ineffective is in most of the cases similar to (\u0165 V ,t V ), i.e., similar to the time period where the virus is growing. Figures in Section 6 confirm this fact.",

Since the minimization of 5.1 implies a nonlinear optimization problem, with highly dependence on initial conditions, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm [43, 24] is employed as a global optimization algorithm, which has shown to be robust to initial guesses of parameters [44] . Even though it is still debatable which compartments SARS-CoV-2 can infect, there is a common agreement that the viral shedding take places mainly in the respiratory epithelial cells (due to the high expression of ACE2) with direct viral toxicity of the infected cells [45] . Therefore, following previous works of mathematical modelling for influenza infection in humans, the value of U 0 is taken as about 4 \u00d7 10 8 cells for all patients [16] . Furthermore, I 0 is assumed to be 0 and V 0 was estimated (using a regression model, since the viral at the day of infection was not provided) [12] to be about 0.31 Copies/mL. Moreover, in order to avoid identifiability problems related with the fact that only viral titters are used to fit the model, the viral clearance parameter (c) was set in 2.4 1/day, which is in accordance with previous estimates for influenza and HIV [46, 16] . The parameters and initial condition (at the time of infection t = 0) of each patient are collected in Table 1 . Since the viral load was measured after the onset of the symptoms, an incubation period of 7 days post infection (dpo) was assumed for the time of infection, according to [12] . The time evolution of U , I and V is shown in Figure 5 , for each patient. As it can be seen, the plot confirms the results in Theorem 3.2 concerning the minimum and maximum times of V , the maximum time of I and the time when U reaches U c (i.e., when R(t) reaches 1). Table 2 , for the nine simulated patients. Figure 5 : U ,I,V time evolution for the untreated case. As stated in Theorem 3.2,\u0165V <tI < tc <tV , where\u0165V andtV are the times at which V (t) reaches a local minimum and a local maximum, respectively,tI is the time at which I(t) reaches a local maximum, and tc is the time at which U (t) reaches Uc. Furthermore, as stated in Remark 4,\u0165V \u2248 0 andtI \u2248 tc \u2248tV . V undet = 50 (Copies/mL) stands for the undetectable level of the virus load. [47] . However, observation of viral load in infected macaques [48, 49] denotes that the viral peak from nose and throat swabs happens during the 1-3 days post infection. Therefore, since the target cell model fitting was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 viral load measured after the onset of the symptoms [22] , the estimated timeto-peak (t V ) in Table 2 is subject to practical identifiability problems, which as was indicated in Theorem 4.1 and will be shown in Section 6, is a main parameter to evaluate antiviral effectiveness. Due to this reason, an uncertainty analysis computing the likelihood-based confidence intervals [50] for each parameter was done. In Figure 6 such analysis is shown for the 95% confidence interval of parameter p, where it can be seen the high degree of uncertainty in the estimatedt V for patients A, C, F and G (approximately 5 days).

For the sake of simplicity, unless otherwise stated, the approximation of system (2.1) presented in Remark 4 is used for simulations. Figure 7 shows the simulated virus load evolution corresponding to each of the nine patients, when the antiviral therapy is started at the first positive PCR test day (t tr = t DL , being t DL the time at which the virus reaches the value DL = 100 copies/mL), which is about 0.3t V \u2248 0.40t e .

First we started with small values of \u03b7 p , fulfilling the condition \u03b7 p < \u03b7 c p (t tr ) (item iii in Theorem 4.1, ineffective treatment). Then \u03b7 p was set to a value equal to \u03b7 c p (t tr ), to reinforce the counter-intuitive fact that larger inhibition effects fulfilling \u03b7 p < \u03b7 c p (t tr ) produce larger virus peak times (item iv in Theorem 4.1). Finally, \u03b7 p was increased to two values larger than \u03b7 c p (t tr ) (items i and ii in Theorem 4.1), to show that higher inhibition effects produce faster eradication of the virus V .",

On the other hand, ineffective treatments cause a delay in time to peak, significantly increasing the duration of viral shedding as \u03b7 p is augmented from 0 to \u03b7 c p . Even when the viral load peak is a monotonically decreasing function of \u03b7 p (by following similar steps than the ones in Lemma 1 it can be shown that \u2202V (t V,tr )/\u2202R = (\u03b4/\u03b2)(1 \u2212 1 R ), for R := R(t tr ) \u2265 1, with R(t tr ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b7 p )p\u03b2/(c\u03b4)), the patient will be PCR-positive for longer periods of time. This means that isolation and precautions measures with treated patients should be carefully considered, depending on the antiviral effectiveness. Figure 8 shows a box-plot of the infected-related metrics for the antiviral effectiveness assessment. For an effective antiviral therapy (\u03b7 p > \u03b7 c p (t tr )), the difference of viral loads at time-to-peak (\u2206V ) is above the 2 logs threshold [13] and the duration of infection (DI) is below the 30 days limit (according [51] the viral shedding interval for untreated COVID-19 patients is in order of 30 days) which is in accordance with an effective viral clearance strategy. On the other hand, for ineffective antiviral therapy (\u03b7 p < \u03b7 c p (t tr )), even tough \u2206V is monotonically increasing with \u03b7 p , the duration of infection is increased to a sub-potent drug efficacy. This means that the delay of the virus peak associated to ineffective treatments is significant in terms of the infected-related metrics. Figures 9 and 10 show the virus load evolution when the antiviral therapy is started in the course of viral spreading, at t tr \u2248 0.7t e and t tr \u2248 t e , respectively. The viral load over the time has the same qualitative behavior than in the previous case. However, the duration of the infection is longer as the inhibition effect approaches \u03b7 c p (t tr ) from below and from above (i.e.: \u03b7 3 p and \u03b7 4 p cases, violet and green lines in Figures  p (t tr ) , the viral duration interval is augmented -even for effective therapies -since V has already reached a relatively high value at the treatment time. This behavior is confirmed in box-plots 11 and 12, where a sudden increase of the duration of infection happens when the antiviral efficacy is near the critical value. However, as the treatment time is delayed this behavior is mitigated (see box-plot 12) due to the natural increment of V (t tr ) (recall tha\u1e6b V (t) \u2248 (R(t tr ) \u2212 1)\u03b4V (t), for t > t tr , so larger values of V (t tr ) produce larger values of |V (t)|). It is important to remark that, even when an increased duration of the viral shedding is reported for the effective treatment case in the boundary of critical drug effectiveness (\u03b7 p \u2248 \u03b7 c p ), the viral load peak occurs previous tot V , in accordance with items i and ii of Theorem 4.1.

Only two representative patients (labeled as B and E) were considered, based on the uncertainty analysis made in Section 5. The treatment initial times were: t tr1 = 4, t tr2 = 6, t tr3 = 9, t tr4 = 17, t tr5 = 20 and t tr6 = 25 dpi. Figures 13 and 14 (left) show that if an ineffective treatment is initiated (\u03b7 pB = 0.73 for patient B and \u03b7 pE = 0.54 for patient E, with \u03b7 c pB (t tr ) \u2248 0.81 and \u03b7 c pE (t tr ) \u2248 0.6 for t tr < t e ), the time-to-peak (t V,tr ) and the duration of infection (DI) decrease as the treatment time is delayed. This can be explained by the fact that, for the same effectiveness,t V,tr is reduced as V (t tr ) is augmented. Equations (8.4) and (8.5) in Lemma 1 show that for a fixed R \u2265 1, k 1 (R) \u2265 0 and k 2 (R) \u2264 0 are increasing functions of V (t tr ) (i.e.: k 1 (R) = 0 and k 2 (R) = \u22121/(\u03b4(R \u2212 1)) for V (t tr ) \u2192 0 while k 1 (R) = 1/((1 \u2212 R) 2 + R) and k 2 (R) = \u22121/(\u03b4R) for V (t tr ) \u2192 \u03b4/\u03b2, being \u03b4/\u03b2 < V (t V )). Therefore, sincet V,tr = k 2 ln(k 1 ) + t tr (according to equation (8. 3)), it can be inferred thatt V,tr is monotonically decreasing with V (t tr ). Moreover, comparing the viral load at the time-to-peak, it can be deduced that V (t V,tr2 ) > V (t V,tr1 ) for an ineffective therapy started at two treatment times t tr2 > t tr1 during the beginning of the infection (assuming that U (t tr1 ) \u2248 U (t tr2 )). By following similar steps as in Lemma 1, the viral load at the time-to-peak can be written as: V (t V,tr ) = V (t tr ) + (p/c)U (t tr ) \u2212 (\u03b4/\u03b2)(ln(R tr ) + 1) and, therefore, ",

This can be explained by the fact that the difference of viral load att V,tr , for therapies started at different times, depends mainly on the deviation between the viral loads at treatment times, which normally are several order of magnitude below V (t V,tr ). For example, for patient B, V (t V,tr1 ) = 3.29 \u00d7 10 5 , V (t V,tr2 ) = 3.30 \u00d7 10 5 and V (t V,tr3 ) = 4.35 \u00d7 10 5 Copies/ml while V (t tr1 ) = 10 2 , V (t tr2 ) = 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 and V (t tr3 ) = 1.74 \u00d7 10 5 Copies/ml. Consequently, the increment on the viral peak is not significant as the treatment is delayed, although the duration of infection is considerably reduced (i.e.: from 96 to 55 days for patient B and 95 to 65 days for patient E). Note that the target cell-model assumes that the viral clearance in the convalescent phase is proportional to the virus load concentration at time-to-peak, which is in the same order of magnitude for the three cases. As a result, and taking into account that the viral peak is reached early as the treatment is delayed, a quickly viral deletion is observed for the postponed case. As a consequence, if a fixed sub-potent drug is employed, delaying the treatment initiation time could reduce viral shedding interval, without significantly increasing the viral load at time-to-peak. It is important to remark that if \u03b7 p is reduced even more (\u03b7 p \u226a \u03b7 c ), the viral at time-to-peak follows the same behavior, although, the viral shedding interval is not-considerably decreased, sincet V,tr \u2248t V as \u03b7 \u2192 0 (t tr \u2208 (\u0165 V ,t V ).

Although this critical value has been described for chronic infections (e.g. HIV [52, 53] , HCV [35] ) it has not been studied yet for COVID-19. The critical drug efficacy can be understood in terms of the antiviral potency to decline viral spreading, in spite of guiding the system to an uninfected equilibrium, as it was introduced in Definition 4, Section 4.2. In addition, the critical inhibition effect of an antiviral depends on the treatment initiation time, and it has shown to be a monotonically decreasing function during the viral spreading interval (roughly speaking, during the time interval before the untreated virus peak).",

Therefore, if the therapeutic objective is to reduce both, the viral shedding interval and the viral peak, the efficacy level would need to overpass the critical value in a given quantity. From Figure 3 it can be seen that \u03b7 c (t tr ) > 0.7 for most of patients.",

Particularly, Figures 13 and 14 corroborate a slight reduction on the viral shedding interval if a subpotent drug therapy is employed after the time-to-peak. Consequently, taking into account that the viral load in COVID-19 patients presumably reaches the peak prior to the symptom onset, no further clinical improvements may be obtained if the therapy is started in this symptomatic phase (i.e.: notice that SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology is characterized by a direct cytotoxic effect, endothelial cell damage, dysregulation of immune response, among others [45] ). Furthermore, considering the analysis presented in Theorem 4.1 that is valid during viral spreading interval, we can argue that the non-significant antiviral effect reported recently in [54] might be related to an early time-to-peak of COVID-19 patients.",

In comparison with single treatment cases (represented by the horizontal and vertical dash-dot lines in Figure  15 ), a reduced critical antiviral efficacy was reported for the combined case, denoting a reduction on the necessary drug effectiveness to reduce viral spreading. Moreover, the viral characteristic behavior in the vicinity of the critical drug efficacy (i.e.: increase of time-to-peak and duration of infection) was preserved for the combined case, as the pair (\u03b7 \u03b2 , \u03b7 p ) belongs to the critical boundary of H c (t tr ), which implies that the antiviral effectiveness characterization made in Theorem 4.1 for single treatments could be extended to combined therapies.",
