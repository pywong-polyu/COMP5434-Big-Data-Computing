We analyze 10,443,476 adverse event re-38 ports spanning 19,193 adverse events and 3,624 drugs to reveal previously unknown impacts of the 39 pandemic on drug safety and identify variation in adverse events across diverse patient populations. 40 Disentangling confounders (such as sampling variance and temporal biases in reporting of adverse 41 events), our algorithm identifies sex-and age-related variations in adverse events and demographic 42 groups who are at higher or lower risk for adverse events during the pandemic than in the pre-43 pandemic time. The analyses enable insights into the inter-correlated adverse events, distill drug 44 safety signals, and yield hypotheses based on risk-altering interactions to inform drug prescription. 45 We also present a comprehensive catalog of adverse events that can serve as a valuable resource 46 to discover relationships between drugs and safety events, especially in cases of rare events and 47 rectly related to COVID-19, such as coronavirus infection, coronavirus test positive, COVID-19, 85 suspected COVID-19, and COVID-19 pneumonia (all p-value < 10 \u221237 , Fisher's exact test): we 86 exclude these from the rest of our analyses. The model detected 64 unique adverse events whose 87 incidence changed during the pandemic in the overall population: 54 of which have increased re-88 porting frequency during the pandemic, while only 10 decreased in frequency (SI Figure S1 ). We 89 define adverse drug reactions whose reporting frequency has disproportionately increased with the 90 pandemic onset as enriched, and those with significantly decreased reporting frequency as purified. 91 Among the 54 enriched adverse events, delusion has the greatest association with the pandemic, 92 with the largest PAEAI score of 1.95 (statistics for more adverse events in SI Table S1 ). The vol-93 ume of FAERS reports involving drug-related premature delivery increased 73.4%, despite studies 94 from the US and Europe finding a decrease in the overall incidence of preterm births during the 95 pandemic [33] [34] [35] . Similarly, the incidence of drug-related bladder cancers increased by 147%, 96 despite overall decrease in cancer diagnoses after the onset of the pandemic [15] . The frequency of 97 hallucination side effects increased 138% during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, 98 which could be related to reports linking paranoia about COVID-19 to hallucinations, as well as 99 the neurological impacts of the disease itself [36, 37] . Our framework also detects large increases 100 for severe side effects, such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. The domination of adverse 101 events with increased frequency is consistently observed in most demographics across sex and age. 102 For instance, in patients over 65 years old, 18 out of 19 identified adverse events are enriched, and 103 only one is purified (SI Figure S1 ). 104 Women suffer from more drug adverse events than men relative to pre-pandemic levels 105 While our approach detected 38 adverse events that increased in frequency in women (SI Table S3 ), 106 only 16 enriched adverse events were detected in men (SI Table S2 ; Figure 2a ). This finding is 107 consistent with that 62.0% of all reports in FAERS are from women and only 38.0% from men 108 (excluding reports with unknown sex). Even after normalizing to the greater number of female brought on by the pandemic exert greater influence on the incidence in female patients. 117 Proportion of female patients increased across most enriched adverse events 118 Next, we assess the proportion of female patients in each of 54 side effects that were enriched in 119 the overall population, comparing the proportion before and during the pandemic (Figure 2d ). We 120 exclude premature delivery, for which all patients are female. We find the proportion of female 121 patients increased in 40 out of 53 adverse events during the pandemic. The two adverse events 122 with the largest increases are reduced visual acuity, where the proportion of women increased from 123 53.8% to 75.2%, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, where the proportion of women increased 124 from 18.4% to 39.0%. We find the proportion of women in drug-related anxiety reports increased 125 from 67.8% to 72.3%, confirming that women report anxiety at higher rates during the pandemic 126 than men [38] . We observe an increase in the proportion of reports for side effects associated with 127 anxiety disorders: insomnia, dysponoea (shortness of breath), and dizziness, but find a decrease in 128 side effects commonly associated with psychosis disorders: delusion, hallucinations, and dementia.",

Values listed indicate the number of averse events associated with each patient cohort and are divided into groups by etiology of adverse events (Methods). In the overall population, nervous and vascular SOCs are most common, with nine and seven side effects, respectively. The representation of enriched psychiatric adverse events varies: four out of 16 adverse events in men (25%) and five out of 18 in the elderly (27.8%), compared to only two out of 38 in women (5.3%) and one out of 35 in adults (2.9%). There is one overrepresented and one underrepresented drug side effect in young patients (SI Figure S2-S3). (b) The proportion of female patients in the 53 side effects enriched in the overall population (omitting reports with unknown sex and excluding premature delivery which only occurs in women). In the majority (75.5%) of side effects, female patients account for a higher proportion of reports during the pandemic, compared to before the pandemic. (c) Changes to gender disparities in the 53 side effects enriched in the overall population during the pandemic (same 53 as in panel b). The gap in the number of reports for men and women is exacerbated during the pandemic in most (41/53) of the adverse drug events. We annotate the top five adverse events that have the largest increase (bolded), with the first number indicating the absolute difference in number of reports, and the number in parentheses showing the difference normalized by population size. For example, a normalized gap of 4.08 in dysponea indicates there are 4.08 more reports per thousand women than per thousand men (negative numbers indicate the reporting frequency in women is smaller than in men, even though the absolute number of reports may be higher in women). Considering incidence proportion (the number of reports per thousand patients) of adverse events (SI Figure S4 ): we find that the gender disparity is enlarged in 33 out of 53 the adverse drug reactions during the pandemic, consistent with the trend observed in the absolute number of reports.",

Higher PAEAI indicates the incidence of a drug-related side effect has undergone a greater change during pandemic than pre-pandemic and that change cannot be explained by temporal trends. We find 10 adverse drug reactions show significant association with the pandemic only in men but not in women, whereas 31 are associated with the pandemic only in women. (b) Age differences in PAEAI. We find that adults have more drug adverse events whose reporting frequency was impacted by the pandemic, compared to the young and elderly cohorts. Pyrexia is significantly associated with the pandemic in both young and adult cohorts. There are no side effects impacted by the pandemic in both young and elderly individuals. The algorithmic approach detects six adverse drug reactions impacted in both adults and the elderly. The majority (28/35, 80.0%) of adverse events observed in adult patients are not found in other age groups. In contrast, there are 12 out of 18 drug reactions in elders are not found in adults. (c) Gender gap in adults (omitting reports with unknown sex). We detected 35 enriched adverse events in adults, and omitted premature delivery and 10 that were only observed in reports with unknown sex: leaving 24 with gender difference. Pre-pandemic gender disparities are increased in 21 out of 24 (87.5%) adverse events, in response to the pandemic. Of these 21 adverse events, 18 have more reports involving women than men, suggesting a disproportionate vulnerability in adult women for gender disparities. Regarding incidence proportion, we note that the gender gap is magnified in 70.8% of the adverse events (SI Figure S5 ). (d) Gender gap in the elderly (omitting reports with unknown sex). In 13 out of 14 adverse drug events (18 adverse events significantly associated with the pandemic in elderly patients, 4 only observed in unknown sex and omitted), a pre-existing gender gap is intensified during the pandemic. Five among these drug side effects (5/13, 38.5%) are reported in more males than females during the pandemic, while only 3 out of 24 side effects (3/24, 12.5%) in adults: indicating the gender inequality is mitigated in aged people in contrast to adults. With the onset of pandemic, gender discrepancy (in terms of incidence proportion) has worsened in 11 out of 14 adverse events where gender inequality previously existed (SI Figure S6 ; adjusted for population size).",

In both networks, cardiac and respiratory arrest 230 are associated with a similar cluster of nervous system-related drugs, including common Benzo-231 diazapines and Opioids such as Fentanyl, Oxycodone, Methadone, and Diamorphine. Many of 232 these drugs are known to be highly addictive and sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic has 233 impacted the ongoing substance abuse epidemic [45, 46]. Moreover, Methadone is only enriched 234 in women, while Diamorphine is only enriched in men, suggesting a potential gender difference in 235 the use of addictive substances. 236 A major difference between the two networks is the large cluster found only in the female 237 network. This cluster includes anxiety and closely associated side effects (such as dizziness, in-238 somnia, palpitations, and dysponea): consistent with numerous studies that women are more likely 239 to report a mental health disturbance during the pandemic [47-49]. Comparing drugs present 240 across the female and male networks is hindered by lacking information on total drug usage in 241 the FAERS dataset. However, both Sildenafil and Tadalafil are located within the center of the 242 female-specific cluster, two drugs whose on-label use is for erectile dysfunction. Despite majority being in men, both drugs are found only the female cluster. Both have off-label uses for 244 treating sexual dysfunction in women, highlighting our method's ability to detect potential adverse 245 events of off-label drug usage, and to overcome the limitation of differences in drug usage. There 246 are 35 drug-adverse events associations enriched in only male patients. For instance, an associa-247 tion between alcoholism and Naltrexone is enriched in men, but not women, indicating a gender 248 disparity in the previously documented rise in alcohol use during the pandemic [50]. 249 We separately analyze associations with Remdesivir as the first treatment for COVID-19 250 to receive emergency approval [51]. Remdesivir presents in both male and female networks and 251 shows association with cardiac arrest. Analyzing differential rates of adverse events in patients re-252 porting use of Remdesivir, we note that female patients are at increased risk for hypoxia, hypoten-253 sion, and renal impairment, while in the male network, Remdesivir is connected to respiratory 254 failure. These adverse events have been reported in Remdesivir clinical trials [52, 53], but are very 255 rare (cardiac arrest, 1/155 patients; renal impairment, 4/53; hypotension, 4/53; respiratory failure 256 2/53) [54] and the trials fail to provide any differential drug effects for distinct patient subsets; 257 the literature does not reveal the association with hypoxia (ROR=7.05; p-value < 10 \u221236 , Fisher's 258 exact test). The detection of Remdesivir-associated adverse events highlights the importance of 259 population-scale patient safety datasets to detect rare adverse events and unexpectedly high-risk 260 demographic subgroups. As more clinical treatments and vaccines receive emergency use autho-261 rization, rapidly detecting rare adverse events and stratifying at-risk populations will be critical to 262 patient safety. 263 Discussion 264 Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of population-scale patient safety data in revealing demo-265 graphic variation of drug adverse events during a public health crisis. Using 10,443,476 reports 266 that span 3,624 approved drugs and 19,193 unique adverse events, our algorithmic approach quan-267 tifies reporting patterns within and across diverse patient cohorts to flag at-risk demographics and 268 identifies relationships between adverse events and drugs. 269 Our analyses quantify associations between adverse events and the pandemic and discovers 270 inequalities across patient subpopulations, paving the way for future research to identify medi-271 cal and non-medical factors driving the inequities. The approach detects population specific side 272 effects supported by the literature, such as increased susceptibility of women to anxiety related 273 effects and the age and gender disparity in urinary tract infections.

The reports in 324 FAERS mainly contain demographic information (such as age and sex, no personal identifiers), 325 drugs (drug substances) and adverse events (preferred terms in MedDRA; more details in the sec-326 tion on adverse event identification). We investigate 10,443,476 reports, involving 19,193 adverse 327 events and 3,624 drugs, reported between January 2013 and September 2020. For reports with the 328 same case number, we keep only the latest report. We restrict our analysis to the adverse events 329 occurred in the USA (6,351,817 reports) to alleviate country-wise biases and avoid biases caused 330 by different national surveillance systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pan-331 demic on March 11, 2020 (retrieved from WHO). The latest available safety reports were submitted 332 on September 30, 2020: thus, we focus on the reports submitted from March 11 to September 30 333 in 2020 and the same period in previous years (from 2013 to 2019), leading to 3,709,531 reports. 334 FDA reporter qualifications. FAERS submissions are voluntarily made by the reporters, who 335 send the reports to the FDA directly or through drug manufacturers. The reporters include health-336 care professionals (physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dentists, etc.) and non-professionals (lawyers 337 and customers). We investigate the distribution of reporters: physicians (594,787, 16.0%), pharma-338 cists (282,323, 7.6%), other healthcare professionals (548,261, 14.8%), lawyers (113,744, 3.1%), 339 customers (2,045,491, 55.1%), and unknown reporters (124,925, 3.37%). To increase the validity 340 of our analysis, we focus on the reports submitted by healthcare professionals (1,425,371 reports). 341 Demographic distribution. We further look into the distribution of diverse patient cohorts and 342 find that the proportion of men, women, and unknown sex are 484,649 (34.0%), 784,230 (55.0%), 343 and 156,492 (11.0%), respectively. Based on the aging criteria set by the WHO [66], we split 344 the patients into young (<20 years, 35,987 reports, 2.52% of all reports, mean=13.9, std=9.0), 345 adults (20\u223c65 years, 508,983 reports, 35.7%, mean=47.8, std=13.2), elderly (>65 years, 305,685, 346 21.4%, mean=72.9, std=11.1), and unknown age (574,716 reports, 44.3%). In sex-or age-specific identification. The drug reactions recorded in FAERS reports are characterized 351 by preferred terms (PT; text string) in MedDRA ontology ((https://www.meddra.org/how-to-use/ 352 basics/hierarchy) [41]. We map the adverse events from their PT string in FAERS to the cor-353 responding MedDRA PT identifier for downstream analysis. One of the major challenges faced 354 by the mapping is that the string names (e.g., 'Phobia fear \\\\ Height') shown in adverse event 355 reports may not match with the standard MedDRA PT names because of nonstandard annotations. 356 Addressing this issue, we propose a simple but efficient mapping strategy which contains three 357 steps. First, we convert all strings into lower case (e.g., 'phobia fear \\\\ height'); second, split the 358 string by '\\\\' if exist, and then separately map the split strings (e.g., 'phobia fear' and 'height') 359 to MedDRA; third, if none of them match with the standard PT names, we further split the string 360 by ' ' if exist (e.g., 'phobia' and 'fear') and check the matching (e.g., 'phobia' match with Med-361 DRA ID '10034912'). In this way, we can map 98.2% of all the adverse events strings appeared in 362 FAERS dataset, which is higher than most literature (such as [67]).

For 367 example, when measuring the impact of the pandemic on the gender gap, we manually excluded 368 premature delivery because it only occurs in female patients.369Mapping of adverse events to human organ systems. To explore the disparities among differ-370 ent parts of human body, we categorize adverse events into higher level, from 'Preferred Terms 371 (PTs)' level to 'System Organ Classes (SOCs)' level, based on etiology (such as infections and 372 infestations) and manifestation sites (such as gastrointestinal disorders) following the MedDRA373",

For s h which pass the two-fold criterion in previous step, we 487 build its trajectory vector v(s h ) = [v h,2013 , v h,2014 , . . . , v h,2020 ]. Element v h,k represents the pro-488 portion of reports related to s h in all reports submitted in year k. For example, of the 211,152 489 reports submitted during the pandemic period, 6,130 involve hallucination, which means the pro-490 portion of hallucination during the pandemic is 2.9% = 6, 130/211, 152. Inspired by the pow-491 erful temporal feature capture ability of autoregressive method [78], we train a second-order au-492 toregressive regression (i.e., AR(2)) model for each adverse event by fitting its historical values 493 [v h,2013 , v h,2014 , . . . , v h,2019 ]. The regression models trained on different adverse events do not share 494 parameters. The optimized model is then used to predict the proportion of s h in each year. [v h,2015 , v h,2016 , . . . , v h,2020 ] is from 2015 to 2020 since 2-order AR model need the first 496 two numbers (in 2013 and 2014) as initial inputs. On top of the difference between observation 497 and prediction, we define PAEAI of s h as: 498 PAEAI(s h ) = log |r 2020 (s h k (s h ) denotes the standardized residual in year k in the regression model of s h , which is 499 calculated through r k (s h ) = e k (s h )/ (1/6) 2020 k=2015 e 2 k (s h ). The e k (s h ) = v h,k \u2212 v h,k denotes 500 the residual of s h in year k (from 2015 to 2020). 501 In summary, PAEAI measures the ratio of average standardized residual in the pandemic 502 relative to pre-pandemic. Positive PAEAI indicates the reporting frequency of s h has changed 503 during the pandemic more than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. It 504 suggest the adverse event s h is associated with the pandemic factors and cannot be explained by 505 temporal trends based on historic data. Negative PAEAI indicates the change during the pandemic 506 does not exceed expected normal fluctuations of the s h 's trajectory. A higher value of PAEAI 507",
