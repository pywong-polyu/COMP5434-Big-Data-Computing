The aim of this study is to describe the change of the activity of a Paediatric Emergency Service (PES) of a tertiary hospital during the pandemic. A retrospective cohort study with analysis of visits to the PES from March 30 to June 30, 2020, and comparison with homologous periods in the previous 3 years (2017-2019).A total of 53,883 episodes were analysed, with a median age of 5.8 years, and 53% were boys. In 2020, there was a 60% reduction in the number of admissions (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in referral by the public medical advice phone line of the National Health Service (NHS) (18.5% vs 5.4%) and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (5.1% vs 4.2%). Urgent patients decreased (31.2% vs 38.3%), and non-urgent patients increased (7.5% vs 1.7%). There was a significant reduction in school (0.4% vs 7.1%) and sports accidents (0.1% vs 1.2%) and an increase in other accidents (falls, wounds, burns, and dog bites) (12.2% vs 6.3%). Hospitalisation rate was higher (5.7% vs 3.1%, p < 0.001). The infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 1.1%, all with mild illness or asymptomatic.",

The perception of the scarcity of available human resources [4] , the moral conscience not to overload the services focused on responding to the pandemic, and the restriction in the public transport network for travelling to the hospital may also justify this change [5, 11] .

Furthermore, as in another study, paediatricians' shift work was rearranged, with adjustments on shift schemes to prevent cross infection among staff [7] . The significant increase in the percentage of newborns observed in the PES, despite a small reduction in absolute numbers, may be due to pandemic-related reduction in activity and accessibility to primary health care and private hospitals. In addition, the foreseen shorter time of contact between mothers and the medical and nursing teams during the stay and even earlier discharges may have favoured this fact. These results are corroborated by the study by Cheek et al. [20] that also identified an increase in newborns' percentage in tertiary hospitals in 2020, comparing to 2019, explained by the reduction in visits to local municipalities.",

This fact justified the increase in patient referrals by phone line of the NHS and EMS and the decrease in admissions of children brought by parents' initiative, which were in line with the recommendations of the GDH [22] . There was also a decrease in patient referrals from private clinics that were closed in this period.
