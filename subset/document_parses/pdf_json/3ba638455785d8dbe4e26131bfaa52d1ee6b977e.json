For manufacturing digitization, there has been active research and development with a focus on Cloud Manufacturing (CM) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This work presents a computer vision toolkit (CV Toolkit) for non-invasive digitization of the factory floor in line with Industry 4.0 requirements for factory data collection. Currently, technical challenges persist towards digitization of legacy systems due to the limitation for changes in their design and sensors. This novel toolkit is developed to facilitate easy integration of legacy production machinery and factory floor artifacts with the digital and smart manufacturing environment with no requirement of any physical changes in the machines. The system developed is modular, and allows real-time monitoring of production machinery. Modularity aspect allows the incorporation of new software applications in the current framework of CV Toolkit. To allow connectivity of this toolkit with manufacturing floors in a simple, deployable and cost-effective manner, the toolkit is integrated with a known manufacturing data standard, MTConnect, to translate the digital inputs into data streams that can be read by commercial status tracking and reporting software solutions. The proposed toolkit is demonstrated using a mock-panel environment developed in house at the University of Cincinnati to highlight its usability.",

They collect and process operation data based on the visual cues (dials, displays, part location, etc.), particular job settings, the operation sounds, and more. These cues form a wealth of information for the operators to control and maintain productivity and quality. If the equipment is not digitized, this awareness and knowledge live a finite and sheltered life within the operators memory. Digitization of these cues can provide automated feedback, work instruction verification, early detection of operational issues, preventive maintenance, and big data collection for downstream applications. This forms the motivation for the work presented in this paper.",

With consideration of a modern manufacturing facility with numerous systems operating in parallel, the seamless data transfer as a result of automation requires a standardized interface. MTConnect R provides one such interface [25] . It is an open communication standard that enables data transfer on the manufacturing factory floor in an understandable format that can be read by any other device using the format. MTConnect has paved a way for unifying the data acquisition framework for factory floors in the age of Industry 4.0. Since its creation, MT-Connect has found various applications on the manufacturing floor including but not limited to machine interoperability [26] , system and quality monitoring [27] , data handling in cyberphysical systems [28] , cloud-based digital twin integration with manufacturing facilities [29] . Since MTConnect is a widely accepted standard for \"seamless data-communication pipelines\" in the manufacturing industry, it was adopted in the CV Toolkit system as a standard of communication.",

Although this application demonstrated immediate improvement in fault detection, there is a large scope of improvement which may include classification of fault categories as well as implementing this approach for monitoring the state of production machinery. Solutions in IIoT space for manufacturing have mainly considered data-intensive predictive analysis tooling for automated maintenance of the factory floor and invasive solutions to automate the legacy systems [31, 32, 33] . Non-invasive solutions for the digitization of legacy machines have not received enough attention. In our work, we attempt to solve this problem using computer vision-based toolkit development for monitoring various artifacts on the factory floor. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we present a solution to monitor the legacy machine artifacts which allows capturing the analog data in digital format in real-time. Secondly, with the presented framework we not only demonstrate the applica-3 bility of our work in quality control and fault detection of the manufacturing output but also demonstrate the capability of our framework to interface with commercially available software platforms to allow data analytics and potential to be used for cloud manufacturing. This toolkit can be viewed as a manufacturing floor assistant which eventually alleviates manual stress on the operators. Figure 1 shows the overall schematic of the CV Toolkit with all its components. The imaging system (sensing module) forms the first component of the toolkit. This consists of a camera and the mounting apparatus to secure the camera with a focus on the legacy machine artifacts to capture the data of interest. The second component is the software system that is further divided into three modules: (i) The Computer Vision Software The data collected by the imaging system is captured, processed and analyzed in this module. It forms the core of the toolkit responsible for the digitization of the legacy machine output; (ii) MTConnect R based Adapter The digital output of the Computer Vision Software is collected by this module in JSON format which contains the respective artifact information and its corresponding parameters. It is responsible for parsing of this JSON data and creating a stream of MTConnect R standard data which can then be collected by an MTConnect R based Agent; (iii) MTConnect R based Agent This module stores the timestamped legacy machine artifact data in MTConnect R standard format and acts as a server which can broadcast the data on demand through an HTTP connection.",

The vision software with all the applications described in section 4.2 is installed and run on-site. The video data is processed at the speed of 30fps. In fig.  1 , this processing unit is referred to as Computer Vision/Intelligence Controller.

The on-site processing allows inferences on-site for review and transfer of processed data features to the remote locations. This makes it feasible for cloud-based applications. \u2022 MTConnect standard integration: Various image processing and machine learning techniques are applied to the data that is captured by the imaging system and the digital output that is generated by the Computer Vision Software is broadcasted to MTConnect R based Adapter through a TCP/IP network connection.",

            "text": "This section presents the demonstration of CV Toolkit where it detects states of various factory floor artifacts described in section 4.2. Figure 3 shows the mock-panel environment developed at the University of Cincinnati with the factory floor artifacts created to facilitate the development of these applications before deployment of CV Toolkit in an industrial environment. Currently, all the computer vision applications in the toolkit are interfaced with ShopFloorIQ [34] through our MTConnect R based Adapter and the figures show the state of the system along with the output received on the ShopFloorIQ software. Figure 7 shows the demonstration of these applications to detect state of various artifacts. Figure 8 presents the use of this application for monitoring the quality. In this figure, the machine production quality monitor application from CV Toolkit is used to track the output of the fastener manufacturing machine at Matdan R Fasteners production facility. The figures 8a, 8b and 8c show the possible outputs from the machine. Fig. 8a shows the unmachined part coming out from the manufacturing machine. This figure indicates the part prior to the machining operation on the machine tool. Fig. 8b indicates the partially machined part which indicates that the part is incorrectly processed by the machine tool and the machine requires replacement of the tools. The desired correct output of the fastener is shown in fig. 8c . The image in this figure indicates that the machine is functioning correctly. Figure 8d shows the quality monitor application in the CV Toolkit in action with its output tracked on ShopFloorIQ. 6 (a) Gauge Reader interpreting the data from a circular gauge and the corresponding output is shown in ShopFloorIQ . The data for this experiment is courtesy of Faurecia. The output shown on the left of this figure corresponds to the case shown in fig. 8b . The right side of fig. 8d shows the corresponding digitized output received on the ShopFloorIQ GUI through MTConnect R adapter-agent interface. For the artifacts with reflective surfaces such as gauges (shown in fig. 7a) , it was observed that the sensing and inference of the developed applications were highly dependent on the light conditions and image resolution. A direct reflection of the light source on these artifacts may cause misinterpretation of the images because of the glare. To handle this noise, the artifacts were equipped with anti-glare screens while installing the toolkit for monitoring those artifacts. The contribution of the automation of the inspection processes shown in figures 7 and 8 is two fold. Firstly, this inspection process aids in reducing the manual fatigue while working with the artifacts demonstrated in these figures. Secondly, it enables data logging and digitization for various inspection processes in the manufacturing facilities. The data gathered can be used with the commercially available tools such as ShopFloorIQ for visualization and predictive maintenance of the machines. Another advantage of this system is the feasibility to install the cameras at locations where it may be difficult for a worker to reach. One such example is to monitor an artifact installed at a height such as a gauge that may be installed on a pipe carrying fluids through various levels of the manufacturing facility.",

This system is non-invasive, i.e., there is no requirement for physical connections and/or internal modifications in the legacy machines. Leveraging MTConnect R , this toolkit provides an intuitive graphical user interface to enable information collection and has complete compatibility with existing MTConnect R applications.

As with any vision system, this toolkit is sensitive to light conditions of the environment and the parameters for all the applications are sensitive to light conditions. To address this limitation and make this system light condition agnostic, future work also includes improving the current image processing routines for low light conditions [45] . The current design of the toolkit was undertaken to keep it low cost. To make this system more robust and deployable even in hazardous environments such as the chemical plants, the toolkit design can be improved with appropriate enclosures on the various parts of the toolkit.",
