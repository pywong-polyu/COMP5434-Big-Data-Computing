The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into susceptible cells is mediated by the interaction of the viral spike S protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor; then, S protein is cleaved by host proteases, allowing the virus-host membrane fusion [3] . Indeed, this virus is able to primarily infect ACE-2-expressing cells in the airways, inducing a direct cytopathic with consequent respiratory symptoms. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 presents an increasing gradient of infection from distal to proximal respiratory primary cell lines. Moreover, from autoptic findings, it has been observed that ciliated cells in the airways and pneumocytes type 2 of the alveoli are the cells more susceptible to infection. Moreover, cell death has also been reported as caused by the exacerbated immune response activated by the infection [4] .",

In addition, other conditions in scenarios involving close contacts have also been defined and include the direct physical contact with a COVID-19 positive individual, a COVID-19 patient-caregiver not wearing the proper protection, the sharing of a house, room, and/or meal with positive persons [7] . These settings could easily occur in different situations, for instance in the school classroom and public transports.

Few other human cell lines are tolerant to SARS-CoV-2 reproduction, including Calu-3 (lung adenocarcinoma), Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), and Huh7 (hepatocellular carcinoma); nevertheless, in these human cells, the cytopathic effect was not evident as that observed in monkey cells [9, 10] .

At the end of the infection setting (7th days post virus exposition), wells were washed in PBS, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Next, fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS + 0.2% triton-x100 (PBS-T) and the nonspecific sites were blocked with PBS-T + normal goat serum (NGS) 10%. Cells were firstly incubated overnight with anti-SARS/SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Antibody (MA1-7403, Thermo Fisher Scientific) (1:100 in PBS-T + 1.5% NGS), and then with the anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody for 1 h (A11029, Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, dilution 1:500). Finally, a mounting medium containing 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Fluoroshield\u2122 with DAPI, F6057, Sigma Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was employed to seal the coverslips on the glass slides (Superfrost, 10143560, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Notably, there are no appreciable differences both in terms of viral load and cytopathic effect between infections obtained with 1, 2, 3, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min of absorption at 7 days post-infection. These results possibly suggest that the initial binding of the virus with the cells is crucial and sufficient for virions to adhere and enter the cellular membrane, with subsequent intracellular replication, including when low MOIs were tested. With lower MOI, only a longer time of viral inoculation was able to generate an infection, being 15 and 60 the minimal times required to yield viral replication for MOI 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively. Interestingly, the time needed to macroscopically perceive these effects is also compatible with the onset of the symptoms in COVID-19 individuals after close contact with a positive subject [16] .",

The cells were characterized by cellular rounding, detachment, and degeneration, together with the presence of multinucleate cells. This phenotype is characteristic of infected cells. Indeed, the sole presence of the viral spike protein in correspondence with the plasma membrane can lead to the formation of receptor-dependent syncytia. Nevertheless, it has been reported that Vero cells seem to form syncytia only when co-cultured with other cell lines (U2OS-ACE2 and 293T-ACE2 cell lines) and came in contact with U2OS-ACE2-infected cells or 293T-ACE2 cells expressing the spike protein. Vero cells fused also when they were transfected with the S protein, but they did not fuse upon infection. Therefore, the presence of ACE2 or S protein is essential to generate syncytia [17] . Our immunofluorescence images showed multinucleate cells upon infection; however, we did not employ a GFP-Split complementation system as in the paper by Buchrieser et al. [17] ; therefore, the syncytia formation cannot be confirmed. Moreover, the Vero cell lines used in our experiments might be slightly different between the two experimental settings, since in the present study the Vero E6 clone (ATCC CRL-1586) was employed, while in the paper redacted by Buchrieser et al. [17] , the ATCC code was not reported, thus not allowing a comparison. Nevertheless, the formation of multinucleate cells in Vero E6 cells simply infected with SARS-CoV-2 was previously reported [10] , as in the present study.",

To date, the international WHO guidelines indicate 15 min as the time necessary to define close contacts with a COVID-19-affected individual [7] . The current work is aimed at analyzing and further characterizing in vitro this condition (i.e., 15 min and less of exposure). Bearing in mind the limitations of an in vitro experimental setting in trying to represent the real scenario of a virus-host contact, based on our findings, it could be reinforced that in some high-risk contexts, such as restricted closed environments with poor air circulation (e.g., elevators, crowded means of transports), the precautions to take in the presence of a COVID-19-positive individual should be maximal. Actually, the main way that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted is from person to person through direct, indirect, or close contact with infective secretions, such as saliva and respiratory droplets [2] . The virus is also found in very low quantities in urine, stool, and blood; thus, the viral transmission through these routes is still under discussion by the scientific community, as well as the airborne spread of SARS-COV-2, which has been hypothesized but still needs to be confirmed [15] .",

Indeed, in the majority of the studies regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, although having different aims from the ones investigated in our work, Vero E6 cells (and other cell lines) are exposed to the virions for 1 h [10] . However, we have observed that a minor time of viral absorption in vitro can be employed to obtain the same consistent cytopathic effect. Therefore, taken together, our findings will initially contribute to redesigning the anti-viral infection protocols, and secondly, even if obtained in a cellular model of infection, our findings will be a warning about the transmission risk even with a very short time of exposure.
