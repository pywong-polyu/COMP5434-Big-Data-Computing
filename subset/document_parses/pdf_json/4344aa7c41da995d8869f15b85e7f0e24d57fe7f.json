In a recent study, researchers found that one in 20 youth in the United States had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety [2] . Depression is commonly described as persistent sadness, or an irritable mood and anxiety is often referred to as excessive fear or worry [3] . These conditions have been associated with negative psychosocial outcomes including disengagement in school, substance misuse, risky sexual behaviors, and increased suicide risk [4] . Beyond this, these internalizing problems frequently persist into adulthood and are associated with an increased risk of co-occurring disorders, lower wage earnings, and early death [5] .",

Peer victimization is prevalent among school-age youth and has been found to contribute to internalizing mental disorders [7] . Much of this research focuses on one developmental period, middle childhood, leaving a notable gap in the field's understanding of development and long-term outcomes. According to the life course perspective, development is lifelong and no life stage can be understood in isolation from others. Therefore, adolescent mental health outcomes can be fully understood in light of previous childhood experiences [8] . Moreover, even less is known about the contextual factors that may contribute to the link between peer victimization and internalizing symptomology, which can directly inform early prevention and intervention efforts [9] . School connectedness is a salient factor for school-age youth and may contribute to how strongly peer victimization is associated with internalizing symptoms [10] [11] [12] . Accordingly, the current study extends previous research by investigating whether peer victimization is associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety among adolescents over a 6-year period, and whether school connectedness mediates this link. In addition, this study explored whether this mediation process was moderated by race.",

            "text": "While the United States is gripped in a fierce public health crisis in the COVID-19 pandemic, it also faces the sustained public health crisis of bullying and peer victimization. Bullying, peer victimization, and their relationship to internalizing problems has been given ample space within the literature. The concept of bullying has long been studied and is often characterized as physical, emotional, or relational (non-sexual) harm done to others [13] . The physical component might involve hitting, kicking, or punching, while the emotional component might involve teasing or disparaging remarks. Relational bullying involves one individual trying to cause harm to another's reputation by spreading rumors or damaging relationships so that a victim feels isolated. This is also referred to as indirect aggression as opposed to direct aggression involving physical bullying. Peer victimization is most commonly defined as repeated exposure to these negative actions for some time with a power imbalance between the bully and the victim [14] [15] [16] . Bullying and peer victimization also can occur online and through text messages, which is known as cyberbullying. With the rise of distance learning during this pandemic, more focus has been given to cyberbullying. Upwards of 20% of high school students were bullied on campus and another 15% were bullied online [17] . Within each of these areas of bullying, children and adolescents experience peer victimization whether physical, emotional, or relational. This means that they are the targets of bullying and experience the physical, emotional, or relational violence directed towards them from perpetrators of bullying incidents.",

The researchers found that victimization was associated with increased feelings of depression [26] found that increases in physical and relational victimization were related to increases in internalizing symptoms (e.g., separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, depressed mood) in a sample of adolescents across a 4-year period [27] assessed the relationship between peer victimization and social anxiety in a sample of adolescents and found that relational victimization over time was associated with increased self-reported social anxiety and social phobia symptoms.",

Specifically, boys are more often exposed to physical bullying and more likely to be victims of physical bullying than girls [28] . Girls in contrast are more likely to experience relational victimization and perpetrate it as well [29] . The patterns of internalizing symptoms also vary according to gender. Higher depression levels were reported by girls in addition to generalized anxiety and social anxiety when compared with boys, particularly in terms of relational or indirect aggression [30, 31] . Like gender differences, racial differences also manifest in patterns of peer victimization along with internalizing symptoms [32, 33] . According to [31] in a sample of early elementary schoolers the risk of peer victimization was higher for African Americans than Hispanic and White students. Researchers also found that White and African American students were more likely to encounter repeated incidents of peer victimization when compared to Hispanic counterparts. Likewise, in terms of the type of victimization experienced, African American youth were more likely to experience direct victimization than relational or indirect victimization [34] . Other research has suggested that the context of the school environment matters, particularly, the racial makeup of the classroom. Students of color face more peer victimization when in ethnically diverse classrooms according to [35] .",

School connectedness is characterized as students feeling psychologically attached or identifying with the school community [46] . This construct is often referred to by many other terms (e.g., school membership, school bonding, school belonging, school climate), demonstrating its multidimensional nature and lack of consensus in the field of education [47] . Notably, school connectedness has been found to buffer against internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression) among economically disadvantaged youth [48] . The psychological sense of connecting with the school environment is argued to be particularly important for adolescents as they rely less on family as part of their development and come to rely more on relationships that are usually found in schools or with peers [46, 49, 50] .",

As applied to school settings, researchers emphasize that well-being can be raised through school connectedness through a process of relatedness and the desire to attach and connect to others in school [52, 53] . From this prospective, it is hypothesized that school connectedness mediates, or accounts for the effects of peer victimization on adolescent mental health well-being. Prior research has directly tested the mediational role of school connectedness on adolescent mental health. For example [10] , found that the relationship between peer victimization and mental well-being was mediated by school connectedness among Pakistani adolescents with an average age of 16.1 years. Similarly [11] , found that exposure to peer victimization was associated with increased depressive symptoms in a sample of majority African American (44.3%) middle school students. In addition, the researchers found that school belonging mediated long-term problems that were related to peer victimization via reductions in depressive symptoms. Ref. [12] examined the relations among peer victimization, school belonging, and mental health with an ethnically diverse sample of transgender adolescents. The researchers showed that school belonging was associated with improved mental health outcomes and mediated the relationship between victimization and mental health issues (e.g., depression, suicidal ideation).",

The results revealed that being a transgender youth of color did not necessarily differentiate the negative impact of peer victimization on mental health and belonging. Similarly, [54] examined the relationships among peer victimization, school belonging, and substance abuse among high school teenagers. Their results showed that transgendered youth of color did not report greater drug use than their White peers, despite experiencing more victimization [54] .

Self-determination theory (SDT) is a psychological theory of innate needs that are essential for facilitating optimal functioning and personal well-being. The three basic needs include autonomy, competence, and relatedness to others. Autonomy emphasizes the need to feel in control of one's own behaviors. Competence is characterized as the ability to feel mastery of skills for an activity. Relatedness is a universal need to experience a sense of connection or attachment to other people [51] . Social environments that allow satisfaction of these needs are theorized to promote psychological health and well-being [51, 55] .

Through multistage stratified random sampling, it follows nearly 5000 children who were born between 1998 and 2000 in 20 large U.S. cities (with populations over 200,000 in 1994), as well as their parents, with an oversampling of nonmarital births [56] . Data collection has consisted of six waves so far with interviews of mothers, fathers, and/or primary caregivers at the child's birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15; in-home assessments at ages 3, 5, 9, and 15; and child surveys at ages 9 and 15 [57] . The data from age 9 and 15 child surveys were used for the current longitudinal study. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to understand how children born into these families fare with a focus on educational experiences and mental health outcomes.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether peer victimization at age 9 indirectly related to internalizing problems at age 15 via school connectedness and whether the direct and indirect associations between peer victimization and internalizing problems were moderated by race. After controlling for gender, age, family household income, academic performance, and school climate perceptions, findings revealed that peer victimization at age 9 was positively associated with internalizing problems at age 15, which is consistent with previous research. Beyond this, the findings indicated that the predictive effect of peer victimization over a 6-year period on teen depression and anxiety was explained by increased school connectedness. Furthermore, there was a moderating effect of race on the direct effect of school connectedness and teen depression and anxiety. For both White and ethnic minority students, increased school connectedness was associated with less teen depression and anxiety. However, this effect was weaker for ethnic minority students in comparison to White students in both moderated mediation models.

This approach negates the role of protective factors as a way to mitigate risks. The current study advances our understanding of early exposure to victimization and its association with internalizing problems, and the role of school connectedness as an essential protective factor. Consistent with previous research investigating effects of victimization [10, 69, 70] , this study provides support for school connectedness as an underlying mechanism mediating the effect of victimization on teen depression and anxiety. The mediation analysis demonstrated that peer victimization predicted diminished school connectedness and that an increased sense of school connectedness was associated with less teen depression and anxiety. Although school connectedness demonstrated protective qualities, the mediating effect was minimal in both moderated mediation models. This finding may be due to some other underlying mechanisms such as peer support explaining this association. Because no other intermediate variables were analyzed, other factors in this indirect path of depression and anxiety could not be compared. Future research should explore multiple mediating factors simultaneously. Beyond this, this study does provide support for the self-determination theory [51] and the psychological need for relatedness. From this perspective, school connectedness is a social and interpersonal phenomenon, in which, youth have an innate desire to attach and connect to others in the school setting which in turn improves overall mental well-being.",

This conditional process analysis was necessary in understanding the effect of racial differences. The study identified a second-stage moderation regarding race and teen depression and anxiety, which is contradictory to research that found no moderating effects of race on victimization and mental health outcomes via school belonging [12, 54] . Findings showed that race moderated the direct effect of school connectedness and teen depression and anxiety. For both White and ethnic minority students, increased school connectedness was associated with less teen depression and anxiety. However, this effect was weaker for students of color in comparison to White students in both conditional models. This could be due to White students on average having a greater sense of school connection in comparison to youth of color [72] and as a result the association between school connectedness and teen depression and anxiety has a greater impact on White students, in terms of fewer internalizing symptoms, than students of color. This finding has the potential to inform the enhancement of targeted school-based interventions and prevention efforts.",

The inconsistency in experiences of victimization across racial groups have led researchers to conclude that race alone is not directly related to peer victimization [73] . One area of exploration to account for bullying experiences is the intersectionality of the racial composition of the school/classroom and the race of victims [35, 74] . Theories such as the imbalance of power thesis [75] and group threat theory [76] explain the dynamics of intergroup racial contact and potential contribution to peer victimization.",

Several limitations, however, should be addressed. First, data were collected through selfreport measures. Relying on the self-reporting of participants runs the risk of reporter bias. For example, surveys that assess highly sensitive risk behaviors like bullying behaviors and mental health symptomology may be underreported due to social desirability. Future studies should include more objective measures and other report measures from different informants (e.g., parent or teacher). Second, the measurement of peer victimization was limited and did not include the effects of cyberbullying. Future research should explore the impacts of cyberbullying and its relationship to mental health. Third, this study was not able to control for the initial effects of depression and anxiety at Year 9 because these measures were not available in the dataset. This is important and needed in future research. A final limitation is that this study relied on only two assessment waves of targeted constructs. Future research should focus on the inclusion of three or more assessment points providing greater information on the pattern of change over time, as well as the opportunity to use growth curve modeling to test relationships between peer victimization and internalizing problems. In addition, research that employs a nationally representative sample and that could offer a broader understanding of the relationships among peer victimization, school connectedness, and internalizing problems will extend these findings considerably. Further, research that could provide important contextual information about the schools that are most successful in cultivating a sense of school connection for students of color will have important implications for educational policy.",

The push for increased connectedness, leading toward improvement in school members' experiences of safety and decreased internalizing problems could take on many forms. For example, school staff could seek out climate-building programs with components that directly target school connectedness. Administrators and other officials could monitor student connectedness as a more proximal outcome of school climate intervention efforts. Additional examples include the enactment of school policies to ensure that students of color feel psychologically attached to school and accepted and the creation and support of clubs that engage ethnic minority youth experiencing mental health symptomology. Beyond this, school mental health providers must consider school connectedness as an underlying factor in overall student mental health assessment and treatment. In terms of professional development, school mental health professionals can offer teachers training on understanding the importance of how their behavior impacts school connectedness, particularly for students of color.

Given that the majority of students in public schools are students of color, the findings that the moderating relationship between school connectedness and internalizing problems is weaker for students of color needs to be further explored from a racial justice perspective. Researchers have the opportunity to ask why this weaker relationship exists and how it ultimately influences the mental health of students of color. Additionally, school connectedness in the era of COVID-19 is an understudied topic. Like the health research on COVID-19 has demonstrated gross racial disparities in the disease and death rates, research of the racial differences in school connectedness during COVID-19 will be essential to prioritizing the mental health outcomes and treatment of students in schools.",

            "text": "School officials must continue to prioritize efforts and activities that increase student connectedness as they target a reduction of internalizing symptoms in adolescents who attend their schools. This study demonstrates the importance of school connectedness as a mediator of internalizing problems in adolescents. School connectedness is especially important as student relationships are in flux due to the global pandemic. Even as schools eventually regain normalcy, they can bolster efforts to increase school connectedness for all students, with extra attention to this metric for students of color. .
