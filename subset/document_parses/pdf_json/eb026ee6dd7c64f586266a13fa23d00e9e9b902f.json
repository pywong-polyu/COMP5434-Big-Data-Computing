            "text": "Background: Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the SARS-CoV-2 or nCOVID-19 infection (a pandemic), continuous spread of the virus has been observed which has continuously seen to affect and kill multitudes of individuals all over the world. An understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease is necessary for an effective treatment. Laboratory investigations play an important role in the diagnosis as well as treatment of this infectious disease. Hematological parameters demonstrate alterations during the progression of nCOVID-19 infection. Of these, many are indicative of extremely poor clinical outcome. Hematological findings like leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulation-related abnormalities are the most common manifestations. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological and immunological parameters among nCOVID-19 infections. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was designed after categorizing patients suffering from COVID-19 into three groups: (a) Group I; (b) Group II and (c) Group III or severe critical patients. Hematological and immunological parameters of neutrophilic and white blood cell counts, d-dimer levels, hemoglobin levels, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) levels and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed. Statistical analysis using Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results: Normal white blood cell and neutrophil count among COVID-19 patients was seen. However, median values in Group II (P < 0.01) and Group III (P < 0.0001) were found to show significantly higher values when compared to Group I. A significant (P < 0.01) decrease in lymphocytic counts was found among severe and critical patients. Hemoglobin level was found to demonstrate higher decrease (P < 0.01) among severe and critical patients. Platelet count was found in normal range in all COVID-19 patients. Routine coagulation tests revealed increased fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and d-dimer levels (P < 0.0001) in severe and critical patients. Normal proportions of total CD3+ and CD4 + T lymphocytes were observed in COVID-19. However, CD8 + T lymphocytes proportion was found to be decreased (P-value < 0.05). Immunoglobulin G levels among Groups II and III patients were found to be lower when compared with Group I (P < 0.001). No statistical significance was observed between the groups in IgM levels. Plasma IL-6 levels were found to show progressive rise among Groups II and III patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Analysis of hematological and immunological parameters profiles in COVID-19 patients may help in deciphering the clinical progression of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease. Thus, regular monitoring of the hospitalized patients may help in planning the management of these cases.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in an unexpected health crisis all around the world. It was on March 11, 2020 , when the WHO declared it as a pandemic. Ever since, an exponential increase in the disease has been seen. [1] The coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is a beta-coronavirus that has been closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 by means of genetic sequencing methods. This disease is associated with alterations in the complete blood picture and coagulopathies. [2] The beta-coronavirus is a member of the extreme acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It has 79 and 51.8% genetic homology to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Among the biochemical parameters, a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.05) was observed. [3] Ferritin has been associated with dysregulation of the immune system. At high serum levels, the immune system undergoes suppression. Its proinflammatory activity plays a vital role in cytokine storm crisis. Thus, it is indirectly related to causation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness. All of this results in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection. [4] It has been estimated that the median period for incubation is between 2 and 14 days. Symptoms of COVID-19 infection include fever, dry cough, headache, fatigue, hemoptysis, dyspnea, diarrhea and lymphopenia. [5, 6] Patients infected with COVID-19 exhibit mild to severe acute respiratory infection syndromes. Patients with mild disease show symptoms like fever, fatigue, dry cough, malaise and may be an abnormal chest radiograph or computed tomography scan. In a few patients, there is a rapid progression of the disease that develops into ARDS or multi-organ failure in a short period of time. This rapid progression may be attributed to various immunological factors. Thus, it is important to study these immune factors for timely and early identification of a severe disease. [1] The study of biochemical parameters may be used to evaluate prognosis of patients during the entire period of patient hospitalization. Thus, an increase in the levels of the inflammation causing cytokines results in a condition known as \"cytokine storm\". This phenomenon is considered to be the reason behind acute pulmonary injury leading to tissue damage. [7] Virus-induced infection of the endothelial cells causes activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). IL-6 plays an important role on the janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and increases vascular endothelial factor secretion along with an increase in IL-8 synthesis. These proinflammatory cytokines along with the immunologically active molecules cause an increase in the production of chemokines, colony stimulating factors and interferons which cause cytokine storm. The cytokine storm along with a hyper-inflammatory physiological condition results in a pro-thrombotic situation along with activation of endothelial cells and platelets. [8, 9] There is a pressing and urgent requirement for an early identification of effective diagnostic as well as prognostic biomarker of disease progression towards clinical decline, and resultant patient mortality. Lymphocytopenia is a prominently consistent feature in the affected subjects. This virus shows affinity towards the ACE-2 receptors localized on lymphocytes and is attributable for its cytopathic effects. [7] It has been observed that individuals with blood group A demonstrate a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while the group O subjects demonstrate a lower risk. [10] Blood tests play an important role in the early diagnosis as they can provide useful information regarding the process of inflammation within the body which may include lymphocyte count, CRP levels and collateral damage such as acute renal failure, hepatic and renal disease severity. [10] Xu et al. [11] (2020) have reported three mechanisms of thrombocytopenia: (a) According to the first mechanism, there is a viral infection of hematopoietic tissues of bone marrow leading to depleted synthesis of platelets; (b) According to the second hypothesis, it is because of impaired immunological system and (c) According to the third hypothesis, platelets undergo aggregation within lungs which may lead to their consumption and formation of microthrombi.",

[12, 13] Patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease show recovery following medical therapy. However, patients with severe disease have a fatality rate ranging from 1 to 15%. [14] [15] [16] Radiological features of chest radiography show features such as consolidation, ground-glass opacifications and paving pattern. The frequency of ground-glass opacifications and consolidation reduce as there is progression of the disease while there is an increase in consolidation with the paving pattern concomitantly. It has been hypothesized that lymphopenia is the result of direct viral infection of lymphocytes, destruction of lymphocytic organs and apoptosis of lymphocytes. Worsening of lymphopenia is seen in severely infected patients. [17, 18] Tian et al. [19] , in 2020, reported radiological changes in chest findings which include injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, formation of hyaline membrane and type II pneumocytic hyperplasia.
