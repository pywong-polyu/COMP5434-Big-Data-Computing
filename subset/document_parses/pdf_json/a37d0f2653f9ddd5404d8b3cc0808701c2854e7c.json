Many countries have imposed export restrictions on PPE to ensure the sufficient domestic supply. The surging demand and export restrictions cause shortage contagions on the global PPE trade network. Here, we develop an integrated network model, which integrates a metapopulation model and a threshold model, to investigate the shortage contagion patterns. The metapopulation model captures disease contagion across countries. The threshold model captures the shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network. Results show that, the shortage contagion patterns are mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the disease contagion. Besides, export restrictions lead to ineffective and inefficient allocation of PPE around the world, which has no benefits for the world to fight against the pandemic.",

They concluded that export restrictions might cause uncertainty in supply and other negative security consequences, though these restrictions seem logical and justifiable [5, 7, 11] . Demand surges and export restrictions cause shortage contagion on the trade network. There is rich economic literature using quantitative models to investigate the contagion patterns and their impacts on international trade [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In physics, a wide range of research proposed different models to analyze the dynamics of contagion propagation on interdependent networks [17] , for example, the diffusion model [18] and the threshold model [19, 20] . However, how the shortage contagion transmits on the global PPE trade network during large-scale epidemic like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is underresearched. Most, if not all, existing studies examined the disease contagion and shortage contagion separately, and did not take into consideration the dynamic interplay between them. It is critical to characterize such interplay because the surging demand is caused by the epidemic arrival.",

We illustrate the structure of the model in Fig. 1 . The proposed model integrates a susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) based metapopulation model, which captures the dynamics of disease contagion on the global mobility network (top layer of Fig. 1) , and a threshold model, which captures the dynamics of shortage contagion on the global PPE trade network (bottom layer of Fig. 1) . We investigate the shortage propagation patterns of eight sections of PPE commodities for five scenarios on export restrictions. We provide quantitative evidence that export restrictions cause shortage contagion to transmit even faster than that of the disease contagion. Besides, export restrictions delay the occurrence of shortages for self-sufficient countries, but accelerate the occurrence of shortages for not-self-sufficient countries. In addition, export restrictions lead to ineffective and inefficient allocation of PPE worldwide.",

We can observe that, compared with scenario S all where all countries restrict exports, the number of countries facing shortages decreases greatly in the early periods (from January to June) in scenario S none where no country restricts exports. Besides, the number of countries facing shortages in scenario S 5% (only the top 5% of exporters restrict exports) is nearly the same as scenario S all , which can be explained by the Pareto distribution in global exports. Counterintuitively, the number of countries facing shortages in scenario S lower (the lower half of the exporters restrict exports) is slightly fewer than that in scenario S none . The reason is as follows. The total percentages of world exports that the lower half of the exporters share are only 0.005% and 0.053% for section 1 and section 2, respectively. They can hardly help other countries manage supply shortages. Besides, exports lower the inventory level of these countries, thus, in scenario S lower , restricting exports can delay the shortages when disease arrives at these countries. These findings show that, on the one hand, agreements are urgently needed to ensure open trade between countries during the pandemic; on the other hand, such agreements should also allow countries that contribute little to global exports to impose some export restrictions in order to ensure a sufficient inventory for the upcoming pandemic. For section 1, we find that scenario S 1 leads to many more countries facing shortages as compared to scenario S none , because Germany (the largest exporter) stops supplying commodities to others. This gap shrinks for section 2, because the largest exporter (China) is the initially infected country as well. So even without export restrictions (such as scenario S none ), China has to meet the domestic demand by lowering the exports significantly.",

In section 2, we also observe that export restrictions lead to a much earlier occurrence of shortages for not-self-sufficient countries in Fig. 4 (c) and Fig. 4 (d) . The mean value of T s decreases to 22 days in scenario S all from 105 days in scenario S none . In Fig. 5 , we also present the fraction of countries with T s > T a in section 1 and the mean value of T s in section 2 for not-self-sufficient countries in all scenarios. The differences in scenarios are consistent with that in Fig. 3 . To sum up, when all countries restrict exports, almost all not-self-sufficient countries locate below the blue line, which can be observed in both section 1 and section 2, indicating that they encounter PPE shortages even before the epidemic arrival. Besides, both self-sufficient countries and not-self-sufficient countries locate farther away from each other in scenario S all than in scenario S none . Similar results to scenario S all are found in scenario S 1 and scenario S 5% . These results indicate that export restrictions delay the occurrence of shortages for self-sufficient countries, but accelerate the occurrence of shortages for not-self-sufficient countries. These results also present the double-edged nature of the PPE trade relationship between countries. On the one hand, such relationships allow countries (especially not-self-sufficient countries) to address the pandemic with the help of trading partners. On the other hand, shortage contagion can also transmit through these relationships. As illustrated in Fig. 4(c) , 80 countries suffer from shortages while only 26 countries are infected at t = 100. The surge in domestic demand in infected countries leads to a reduction in their exports. The shortage contagion then spills over to non-infected countries because the domestic demand cannot be met. However, countries can mitigate such spillover effects by increasing production while facing shortages. We present the averaged fraction of countries facing shortages for each month with different production increase factor \u03b8 p,i (t) in scenarios S none and S all in the Supplemental Material. We observe in both sections that, the number of countries facing shortages decreases greatly as \u03b8 p,i (t) grows, espe-cially at the early stage (from January to June). Besides, even as \u03b8 p,i (t) grows, there are still more countries facing shortages in scenario S all than that in scenario S none for the same \u03b8 p,i (t). These results indicate that cooperation between countries (no export restrictions) always plays an essential role in preventing global shortages of PPE regardless of the production level. But at the same time, a higher production level leads to less dependence on imports, which greatly helps countries cope with PPE shortages. Therefore, except for promoting global cooperation, governments and international organizations should take actions to reduce supply chain barriers and work together to increase global PPE production.",

In section 2, U (s) w (t) is reduced by 100%, 100%, and 0.64% for January, February, and March, respectively. These results show that, with export restrictions, a large amount of PPE is hoarded instead of being distributed to where it is most needed, particularly at the early stage. We can also find that, although there are more countries facing shortages in scenario S 5% than that in scenario S all (Fig. 3) , Inv w (t) in scenario S 5% are almost the same as or even slightly lower than that in scenario S all . From this perspective, we can conclude that the more top exporters restrict exports, the less effective the global PPE supply chain is. These findings further indicate that export restrictions are not an appropriate solution to address the pandemic. A fully functional PPE supply chain system could leave countries more time to adapt their production and identify alternative supply sources. Countries should lift the export restrictions to help allocate PPE more effectively and efficiently for the collective benefit of humankind.",

We simulated the impacts of five export restriction scenarios based on an integrated network model, which integrates the real-world PPE trade data and global mobility data. We find evidence that the shortage contagion pattern is mainly determined by the export restriction policies of the top exporters. Export restrictions can cause shortage contagion to trans- mit even faster than the disease contagion, with only the top 5% of exporters imposing export restrictions. To some extent, export restrictions can provide benefits for self-sufficient countries, at the sacrifice of immediate economic shocks at not-self-sufficient countries. The results also validate that export restrictions are not an effective and efficient solution to confront the pandemic. PPE is not properly allocated to countries with shortages. To better respond to the next wave of COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases, countries should keep PPE trade open and reduce reliance on only a small number of PPE exporters.",
