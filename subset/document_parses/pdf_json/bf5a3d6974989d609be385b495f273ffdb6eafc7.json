Most cases have been detected in the capital city, Kinshasa. In the province of North Kivu, there have been 203 cases as of August 25, 2020 . The primary mode of transmission is community based. 5 In response to the pandemic, the government declared a state of public health emergency on March 24, 2020, with broad closure of businesses, gatherings, and travel. 4 Since this initial lockdown, the government authorized gradual reopening of businesses and public transportation (July 22); schools and universities (August 3); and churches, interprovincial travel, and international airports (August 15). 4 Refugees and migrants are among the world's most vulnerable people. 6 Worldwide, there are approximately 26 million refugees and 46 million IDPs, displaced due to insecurity and natural disasters. 7 The DRC has the second highest number of IDPs of any country in the world (after Syria), estimated at more than 5.5 million. 8 Displaced populations, housed in temporary shelters or camps, generally have limited access to quality shelter, sanitation, clean water, stable food supply, and health care. Under these conditions, COVID-19 prevention efforts may be challenging. [9] [10] [11] Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on displaced populations are predicted to be disastrous. Already, resettlement procedures have been suspended by the United Nations, alongside widespread travel bans. The first case of COVID-19 in the island of Lesvos in March 2020 raised the alarm for the 20,000 residents of the Moria refugee camp, where distancing is a physical impossibility. 9 In the world's largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, which shelters more than 855,000 Rohingya refugees, preparations for COVID- 19 have begun, such as portable handwashing facilities at every community center. 12 In Nigeria, efforts to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 have included sensitization campaigns on handwashing and distribution of soap to more than 100,000 IDPs. 13 However, as noted by previous authors, recommendations for hand hygiene and physical distancing may be extremely difficult to implement in a refugee or IDP camp. How do you self-isolate in a refugee camp? 10 Several commentators have forewarned of an impending crisis if COVID-19 strikes in refugee or IDP camps. 6, 10, 12 However, a paucity of empirical data from these areas is available.",

FGDs lasted 30-45 minutes and included 3 or 4 participants in each group. 24 The FGD topic guide was adaptive, allowing us to confirm findings and explore emerging themes from each FGD session. Questions were open-ended and elastic, allowing participants to shape the discussion. FGDs were continued until saturation. 25 Thematic analysis was used to identify, analyze, and report themes in the FGDs. 26 Two investigators (KMC and MH) read the transcripts several times, noted preliminary ideas, produced initial codes, then generated and refined themes. Representative quotations as well as statements of particular interest were extracted to support the themes.",

All households living within the selected area were included, and the standardized questionnaire was administered to 1 adult member from each household. Our sampling technique was inspired by the cluster sampling method developed by the WHO for monitoring vaccine coverage. 35, 36 In this approach, a population is divided into a specified number of geographic \"clusters\" (in our case, camps) of a known or estimable population size. Within each cluster, the desired number of households are selected (in our case, approximately one-third were needed to reach the required sample size). 36 Several strategies are possible for household selection (e.g., enumeration of all households and simple random sampling from this list, or a \"random walk\" sampling contiguous households). 36 However, random selection in more densely populated areas (e.g., urban settings or, in our case, an IDP camp) can be more challenging, given the more complex household types (e.g., apartment buildings or, in our case, IDPs sheltering in school classrooms). In such settings, a common approach is to divide the geographic area of interest into zones, randomly select a zone, and randomly select a starting point within that zone. To reach our desired sample size, we needed to sample approximately one-third of the camp households. Therefore, we chose to divide the camp into thirds, choose 1 cluster at random, and sample all households within that cluster. For our comparison group, we surveyed the surrounding villages (nondisplaced population) using a nonprobability, purposive, maximum variation sampling technique, 37 choosing participants from all demographic categories (men and women, full age spectrum, employment category, education attainment, and marital status). Participants were aged 18 years or older.",

Given the radically different challenges of COVID-19 prevention in IDP camps, this study fills a gap in available data from a neglected and isolated population. IDPs differed from neighboring Congolese residents in terms of larger household size (including 46% of families with a member over the age of 60), more extreme poverty, lower educational attainment, less access to information through media and internet, less COVID-19 specific knowledge, lower rate of physical distancing, and reduced access to hand hygiene. These factors, as well as the high mobility of IDPs, leaving and reentering the camp daily for subsistence labor, establish their vulnerability to COVID-19.",

The sampling strategy for IDPs and the comparison group was not a fully random sample due to lack of detailed census information. Instead, for IDPs we used geospatial sampling 34 from 3 displacement camps. For the comparison group, we used maximum variation sampling, based on demographic features (age, sex, occupation, and educational attainment). These nonprobability sampling methods are widely used, 37 but findings may not be representative of the entire IDP population. Therefore statistical inferences should be interpreted with caution and should be confirmed in studies with a fully random sample of the population of interest (IDPs in North Kivu, DRC). For our primary analysis Given challenges with hand hygiene and physical distancing in the camps, we speculated that IDPs may have felt disempowered to take small efforts to reduce physical contact with others.",

Awareness and fear of COVID-19 was high among IDPs, but only 15% had comprehensive knowledge of the disease. Significant barriers to implementing COVID-19 prevention measures exist in IDP camps, including crowded sleeping quarters, frequent close contact with non-family members, movement in and out of the camp for work, and lack of access to hand hygiene. Poignantly, IDPs spoke of a desire for peace and a return to their homes, where they could capably prevent COVID-19 themselves. These data from a hard-to-reach population in a zone of insecurity provide a rare glimpse of the desperate conditions under which IDPs survive, leaving them vulnerable to COVID-19. These results call for an ethical, inclusive approach to the global pandemic that leaves no one behind, just as COVID-19 will not respect borders and will not leave behind refugees and IDPs. 6 ",
