Most of these meals-85% for breakfast, 74% for lunch [1] are served free or at reduced prices, targeting children at greater risk for food insecurity and poor diet. All school meals must meet USDA nutrition standards [2] that ensure all children's access to nutritious foods. Participation in the NSLP has been linked to improvements in children's dietary intake and health, with most significant gains observed among nutritionally-disadvantaged low-income children [3] [4] [5] . As school meals are almost universal (99% of US public schools and 83% of private schools participate in NSLP [6] ), any changes in school nutrition have potential to affect the diets of millions of American children. Increasing evidence suggests that the quality of diet can impact academic achievement, school attendance, long-life income, and health [7, 8] , so changes in school nutrition have implications far beyond dietary outcomes.",

As CEP eligible schools and/or school districts were not required to participate in CEP, participation decisions were choices that could be correlated with unobservable factors also affecting school and child-level outcomes. Reverse causality is another threat in that a school/district's performance on certain outcomes could affect its decision to participate in CEP. To demonstrate the point on potential selection bias into CEP, Table 1 demonstrates significant differences in the observable mean characteristics of schools that chose to participate in CEP and non-participating schools, including those that were eligible but selected not to participate. To account for potential selection bias and consistent with previous economic research [18, 19] , the analytic sample in this study was limited to children attending schools that participated in CEP at any point in our data in 2011-2016, excluding children in CEP ineligible (i.e., higher income) schools/districts and CEP eligible schools/districts that did not participate in CEP within two years of its nationwide implementation.",

Attendance was reported by school administrators as a percent of enrolled children attending school on an average day. Academic achievement included assessments of a student's proficiency in reading, math and science that were measured by direct child cognitive assessment scale scores using the Item Response Theory (IRT) procedures. The test performance metrics were transformed into z-scores normalized using grade-by-year means and variances of each subject. The child's height and weight, which were measured by the ECLS-K:2011 study's personnel, were used to construct age-and gender-specific BMI percentiles and z-scores. Indicators for child overweight (BMI percentile: 85.0-94.99) and overweight/obesity (BMI percentile: 85.0 and above) were used to assess children's BMI status. Finally, household food security was assessed based on parental responses to the 10-item version of the USDA's adult food security measure. Three binary outcomes were created, including an indicator of a food secure household (<3 affirmative responses to 10 food security items), one for low food security (3-5 affirmative responses), and one for very low food security (\u22656 affirmative responses). Adult food security was used as a measure of household food security given few reports of food disruptions among children and a very small sample size for child food security.",

This study tested the parallel trends assumption using an event study framework to account for the variation in the timing of the policy change (i.e., CEP eligibility), which is consistent with prior economic research on CEP [18, 19] . Specifically, the model in equation (1) was re-estimated by including a set of indicators to capture the years before and after the CEP introduction. The leads and lags of the CEP indicators included one year, two years and three or more years prior to the CEP adoption, and similar periods following the policy change. The results in Supplementary Materials Figures S1-S3 for the full sample show that the coefficients in the years prior to the CEP adoption were not statistically different from zero, supporting the parallel trends assumption.",

To test this hypothesis, we limited the sample to students whose change in the CEP status was due to their school's change rather than students switching schools. Specifically, 42% of children in our analytic sample changed their CEP participation status by changing schools-due to moving, a school switch, or the school district design of separate K-2 and 3-5 schools.

Our research and prior studies confirm that CEP achieves its primary goal of increasing school meal participation and expanding reach for the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, 36, 37] . We find evidence for improvements in school meal participation based on data from two independent sources, including school administrators and parents, which makes the findings more reliable. It is encouraging that the improvements seen in the school meal reach are particularly large for children who did not receive free/reduced-price school meals prior to the CEP adoption in their schools.

Conducting a national study with large heterogeneity across states could explain some of our challenges in estimating the CEP effects as well as more modest estimated effects for some findings. The sample size in several sub-group analyses was small, which might have affected the results. Future research should study the effects of CEP and UFM, especially during and after COVID-19, on household food security and child nutrition.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to the UFM implementation across all schools, irrespective of student incomes [41] , which could lead to broader adoption of CEP in the long term. Two states (CA and ME) have recently passed legislation to make UFM a permanent program [42, 43] . Our work suggests that access to UFM, without disruptions of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, will likely benefit children's nutrition security and academic achievement, particularly among children from economically-vulnerable families.

ECLS-K:2011 focused on children's early school experiences, beginning with kindergarten entry and through the fifth grade, with data collection in the fall and spring of kindergarten, first grade and second grade, and the spring of third, fourth and fifth grades. The study included parent, teacher, school administrator, and child-level data on children's cognitive and social development, home environment, test scores, child's health, body weight and height, and behavior [30] .We used child assessment, parent-, teacher-and school administrator-reported data from all six spring waves. To enable linkages between the school's location and child-level outcomes, we used a restricted version of the ECLS-K:2011 with geographic identifiers, which was provided by the National Center for Education Statistics at the US Department Acknowledgments: The authors appreciate helpful feedback from Michael W. Long and gratefully acknowledge the advice of Timothy Moore and Joochul Lee of UConn's Statistical Consulting Services.
