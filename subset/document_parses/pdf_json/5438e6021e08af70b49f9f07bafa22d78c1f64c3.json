            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm since it first began in January 2020. As of 17 October 2021, 241 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported worldwide along with 4.9 million deaths by COVID-19. 1 Being a significant global health risk, it led to a relatively quick development of vaccines. As of 14 October, more than 6.4 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, 2 with more than 41 million people in England alone receiving their first dose from December 2020 to 6 October 2021. 3 An estimated 24.9 million first doses and 24 million second doses of ChAdOx-1 nCov-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine have been administered in the UK by 6 October 2021. Vaccines against SARS-COV 2 are generally safe. With use, reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia in relation to the use of ChAdOx-1 nCov-19 vaccine began to emerge. Several case series have been published in literature describing these patients, the way they were treated and their outcomes. 4 5 These patients were generally young (aged 22-54 years), who presented 5-16 days after vaccination with thrombosis at unusual sites, thrombocytopaenia, elevated D-dimers, low/normal fibrinogen, normal PT and aPTT along with elevated titres of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF-4) heparin complex without prior exposure to heparin. In the guidelines produced by expert haematology panel (EHP) of British society of Haematology and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in UK, this syndrome has been labelled as vaccine-induced immune thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia (VITT). 6 7 The spectrum of clinical features and lab findings strongly resemble autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia. 8 Up till 6 October 2021, 424 cases have been reported with a fatality rate of 17% and an overall incidence after the first or unknown dose being 15.2 per million doses. Forty-six out of 424 cases have been reported after a second dose with an overall incidence after second dose being 1.9 cases per million doses. 3 Such low incidence rates make it a very rare side effect of the vaccine. One hundred and fifty-one out of 424 reported patients had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), making this the most common site for thrombosis. CVST carries high mortality in patients with VITT, with odds of death being increased by a factor of 2.7. 9 EHP has identified five criteria which can be used to classify a VITT case into one of four categories to prioritise and guide further management. These are definite, probable, possible and unlikely. These criteria are (1) onset of symptoms 5-30 days post COVID-19 vaccine, (2) presence of thrombosis, (3) thrombocytopaenia, (4) D-Dimers>4000 \u03bcg/mL (Fibrinogen Equivalent Units) and (5) positive anti-PF-4 antibodies ELISA assay. We describe a case of a patient who presented with CVST in association with ChAdOx-1 nCov-19 vaccine who received prompt treatment and remained well without any complications.",

The headache gradually worsened over the course of next 2 weeks. It was predominantly right sided, radiating from occipital region to the forehead and neck, constant and worsened when turning head to the right or when lying down. Pain was not increased with straining or leaning forward. It was not associated with disturbances in gait, speech, balance, diplopia, decreased vision, abnormal movements, limb weakness or paraesthesia. She did notice flashing lights in her field of vision, photophobia and phonophobia. Hours before presentation, pain was so severe that it woke her up from sleep and she vomited a few times. She did not have any fever, rashes, mouth ulcers, ear pain or discharge. She was a previously fit and physically active person who had recently started a new job. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was no past medical history or family history of blood clots or migraine. Three months prior to presentation, she was started on hormone replacement therapy for her perimenopausal symptoms.

Affected patients did not receive any heparin in 3 months prior to presentation and no underlying condition or medication usage has been clearly identified as a risk factor. Thrombosis most commonly involves cerebral venous sinuses. In the study by Pavord et al, CVST was found in 50% patients followed by thrombosis in deep veins and pulmonary arteries in 37% patients. Other less common sites included splanchnic circulation and arterial thrombi in aorta, coronary and cerebral arteries. 9 More than one vascular bed may be involved.",

In such cases, platelet counts should be repeated if strong suspicion remains. Once thrombocytopaenia is confirmed or if strong clinical suspicion remains, D-dimers, PT, aPTT and Clauss fibrinogen should be sent. D-dimers>4000 \u03bcg/L and low levels of Fibrinogen increase the likelihood of VITT, although fibrinogen can be normal. On admission, our patient had low platelets, D-dimers>6000 ng/mL, normal fibrinogen, PT and aPTT. In cases of possible VITT with strong suspicion or probable VITT, samples for anti-PF-4 antibodies by HIT ELISA method should be sent. 6 In the study by Pavord et al, anti-PF-4 antibodies were detected in overwhelming majority of patients with definite or probable VITT although they were negative in 6 (2.7%) patients. For such cases of probable VITT where anti-PF-4 antibody is negative, NICE recommends discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting whether treatment should be continued. 7 Based on case definition criteria, our patient had definite VITT as all the criteria were met.

For thrombosis, anticoagulation with non-heparin based agents such as direct oral anticoagulants, fondaparinaux, danaparoid and argatroban should be used while heparin-based agents and warfarin should be avoided. In cases where there is high risk of bleeding such as platelets <30\u00d710 9 /L or when surgery is being considered, Argatroban should be used. Use of fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate should be considered to keep fibrinogen >1.5 g/L.
