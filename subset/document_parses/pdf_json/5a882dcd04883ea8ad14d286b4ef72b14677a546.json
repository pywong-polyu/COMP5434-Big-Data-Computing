Some studies have reported differences in anxiety about the future by gender in favor of females, and by social status in favor of the unmarried. No differences were found by profession [22] [23] [24] . Low-to-average anxiety levels were found between participants. The frequency of mild, average, and severe anxiety among participants was 7.7-78.8%, 5.6%, and 2.7-5.2%, respectively. The study did not find gender differences in depression and anxiety. On the other hand, it found differences in favor of the unmarried [25] . The authors in [15] found higher levels of anxiety among students than those among employeesworking personnel. The level of anxiety did not correlate with social status, the size of the family, or age. Similarly, social status, having no children, and workplace did not significantly contribute to anxiety or depression [16] .",

            "text": "Smartphone use has been globally widespread during the coronavirus pandemic, which has induced feelings of isolation, social distancing, and a need for leisure, recreation, and shopping [26] . With this intensive use, smartphone addiction has become a universal concern [27] . It is a recent phenomenon in human behavior that can adversely affect the mental health and social functioning of people who overuse smartphones [28] . Smartphone addiction is the overuse or compulsive use of smartphones, resulting in negative consequences in social, behavioral, and emotional functioning [29] . It is a form of behavioral addiction that makes the individual unable to control the strong desire to use the smartphone and its applications, with the loss of productivity, the denial of negative effects, preoccupation, and feelings of annoyance and even panic when deprived of the smartphone [30] . Some studies have shown a connection between smartphone addiction and psychological adjustment problems, e.g., anxiety and depression. A Korean study found that smartphone addiction can be predicted by depression [31] . A similar finding was also reached in a Chinese study [32] , where loneliness, which relates to depression, was found to be a strong predictor of smartphone addiction. In an American study, social interaction anxiety was found to predict smartphone addiction [33] . Another study found a positive correlation between anxiety and depression and smartphone overuse [34] . Smartphone addiction could be predicted by anxiety and depression. Anxiety as a major symptom of smartphone addiction emerges once the person is deprived of their smartphone [35, 36] . This shows that the smartphone itself is a source of anxiety [37] . Smartphone overuse is a factor leading to mental health problems. They also found that gender was the strongest predictor of depression. Symptoms of anxiety were more frequent in younger people [38] . A positive correlation between smartphone addiction and psychological stress was also found. Research also revealed a weak relationship between age and hours of use on the one hand, and smartphone addiction on the other [39] .",

This finding largely concurs with the findings of previous studies conducted in some Gulf states during the outbreak of the pandemic. Those studies reported average anxiety and stress resulting from the pandemic [13, 14] . The percentages here were also close to their counterparts in the Chinese study [15] , and slightly higher in high anxiety than the percentages in the Italian study [16] . The current percentages, showing average and high anxiety, exceeded their counterparts in the Australian study [25] . Data collection in the present study coincided with the application of strict health procedures in all countries globally, e.g., the prohibition of gatherings and curfews.",

This finding seems logical given that Egypt, in comparison with Jordan, was late in imposing health restrictions and giving the real numbers of infected cases. Unlike Egypt, Jordan took actions with the appearance of the first infected case. Jordan imposed a curfew and closed schools, governmental institutions, mosques, and airports. Such procedures largely reduced the number of infected cases. Accordingly, the number of infected cases in Jordan up to 7 July was 1167, with a recovery rate of 82% and a death rate of 0.08%. On the other hand, the number of infected cases in Egypt up to 7 July was 76,222, with a recovery rate of 28% and death rate of 4.5%. This may refer to a deficiency in health procedures and the provision of health support to critical cases that required special and costly treatment protocols. Egypt's population is also more than 100 million. The frequency of high anxiety (15.1%) in Egypt exceeded its counterparts in a number of Arab and Asian countries that were covered in previous studies [13] [14] [15] [16] 25] .",

Those respondents live with their families and work in various sectors in the country. Male residents in the United Arab Emirates may have higher levels of anxiety than females do because of fears about their jobs with the economic damages resulting from the pandemic. Some sectors there made some employees redundant or reduced their salaries. For this reason, non-Emirati male employees may fear the loss of their jobs and becoming unable to sustain their families. Women, on the other hand, do not have these fears because women in Eastern societies are not required to work and sustain their families. Furthermore, women stay at home most of the time, which makes them less anxious about catching the infection. This finding is consistent with [14] , in which residents had higher levels of anxiety because of the lack of occupational security and being in countries other than their own. This finding is also consistent with studies investigating general anxiety and anxiety about the future, in which males were reported to have higher levels of anxiety than females [21, 58] .",

Participants working for the government and the private sector and students had comparable levels of anxiety about infection. This finding is consistent with [16] , and with studies that did not find differences in general anxiety by workplace [22] [23] [24] . However, it is inconsistent with [15] , in which students outnumbered employees in terms of anxiety, and with [14] , in which unemployed respondents outnumbered employees in terms of infection anxiety. Overall, social status and workplace need to be further studied with other variables such as educational level, income, and age because of the inconsistent results about the latter two variables in the few studies conducted so far.",

This means that people who are more anxious about infection tend to excessively use their smartphone.

With the outbreak of the coronavirus, and restrictions such as social distancing and staying at home most of the time, the smartphone can be the only resort for people in order to vent, pass time, and search for information about the virus. The smartphone is also used for distant learning due to the closure of schools. People may therefore excessively use the smartphone to the degree that they cannot control the time spent in its use. This, in turn, can lead to compulsivity, sleep interference, and excessive attachment to the smartphone, which are all symptoms of addiction. This concurs with [35, 36] , reporting anxiety as a major symptom of smartphone addiction. It also concurs with the assertion of [59] that overdependence on smartphones and the use of social media to know about current events can result in the fear of missing events, known as \"fear of missing out\". The finding that daily use hours contribute to smartphone addiction is consistent with some studies [42] [43] [44] [45] , and is inconsistent with [39] , in which a weak relationship was found between smartphone use hours and addiction.",

The study also revealed that infection anxiety can lead to smartphone addiction, with all its negative psychological and physical effects, as well as the disorder known as nomophobia. Women were found to be more anxious about infection. Anxiety about infection and daily use hours were found to significantly contribute to smartphone addiction. It is therefore necessary to develop preventive programs to eliminate this phenomenon. Awareness must also be raised about the judicious use of smartphones. People should be advised on how to find alternative ways to fruitfully spend time, control their desire to use smartphones, and sterilize their phones, which can be a source of infection. It is also recommended that social media should be used to support people during the pandemic, and instruct them on how to keep safe and manage their anxiety. They should be told not to show fear and anxiety in front of their children, as this can leave negative effects on their development. People, especially mothers, should be advised not to spend too much time on social media, as this can make them anxious. This can adversely affect childcare, which might cause insecure attachment. During quarantine, people should telecommunicate with relatives to alleviate the impact of social isolation on children and adolescents. People can make an opportunity out of the crisis to practice activities and hobbies for which they previously had no time. Adults should distract children and adolescents from bad news by providing them with daily home activities and events. The use of smartphones and electronic games by children should be monitored so that they do not become addicted to them.",

Anxiety about COVID-19 infection was the best predictor of smartphone addiction, as it could explain 0.181 of the variance in smartphone addiction. The interaction of anxiety about COVID-19 infection and daily smartphone use hours explained 0.273 of the variance in anxiety about COVID-19 infection. Thus, the daily use hours variable could predict an additional amount of smartphone addiction of 0.090, which was significant at the 0.01 level. The prediction equation can be stated as follows: smartphone addiction = 31.160 + 0.168 \u00d7 anxiety about COVID-19 infection + 1.127 \u00d7 daily use hours.",
