In the early days of the pandemic the health and economic effects of COVID-19 were obvious in the high income countries of Europe and America and it was expected that the effect of the disease may be more marked in low income countries [2] . At the onset, many public safety and non-pharmacologic measures were instituted to limit the spread of the virus. These measures included the closure of international borders, lockdown order within countries, stay-at-home order for citizens, restriction of public gatherings as well as the ban on nonessential travel [3] [4] [5] . These aforementioned measures have since been relaxed in many countries of the world. However, the non-pharmacological preventive measures which are still in force to varying degrees include the use of facemasks, frequent hand washing with soap and running water, sanitizing with alcohol-based hand rub, and physical/social distancing [6, 7] .",

Nigeria at the time of our analysis has a CFR value that falls in the midrange of the CFR values of different countries of the World. When compared with the countries six cultural/ geographical neighbours, the country ranked 4th with Togo, Ghana and Benin having lower CFR. Comparing the CFR in Nigeria to continental averages showed that while Africa still has the worst continental value, the CFR in Nigeria is only higher than that of Asia and Oceania. It is pertinent to note that the SARS CoV2 virus originated from Asia [31] and more insight will be obtained if we are to drill down on the trend of the CFR on this continent. When these countries with similar HDI were compared with Nigeria, the country ranked 5 out of 7 with Cote d'Ivoire and Central African Republic having a lower CFR. When these two groups of countries (low and high HDI) were compared our finding showed that the CFR is expectedly significantly higher in countries with low HDI. This perhaps suggests that factors such as health facility infrastructure and capacity may have a larger influence on the CFR.",

It is therefore not expected to be among countries with the lowest CFR. Similarly, countries like Bhutan (also a landlocked country) and Laos can be regarded as developing countries [34, 35] . We explored the link between being landlocked and the possibility of limiting exposure to visitors and the different variants of the SARs CoV2 virus but Bhutan enjoys robust interactions with foreigners due to the recreational mountaineering activities [36] , though these recreational activities may have been slowed down by the country response which included two lock-downs implemented in the country so far [37] .",
