The disease, now named Coronavirus disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and rapidly spread worldwide. Since 26 February 2020, when the first case was reported in Brazil, COVID-19 has caused a huge number of infections [1]. On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and is continuing to spread globally. As of June 2021, 180 million cases with more than 3.89 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. In much of South America, the pandemic is currently spreading out of control. A total of 18.2 million SARS-CoV-2 cases have been reported in Brazil through June 2021, resulting in 507,109,000 deaths [1]. Among these confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazil, 14, 484 have been in pregnant women, 1461 (10.1%) of whom have died [2] .",

From 13 April to 17 June 2020, all pregnant women admitted to the maternity unit were invited to participate in this study. The inclusion criteria were: admission to the maternity unit during gestation, \u226518 years of age, willingness to have nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provided signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria were women not willing to participate and subsequent admissions in the same pregnancy during the study period. Sampling was not longitudinal as most patients received prenatal care at other health institutions, delivered at our hospital, and post-natal follow-up occurred elsewhere.",

This study defined HIV using the following testing algorithm [10]: 1. A plasma sample was tested for HIV-1 by either a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) (Abbott ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA) or an Abbott real time HIV-1 viral load test (Abbott Real-time HIV-1 Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Next, a second sample from the same participant was tested by CLIA or an Abbott. If both samples were positive for HIV-1, the participant was classified as living with HIV. Nasopharyngeal swabs were systematically collected according to established protocols [11] within 24 h of admission to the maternity. Swabs were refrigerated upon collection and were transported within 2 h to the Molecular Virology Reference Laboratory at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from swab media were extracted in the Maxwell MDX Promega automated machine using the Maxwell16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). RT-PCR was standardized in the laboratory using RT-PCR 7500 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the Gotaq one-step Probe RT-qPCR System (Pomega). We have strictly followed the CDC protocol [12] which uses the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid targets-N1 and N2-and human RNase P (RP) as control target. After 45 amplification cycles, RT-PCR positive were defined for samples with cycle threshold (ct) below or equal to 38, negative above 40 ct and inconclusive between these ct values. To define the assay limit of detection (LoD) value, we first defined the number of RNA copies of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate by digital PCR. We then made 12 dilutions (a Log2 series) of this viral isolate specimen and eight replicates of each dilution to calculate the LoD by Probit analysis. We figure that the assay has a LoD of 10 copies of viral RNA per 200 \u00b5L of swab media. Serum samples were collected within 24 h of admission to the maternity for serology diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (IgG serology) and processed at Virology Molecular Reference Laboratory (LVM) at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. The ELISA assay for detection of IgG was developed and validated at the LVM, using the spike protein as antigen, according to protocol described by Perera et al. [13] .",

Furthermore, as the site is a reference center for high-risk pregnancies, it is not surprising that preterm births and malformations occurred during the study.

In our study, fully 25 (22%) of the study participants were women living with HIV. As the study site is a reference center for HIV in pregnancy, one of the principal comorbidities was HIV. This institution is also a center for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission where testing for HIV is universal during prenatal care and at delivery and cART is the standard of care. Another study in South Africa reported that living with HIV worsened the severity of COVID-19; however, like our study, a number of others have found no evidence of worse clinical outcomes [32] [33] [34] [35] . This population has a higher prevalence of HIV than other populations of pregnant women in which COVID-19 has been investigated, have taken cART as the standard of care with good adherence, had suppressed viral load and high CD4 cell counts. This could partially explain why the severity of COVID-19 among the participants was minimal in our setting.",
