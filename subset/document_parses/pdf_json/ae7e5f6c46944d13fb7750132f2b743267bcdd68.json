The vanilla federated averaging algorithm makes it possible to obtain more generalizable deep learning-based segmentation models representing the training data from multiple institutions without centralizing datasets. However, it might be sub-optimal for the aforementioned multi-task scenarios. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous optimization methods that show improvements for the automated segmentation of pancreas and pancreatic tumors in abdominal CT images with FL settings.",

Techniques proposed for multi-task learning can be an alternative to tackle the heterogeneous statistical problems [15] . Dynamic task prioritization (DTP) specifies a prioritization for each task in multi-task learning based on the task-specific metrics [4] .

Three local models are standalone-training results for their corresponding datasets. The global model resulting from FedAvg performs well in the TCIA dataset, and the MSD pancreas compares to local models. Moreover, for the MSD tumor and Synapse dataset, although the performance is not as high as corresponding local models, there is still a significant improvement to other local models, indicating the improved generalizability of the global models. The FedProx model shows similar performance as the FedAvg model. In the MSD dataset, the average Dice score of the pancreas and tumor is slightly lower than the result of the FedAvg model. However, the average Dice score of the Synapse dataset is significantly higher than the result of the FedAvg model. The performance of DTP models is generally lower than the FedAvg baseline and DWA results. Nonetheless, in most settings, DTP models still outperform the local models. Furthermore, compared to the DWA results, the performance on MSD tumors is more consistent. Both FedAvg and FedProx are commonly used in FL, and our experiments suggest that both methods already provide a strong baseline performance even on heterogeneous datasets. In DTP, the dynamic prioritization weight focuses on the most challenging tasks by adjusting the magnitude of the loss. However, each client only calculates the prioritization weights using local batch data. The lack of a global perspective of the training can therefore limit the performance of DTP. Also, DTP scales the magnitude of the loss, disrupting the optimization and increasing the need for further hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, with most DWA configurations, the Synapse dataset's performance is markedly higher than the FedAvg baseline. The results show that DWA can outperform both FedAvg and FedProx on average with properly selected hyperparameters. ",
