In China, as of the end of 2018, there were 2.044 million drug users and 0.504 million relapsers (2) . As a common and longterm recurrent mental illness (3) , substance dependence poses a huge threat to human physical and mental health (4), placing a serious burden on the economy and society (5) . Despite the serious adverse consequences, drug users still show obsessive drug cravings (6) . Despite the best medical treatment and rehabilitation support, the relapse rate among patients with substance use disorder (SUD) remains high (7) . According to reports, the relapse rate within 1 year is 40-60% (8), while it is as high as 90% under the same conditions in China (9) . Relapse tendency refers to the possibility and willingness of relapse behavior, which is an important prerequisite for an individual to produce a specific behavior (10) . The higher the tendency of relapse, the higher the probability of relapse behavior (11) . Conventional treatment and rehabilitation mainly include medications and psychotherapy. Till now, there is no sufficient evidence to show that any drug has a significant effect in treating substance dependence and reducing the relapse rate (12) . SUD patients have difficulty withdrawing and a high relapse rate, not only lying physical dependence, but also in the difficulty of getting rid of psychological dependence (13) . Compared with drug therapy, psychotherapy is not only more operable, but also avoids adverse drug reactions and potential negative effects between drugs (14) . Therefore, the psychological mechanisms of the relapse tendency in SUD patients warrant further study.",

Family system theory (17) points out that as a dynamic whole, there are direct or indirect interactions among the various subsystems of the family, such as the husbandwife subsystem, parent-child subsystem and sibling subsystem. The family function is a common factor closely associated with substance dependence (16) . Daniel et al. found that the public environment, especially within the family, would affect future drug abuse behavior. Specifically, the family function is considered to be the potential trigger of substance dependence (16) . A study found that family function had a significant negative impact on substance dependence in the Iranian military (18) . A longitudinal study showed that family support and encouragement play an important role in preventing relapse, and a good family environment would not only supervise them, but also enhance the guilt of patients with SUD and help reduce addictive behavior (19) . The buffer model of social support argues that good social support plays a protective role in the stressful states and buffering stress (20) . As the smallest unit of social groups, the family is very important to everyone. Individuals with good family support have higher levels of family function, enabling individuals to actively cope with and relieve negative emotions and stress, and reduce the tendency of relapse (21) . However, the specific mechanism of the relationship between family function and relapse tendency is not clear.",

A longitudinal study reported that family functions have a long-term and lasting impact on the development of individual self-esteem (27) . People with low self-esteem often feel inferior, depressed, desperate, and even suffer from mental illness (28) . In addition, individuals with low self-esteem tend to use the substance to meet their self-esteem needs, thereby controlling their emotions (29) . However, positive psychological capital, such as self-esteem, is an effective protective factor against substance dependence (30) . When SUD patients have a higher level of psychological capital, they maintain a more positive attitude toward life, and have a higher sense of self-efficacy. Further, they have a strong motivation for detoxification, and can resist the temptation of drugs, so their tendency to relapse will also be reduced (31) . So far, there have been few studies on the role of self-esteem between family function and relapse tendency.",

It is an internal factor that helps individuals cope with and adapt to external pressure (32) . Therefore, resilience depends on the strength of the individual and the resources provided by the favorable environment (33) . It is reported that individuals with high resilience tend to face stress more flexibly and dynamically, and recover faster from negative emotions, which is an important protective factor for physical and mental health (34) . Hence, more and more studies pay attention to the inherent protective factors of psychological resilience, such as self-esteem (35) . High self-esteem is a protective factor of resilience, while resilience is a promoting factor of self-esteem, showing a close relationship between the two (36) . Further, a cross-sectional study found that higher resilience may reduce the tendency for smoking, nicotine dependence, lifelong alcohol consumption and substance use (37) . Resilience can reduce the risk of substance dependence through effective emotional regulation, tolerance of negative emotions, or actively seeking support (38) . Most research on self-esteem and psychological resilience is conducted among students, not SUD patients. Studies have found that close family emotional bonds can enhance the positive psychological capital and qualities of SUD patients such as optimism, self-confidence, resilience and selfefficacy (21) . Therefore, it is necessary to explore the sequential effect of self-esteem and resilience between family function and relapse tendency.",

Additionally, they lack the psychological resources and social support to resist drug cravings when they face negative life events or difficulties (46, 47) . Also, they lack positive ways to solve the problem. It is easy to temporarily evade or reduce negative emotional experiences such as anxiety, helplessness and depression by retaking drugs (48) . In addition, it is believed that there is a bidirectional relationship between family function and drug abuse. When there is a SUD patient in the family, the family relationships will be materially and negatively affected (49) , such as blame, anger and even alienation. The increase of family conflicts and family dysfunction (50) , in turn, prompted these patients to relieve stress and negative emotions through relapse, creating a vicious circle.",

This finding is also consistent with the previous study (52) . Kaplan et al. believed that family is one of the important protective factors for resilience (53) , also supported by some other studies (54, 55) . An intervention study on SUD patients showed that interventions in their resilience could effectively reduce the recurrence rate (56) . The family functions of SUD patients are poor (57) . When individuals encounter setbacks or adversity, it is difficult to obtain support from their families, and thus they are unable to possess resilience. The lack of resilience usually means that it is more difficult for individuals to solve the problems in face of stressful situations. At the same time, studies have confirmed that individuals are at a greatly increased risk of substance dependence in stressful situations (58) . Thus, the family function may influence the relapse tendency through the intermediary role of self-esteem and resilience in SUD patients.",

At the same time, individuals with low levels of self-esteem cannot always face problems correctly and solve them actively, making them unable to recover quickly when they encounter difficulties.

Fourth, some other information was not collected, such as addiction severity, drug use trajectories, income, and details of legal drug use, which were helpful to render the data interpretable. Finally, all the recruited SUD patients were from Tianjin, so it is unknown whether the conclusion can be extended to and settings.
