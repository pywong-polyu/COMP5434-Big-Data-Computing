We find high cholesterol adsorption and preferential affinity of anionic surfactants to Arginine and Lysine residues within S1 receptor binding motif.

COVID-19 is transmitted by inhaling airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, which infect the respiratory system and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that can lead to lung failure. Whereas our knowledge of the biochemical structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 is quickly growing, the physico-chemical aspects of virus interactions with the respiratory system environment have been sparsely addressed and are poorly understood. Bridging this knowledge gap is important for informing clinical studies on surfactant therapies by administering respiratory and exogenous surfactants that can hinder virus proliferation and penetrations into the cells. The search for suitable therapeutic surfactants is actively expanding. [1] [2] [3] [4] Here, we explore by using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations the mechanisms of preferential adsorption of typical pulmonary and exogenous surfactants on SARS-CoV-2 virions that may lead to virus inactivation.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 virions, which contain and protect the virus RNA, are spheroidal nanoparticles, with a lipid bilayer envelope of about 85 nm diameter decorated by a \"crown\" of 20 nm long protrusions of Spike protein. Being inhaled, SARS-CoV-2 virions travel through lung airways and interact with respiratory surfactant monolayer films coating alveoli that composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and surfactant proteins, known as the lung surfactant (LS). The virion attachment to cells occurs by binding of S1 domain of Spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the type II pneumocytes of the alveoli. [5] [6] The LS film regulates surface tension at the alveolar interfaces to help breathing and prevent lung collapse during expansion-contraction cycles. 7 LS film is also the first line of defense against inhaled airborne particles. 3 Surfactant-induced inactivation of viruses has been a traditional topic of clinical studies before the COVID-19 pandemic. 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Surfactants, that have been found effective in inactivating various types viruses and in restoring the lung damage, include soap 10 , sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 11 phospholipids, 12 sodium laureth sulphate, 13 and potassium oleate 9 (see review by Simon et al 4 ). The virus inactivation may occur (1) by surfactant penetration into viral envelope lipid membrane leading to its lysis and (2) surfactant adsorption on viral proteins that plays crucial role in the infection process and the stability of the virus. 4 While viral lysis was observed at high surfactant concentrations that can be cytotoxic, functional inactivation of viral proteins by surfactant adsorption was found at low surfactant concentrations suitable for therapeutic administration. 4 Despite recent great progress in molecular simulations of coronaviruses, including simulations of systems containing several to hundreds of millions of atoms, [14] [15] [16] no attempts have been made to study the interfacial interactions of SARS-CoV-2 virions with pulmonary and exogenous surfactants that is the focus of this work. Our main goal is to mimic in-silico surfactant adsorption on the S1 domain that is responsible for ACE2 binding. Spike protein, a trimer of the 1273-residue S-protein, 17 has two functional domains, S1 (1-685) and S2 (686-1273). S1 binds to ACE2 with its receptor binding domain (RBD 319-546), while S2 assists in fusion of the virion and host cell membranes. The N-terminal domain (NTD 14-305) of S1 binds to sugar molecules. 18 The main functional region in RBD is the receptor binding motif (RBM 438-506). 19 We perform CGMD MARTINI 20-21 simulations of surfactant adsorption on the S1 domain. Three typical surfactants are considered: zwitterionic phospholipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC) and cholesterol (CHOL), that are main components of LS films, and anionic sodium dodecyl sulphate, that is considered as a potential exogenous surfactant with a therapeutic effect. 22 The MARTINI model of S1 domain is constructed utilizing the Spike protein structure predicted by I-TASSER 23-24 ( Figure S1a ). Simulations are performed at the physiological conditions (310 K, 1 bar). The S1 domain is initially placed in the center of the 18 nm cubic simulation box filled with water and surfactant molecules dispersed around the protein at random positions. To demonstrate the difference in surfactant -protein interactions, we explore 7 surfactant compositions: 3 single component solutions and 4 binary mixtures containing DPPC and CHOL at 4:1 and 1:1 ratios, DPPC and SDS at 1:1 ratio, and CHOL and SDS at 1:1 ratio. The total number of surfactant molecules varies between 10-50. 4 replicas of each system are simulated for good statistics (in total -136 simulations). The simulations are run for 1 and the statistics is averaged over the last 200 ns and over the replicas. Details of the CG models schematically shown in Figure 1 and CGMD simulations are provided in the Supporting Information (SI) Section 1.",

In the single component surfactant systems ( Figure  1a ), DPPC shows a high tendency to aggregate into large clusters that adhere to the protein, which results in fewer direct lipid-protein contacts. In comparison, cholesterol exhibits a much lower aggregation tendency owing to its wedge-like shape that hinders micellization and, consequently, enhances direct lipid-protein interactions. SDS forms pronounced micellar aggregates, similarly to DPPC. Being a smaller molecule with a simpler structure, SDS adsorbs to the protein more effectively compared to DPPC (see below).

Note that here we deal with reversible physical adsorption of surfactants. ( ) is averaged over the data from 4 replicate simulations with 5 different surfactant concentrations. Averaging over a total of 20 simulations for each surfactant provides reliable statistics for determining the regions of the protein that are preferential for surfactant adsorption. As depicted in Figure 1b -c, ( ) exhibits similar patterns for all the three surfactants, which identify the blocks of residues,1-14, 100-150, 170-250, 320-506 and 530-600, as having high affinity to surfactants, in contrast to blocks 14-100, and 250-320, where surfactant adsorption is less probable (see detailed analysis in Figure S3 -S4). Figure 1c demonstrates the distribution of S1 residues with respect of their affinity to surfactant adsorption. Note that the RBD and RBM sub-domains represent preferential regions for adhesion of surfactant aggregates. The difference in adsorption of the considered surfactants is further demonstrated with the overall surfactant adsorption probability averaged across the whole S1 domain (SI section 2) at a given molar surfactant concentration, that predicts distinctively a higher adsorption probability of cholesterol compared to DPPC and SDS, (DPPC), indicating distinctively higher cholesterol adsorption. Note that SDS has a higher affinity to S1 compared to DPPC, despite lower adsorption probabilities (Figure 1b-c and 2a) . SDS is a much smaller molecule and thus make less direct contacts with residues compared to DPPC. The fractions of different surfactant fragments (heads and tails) or a bead type that are in contact with the protein, provides a more detailed characterization of the adsorbed surfactants ( Figure 3 ). For instance, 4 represents the ratio of number of PO4 beads in direct contact with the protein residues to the total number of PO4 beads, and so on. In one-component surfactant systems (Figure 3b) , reveals: (CHOL) > (SDS) > (DPPC), which is a much-pronounced trend compared to . Adsorption of DPPC occurs preferentially by hydrophobic tail and glycerol backbone. There is a preference for adsorption of the anionic PO4 over the cationic choline that has the least affinity to the protein. In SDS, the anionic SO3 group has a like affinity to the protein as other uncharged fragments. In general, a clear preference for adsorption of anionic fragments is observed in all systems considered. For cholesterol, the highest affinity to the protein is found for the hydrophilic ROH fragment followed by the aromatic R1-R5 and the aliphatic tail C1/C2 fragments. Note that the observed difference in surfactant adsorption correlates with the affinity of the surfactant head groups. This is explained in part by the fact that in surfactant aggregates adhering to the protein, direct contacts of the tail groups are hindered, while the head groups are located closer to the protein. In mixtures, surfactant adsorption is affected by the interactions between different components. In DPPC-CHOL mixtures (Figure 3c-d) , cholesterol adsorption is reduced, while DPPC adhesion is slightly enhanced compared to the respective single-component solutions. This is explained by CHOL association with DPPC that hinders the CHOL-protein contacts and reduces the aggregate size, enhancing DPPC-protein adsorption. In DPPC-SDS systems, SDS adsorption is suppressed (Figure 3e ) due to the electrostatic attraction between 3 \u2212 and choline groups that favors DPPC-SDS aggregation. Adsorption in SDS-CHOL systems seem to be unaffected by the inter-surfactant interactions (Figure 3f ), although the 3 \u2212 adsorption appears to be somewhat enhanced.",

These ionic residues, a total of 113, present in similar amounts evenly distributed along the chain, gives the S1 domain an overall cationic character. The observed ability of surfactants to be adsorbed on cationic residues presents a special interest, as the overall cationic character of S1 domain with a net charge of +5 is the driving force for the Spike protein binding to highly negatively charged ACE2 protein. 25 Understanding the surfactant affinities of various amino acid residues shown in Figure 4 helps to predict the behavior of the CoV-2 variants. S1 domain is strongly cationic with ARG and LYS being preferential sites for surfactant adsorption. However, the roles of ARG and LYS might be not just electrostatic but also residue-specific with additional surfactant interactions with the side chains, which are attractive to non-ionic and zwitterionic surfactants. Noteworthy, the key mutations in the S1 domain of the highly infectious Delta 26 and, especially, Omicron 27 variants (Table S2 ) increase the total number of Arginine and Lysine. The S1 mutations in Delta increase the numbers of ARG by 2 and LYS by 1 and reduce number of GLU by 1, while in the S1 domain of Omicron, ARG is increased by 2 and LYS by 3. The increase in cationic residues may be one of the factors of the high infectivity of CoV-2 variants. In this respect, it is instructive that our simulations suggest that the cationic residues can be effectively targeted by surfactants.",

The adsorption process proceeds by forming surfactant aggregates adhered on the protein. Adsorption of cholesterol is more efficient than other surfactants, that explains recent experimental observations that cholesterol enhances the Spike interactions with model membranes. 28 The anionic surfactants have a higher affinity to S1 domain, tending to be adsorbed on cationic Arginine and Lysine residues, which are present in higher quantities in Delta and Omicron variants. The latter effect may have important implications for the search of extraneous therapeutic surfactant that can potentially hinder binding of Spike proteins with ACE2.

This S1 fragment is converted to MARTINI CG representation ( Figure S1a ) and the corresponding force field parameters are obtained, using the martinize.py script. The CG MARTINI 1-3 employs a general 4-1 mapping; approximately, 4 heavy atoms are grouped into a CG bead. In the all-atom representation, the S1 domain consist of 10681atoms (including hydrogens) while in the CG model it consists of just 1556 CG atoms. The CG models of the surfactants ( Figure S1b) , DPPC, Cholesterol and SDS, are taken from the structure files available from the MARTINI website (http://cgmartini.nl/). DPPC is modelled into a 12-bead representation with head group containing the choline, and phosphate beads and two glycerol beads, and two tails containing 4 beads each. Cholesterol has a head group with OH containing ROH group connected to the 5-bead aromatic ring region (R1-R5) and a 2-bead aliphatic tail. SDS is dissociated in the solutions into DSand sodium ions.
