The rapid spread of the virus, together with the high mortality rate in the early period of the outbreak, forced the governments to deploy intervention policies such as lock-down of cities, or restricting the social life considerably. These policies have indeed shown their effect on controlling the spread of the virus, but also caused significant harm to the economies. In addition, parts of the populations of many countries have become annoyed by restrictions, and the desire for returning to normal has been getting stronger with time. However, recent observations revealed that second (or later) waves of infection can indeed be triggered once the policies are relaxed, and these waves are experienced to have higher amplitudes than the first one in several countries. As the availability and distribution of vaccines still is a certain time ahead (as of November 2020), governments are forced to deploy restrictions like lock-down policies again in order to mitigate the second or a later wave. Simple intervention scheme of the type of bang-bang control, as switching repeatedly between complete shutdown and no restrictions, quickly lets authorities loose credibility, and the effectiveness of intervention measures gradually decreases over time. This raises the question of which intervention schemes are more suitable, and this paper intends to address this question from the perspective of control theory.",

The goal is to use the experience gathered during the first wave of infection, such as the average infecting rate of the virus, the average healing time of the patients, effectiveness of different policies in controlling the spread of the virus, or the socio-economic costs of these policies. The intervention policies considered here include, among others, wearing masks, social distancing in different regions, reserving medical staff for COVID-19 patients, or introducing traffic limitation between different regions and countries. The geographic adjacency between regions is also taken into account, such that each region can deploy its own policy against the virus. This setting can help to evaluate whether a common intervention policy of different regions is necessary. It is stressed here that, while the models and measures are adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic, the insights and findings should be transferable with suitable modifications to other pandemics as well. The next section first provides a review on existing work on epidemic modeling and control problems, with distinction of whether the work refers to periods before or after the outbreak of COVID-19. In Sec. 3, the nonlinear epidemic model, the input and state constraints, and the cost functions of the considered MPC approach are specified. Section 4 compares strategies obtained from MPC with simpler schemes such as bang-bang policies.

The healing and infection of any person i \u2208 N = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n} of a Markov model are described by two independent Poisson processes with rates \u03b4 i and \u03b2 i , respectively. Although the 2 n Markov model describes the spread of a virus disease often fairly well, its shortcoming is obvious: the state-space size grows exponentially with the number n. Accordingly, an N \u2212 Intertwined model has been proposed in Gourdin et al. (2011) , in which a mean-field type approximation technique is applied to approximate the 2 n Markov model. This approximation enables one to only use a set of n nonlinear ordinary differential equations to describe the dynamics of the epidemic, i.e., by using p i (t) to denote the probability of person i being infected in time t, the following dynamics applies:",

A quite detailed review to these adaptations is given in Kantner and Koprucki (2020) . The work in Giordano et al. (2020) extended the SIS model to a more explicit one, the socalled SIDARTHE model accounting for the pandemic in Italy, which includes more disease-related status of the population at the beginning of COVID-19 . Based on the SIDARTHE model, the work in Kantner and Koprucki (2020) proposed an optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy for the case that a vaccine is never found. For the work by K\u00f6hler et al. (2020) , which also considers the pandemic in Germany, the social distancing requirements are optimized through an MPC strategy in order to minimize the fatalities over a fixed period of time. The above work has all been written in the mid of the first wave of COVID-19, thus the main concern was limited to either finding a suitable model to reproduce the evolution of the pandemic during the first outbreak, or to evaluate whether the virus can be erased through a given policy. After the first wave, however, a fast elimination of the virus without vaccine has proven to be impossible in most countries (whereas the work by Liu and Stursberg (2021) has started to consider an optimized distribution of limited amount of available vaccines). The focus thus should be shifted to the question of how to properly utilize the experience gathered during the first wave, such that better intervention policies can be developed to mitigate the pandemic, until a vaccine is distributed to significant extent.",

For the investigated country with five regions as in Fig. 1 , the weight \u03b1 ij , i \ufffd = j, can take values in the interval [0.2, 1], and the infection rate \u03b2 i varies within [5.4 \u00b7 10 \u22123 , 9 \u00b7 10 \u22123 ], while the healing rate \u03b4 i is in [0.014, 0.017]. The infection rate \u03b2 i has a larger range than \u03b4 i , since the latter value cannot be significantly changed without efficient medicine. Default values of these variables are \u03b1 ij = 1, \u03b2 i = 9 \u00b7 10 \u22123 and \u03b4 i = 0.014. The threshold value is chosen to p c = 0.0001. Now, if the bang-bang intervention scheme is introduced in the studied country, i.e., whenever p i (t) \u2265 p c applies in region i, this region is locked down in the next decision time: thus the weight \u03b1 ij of each edge connecting region i and the infection rate \u03b2 i are reduced to the minimum, and the healing rate \u03b2 i is increased to the maximum. The lock-down status then lasts for T = 30 days up to the next decision time. The outcome by deploying this policy is illustrated in Fig. 4 and the lock-down sequences in all five regions are plotted in Fig. 5 . One can notice that the p i (t) are beyond the threshold p c in all regions for almost all the time, despite the frequent lock-downs and large fluctuations of p j (t) in other countries.",

This setting, however, seems barely realistic if, e.g., intensive testing is not always possible. In particular, exact values of the infection rate \u03b2 i and healing rate \u03b4 i , or the edge weight \u03b1 ij can hardly be determined in practice. More often, one can only identify possible ranges of these rates and weights. This challenges the MPC strategy which should be able to robustly satisfy the constraints in Problem 1. To this end, the min-max approaches tailored to robust MPC, see e.g. Campo and Morari (1987), can be applied to satisfy the constraints even in the worst case. Another type of uncertainty often reported in media is a sudden outbreak in a hotspot of region i, which can be represented by a dramatical increase of p i (t) in short time. This hotspot scenario can be modeled by adding a bounded stochastic disturbance \u03c9 i (t) to the local dynamics (3), which follows a distribution that can be estimated from evolutions in the first year of the outbreak. Now, by replacing the dynamics (3) in Problem 1 by the stochastic model, one can either further apply the min-max approaches to ensure the robust satisfaction of the constraints. or adopt e.g. the technique of scenariobased MPC, see Bernardini and Bemporad (2009) , to ensure that the constraints are satisfied in a mean-square sense. Furthermore, one can use the stochastic model to represent insufficient measurements of infected cases due to a lack of testing. In addition, it should be mentioned that Problem 1 only considers typical epidemic-related social-costs and constraints, while additional types are conceivable. For example, the economic costs such as the damage caused by lock-down, or constraints like available hospital staff can be included. Depending on the measurable data, Problem 1 should thus be adapted in every decision step k by identifying new instances of dynamics, costs, and constraints.",

The background of the problem is that simple bang-bang schemes are not guaranteed to avoid a second wave of the pandemic, as shown by simulation and recent experiences. In addition, a frequent change of policies will also lead to negative effects on life and economy, and thus decreases the effectiveness. This paper has outlined how to determine ,,smoother \" strategies by using MPC, taking the geographic position, the mortality rate, and the socio-econonmic costs into account. Simulation results have confirmed significant advantages compared to bangbang schemes. Upcoming work will take prediction and modeling uncertainties into account, in order to enhance robustness of the obtained policies. ",
