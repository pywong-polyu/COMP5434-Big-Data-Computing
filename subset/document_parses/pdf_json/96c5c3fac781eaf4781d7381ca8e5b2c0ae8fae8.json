            "text": "Rachel Carson (1907 Carson ( -1964 ) was a famous American marine biologist of her time, and author of Under the Sea Breeze, Surrounded by Our Ocean and Ocean Edge. Her most famous and most representative work is Silent Spring, published in 1962, which has already become the \"milestone canonical work\" in contemporary ecological theory, and is also a canonical work of literary ecological critique. The writing of this book took a good many years in the process of which Carson lived through two great misfortunes: the first is her mother's passing; Carson never married and depended on her mother for her whole life, so her mother's passing was a heavy blow to her; the other time was Carson herself suffering from cancer. Two years following the publication of Silent Spring, in 1964, she passed away. This book not only manifests the passion for literature and depth of thought that she had, but also exhibits her rigor and positivistic spirit as a scientist. She painstakingly compiled large amounts of evidence, and after putting it through large amounts of survey studies, the book fiercely attacks the damage wreaked on the earth and atmosphere by pesticides and points the sharp point of her pen directly at the production of DDT. The publication of this book gravely offended the interests of the agricultural capitalist and the groups of scientists related to them, who criticized, ganged up against her and even launched fatal blows. The New York Times used a lively and directive title when discussing her case-\"The Silent Spring is Now Noisy Summer.\" Carson obstinately braved the pressure, made sure the publication of the book went smoothly, and it became one of the highest grossing books in America and the whole world at the time. It is precisely because of this book that America passed an environmental protection law. The publication of the book also genuinely became a turning point for ecological problems. \"She deployed explicit, richly poetic and easy to understand language to concretely describe how pesticides damage the American resources of air, soil and water and how the damage incurred from the abuse of pesticides greatly outweighed the benefits they were bringing about\", \"she wakened people to ecological problems with the touch of her own pen\", and many Americans saw Carson as a brave hero. 1 (",

What accompanied the modernization of American agriculture was initially the widespread use of such modern agricultural technologies as fertilizers and pesticides, which means putting tons of pressure on the ecological environment. This town that Carson envisions would hear a cacophony of birds singing the glory of blooming diversity, a cacophony that dramatically dims down to a dead silence, the reason being that the overuse of such insecticides as DDT wreak havoc on the fields and soil and harm insects and all species of birds, which is effectively people harming themselves. This town is a reflection of countless U.S. towns during the 60's; it is an extremely illustrative allegory of industrial civilization leading humanity to harm itself. Humanity not only destroys nature, but harms humanity itself, \"this means that malignant disease will strike two out of three families.\" 2",

            "text": "In Capital, Marx argues that the essence of capital is the pursuit of the unlimited proliferation of capital. In Silent Spring, Carson gives a vivid interpretation of this conclusion from her own perspective. In the book, she exposes the reason causing the silent spring to be the overuse of modern agrochemicals and specifically the pesticide DDT, but the ultimate reason behind this phenomenon is the domination of capitalist industries, which seek the maximization of profit. She states, \"it is an age dominated by industry, in which the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom challenged.\" 3 She traces this situation further back to the capitalist pursuit of money developing since the industrial revolution, which is precisely the essence of capital Marx spoke of as the pursuit of the proliferation of capital, but she elevates this problem to the level of public health. She states, \"As the tide of chemicals born of the industrial age has arisen to engulf our environment, a drastic change has come about in the nature of the most serious public health problems.\" 4 (4) Revealing the Law of the Balance of Nature Rachel Carson was a marine biologist, who skillfully applied basic biological theories in her book, specifically the theory of the balance of nature, and advocated the thought of the food chain. The famous English historian Arnold Joseph Toynbee also advocated the theory of the food chain, stating that humanity's destruction of the natural environment commits the crime of \"matricide.\" Carson states, \"In some quarters today it is fashionable to dismiss the balance of nature\", \"but it is still there: a complex, precise, and highly integrated system of relationships between living things which cannot safely be ignored any more than the law of gravity can be defied with impunity by a man perched on the edge of a cliff. The balance of nature is not a status quo; it is fluid, ever shifting, in a constant state of adjustment. Man, too, is part of this balance. Sometimes the balance is in his favor; sometimes-and all too often through his own activities-it is shifted to his disadvantage\". 5 Carson also states about the chains of life that, \"from the small-as-dust green cells of the drifting plant plankton, through the minute water fleas to the fishes that strain plankton from the water and are in turn eaten by other fishes or by birds, mink, raccoons-in an endless cyclic transfer of materials from life to life.\" 6 The theory of chains is extremely important in contemporary biological thought. Every entity and biological being on earth, including man, is a link in this chain of life, and enjoys the rights that it deserves to enjoy in this chain, and should also take on the responsibility that the chain gives it whether consciously or unconsciously-which is to maintain the stability and balance of the chain of life. Today there is a saying that the chain of life may still be restored after being destroyed, but actually the chain of life is irrecoverable after it is destroyed. After an ecological milieu is destroyed and then repaired, the ecological chain in it has actually already transformed and is no longer the same ecological chain that existed prior to the destruction. After primeval forests have been felled, the ecological chain is destroyed, after which planting trees may bring about another new chain, but the original chain is no longer recoverable; After the Huang He river is polluted, we can treat it, but the chain of life in it is already altered, and the Huang He river changes into another Huang He river after treatment. The facts prove that ecological conditions are singular and unrepeatable. So, we have to protect and try to maintain balance in the chain of life.",

In the last century we said \"to hell with Nature, the earth can produce as much as man wills,\" which exudes from great confidence in controlling nature, but a confidence which is an ignorance, a self-aggrandizing fantasy. The human species in fact cannot possibly have complete control of nature, and on the contrary can only respect nature and follow nature. Marx never respected controlling nature, \"but respected shaping nature in accordance with the laws of beauty\", which include two aspects: one is the needs intrinsic to species, another is the needs intrinsic to human being. In satisfying the needs of human beings, we also must respect the needs of species, which is to speak of respecting nature, not controlling it. When Carson speaks of man controlling nature, she states, \"The control of nature is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modern and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.\" 7 Using the pesticide DDT to control the growth of so-called pests leads to the \"silent spring,\" which is but humanity reaping what it has sown. Similar to this, China once got caught up in the movement of \"eliminating the four pests,\" when sparrows were thought to be one of the so-called \"four pests,\" and the Chinese people wiped out the sparrows through many methods from spraying chemicals to trapping them with nets, practices which were likewise extremely infantile, resulting in the destruction of ecological chains and the balance of nature.",

            "text": "In Silent Spring, Rachel Carson points out the seriousness of ecological problems and issues a solemn warning to humanity. She states, \"we stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road-the one 'less traveled by'-offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of our earth.\" 8 What she calls \"the road we have long been travelling,\" is actually that of humanity destroying itself by polluting the ecological environment, while the other seldom travelled fork in the road is that of humanity and nature balancing, harmonizing and unifying. The Club of Rome is an international, non-governmental, non-ideological, crosscultural civilian group of international academic researchers, who do not serve the interests of any state or government. This club has a group of world renown physicists, biologists, mathematicians, economists, sociologists, philosophers and prospectors. Its founder is the Italian Aurelio Peccei . Peccei was born of a progressive cultural family from Torino, a doctorate in economics, a famous Italian industrialist, social activist and researcher of global problems. He once worked at Fiat Automobiles, dedicated himself to the anti-fascist leftist movement during WWII, and became a member of the Italian resistance movement. In 1944 he was thrown in prison for a year. After the war he continued to work at Fiat Automobiles, and resided in China for eight years. After 1957, with the support of Italian investors, government officials and industrialists, he founded an international non-profit engineering and economic consultation company that he presided over as CEO, and it later developed into Europe's largest and most vital economic consultation company. In the middle of the enterprise, Peccei felt accomplished enough to step back from the company, and put his focus on the human predicament, hoping to find a method to alter humanity's course leading to disaster. In April of 1968, under his initiative, more than 30 specialists, including scientists, educationalists, economists and entrepreneurs from ten countries, including Italy, Sweden, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Great Britain, attended a meeting at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, where they discussed present and future predicaments. This was the first international meeting where the problem of the human predicament was discussed. The Club of Rome was born on the ground of this meeting. So far, the Club of Rome's nearly 100 representatives coming from 40 countries engage in cross-disciplinary innovative research on such global problems as the population, resources, food, energy and environment in current societies, and wrote a series of synthetic investigative reports: The Chasm Ahead, The Limits to Growth, Mankind at the Turning Point, Road Maps to the Future, Dialogue on Wealth and Welfare, etc. The Limits to Growth is a scientific report on the development of human social economy written by four Club of Rome entrusted young scientists from MIT. The book was published in 1972, which is precisely the year in which The Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was adopted, marking the point at which humanity stepped into the era of ecological civilization, when ecological problems became global problems. The Limits to Growth explains the limits of growth with scientifically vetted data and reasoning, and reveals to humankind for the first time the severe consequences of unlimited growth on a limited earth, sending shockwaves throughout the globe. The revised edition was published in 1992, and the 3rd edition in 2004. The 3rd edition once again sounds the alarm on the issue of growth with 30 years of additional data to back it up. Just as the author says, this book is not simply a book making predictions about humanity's future, but is rather a book that makes simulations of all kinds of scenarios and consequences on the basis of known data and hypothetical situations, a book that provides humanity with the correct path to choose, and also a book of warning to the world. The author repeatedly argues \"that humanity has already overshot the carrying capacity of the global environment, but still has enough time to reflect on and choose active measures necessary to make corrections even at the global level\". 9 The significance of this book for humanity cannot be underestimated, but at first, it met with great resistance, because it aimed at limiting growth, and advocated an \"enough is enough\" model of life, which for those craving growth and overconsumption was unbearable.",

The agricultural and industrial revolutions were the most profound examples\". 10 These two transformations both arose out of \"shortages\" and \"deficits,\" and were forced as the result of having no other alternative. The agricultural revolution was humanity's successful coping with a shortage of wildlife species. 11 Due to population growth, the decrease of wild animals in the hunting economy could no longer satisfy people's needs, so humanity settled down and became sedentary, choosing crop growing and the agricultural economy instead. Some nomadic regions of Chinese Inner Mongolia no longer adopt the nomadic model of production, but developed into a enclosure-raising model instead. I once went to a huge pasture in Inner Mongolia, but scenes of \"wind blowing the grass and the sight of cows and goats\" are already hard to find, the grass grows very short, and although the locals say that grass is very nutritious, it ultimately reflects the trend of insufficiency of soil fertility and an originally nomadic people being forced to turn toward agriculture under the pressure of the growth of population and demands.",

Such changes are also a complicated enjoyment\". 13 This is shows that because of rapid population growth, traditional agriculture could no longer sustain the life of such populations, thereby bringing about new shortages, which is the main reason behind the birth of the industrial revolution. But, \"the success of the industrial revolution just like the hunting and agricultural revolutions before it ultimately brought about its own shortages as well,\" 14 and such shortages include the aspects of \"source\" and \"sink.\" \"Source\" refers to resources; \"sink\" refers to the earth's carrying capacity for pollution. This leads to a new revolution of \"sustainable development.\" The Limits to Growth points out, \"Like the other great revolutions, the coming sustainability revolution will also change the face of the land and the foundations of human identities, institutions, and cultures.

The term becomes an important keyword for the book. The term \"ecological footprint\" refers to \"the relationship between the human needs of the planet and the capacity that the earth can provide\", 19 specifically \"providing resources for the international community (food, feed, trees, fish and urban land) and the area of land needed to absorb emissions (carbon dioxide)\". 20 1.3 billion people survive on 9.6 million square kilometers of land in China. To contrast, only less than 40 million people live on more than 10 million square kilometers of land in Canada. China's ecological footprint is much smaller. In the past, Chinese textbooks often talk about China's \"vast territory and abundant resources.\" However, from the perspective of ecological footprint theory, China's pressure on environmental resources is very large: China has neither a vast territory, nor abundant resources. Mathis Wackenagel predicted the following by using ecological footprint theory: in the 1980s (1980) human demand and the Earth's carrying capacity are roughly equal. By 1999, human demand had exceeded the Earth's carrying capacity by 20%. WWF also noted in a report that the world's average ecological footprint is 2.2 hectares per person, much more than the 1.8 hectares that the Earth can offer. Since the 1960s, China's average ecological footprint has doubled. The current demand is more than double the amount of sustainable supply in the country, 21 which demonstrates the seriousness of the problem.",

For example, when somebody deposits $100 into the bank at 7% interest, it will to $107 in the first year. In the second year, the 7% rate will lead to a growth of $7.49. At this rate, the initial deposit will be able to grow to $196.72 by the tenth year, almost doubing in value. To contrast, if you put $ 100 in a jar and add $7 per year, you will only have $149 after ten years, which is linear growth. By the end of the 50th year, the money in the bank account would be 6.5 times greater than that of the jar at almost $2500. According to the author of Limits to Growth, the population growth in less developed regions has increased exponentially over the past half century, and the population has doubled in 19 years, while the population in more industrialized areas has grown linearly and more gently. Regarding the exponential growth of the population, there is a real problem in front of us: regarding our ecological footprint, is there a growth limit population demands and ratios of people to land? And if so, where is the limit?",

            "text": "The so-called \"enchantment\" view of the world holds that ghosts, demons and other superstitious entities exist. In ancient agricultural societies, science and technology was not yet developed, and people did not understand natural phenomena. They therefore believed that many mysterious phenomena arose due to the gods or ghosts, thereby \"enchanting\" nature. In some parts of China's rural areas in the past, snakes, foxes, and other animals are often sacred because of their color, and cannot be killed, as doing so would bring about disaster. In industrial society, science and technology have developed, and people's ability to know the nature has been greatly enhanced. As a result, nature's mystery began to fade away. During the Enlightenment, Francis Bacon proposed that \"knowledge is power\" and believed that knowledge can change everything, which is a heroic declaration of human respect for knowledge and the self. Rene Descartes put forward the idea that \"I think so I am\", and believed that reason is above all else, and therefore that the rational subject is above all else. They estimated too highly of experimental science as the representative of scientific forces, and believed that the power of relying on technology can do everything. They therefore put forward the idea of the \"Disenchantment of the World\". According to research, it is the famous German sociologist Max Weber who first proposed the idea of the \"Disenchantment of the World.\" In fact, the \"disenchantment\" had already begun during the Enlightenment. Immanuel Kant's famous saying: \"Man made legislation for nature \", clearly demonstrates this view position. Weber put forward this statement when introducing one of Christianity's reformed sects, \"Calvinism\" in in the Eucharist as a path to salvation.\" 27 \"The magic of the Eucharist\" means that Jesus will give his disciples wine and bread that will symbolize his own blood and flesh during the last supper so that they can be rescued after his martyrdom. Refusing to take part in this religious practice is also \"disenchantment.\" The translator interprets it as \"a very important aspect of Weber's more extensive rationalization process, where he sums up his philosophy of history.\" 28 In other words, \"disenchantment\" is an important aspect of Weber's rational process, not only confined to religion. D.R. Griffin, the contemporary American philosopher directly criticized Weber's view of the \"disenchantment of the world\" in the article \"Peace and Postmodern Paradigm\", advocated some \"Reenchantment\". He writes, \"Max Weber once pointed out that this kind of world's Disenchantment is an important feature of the present era, which naturally is seen as a dead thing, it is composed of lifeless objects, there is no divine nature of life in it. This kind of 'natural death' leads to a variety of catastrophic consequences.\" 29 On the contrary, he proposed a Reenchantment of the World, claiming that, \"This requires the realization of the Reenchantment of the World, postmodern paradigm will help this ideal\". 30 He will have \"the Reenchantment of the World\" as a theoretical achievement of postmodern paradigm. What does \"the Reenchantment of the World\" mean? Is it possible to return to the \"everything has spirit\" in the agricultural society?-of course not.",

He said, \" This much is certain: there was a time when the matter of our island universe had transformed a quantity of motion-of what kind we do not yet know-into heat, such that there could be developed from it the solar systems appertaining to (according to M\u00e4dler) at least twenty million stars, the gradual extinction of which is likewise certain.

He claims in his Introduction to Probability in Philosophy: \"If a wise man knows all the forces in the universe, knows the locations of all objects, then through 'the simple calculation', the future and the past will show in his eyes.\" However, this approach to scientific knowledge has been overthrown by modern natural science. In the first place, thermodynamics denies it. Thermodynamics indicates that a liter of gas contained in a sealed container contains tens of billions of atoms. However, it is impossible to know the position of each atom. One can only describe the state by probability theory and statistics. Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle also points out that we can't know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Then the meteorologist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz put forward \"chaos\" theory in 1961, which claims that a very simple system will eventually become unpredictable and contain very complex movements and consequences. This is, the famous \"butterfly effect.\" A butterfly flapping its wings on the Amazon River can potentially set off a storm in the Mississippi River Basin. \"Chaos\" theory also pointed out that people can't know where the solar system or planet will be in one million years' time.",

Now, China's steel production has more than that of Germany, Japan, and the United States combined steel production. However, with the transfer of this equipment, environmental pollution has also been transferred. Ruhr was a high pollution area. If you wear a white shirt in the morning, it will turn gray at night. But now the Ruhr people in Germany are in exchange for clear water and blue sky. In contrast, Handan in China has a serious problem of environmental pollution. The residents living in the west side of Handan City have been living in dusty smoke, containing carcinogenic substances in the gas. 36 A village in central Shandong is also the so-called \"cancer village,\" as the incidence of esophageal cancer is extremely high because the village is close to the Dawen River polluted by the nearby city of industrial and mining enterprises.

            "text": "In recent years, China's average annual growth is about 10%, but if you get rid of the economic losses caused by environmental pollution, the growth rate is very small. Practice has proved that the path of \"post-pollution control\" is impractical because it will pay a much higher price. It will not only pay an economic price, but also will pay the price of people's health, good life, and even lives. This is contradictory to the \"people-oriented\" approach in China's scientific development. The United Nations stipulates that environmental rights are also a human right, and everyone has the right to live with dignity in a beautiful environment. Imagine if there is no clean drinking water: we would all go crazy to grab a small amount of mineral water or rush around for a bucket of water. Would people in this way live with dignity? When we are closed upstairs by \"SARS\" virus, only to get a little life supplies in the window through the basket, will we be living with dignity? In this case, can we take the kind of arrogant, conqueror's attitude to nature, or can we be moderately fearful of nature? That is to say, when a quantity increases in proportion to its existing one, it grows exponentially. For example, depositing $100 in a bank will increase to $107 in the first year at a 7% interest rate. The growth rate in the second year is 7% of $107, or $7.49. By the tenth year, it will grow to $196.72, almost doubled. If you put $100 in a jar, and invest $7 per year, then after 10 years, it will be $149. This is linear growth. By the end of the fifth decade, the money in the bank account will be 6.5 times more than in the jar, almost $2,500. According to the authors of Limits to Growth, the population growth of underdeveloped cities has grown exponentially over the past half century, and the population has doubled in 19 years. The population of industrialized areas has grown linearly and is relatively flat. For the exponential growth of the population, there is a real problem before us. That is to say, under a certain ecological footprint, is there limit to the growth of human needs and land ratio, and where is this limit?",
