An inactivated whole AIV vaccine has been widely used for over the past 30 years and accounts for 95.5% of AIV vaccine usage in poultry [45] ; however, protective efficiency largely depends on whether the antigen of the AIV strain that was used for vaccine preparation matched the virus(es) circulating in the field [48] . Using reverse genetic systems for AIV [15, 33] , custom-made inactivated AI vaccines that match circulating viruses can be created within a relative short period of time [48] . However, the use of inactivated AI vaccines is limited due to the high labor cost for intramuscular or subcutaneous vaccine injection.",

The purified recombinant protein can then be used as a vaccine following oil emulsification. The antigen can be produced in an in vitro system without safety concerns of growing AI vaccine viruses. Moreover, the chimeric gene that is joined in tandem by the epitopes from different antigens can be easily expressed using an in vitro system to produce a multivalent vaccine. Virus-like particles (VLPs) can be obtained by the self-assembly of viral structural proteins expressed in vitro, thereby inducing a sufficient immune response. Moreover, VLPs are non-infectious because they do not contain the viral genetic material. To date, several expression systems, including baculovirus [6] , transformed cells [54] , and plant systems [7] , have been used to produce AIV VLPs. The VLPs produced with baculovirus, which comprise hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and/or matrix protein M1 from a H5N1, have been shown to protect chickens from AIV infection [12, 37] .",

            "text": "Nucleic acid-based vaccines are not associated with potentially hazardous pathogens, which can induce both a humoral and cellular immune response. Previous studies indicate that vaccination with the mRNA of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and nucleoproteins of the H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses can protect pigs, mice, and ferrets against clinical signs and reduce viral shedding in challenge experiments [39] . The ability to encode multiple genes of interest is a significant advantage of DNA-based vaccines; however, in contrast to mRNAbased vaccines, DNA-based vaccines are poorly transported into target cells [36] . Therefore, needle-mediated injections [30] , intranasal administration [27] , and electroporation [9] , are used to deliver DNA vaccines into target cells. In addition, the safety of DNA vaccines is attracting attention, since DNA-based vaccines with selective markers (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes) can be integrated into the genomic DNA of host cells [52] .",

Among the various baculoviruses, Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) are the most widely studied [21] . Moreover, a baculovirus expression vector system has been widely used for vaccine development due to the versatile features of baculoviruses, such as the large cloning capacity, post-translational modification in a eukaryotic system, replication-defect properties in mammalian cells, and broad tissue tropism [11] . It has also been reported that the HA1 protein of the H6 influenza virus and HA1 protein of the H5N1 AIV can be expressed in insect cells and Spodoptera litura larvae [18, 29] ; indeed, the avian H7 influenza virus haemagglutinin was expressed in the silkworm (B. mori) pupa [32] . Additionally, recombinant subunit vaccines targeting haemagglutinin have been developed using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). A trivalent recombinant HA influenza vaccine, Flublok\u00ae, was produced in insect cells using BEVS and subsequently approved in the United States [3] . In addition, baculovirus has been successfully applied for delivering foreign genes into mammalian cells without viral replication [11] . Baculovirus has also been reported to stimulate the host antiviral immune response in mammalian cells [4, 8] and to confer protection from lethal influenza virus infection in mice [1] .",

Therefore, vaccination with a polyantigen chimeric epitope vaccine may represent an effective strategy for protecting poultry from infection with various AIV subtypes. In the present study, a recombinant baculovirus rBac-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT containing a fused codon-optimized sequence (CTLT) of T cell epitopes from the hemagglutinin (HA) of H1, H9 and H7 AIV subtypes, and another fused codonoptimized sequence (THB) of Th and B cell epitope from HA of H1, H9, and H7 AIV subtypes, driven by a baculovirus P10 promoter and cytomegalovirus CMV promoter, respectively, was constructed. The results of the present study indicate that specific humoral and cellular responses can be detected in chickens and mice following the administration of rBac-CMV/THB-P10/ CTLT, suggesting that rBac-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT can be developed as a potential vaccine against different AIV subtypes.",

The cell nucleus was stained with DAPI. CK, normal mouse; Test, the mice vaccinated with BmNPV-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT. b The level of anti-THB antibody detected in the serum of the vaccinated mice with BmNPV-CMV-THB-CTLT. The mice were vaccinated with BmNPV-CMV-THB-CTLT at a dose of 10 10 TCID 50 /kg (Group 1), 5 \u00d7 10 9 TCID 50 /kg (Group 2), and 10 9 TCID 50 /kg (Group 3). The serum sampled at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-vaccination were used to determine the level of anti-THB antibodies by indirect ELISA transduction with BmNPV-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT, and subsequently decreased, since the baculovirus could not replicate in the invertebrate animal cells (Balraj [3] ).",

Similar results were observed in the present study, indicating that BmNPV could be used as a gene delivery vehicle for animals. Moreover, specific humoral and cellular immune responses against the expressed THB antigen were detected in both chickens and mice, suggesting that BmNPV-CMV/THB-P10/ CTLT has the potential for the development of a vectorbased vaccine against AIV. The ELISA results indicate that the antibody levels induced by BmNPV-CMV/THB-P10/CTLT increased roughly with the immunization in a dose-dependent manner in both chickens and mice. Although previous studies have shown that the epitope regions selected in this study are critical for the production of neutralizing antibodies [22, 24, 35, 40] , a neutralizing assay for AIV should be conducted to test whether these B cell epitopes could induce neutralized antibody in the further.",
