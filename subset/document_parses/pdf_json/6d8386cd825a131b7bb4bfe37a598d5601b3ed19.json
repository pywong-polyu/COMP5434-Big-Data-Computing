SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a dog and a cat from COVID-19 positive households. Whole genome sequence analysis identified SARS-CoV-2 delta variant of concern (B.1.617.2). Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 isolated from dog and cat were grouped into sublineage AY.30 and AY.85, respectively. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in both dog (day 9) and cat (day 14) after viral RNA detection. This study raises awareness on spill-over of variant of concern in domestic animals due to human-animal interface. Thus, surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic pets should be routinely conducted.",

All members were tested positive on 12-14 July 2021 and tested negative after 14 days. Swab (nasal, oral and rectal) and environmental samples were collected on four occasions (day 1, 3, 7, and 10). During quarantine, a cat did not show any clinical signs. Nasal and oral swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at day 1 and day 3 (Ct 20.66-34.36). Low viral RNA (high Ct Value) was detected in animal hair swabs on day 3 (Ct 36.56). All samples tested negative on day 7 and day 10 ( Table 3 and Fig. 1) . A dog (CU27791) is 15 years-old, 7.5 kg, Shih-Tzu breed, intact female dog. The animal was transferred to private animal hospital on 12 September 2021 due to family members (n = 4) tested positive for COVID-19 on 8-11 September 2021. Sample collection was conducted on five occasions (day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). SARS-CoV-2-RNA was detected in nasal and oral swabs of dogs on day 1-7 (Ct 19.06-39.87). The highest viral titers (low Ct values) were observed in nasal and oral swabs on day 3. Viral RNAs were also detected in environmental samples (hair, water container and floor) on day 3, 5, and 7 (Ct 29.87-38.13). A dog did not have fever but showed mild respiratory signs with serous nasal discharge on day 5-7 (Table 3 and Fig. 1) . In this study, we collected blood sample from SARS-CoV-2 positive animals (n = 6 serum; cat (CU27516) (n = 2 time points) and dog (CU27791) (n = 4 time points)). We tested serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by indirect multispecies ELISA, surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and pseudotyped virus neutralization (pVNT). Our result showed that a cat was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by indirect ELISA (113%-271%), sVNT (90%-95%) and pVNT (1:640) at day 14 and day 21.

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by comparing complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 from dog and cat in this study and 289 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in the GISAID and GenBank database. The sequences were aligned by using the MAFFT FFT-NS-2 algorithm and phylogenetic tree was constructed by using IQ-TREE 2 applying the GTR + \u0393 model of nucleotide substitution with default heuristic search options and bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Lineage classification was performed by using the Pangolin tool. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 of dog and cat in this study clustered with human SARS-CoV-2 of B.1.617.2 (Delta variant of concern). The cat and dog SARS-CoV-2 were grouped into sublineage AY. 30 Table 2 ). Characteristic mutation analysis on spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 of dog and cat showed identical mutations to those of delta variant ( Table 5 ). The mutations at the N-terminal-domain (NTD) (T19R, E156G, F157del, R158del), the receptor binding motif (RBM) (L452R, T478K), the subdomain 2 (D614G), S1 unit (P681R) and heptad repeat 1 (D950N) were observed. It should be noted that delta variant, AY.85 sublineage contained additional mutation at T95I on N terminal domain (NTD) and it may associate with higher viral load which promote viral transmission from human to human/animal due to close contact.",

During investigation period, we identified SARS-CoV-2 delta variant of concern (B. Virological test for SARS-CoV-2 showed that viral RNA could be detected from nasal and oral swabs of a cat and a dog at day 1 (4-5 days after the owner reported COVID-19 positive). It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could also be detected in animal hair of cat at day 3 and environmental samples (hair, water container and floor) of dog at day 3 and day 7. Similarly, in previous reports, SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be found in environmental samples e.g. water container and cage floor of domestic pet as well as dust and air samples in mink farms 1, 26 . Serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this study showed that a cat developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies since day 14 (by ELISA, sVNT and pVNT) after SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. While a dog www.nature.com/scientificreports/ was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at day 9 (by pVNT) and day 24 (by sVNT and pVNT). Our findings in agreement with previous studies that dogs and cats can develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as early as 7 to 14 days post infection 5, 27, 28 . For example, our previous studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be detected from dogs at day 11-23 and from cats at day 6 after SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Notably, control dog and cat sera and pre-COVID-19 sera have been tested in our previous report 1 . However, the timing for serum sample collection when the animal might have been exposed to COVID-19 owners could influence the antibodies titer and the discrepancy between the result of ELISA, sVNT and pVNT. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the cat and dog SARS-CoV-2 were grouped into delta variant of concern (B. 29 . A previous study reported role of mutations on spike gene may not in relation to hostadapted mutations 30 . Notably, unlike previous study, M1227L on S gene was not observed in our SARS-CoV-2 from dog. It speculated that this point mutation may relate to S protein destabilization and transmission from human-to-dog 17,31 .",

Notably, AY.30 and AY.85 sub-lineages are predominately found in Thailand. In Thailand, most veterinary clinics and hospitals have followed COVID-19 management guideline provided by the department of livestock development, Thailand. Since most SARS-CoV-2 infected animals are asymptomatic or less symptomatic. History of close contact between owners and domestic animals in COVID-19 positive household is crucial for veterinary practitioners to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection in domestic animals. This study is the first to report SARS-CoV-2 delta variant infection in domestic dogs and cats in Thailand. Our finding supports routine surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals and raises more awareness on frequent spill-over of variant of concerns due to high human-animal interface.",

Unlike previous studies, SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, sub-lineage AY.3 was responsible for COVID-19 in dog in the US and sub-lineage AY.43 in dog in Spain17,18 . Genetic mutation analysis of the cat and dog SARS-CoV-2 showed that all mutations agreed with those of delta variant delta variant of concern (B.1.617.2) including the mutations at the N-terminal-domain (NTD), the receptor binding motif (RBM), the subdomain 2, S1 unit and heptad repeat 1. Since SARS-CoV-2, B.1.617.2 lineage has higher transmissibility rates than the B1.1.7 viruses, thus, mutations on spike protein in relation to transmissibility or host adaptation of animal SARS-CoV-2 needed",

The ID Screen\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 Double Antigen Multi-species ELISA kit (ID VET, Montpellier, France) was used to detect IgG antibodies against N protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in animal sera. We performed the ELISA test according to the manufacture's recommendation. In brief, 25 \u00b5l of each serum sample was diluted at 1:1 ratio with the dilution buffer and added to each well. The 96-well plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min. The plate was washed with 300 \u00b5l of washing solution and 100 \u00b5l of N protein recombinant antigen horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added to each well and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min. The plate was washed 3 times with 300 \u00b5l of washing solution. After washing, 100 \u00b5l of the substrate solution was added into each well and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 20 min. Then, 100 \u00b5l of the stop solution was added. The reaction was read and recorded for the optical densities (O.D.) at 450 nm. The O.D. was calculated as the S/P percentage (S/P%). If S/P% value greater than or equal to 60% is considered positive, while sample with S/P% between 50 and 60% is considered as doubtful, and sample with S/P% < 50 is negative.",
