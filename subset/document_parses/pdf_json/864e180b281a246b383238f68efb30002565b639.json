Rapid detection and monitoring of marine microalgae are important in predicting and managing HABs. We developed a toolkit, the Suitcase Lab, to detect harmful algae species in the field. We demonstrated the Suitcase Lab's capabilities for sampling, filtration, DNA extraction, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection in cultured Alexandrium catenella cells as well as Chilean coastal waters from four sites: Repollal, Isla Garc\u00eda, Puerto Montt, and Metri. A LAMP assay using the Suitcase Lab in the field confirmed microscopic observations of A. catenella in samples from Repollal and Isla Garc\u00eda. The Suitcase Lab allowed the rapid detection of A. catenella, within 2 h from the time of sampling, even at a single cell per milliliter concentrations, demonstrating its usefulness for quick and qualitative on-site diagnosis of target toxic algae species. This method is applicable not only to detecting harmful algae but also to other field studies that seek a rapid molecular diagnostic test.",

Some of the blooming species have been found to produce endogenous toxins and such harmful algae blooms (HABs) can, directly and indirectly, cause acute effects on marine and freshwater ecosystems leading to major impacts on public health and Office of Industry-Academia-Government and Community Collaboration, Hiroshima University, 1-3-2 Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima City, Hiroshima 739-8511, Japan productivity activities such as aquaculture, fisheries, and tourism (Lewitus et al. 2012) . The frequency of HABs in Chile has also been increasing over the decades following a global trend. In particular, a bloom of Pseudochattonella verruculosa occurred during February and March of 2016 in Chile causing record-high economic damages to the country. That HAB event killed 39 million salmon mostly in Reloncavi Sound and Fjord (Anderson et al. 2016; D\u00edaz et al. 2019; Le\u00f3n-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2018 ). Subsequently, a prolonged bloom of Alexandrium catenella occurred in the same year in Chile, which caused paralytic shellfish poisoning in higher vertebrates from the inner sea of Chilo\u00e9 Island to the far north (Eckford-Soper and Daugbjerg 2016a; Montes et al. 2018; Paredes et al. 2019) . The Chilean government, in conjunction with research institutes, has promoted an early warning HAB species detection system to mitigate the effects of these HABs as they emerge. One of the issues is that the complete mechanism of a HAB is not fully understood, and thus a successful model has not been established to aid in avoiding HAB damages.",

            "text": "The current strategy to reduce the HAB related damages relies on early detection of HAB species and toxin levels by frequent coastal monitoring. Microscopy to identify and quantify HAB species is traditionally the standard monitoring tool to assess and manage regional ecosystems. However, microscopy miss detection of HAB species when they are at low abundance during pre-bloom periods or their morphology is transformed by the use of cell-fixing agents such as Lugol's solution and paraformaldehyde (John et al. 2005; Zingone et al. 2006; Rodr\u00edguez-Ramos et al. 2013) . Additionally, microscopy requires specialized and trained taxonomists that routinely analyze high numbers of samples (Orozco and Medlin 2013) . More recently, satellite imaging and molecular methods have come into play to monitor HABs in conjunction with microscopy. Satellite observation provides the great advantage of obtaining real-time information on chlorophyll concentrations in any aquatic environment in the world (Hu 2009 ). The drawback of this method is that it cannot identify a bloom species nor can it determine which family of organisms is responsible for the chlorophyll value in the target aquatic regions. Molecular methods, such as fluorescent hybridization assays, sandwich hybridization assays, automatized biosensor detections, and real-time PCR assays, are superior in their ability to identify and quantify HAB species even at low abundance (Herrera-Sepulveda et al. 2013; Penna and Galluzzi 2013) . However, they have some disadvantages, including difficulty in transportation, time-consuming sample processing, expensive equipment and reagents, cold-chain requirements, and the need to be conducted in specialized laboratories. A successful HAB monitoring tool can be best established from not a single tool but a combination of multiple tools considering each tool's pros and cons. We focus on a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective approach to detect toxic algae in situ, directly in aquatic environments, to provide quick screening information on HABs. Here, we introduce our development of a portable molecular diagnostic laboratory system, called the \"Suitcase Lab,\" for quick screening of toxic alge.",

These outbreaks in many cases occur in regions with a limited source of health specialists, infrastructure, and logistics, such as poorly serviced roads and air systems. Therefore, introducing a portable laboratory in such isolated areas is a valuable strategy to rapidly diagnose critical cases to support patient management and surveillance. With the same concept, the Suitcase Lab was developed for HAB detection to be used in geographically complex areas such as the southern region of Chile where most HAB damages are reported (Montes et al. 2018) . The common monitoring procedures in Chile include multi-day sailing to collect samples from several stations and sent to the closest testing laboratory by bus for microscopy. Thus, it can take days before the HAB species are identified and reported to appropriate health authorities. Fast detection time is critical for many HAB species, as exemplified in Pseudonitzschia australis that produce domoic acid, a highly potent toxin, to rapidly reach the regulatory limit (D\u00edaz et al. 2019). Currently, no adequate in situ screening system exists for quick qualitative diagnoses of HABs. To remedy this, we developed the Suitcase Lab which, as its name suggests, is small enough to be contained within a single-wheeled suitcase. It includes a portable loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) device that can both provide a thermoblock system as well as a quantitative fluorometer. Supporting materials include sterile tubes, pipettes, and filtration units needed for environmental water sampling (cite table of lab contents).",

The method uses a specially designed set of target-specific primers: forward inner primer (FIP), back inner primer (BIP), two primers (F3 and B3), loop primer forward (LF), and loop primer reverse (LB). The first four primers recognize six regions on the target DNA, increasing target specificity to preclude false positives (Tomita et al. 2008) , and the latter two loop primers accelerate the LAMP reaction (Nagamine et al. 2002) . This LAMP amplification reaction uses only a small amount of DNA and proceeds at a constant temperature (60-65\u00b0C) without requiring an additional expensive device, such as a thermal cycler (Notomi et al. 2000) .",

Five hundred millimeters of water was collected in a portable bucket pre-cleaned with in situ seawater 2~3 times. The water was filtered through a 10-\u03bcm nylon mesh sieve (No. 38 in Fig. 1) , and the residue on the sieve (about 1-1.5 mL) was transferred to a 1.5-mL sterile tube with a sterile disposable pipette. The tube containing seawater was then centrifuged at 420-950\u00d7g (No. 37 in Fig. 1 , Petit Spin, WakenBtech, Kyoto, Japan) for 15 min and the supernatant was discarded. The DNA was extracted from the pellet using the Easy DNA Extraction Kit version 2, according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Using the Suitcase Lab, a pilot sampling was performed on the Chilean coast, and the assay and analysis of the field samples were done using the enclosed LAMP device: Coastal water samples were collected from four locations: Metri (MT) (41\u00b060\u2032 S); Puerto Montt (PM) (41\u00b027\u2032 S), Repollal Puquit\u00edn (RP) (43\u00b045\u2032 S), and Isla Garc\u00eda (IG) (44\u00b015\u2032 S) in February 2019 (Fig. 2) . Two hundred fifty milliliters of each seawater was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Sterivex, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).

In the mock test in Takehara Port, the Suitcase Lab performed ideally, including a LAMP assay targeting A. catenella in under 2 h after the sample was collected. The time required from sample collection to detect the target phytoplankton species, A. catenella, was within 2 h using the Suitcase Lab (Fig. 3) . With the current HAB monitoring methodologies, for example, in Chile, the fastest route could still take days from sampling to obtaining microscope analysis data due to the requirement of shipping samples to a laboratory in the complicated geographic area. The ability to detect HAB species at pre-bloom periods will provide advanced warning to the communities who need to initiate mitigation activities such as early harvesting of shellfish and fish or beach closure. With the timely HAB reminder, not only health damages but also economic losses can be reduced for fish farms by stop feeding fish, moving or submerging fish cages, airlifting of deep water into the fish cages, or treating Sengco et al. 2001 ). Thus, effective management of HABs to minimize the effects on coastal communities relies on detecting their development at the earliest possible stage. The Suitcase Lab is a solution to provide field researchers with rapid analysis results using molecular technology. The expensive cost is usually the downfall of using a molecular approach; however, LAMP is relatively cost-effective as one LAMP reaction was estimated at US$ 4.63 for liquid type and US$ 5.83 for lyophilized type (Table 3 ) and the investment in the Suitcase Lab that enclosed a portable LAMP device was approximately US$ 5500. Besides cost and time perspectives, the storage unit in the Suitcase Lab was evaluated by testing the storage temperature to maintain samples and reagent appropriately. Our observation showed that the temperature inside the cold box containing the frozen refrigerant was initially \u2212 15\u00b0C and was maintained at below 4 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C for 17 h when the outside temperature was 25\u00b0C (Fig. S1 ). This information confirms that materials and reagents required for on-site experiments (e.g., in this study, primers, positive control DNA, nuclease-free water) can be safely stored in the cold box below 4\u00b0C during a 1-day field trip. Maintaining a prolonged cold temperature in the storage box will be one of our challenges to incorporate in the next generation of the Suitcase Lab to be used for more extended field journey as Pomerantz et al. (2018) . They were able to transfer materials and reagent from the US to Ecuadorian Choc\u00f3 rainforest in an engineered food storage container with cold packs and carried out the fieldwork using MinION flowcells.",

LAMP assays are limited to qualitative analyses only and can detect a maximum of four target species at a time; therefore, one can only screen for species one is expecting to find with a specific set of primers. These results must be later supported by orthogonal methods that can quantify the target species back at labs (for example, quantitative PCRs or digital droplet PCRs) (Penna and Galluzzi 2013; Eckford-Soper and Daugbjerg 2016b) . The enclosed portable microscope (No. 5 and 36, in Fig. 1) can be used but is currently available only for genus identification to collect supportive information onsites due to its limited magnification (Fig. S2 , \u00d7 800) and narrow visual field. Upgrading the microscope is one of our objectives to develop the improved version of the Suitcase Lab. Table S1 summarizes the pros and cons of commonly used HAB monitoring strategies. Recently, digital PCR (dPCR) launched as a promising quantitative HAB monitoring tool for its PCR inhibitory tolerance from field samples and its robust and highly reproducible results Orozco 2017: Lee et al. 2017 be used with the Suitcase Lab is customizable depending on the purposes, monitoring sites, equipment and personnel availability, and budget.",

No signal was obtained for A. pacificum indicating that the method was specific for A. catenella over A. pacificum, the two morphologically very similar HAB species that are almost impossible to distinguish under a regular light microscope ). Alternatively, a future version of the Suitcase Lab with a portable genetic sequencer may identify HAB species with a single test, but this remains to be tested. The LAMP assay was able to detect A. catenella at 1 cell mL \u22121 (Fig. 4a) , as can be easily seen in the positive results of target gene detection (Fig. S3) . During the A. catenella outbreak in Chile occurred in 2009, cell counts at the early bloom stage were estimated as 40 cells mL \u22121 , which were gradually increased to 1200, 1500, 1800, 3000, and 6000 cells mL \u22121 in the areas of Cuptana (44\u00b032\u2032 S), Canalad (44\u00b033\u2032 S), Angostura (45\u00b036\u2032 S), Ester (45\u00b009\u2032 S), and Allan (45\u00b045\u2032 S), respectively (Mardones et al. 2010) .

            "text": "The locations RP and IG experienced an A. catenella bloom in February 2019. As described in method \"Specific detection of Chilean coastal water samples by microscopy and LAMP,\" the final volume filtered water was around 1200 L for microscopy and detected A. catenella from RP and IG at level 2 (3-10 in 0.1 mL) and 3 (11-42 in 0.1 mL) of 11 levels (174,763-699,050 in 0.1 mL), respectively (see Table S2 and S3). Using the Suitcaase Lab, the LAMP assay also successfully detected A. catenella from the same RP and IG samples but from only 250 mL of seawater filtered followed by DNA extraction on site (Fig. 5) . The microscopy may have difficulty in detecting HAB species when its concentration is low such as during prebloom conditions. However, this LAMP assay is likely to be able to detect A. catenella at low concentration as reported the positive detection result of A. catenella from a single cell isolated from culture. Gene detection in environmental samples as compared to in culture samples could be more complicated because they contain a wide variety of microorganisms that can interfere with reactions (Bach et al. 2002) ; however, the LAMP assay introduced here showed a specific detection of A. catenella separating from A. pacificum. It confirms that the Suitcase Lab is applicable for A. catenella detection from the field samples. One thing to keep in mind is that there is a high risk of crosscontamination on the working space and equipment in the fields by opening the LAMP-product-containing tubes. The result of the assay can be checked without opening it, but if opening is necessary, care must be taken to open the sample containing tubes away from the main station and frequently clean the area to prevent the contamination in the next processing samples. It is our future homework to validate many sets of primers to be specific as much as possible. For instance, it is necessary to check whether A. catenella can be separately detected in the presence of A. ostenfeldii, which is frequently present in the Ays\u00e9n region (Salgado et al. 2015; Pizarro et al. 2018) . To distinguish toxic HAB species in rapid detection, the primer set to be accompanied by LAMP must be validated prior to use for both culture and environment samples.",

The study successfully showed the productivity of the Suitcase Lab for monitoring A. catenella, a well-known HAB species in the field.
