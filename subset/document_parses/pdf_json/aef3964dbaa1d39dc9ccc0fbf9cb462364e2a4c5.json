The aim of this work is to implement a procedure that analyzes the change detection of the potential soil eroded in a burned area, and discriminate the amount of potential soil loss. As part of the MESARIP project (in agreement with the Regional Civil Protection) in order to implement the analyses of soil erosion pre and post fire event, using Sentinel 2 data and with the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) method in a GIS open source environment, a graphical model has been developed. The application of the RUSLE requires a series of consequential spatial analysis elaborations and, according to this scheme, the model has been developed with the Graphical Modeler. QGIS contains in a single environment a multiplicity of tools and algorithms native to other open source GIS software, such as, for example, SAGA GIS and GRASS GIS. The user interface is very simple and requires basic and thematic input data such as DEM, MASK areas or vegetation indices etc. The advantages in the construction of the model can be identified in the standardization of map algebra operations and also in the speed of execution of the steps. Currently the model has been tested in some burned areas in 2019 located in the northern part of the Apulia Region and will be tested in operational mode during the 2020 summer season.",

K, or the soil erodibility factor (Mg \u2022 h \u2022 MJ \u2212 1 \u2022 mm \u2212 1), is significant of the susceptibility of soil particles to detachment and subsequent transport by rain and surface runoff. By changing the structure of the soil and its permeability, fire leads to a decrease in organic matter and therefore, ultimately, an increase in the K parameter [7] . In the present study, the reference value of the K factor is that obtained from the dataset contained in \"Soil Erodibility in Europe High Resolution dataset\" [30] . Larsen and MacDonald [17] point out, like other authors, that high severity fires increase the production and transport of sediments by several orders of magnitude. In this work the same criteria applied by [31] in Calabria have been used and therefore K has been multiplied by a factor between 1.6 (very low severity) and 2 (very high severity).",

The slope steepness factor (S) also allows to consider the increase in erosive phenomena in relation to the angle of inclination of the slope.
