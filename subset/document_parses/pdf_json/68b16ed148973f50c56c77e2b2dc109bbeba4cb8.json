By harvesting the Global initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https:// www. gisaid. org/), between December 2019 and January 15, 2021, a total of 8864 human SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences processed by gender, across 6 continents (88 countries) of the world, Antarctica exempt, were analyzed. We hypothesized that data speak for itself and can discern true and explainable patterns of the disease. Identical genome diversity and pattern correlates analysis performed using a hybrid of biotechnology and machine learning methods corroborate the emergence of inter-and intra-SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains transmission and sustain an increase in sub-strains within the various continents, with nucleotide mutations dynamically varying between individuals in close association with the virus as it adapts to its host/environment. Interestingly, some viral sub-strain patterns progressively transformed into new sub-strain clusters indicating varying amino acid, and strong nucleotide association derived from same lineage. A novel cognitive approach to knowledge mining helped the discovery of transmission routes and seamless contact tracing protocol. Our classification results were better than state-of-theart methods, indicating a more robust system for predicting emerging or new viral sub-strain(s).",

Since then, its breadth and depth have grown tremendously, causing disruptions that demand a hybrid of computational approaches sufficient to discover the changing nature of the virus as it transmits from country to country. A hybrid computational approach combines more than one methodology or system for the purpose of creating new and better models. This approach is adopted in this paper to complement the efforts of biotechnology/bioinformatic solutions for intelligent mining of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. While there exist claims that the virus has remained unchanged 3 , a growing number of studies have reported the emergence of several sub-strains 4,5 . This explains why the rapid human to human transmission of the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 to most parts of the world has exhibited differences in disease severity and fatality even within a demographic region of a country. The disparity on the one hand has been attributed to factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, race, and co-morbidities 6 .",

            "text": "To understand the origin and structure of SARS-CoV-2, a sequence of the viral genetic material is required. Sequencing viral genomes is performed to identify regions of similarity that may have consequences for functional, structural, or evolutionary associations 22 . Furthermore, it can reveal the possibility of future health risks and vaccine remedies. Phylogenetic tree and genomic tree (also referred to as hierarchical clustering) are common determinants for representing genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships of sequenced genomes. While phylogenetic tree reflects slow evolution within the genome (point mutations), hierarchical clustering describes major genetic re-arrangement events (insertions or deletions). Converting massive amount of complete genome sequences into meaningful biological representations has limited progress of discovering viral sub-strains and detailed transmission routes. Although numerous algorithms/tools have evolved to target specific gene sites/ locations for \"on-the-fly\" online phylogeny representations, incomplete representation and clustering errors abound-as different genome sites undergo different evolutionary changes, resulting in disparate multi-dimensional patterns at different sites. Attempts at estimating phylogenies by comparing entire genomes have been made by focusing mainly on gene content and gene order comparisons. While early attempts concentrated on morphological characters with the premise that direct genes comparison makes more sense, modern attempts use sequences from homologous genes 22 but are burdened by the fact that a gene's evolutionary history may differ from the evolutionary history of the organism, as some genes sufficiently conserved across the species of interest may escape detection. Alignment-free genome comparison methods are therefore becoming popular 22, 23 and have evolved to crash the heavy computational requirements of traditional alignment-based methods. Randhawa et al. 24 for instance proposed an alignment-free approach based on ML, for fast, inexpensive, and taxonomic classification of complete COVID-19 genomes in real time.",

Variants with few mutations belong to the same lineage. Lineages are important for showing how a virus spreads through communities or populations. Interestingly, the less virulent strains are disappearing while those showing significant mutant variations prevail. A few documented cases of the spread of the viral sub-strains are observed based on locations, as follows: In USA, 4 sub-strains and 11 top mutations were discovered from the analysis of 12,754 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, where 2 out of 4 discovered sub-strains were potentially more infectious 25 . These sub-strains and 5 mutants were first detected in China, Singapore, and the United Kingdom 26 . In England, a sub-strain of replicative advantage was also discovered as variant of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by 9 spike protein mutations consisting of 3 deletions and 6 substitutions 27 . Some of these variants were prevalent in Netherlands, Switzerland, and France. In Southwestern Wisconsin, Southeastern Minnesota, Northeast Iowa, the sequencing of whole viral genomes of COVID-19 positive patients showed the spread of sub-strains to individuals in 13 cities from epicenters of the infection 28 .

Most biotechnology/ bioinformatics tools are 'black boxes ' and not open to contributions from the research community including reproducible research. Furthermore, extracted features are incomplete to aid meaningful knowledge integration. To support the growing field of medical-and bio-informatics, this paper adopted a novel approach to genome sequence mining. Transitions in nucleotide (dinucleotide) and changes in gene (mutation) information were exploited as input features or predictors, as these features have direct connection with the behavior of the virus. A hierarchical agglomerative clustering method was applied on the extracted features to detect optimal natural clusters for determining the evolutionary group of the various isolates, across countries. Using a self-organizing map (SOM), genome patterns with low similarity profile (or highly variable genomes) including the reference genome, were discerned to visually establish which sub-strain group(s) the various genome samples or isolates belong. By decoupling the SOM map through correlation hunting, a cognitive map that associates similar isolate clusters was obtained. The generated patterns and isolate similarity information provided details for enriching the input dataset through a supervised labelling of the classification targets. Statistical analysis validated the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ variability of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

(ii) Support for the Contact Tracing of Undocumented Source of Infection Tracing infectious diseases routes for efficient documentation of infected cases is very crucial in emerging pandemic situations. While the excavated data holds only few traces of transmission history, our pattern clustering and cognitive knowledge mining results groups the various isolates into sub-strain clusters. This information is then used to label the output targets for classification and prediction, hence, providing understanding of which of the viral sub-strain(s) maintain(s) the reference genome pattern or is/are spreading within a particular country or been acquired from a different country. Furthermore, pattern progressions indicating emerging cluster transitions are revealed by the self-organizing map deployed in this study. (iii) Intelligent System Framework From labelled classification targets, accurate sub-strain classification and prediction is achieved. The proposed framework combines machine learning techniques and cognitive knowledge mining to extract dinucleotide and mutation frequencies for base variant analysis. Also, hidden sub-strains interactions between nucleotide sequences and other information not hitherto seen in the raw data are uncovered. (iv) Gender-Specific Isolates Mining To engage meaningful research in SARS-CoV-2, characterization and prediction by gender is crucial. This aspect which is often missing in the literature was excavated from GSAID. A metadata of excavated SARS-CoV-2 genomes by gender is available (Data S7: SupplData7. xlsx). The metadata permits the intelligent mining of SARS-CoV-2 demographic information, as ambiguities in annotation labels inherent in the Global initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https:// www. gisaid. org/) have been resolved in this paper. Input features and classification target labels of unique isolates based on SOM cluster analysis and cognitive knowledge mining are also available (Data S8: SupplData8.xlsx).

Hence, the expected dinucleotide transitions proportion is the product of the two nucleotide bases. For instance, the CG dinucleotide in the viral genome is 3.60% (i.e., 19.61% \u00d7 18.37%). From this, we arrive at the following computations for the respective dinucleotides/features identified in this study: AA = 8.96%; CC = 3.37%; GG = 3.84%; TT = 10.29%; AC = 5.50%; AG = 5.87%; AT = 9.60%; CG = 3.60%; CT = 5.87%; GT = 6.29%; TG = 6.29%; TC = 5.87%; TA = 9.60%; GC = 3.60%; GA = 5.87%; and CA = 5.50%.

The workflow begins with the excavation of FASTA files of human SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. These files were stripped and processed into a genome database (DB) as multiple columns of nucleotide sequence. AI/ML techniques were then applied to extract knowledge from the genome datasets as follows: Using ML techniques, compute dis(similarities) scores between the various pairs of genome sequences and obtain a genomic tree of highly dis(similar) isolates grouped in the form of a dendrogram/phylogenetic tree. Determine the optimal number of natural clusters-to provide additional knowledge for supervised learning. Separate the viral sub-strains using SOM component planes-for possible transmission pathway/pattern visualization. Perform nucleotide alignment of the entire genome sequences (owing to varying sequence lengths of the different genome isolates, a cutoff at the last nucleotide of the genome isolates or the reference genome serves as the maximum pair for comparison), remove duplicate columns while imposing a similarity threshold-to yield unique genome sequences. Extract genome features by computing dinucleotide transitions and mutation frequencies. Generate cognitive map-for intelligent sub-strains prediction. Label classification targets of extracted features using derived SOM clusters and cognitive map. Learn and predict new/emerging sub-strains using ANN with k-fold validation method. Nucleotide mutations. Mutations in base pairs are important for understanding the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. These computations were compiled after direct pairwise comparisons with the reference genome, averaged across the various continents, to produce Fig. 3 . As expected, changes in base pairs were observed after pairwise comparisons. Also, genome sequences with very negligeable changes or (no significant mutations) from the reference genome were noticed across the various continents for male and female isolates (see Table 3 ). Overall, total insignificant mutants of 587, representing 14.98% of the total number of isolates was observed for male patients, while female patients showed 258 insignificant mutants, representing 9.06% of the total number of isolates.",

While mutations are expected, there is need to initiate robust surveillance mechanism for continuous monitoring of public health implications and rapid response to new strains of COVID-19. To intelligently predict the viral sub-strains for both genders, novel cognitive maps that preserves chains of similar isolates were generated from the SOM component planes using the Python programming lan- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ guage. The extracted clusters are necessary for supervised labeling of the classification targets. By disassembling the SOM correlation hunting matrix space, we attribute these associations to disparate classes of discovered viral sub-strains. The outcome are cognitive maps with 7 clusters simulating the discovered SOM patterns and countries/isolates linked to these patterns for male and female patients (Supplementary Table S3 ). Each sub-strain cluster holds similar isolates that belong to a related pattern bounded by certain degree of association or correlation range, established by the SOM, and captures all isolates discovered within this range. We also captured from the SOM component planes any progression in patterns showing sub-strain(s) development leading to well separated cluster image(s). The cognitive knowledge would assist early contact tracing of cases in emerging disease situations as well as establish how the reference genome has evolved over time. This additional knowledge also permits further characterization of the viral sub-strains, as our results allow unique SARS-CoV-2 base pairs sequence identification (which do not appear in other viral sub-strains) and could be useful as baselines for designing new primers that permit further insights and examination by experts. where, x i is a nucleotide transition or mutation feature, min(X j ) and max(X j ) are the minimum and maximum means obtained from means of the respective nucleotide transitions or mutations feature dataset. The obtained scaling prevents zero values, hence, yielding an even spread of the datasets. Next, using the k-means algorithm, via Silhouette criterion, 7 cluster groups were assigned to the records.

Although addressing underrepresented data in training datasets can resolve bias, while model retraining can assist in improving performance; confusable symptoms relative to the disease have posed a major bottleneck for future applications. This work has created a foundation for future studies on emerging infectious diseases by investigating the variation and functions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes for possible discovery of patterns exhibited by human isolates. A novel taxonomy was created to permit intelligent features mining. The case of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients also presents inconsistencies and is inconclusive in this paper. This aspect of infectious disease demands further research efforts on prompt detection of asymptomatic cases.

The distance separating the clusters is specified via linkage methods 49 which includes, complete, average, single, and ward. Complete linkage computes the similarities and uses the maximum distance between clusters for merging while calculating cluster distances and adopting minimum inter-cluster distance merging. The average linkage calculates the average distance between groups of genome sequence before merging; while the total within-cluster variance is minimized with ward's method and the pair of clusters with minimum betweencluster distance are merged. We rely on all the four assessment techniques and adopt the distance measure with the highest agglomerative coefficient for cluster formation. The resultant cluster solution is finally visualized as a tree structure called a dendrogram (or phylogenomic) tree. As the tree is traversed upwards, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height. The height of the fusion provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are.

Cluster validation (an unsupervised methodology aimed at unravelling the actual count of clusters that best describes a dataset without any priori class knowledge) is therefore essential. In this paper, three widely used criteria to validate the number of clusters in the genome sequence dataset of these widely used criteria namely, silhouette, elbow 50 , and gap-statistics are discussed. The three criteria aim at minimizing the total intra-cluster variation (total within-cluster sum of square) as given in Eq. (3) .",

(ii) For each k , calculate wss. (iii) plot the curve of wss according to the number of clusters k . (iv) the location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters. Silhouette criterion is used to validate the clustering solution using pair-wise difference between the within-cluster distances, and by maximizing the value of this index to arrive at the optimal cluster number 51 . Elbow criterion plots the variance resulting from plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use. Gap-statistics compares the total intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data.

(7) are possible, Unsupervised genome clustering. Several mathematical techniques have been deployed for identifying underlying patterns in complex data. These techniques, which cluster data points differently in multidimensional space are important to discover fundamental patterns of gene expression inherent in data. The clustering technique adopted in this paper is the SOM and has been used extensively in the field of bioinformatics, for visual inspection of biological processes, genes pattern expressions-as maps of (input) component planes analysis. SOM is a neural-network that projects data into a low-dimensional space 55 , by accepting a set of input data and then mapping the data onto neurons of a 2D grid (see Fig. 13 ). The SOM algorithm locates a winning neuron, its adjusting weights, and neighboring neurons. Using an unsupervised, competitive learning process, SOMs produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of the input space of training samples, known as the feature map. During training, weights of the winning neuron and neurons in a predefined neighborhood are adjusted towards the input vector using Eq. where L is the total number of neurons in the network. The input nodes have p features, and the output nodes, q prototypes, with each prototype connected to all features. The weight vector of the connections consumes the prototype of each neuron and has same dimension as the input vector. SOMs differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning, against error correction learning such as backpropagation, and the fact that they preserve the topological properties of the input space using a neighborhood function. where r is the learning rate and f (i, q) is the neighborhood function, with value 1 at the winning neuron q ; and decreases as the distance between i and q increases. At the end, the principal features of the input data are retained, hence, making SOM a dimension reduction technique. The batch unsupervised weight/bias algorithm of MATLAB (trainbu) with mean squared error (MSE) performance evaluation, was adopted to drive the proposed SOM. This algorithm trains a network with weight and bias learning rules using batch updates. The training was carried out in two phases: a rough training with large (initial) neighborhood radius and large (initial) learning rate, followed by a finetuned training phase with smaller radius and learning rate. The rough training phase can span any number of iterations depending on the capacity of the processing device. In this paper, we kept the number of iterations at 200 with initial and final neighborhood radius of 5 and 2, respectively, in addition to a learning rate in the range of 0.5 and 0.1. The fine training phase also had a maximum of 200 epochs, and a fixed learning rate of 0.2. Selection of best centroids of the genome feature within each cluster was based on the Euclidean distance criterion. The algorithm configures output vectors into a topological presentation of the original multi-dimensional data, producing a SOM in which individuals with similar features are mapped to the same map unit or nearby units, thereby creating smooth transition of related genome sequences to unrelated genome sequences over the entire map.",

Although five core Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) areas have been explored, namely: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Radial Basis Network, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks; this paper adopts the Multi-Layer Perceptron model (MLP)a class of feedforward ANNs, with at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer (Fig. 14) . Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Our output classes or classification targets (C1-C7) are derived from pattern clusters discovered from learning the SOM. A k-fold cross-validation method is adopted to divide the data into k parts. At each iteration i , the ith fold is used for testing, while the other folds are used for training. In this paper, the number of groups is split (into k parts) such that each data sample spans 3, 5, 10 and 15 yielding 60, 100, 200 and 300 calls, respectively, on the training and testing mode of each dataset. The k-fold cross validation method is known to estimate the robustness of the model on new data and is used to drive the validation phase of the NN. As the model is fit on training data, a more realistic estimate of how well the model prediction will work on new cases is obtained.

The similarity threshold may be increased or reduced to grow or shrink the size of the component planes window. In this paper, a maximum window size of 250 component planes is allowed, to enable proper viewing of the pattern clusters (see Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of the \"Results and discussion\" section). Pattern correlates generation. A vector representation of pairwise Euclidean distance computation among the vectors in the form of a distance matrix (also called the component plane) is achieved using MATLAB 2017b. Component planes help detect similar patterns in identical positions indicating correlations between the respective components. Local correlations may also occur if two parameter planes are similar in some regions. Both linear and non-linear correlations including local or partial correlations between variables are possible. We achieve the correlation hunting 56 automatically, by decoupling the SOM correlations, to explore patterns among the pairwise genome samples for distinct identification of transmission pathways or routes. The extracted correlation matrices are pairwise relations of the viral sub-strains' transmissions.",

Similarly, Somasundaram et al.29 systematically explored the phylogenetic and viral clade of 28 Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 449 complete genome samples from USA, Europe, China, East Asia, Oceania, Middle East (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) and India were collected from GISAID. A phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood was achieved using IQ tree. Out of the Indian isolates, 26 samples were equally distributed into 2 clusters (A and B). Cluster A consisted of mostly Oceania/Kuwait and 13 Indian samples, while cluster B contained Europe and some of Middle East/South Asian samples together with another 13 Indian samples. The remaining 2 Indian isolates which neither belonged to cluster A nor cluster B, were present in the cluster with mostly China and East-Asia samples.
