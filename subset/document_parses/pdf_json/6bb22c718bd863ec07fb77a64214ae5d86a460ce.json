During the COVID-19 pandemic, visitation restrictions meant communication with patients and their families became a challenge, particularly with intubated patients in the intensive care unit. As the hospital filled with COVID-19 patients, medical students and physicians at Albany Medical Center identified the urgent need for a better communication method with families. In response, the COVID-19 Compassion Coalition (CCC) was formed. The CCC's goal was to decrease the distress felt by families unable to visit their hospitalized loved ones. They developed a streamlined process for videoconferencing between patients on COVID-19 units and their families by using tablets. Having medical students take responsibility for this process allowed nurses and physicians to focus on patient care. Incorporating videoconferencing technology can allow physicians and nurses to better connect with families, especially during unprecedented times like a pandemic.",

Strict visitor restrictions have made this fear a reality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients fighting their condition alone while worried family members remain home. Family members benefit from seeing clinical improvement, or conversely, the extent of the patient's suffering in order to make knowledgeable shared decisions about care-especially at end of life (1) . Since critically ill patients and their families often have anxiety and depression, clinicians worry that the added restrictions on visitors as a consequence of COVID-19 could magnify this stress (2) . Needless to say, family involvement, especially in critical care, is invaluable. It improves communication and increases care satisfaction among the nursing staff, who bear a significant burden of caring for these intensely ill patients (3) . Therefore, it has become imperative to find a way to connect family and patients in real time, especially as hospitalized COVID-19 patients face the terrifying possibility of death. The problem is, who can manage the logistics of creating these meaningful connections while resources are stretched thin?",

A week later, the surge of COVID patients in New York City led to the transfer of hospitalized patients to Albany Medical Center; the urgency of improved communication between patients and family members intensified. Through this necessity was born a self-made team of medical students and frontline physicians who formed the COVID-19 Compassion Coalition (CCC).",

This allowed overwhelmed nurses and doctors to remain focused on patient care since the medical students took responsibility at every step of this process.

Students asked the Information Services department to download 2 programs, Cisco Webex and Apple FaceTime, which were used to initiate video calls between patients and families. For the initial video call, a student instructed the family on how to download the applications and establish the video connection. Many family members were unfamiliar with the technology. In response, the students created a \"Webex tutorial,\" which was emailed to families that required detailed instructions. Once they established the call, the students placed the iPad \u00ae in a sealed plastic bag, attached it to a stand, and gave it to a nurse who rolled it into the patient room. Ideally, this was timed with existing patient care (e.g,, medication administration) to minimize PPE use. The nurses often shared updates on patient care and in some cases, even demonstrated medical interventions, which allowed family members to feel they were part of the process. If their loved one was intubated, family members used the time to sing or sometimes just cry with the patient. Since the iPads were on stands, nurses were free to continue with patient care or leave the room while the call continued. When the call was completed, the nurse then performed their usual PPE doffing process before disposing of the clear plastic bag and returning the iPad \u00ae to the student ( Figure 1 ).",

We believe the initiative eases the burden on health care workers, improves communication with families of patients with COVID-19, and allows for more compassionate, patient-centered care. The ability for a family to have a virtual \"face-to-face\" encounter with their loved one, even if they are intubated and unable to communicate directly, helps heal both the patient and the family. This has also given family members an essential glimpse into the patient's status and supplements the updates they get daily from doctors and nurses. By timing many of the calls closely with difficult discussions about prognosis and end-of-life care, family members have a visual aide to help direct decisions about deescalating care. On multiple occasions, after seeing the patient \"face-to-face,\" family members who had initially expressed guilt about \"giving up\" on their loved ones, were able to better understand the arduous journey that the patient had endured and would ultimately make difficult decisions with peace.",

One nurse in the ICU noted that, while on a call with family, her patient became much more engaged, energetic, and interactive with staff. For patients, families, and health care workers alike, the program provides a necessary lift from the at-times bleak setting of the ICU. One nurse described herself as \"tearing up\" after the intubated man she was caring for began to open his eyes upon hearing his family members' voices on the iPad \u00ae . Sentiments of gratitude from grieving families are shared daily. Following an emotional conversation with their brother just before he died, the sisters of an ICU patient sent a message of thanks to the CCC: \"It means so much to all of us to be able to tell him we love him as he is in this situation and no one can be there with him. Once again, pass our sincere thanks on to the nurse and his docs from [patient's] family. You are a rock star, and so are they.\" ",

Therefore, we asked nurses to identify more convenient time slots and alerted families to the need for flexibility in scheduling video calls based on nursing availability. Setting clear expectations between medical students, nurses, and family members helped alleviate these stressors. The nurses reported additional pressure to answer medical update questions, which were more appropriate for the physician. Clarification on the goal of the call before the \"appointment\" helped; family members were reassured that medical concerns would be addressed by the physician directly at another time. Additionally, methods to ensure efficient PPE usage and manpower were developed as time went on.",
