The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization for >14 days, or death. The key secondary outcomes included time to respiratory failure, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, mortality at 30 days, and SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR clearance rate. Of 58 randomized patients (mean age, 65.8 years; 50% male), 57 (98.3%) completed the trial. A total of 13 (43.3%) participants from the deferred group received plasma based on clinical aggravation. We failed to find benefit in the primary outcome (32.1% versus 33.3%, odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.32-2.84, p > 0.999) in the early versus deferred CP group. The inhospital mortality rate was 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54-17.17 p = 0.246), mechanical ventilation 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54-17.17, p = 0.246), and prolonged hospitalization 21.4% versus 30.0% (OR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.19-2.10, p = 0.554) in the early versus deferred CP group, respectively. The viral clearance rate on day 3 (26% versus 8%, p = 0.204) and day 7 (38% versus 19%, p = 0.374) did not differ between groups. Two patients experienced serious adverse events within 6 hours after plasma transfusion.

During the early months of the pandemic, case series and cohorts from China and the United States analyzed demographic and outcome data for hundreds of inpatients admitted for COVID-19. These showed an intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate between 5% and 26%, and overall mortality from 1.4% to 28.3% [2, 3] . Older age, male sex, and preexisting hypertension and/or diabetes rapidly stood out among risk factors correlating with case fatality rate, in the first large case series of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the US [4] . The scientific community is desperate to find effective treatments and immunization against SARS-CoV-2, and so far, dexamethasone is the only drug that has shown a survival benefit, among those patients who are receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization [5] . The antiviral remdesivir has shown a shorter time to recovery in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and with evidence of lower respiratory tract infection, but its effect on overall mortality remains controversial [6] . An additional promising therapeutic alternative is immune plasma from convalescent patients [7] . This strategy has been used with some success in other viral diseases with significant lethality such as hantavirus, influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections [8] [9] [10] [11] . The use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 was reported early in this pandemic. The initial case series studies suggested faster clinical recovery, viral clearance, and radiological improvement, although the lack of a control group limited the accurate interpretation of these results [12] [13] [14] . Subsequently, a preliminary report of a matched controlled study showed that convalescent plasma improved survival for non-intubated patients [15] . However, the first 2 randomized controlled trials showed no clear clinical benefit, and, furthermore, 1 of these trials was stopped early due to concerns based on finding high preexisting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in patients before transfusion [16, 17] .",

            "text": "We actively selected patients at high risk of developing complications-based on CALL score-and indeed, over 40% of our participants developed severe respiratory failure. The failure to find clinical benefit from convalescent plasma therapy in these patients may be explained by several reasons. First, humoral immunity may not play a major role in the subset of patients who have already initiated a highly pro-inflammatory response and in whom inflammation and coagulopathy may be more important than viral replication in disease progression [33] . We do not know whether preselection of plasma units with a very high concentration of NAbs or a larger volume of plasma could have succeeded in blunting this dysregulated inflammatory response. Additionally, an early adaptive immune response might be necessary to drive more effective infection control. Indeed, different cellular and humoral responses are generated in mild versus severe COVID-19 cases, and it has been reported that a specific cellular response can be detected early in the course of non-severe COVID-19 [34, 35] . Second, the possible lack of efficacy may relate to a too late administration of plasma in the course of the disease, in which a dysregulated immune response predominates and is independent of the virus cell entry blockade achieved by immunoglobulins [7, 18] . Previous randomized trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 included patients who had a longer time gap between symptom onset and transfusion as well as more severe disease at enrollment [16, 17] . Despite setting a strict \ufffd7 days of symptoms inclusion criterion, in our study, over 96% of participants had already established pneumonia on CT scan at enrollment. Hence, it is possible that some patients had a more rapid or aggressive course, or, particularly for older adults, true COVID-19 symptom onset went unnoticed until several days into the disease course. Nonetheless, that the study population reflected early-stage COVID-19 was well supported by the fact that at enrollment over 74% of our participants did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and about 60% did not have significant NAb capacity. Third, given the design of our study, plasma administration in the deferred plasma group may have prevented the primary outcome from developing. However, the probability and time to progression to respiratory failure did not differ between the study groups. Since respiratory failure was one of the prespecified criteria for plasma administration in the deferred plasma group, this secondary outcome allowed us to compare early plasma versus no plasma, further supporting a possible lack of efficacy.",

In spite of the fact that the majority of clinical trials of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 were still ongoing, convalescent plasma received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [37] . Reassuringly, in a recent report of 20,000 hospitalized patients receiving convalescent plasma for COVID-19, the incidence of related SAEs in the first 4 hours after infusion was <0.5% [38] . Nonetheless, in the present study, 2 participants developed acute respiratory failure after transfusion. Given that the patients were, according to the known evolution of COVID-19, in the peak of their inflammatory phase, it was challenging to determine if the respiratory failure corresponded to a TRALI [39] .",

First, NAbs were not determined in donor plasma before the patient's transfusion, and we could not select the plasma units with the highest neutralizing activity. Additionally, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the dose of convalescent plasma needed to effectively increase the pool of antibodies required to neutralize the virus in the blood and in other compartments, and in the present study, the non-significant change of antibody titers suggests that the convalescent plasma dose may have been insufficient. Second, the study was not powered to detect a risk reduction smaller than 35% in the primary endpoint, and therefore we cannot exclude that convalescent plasma may show smaller but clinically relevant effects in a future larger clinical trial. Third, as this was an openlabel study, cointerventions such as steroid use may have unintendedly influenced outcomes [5] . Such management was not standardized, although alternative drug therapies were equally distributed in both study arms.",

Other large case series have reported that the median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 days in the US and 6 days in Madrid, Spain [40, 41] . Thus, a considerable proportion of patients will inevitably have passed the 7-day symptom window when admitted. This implies that new strategies such as outpatient plasma administration in newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections in selected patients at higher risk of COVID-19 complications-such as older individuals with comorbidities-should be explored. However, before proceeding with further large clinical trials, convalescent plasma dosage (volume and antibody titer levels) critically requires optimization; this could be studied safely in healthy volunteers or in post-exposure prophylaxis studies.",
