However, false-negative RT-PCR tests are reported and could hinder the control of the pandemic. Chest computed tomography could achieve a more reliable diagnosis and represent a complementary diagnostic tool. Aim. To perform a meta-analysis and systematic review to find out the role of chest computed tomography versus RT-PCR for precise diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Methods. We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus) from April 1 to April 20, 2020, to find out articles including the accuracy of chest computed tomography scan versus RT-PCR for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational studies, case series, and case reports were included. Results. A total of 238 articles were retrieved from the search strategy. Following screening, 39 articles were chosen for full text assessment and finally 35 articles were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Chest computed tomography showed a wide range of sensitivity varied from 12%-100%. Conclusion. Chest computed tomography is playing a key role for diagnosis and detection of COVID-19 infection. Computed tomography image findings may precede the initially positive RT-PCR assay.",

Twenty-one (21/1014, 2%) patients had positive RT-PCR results but without abnormalities on initial CT examination. e chest CT features of (308/1014, 30%) patients suggested COVID-19, while their RT-PCR assays from oropharyngeal specimens were negative. e authors stated that positive chest CT findings despite of negative RT-PCR test results can still be highly indicative of COVID-19 infection [6]. Fang et al. conducted a study on 51 patients, 36/51 (70.5%) had initial positive RT-PCR, while 12/51 patients were confirmed by two RT-PCR tests, 2/51 patients by three tests, and 1 patient by four tests. erefore, according to Fang et al., a single respiratory swab offers a positivity rate of 70%, an extra 24% after a second test, and an additional 3.9% after a third one. On the contrary, 98% of the patients had abnormal chest CT scan findings compatible with viral pneumonia [20]. Xie et al. conducted another study involving 167 laboratory-confirmed cases. For 155/167 patients (93%), both RT-PCR and chest CT were concordant for COVID-19 infection. In 7 patients (4%), RT-PCR was positive with initially negative chest CT scan. Five patients (3%) were with negative initial RT-PCR and positive CT scan [21]. Long et al.'s study included 36 cases with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 infection.

Wu et al. conducted a descriptive study for clinical, laboratory, and imaging features for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. eir study included 80 laboratoryconfirmed cases by RT-PCR. Fifty-five (55/80, 68.7%) patients had abnormal chest CT imaging and twenty-five (25/ 80, 31%) patients had initially normal chest CT with positive RT-PCR. Hence, the authors suggested that chest imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis [29]. Wang et al. reported that only 5/125 (4%) laboratoryconfirmed cases showed no abnormal findings on chest CT scan [30]. Additionally, Guan et al. studied the clinical characteristics of 1099 COVID-19 confirmed cases by RT-PCR in China and reported that 230/1099 had normal radiological findings by both chest radiograph and chest CT [31]. On the contrary, Zhifeng et al. reported the lowest sensitivity for chest CT in comparison to the gold standard RT-PCR. e sensitivity of chest CT was 12% (95% CI: 4.6-24.3) while the sensitivity of RT-PCR testing was 30.16% (95% CI: 19.2-43) [32]. According to our literature review, this study is considered as an outlying study; however, it was not excluded and included in our analysis. Dai et al. studied the chest CT and clinical features of 234 SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases. Six (6/234, 2.5%) patients had initially negative RT-PCR and 15/234 (6.4%) patients were without abnormal lung changes by CT. us, the reported chest CT sensitivity is 93.6% [33]. Likewise, Ding et al. studied the chest CT findings by duration of symptoms, 17/112 (15%) laboratory-confirmed cases with different stages of symptomatic COVID-19 infection showed no lung abnormalities.us, the reported sensitivity for chest CT is (84.8%)[34]. Additionally, Hu et al. studied the chest CT features for 46 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Two cases were negative according to the first chest CT and were positive on the second/follow-up CT, with reported sensitivity 95.6%[35].4.2. Analysis of Case Series.Bhat et al. reported case series of 8 confirmed cases from USA. ey used chest radiography as the initial diagnostic tool and Chest CT was not performed for all cases. Case no. 1 showed initially negative swab for COVID-19 with positive CT findings, the RT-PCR testing turned positive when repeated (2nd time). Case no. 2 showed initially negative RT-PCR with positive findings by chest radiography (chest CT not performed); the nucleic acid testing turned positive on 8th day. Interestingly, the authors pointed to the American College of Radiology recommendations to use chest imaging in specific clinical conditions and not to screen or diagnose COVID-19 infections. Additionally, a significant overlap in imaging findings with other viral, bacterial, or organizing pneumonias; collagen vascular disease; and drug toxicities should be considered[36].Lescure et al. reported a case series for 5 confirmed cases from France. Two patients (case nos. 4 and 5) showed normal chest imaging (by CXR, CT not performed) despite positive RT-PCR and high viral load[37].",
