Methods: Trough a survey the study aimed: (a) to evaluate the incidence of allergic reactions in patients with latex allergy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; (b) to evaluate the protective role of continuous latex sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) during this period; and (c) to evaluate quality of life of natural rubber latex allergy (NRLA) patients during the pandemic. Results: 67 patients (9 males and 58 females, mean age of 45.9 \u00b1 11.4 years) suffering from latex allergy were included in the present study. We recorded among our patients 13 cases (34.2%) of urticarial/angioedema (U/A), 9 cases (23.6%) of respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, shortness of breath and wheezing) and 7 cases (18.4%) of anaphylaxis. In patients who underwent continuous SLIT, we observed less cases of U/A (p < 0.001), respiratory symptoms (p < 0.001), anaphylaxis (p = 0.003), hospitalizations (p = 0.014) and a lower therapy administration. We compared the results of SF-36 questionnaire in patients who underwent continuous and not-continuous SLIT with a significance differences score between these two groups. Conclusions: Our study is the first that investigated the clinical and quality of life effects of COVID-19 pandemic in NRLA patients.",

            "text": "Latex hypersensitivity has been increasingly reported worldwide, with a prevalence of 9.7%-12.4% among healthcare workers (HCWs), 7.2%-30.4% among susceptible patients and 4.3%-2.1% in general population. 2 Occupation represents a possible risk factor for natural rubber latex allergy (NRLA); healthcare workers, rubber industry workers, hairdressers and housekeepers are mostly exposed to these sensitisations. Other risk factors include atopic history, exposure to latex-derived products during surgery and sensitizations through skin contact or inhalation. [3] [4] [5] [6] The clinical manifestations of NRLA include contact dermatitis, urticaria-angioedema, respiratory symptoms and can lead to anaphylactic reactions. 7 The diagnosis of NRL allergy is based on a positive allergological work-up, including allergological tests (skin prick test and specific serum IgE assay-ImmunoCAP System) and provocation challenges (glove-wearing, mucous-oral, nasal, conjunctival and sublingual provocation test) to confirm clinical latex allergy. Sublingual latex immunotherapy provides a 4 days rush protocol, starting with a drop of latex solution (500 \u03bcg/ml) diluted 1:1018 until the highest dose of 1 mL of undiluted solution (500 \u03bcg of latex), then a maintenance therapy (500 \u03bcg of undiluted solution three times a week) is recommended, without discontinuations. 8 Primary prevention remains essential to reduce the risk of reactions in NRLA patients, and it is obtained by avoiding the airborne and contact exposure to natural rubber latex (NRL). 9 During the COVID-19 pandemic primary prevention is very difficult to reach considering NRL is ubiquitous and widely used. Hence, the protection conferred by latex SLIT could be essential for these patients.",
