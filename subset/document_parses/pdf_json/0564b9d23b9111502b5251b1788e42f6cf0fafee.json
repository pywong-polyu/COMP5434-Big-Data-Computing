Caption: Based on COVID-19 related non-pharmaceutical interventions recorded in Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, the stringency index represented the extent of containment and closure policies and public health information campaigns on the country level. 15 The value of the stringency index ranges between 0 and 100, with 0 indicating the least stringent conditions, and 100 the most stringent conditions. We extracted stringency index data on 5 Mar 2021, on which complete records for our countries of interest are available before 22 Feb 2021. We assume over one year from 22 Feb 2021, as vaccines roll out, stringency indices gradually recover towards pre-pandemic levels. However, due to long-term behaviour and policy changes, we expect that stringency indices will never fully return to 0 in the time frame of this study. Thus, we assume stringency indices will return to 10 over 365 days, regardless of their positions on 22 Feb 2021, following a sigmoid function. After 22 Feb 2022, the stringency indices would stay at 10 to reflect any long-term changes COVID-19 policies have on human behaviours.

During the period where empirical observation was available, the contacts in the school setting were modulated by the \"school closure\" variable (i.e. C1_school_closing) in the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker. The variable C1_school_closing is ordinal: when C1_school_closing reached the highest value (i.e. 3, require closing all levels), the multiplier was set to 0 to indicate no school contacts; when C1_school_closing reached the lowest value (i.e. 0, require closing all levels), the multiplier was set to 1 to indicate school-based contacts were similar to pre-pandemic levels; when C1_school_closing was set to levels in between, the multiplier was assumed to be 0.5 to indicate an intermediate level of school-based contact intensity. During the transition between pandemic and post-pandemic phases and the post-pandemic phases, contacts in the school setting were only driven by the summer and winter holidays. The timing of summer and winter holidays varies in the European Union. 35 Here, we broadly assume summer holidays to go for two months between July and August, and winter holidays to go for 3 weeks between mid-December to the first week of January. During school holidays, school-based contacts were set to 0.",

We only expanded using V60 and V75 as the last groups vaccinated were younger adults, with whom it may make sense to potentially include adolescents. We found that vaccinating adolescents would bring additional health and economic benefits and that vaccinating adolescents simultaneously with younger adults was more beneficial than vaccinating them after the maximum uptake level among younger adults have been reached.
