            "text": "Knockout mouse models have been extensively used to study the antiviral activity of IFIT (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats). Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of \"self\" in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess \"nonself\" cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents, the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost, and the closely related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c. Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA-binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, whereas binding is much weaker to cap0-and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict WT mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.",

In eukaryotes, the mRNA cap consists of a guanosine nucleotide covalently linked to the first RNA nucleotide by a 59-59 triphosphate bridge (capG, GpppNN), which is methylated at the N-7 position (cap0, m 7 GpppNN) to facilitate nuclear export and translation initiation factor recruitment. In higher eukaryotes, including insects and vertebrates, mRNA is further modified by methylation on the 29hydroxyl of the first and second cap-proximal nucleotide riboses (cap1, m 7 GpppNmN and cap2, m 7 GpppNmNm) (1). Coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2, and mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus (ZIKV), encode viral 29-O-methyltransferases to produce cap1 viral mRNAs (2) , which effectively mimic those of the host to avoid immune surveillance.",

            "text": "Sensing of mRNA 29-O-methylation in vertebrates is primarily mediated by a family of antiviral RNA-binding proteins known as IFITs (interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats). In most mammals, including humans, the IFIT family comprises five members: IFIT1, IFIT1B, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5 (3, 4) . IFITs are comprised of tandem tetratricopeptide repeat motifs that form superhelical N-and C-terminal domains joined by a pivot domain of variable length and flexibility (5) . Structures of human IFIT1 and IFIT5 have shown that the groove between these N-and C-terminal domains is lined with positively charged residues which nonspecifically coordinate the phosphate backbone of single-stranded RNA (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . As such, IFIT5 binds specifically to single-stranded RNA that lacks a 59 cap (59ppp) (7, 11, 12) . IFIT1 has an additional hydrophobic cavity within the N terminus that can accommodate the 59 cap and consequently has high affinity for cap0 RNA (8) . However, because of steric restrictions within the mRNA-binding channel, IFIT1 binds to cap1 RNA with much lower affinity and cannot bind to cap2-RNA (8, 13) . Binding to the 59 extremity of cap0 transcripts allows IFIT1 to effectively out-compete the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4F, thereby inhibiting translation at the initiation stage (11) . Although IFIT3 does not bind RNA directly, its ability to form a complex with IFIT1 via a conserved C-terminal interaction motif greatly increases IFIT1 stability and cap0-RNA-binding affinity, thereby promoting IFIT1 antiviral activity (13, 14) .",

Instead, these species typically harbor multiple copies of the Ifit1b gene. In mice, Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c ( Fig. 1A) (also called Ifit1b1, Ifit1b2, and Ifit1b3, to reflect their evolutionary relatedness) (4) . Despite the high degree of sequence identity between these paralogues, their functions remain unknown, and there is little evidence supporting their expression in mouse cells. In these species, Ifit3 has also undergone a 39 truncation and lacks the potential to interact with murine Ifit1 (4, 13, 14) . Therefore, rodent Ifits may have alternative mechanisms to regulate their expression and function, which are distinct from the human IFIT complex.",

We verified expression of noncanonical family members Ifit1b, Ifit1c, and Ifit3b in murine cells and found that Ifit1b binds to cap1-RNA with remarkable affinity and specificity. Ifit1b selectively inhibited cap1-RNA translation and restricted the replication of WT mouse coronavirus in vitro. We then established the different Ifit complexes that can form in mice and found that Ifit1c acts as a cofactor to Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their stability and translation inhibition activity, thereby fulfilling a role analogous to human IFIT3. As such, this study helps to elucidate the ways in which primates and rodents have developed convergent roles for IFIT proteins in the innate immune response that occupy their same functional niche. We additionally highlight key distinctions between the human and murine IFIT families in the hope that this will inform use of mouse models in understanding IFIT biology and antiviral activity.",

Although the expression patterns of murine Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3 have been examined in detail (24) (25) (26) (27) , the expression of the other three members of the murine Ifit family, Ifit1b, Ifit1c, and Ifit3b, has yet to be formally verified in mouse cells. To address this, murine Ifit expression was examined in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells, 17Cl-1 immortalized fibroblasts, and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The cells were stimulated with recombinant IFNb or transfected with synthetic dsRNA (poly(I:C)) for up to 48 h. The cell lysates were examined by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analysis, using qPCR primers (Fig. S1 ) and antibodies (Fig. S2 ) specific to each murine Ifit family member. Because Ifit3 and Ifit3b differ by only 5 amino acids, it was not possible to differentiate between these proteins by immunoblotting so, to reflect this, this band will be annotated as Ifit3/3b. Consistent with previous reports (25, 26) , Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3 mRNA expression was rapidly induced following stimulation of RAW264.7 cells, with peak expression observed at 3-6 h poststimulation ( Fig. 1B and Fig. S3A ). Expression decreased between 9 and 24 h poststimulation. Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3/3b proteins were detectable 6-12 h following stimulation, just after the peak of mRNA expression (Fig. 1D ). Ifit mRNA expression was induced to a lesser extent in 17Cl-1 fibroblast cells, and expression was delayed compared with expression in RAW264.7 cells, with peak mRNA expression at 12-24 h poststimulation ( Fig. 1C and Fig. S3B) . Similarly, at the protein level, Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3/3b were detectable at 24-48 h poststimulation (Fig. 1E ), slightly later than in the RAW264.7 cells. In MEFs, the Ifit mRNA induction patterns were similar to RAW264.7 cells, although the magnitude of induction was 10-100-fold lower, and expression had largely returned to baseline by 24-48 h poststimulation (Fig. S3C ). In both 17Cl-1 cells and MEFs, induction of Ifit2 expression was lower compared with RAW264.7 cells, indicating that Ifit2 may be regulated differently in fibroblasts compared with macrophages ( Fig. 1 , compare D and E, and Fig. S3 ).",

An Fluc reporter mRNA flanked by the 59-and 39-untranslated regions of human b-globin (Globin-Fluc) was transcribed and capped in vitro (Fig. 2, A and B) . The efficiency of cap methylation was verified using a primer extension inhibition assay, based on the propensity of reverse transcriptase to terminate at methylated nucleotides, dependent on Mg 21 concentration (28, 29) . Reverse transcription was carried out using avian myoblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase in the presence of a range of Mg 21 concentrations. At high Mg 21 concentrations, fulllength signal was present for all mRNAs, as well as a proportion of 1 nt longer cDNAs, consistent with low-level terminal transferase activity (29) . At lower Mg 21 concentrations, however, 1 or 2 nt shorter cDNA products were predominant for cap1 and cap2 RNA, respectively. At very low Mg 21 concentrations, only the lower band was detectable for cap1 and cap2 RNA, but not for cap0 RNA. This indicates high cap methylation efficiency, because no residual full-length signal was detectable (Fig. 2B) .",

Representative species of coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)) and flavivirus (ZIKV) were chosen, which have different degrees of RNA secondary structure at their 59 ends (Fig. S5 ). Serial dilutions of Ifit1b were incubated with Fluc mRNAs bearing differentially methylated 59 caps, and luciferase activity was used to monitor translation in RRL, as previously. 50% inhibitory concentrations were interpolated from the data and are presented in Table 1 . Consistent with its described cap0-RNA-binding activity, Ifit1 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cap0 globin-Fluc mRNA translation (IC 50 Fig. 3C , red line). Inhibition of the cap0-MHV reporter by Ifit1b was similar to the inhibition of the cap0-Globin reporter (IC 50 ; 690 nM), supporting specificity for cap1-RNA binding over cap0. However, inhibition of cap2-MHV mRNA was slightly greater, indicating looser binding specificity to this reporter (IC 50 = 238 nM). Therefore, the sequence or structure of MHV mRNA may alter cap-binding specificity, as well as affinity.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that Ifit1b should be capable of inhibiting the translation of a proportion of host mRNA transcripts. To investigate this, a puromycylation-labeling approach was taken (36) . Puromycin is an antibiotic that mimics the structure of aminoacylated tRNA and is thus incorporated into the nascent polypeptide chain during elongation, resulting in premature chain termination. When mammalian cells are treated with low concentrations of puromycin, it is stochastically incorporated toward the C termini of nascent polypeptides. Using antibodies raised against puromycin, these labeled proteins can be detected by Western blotting, thereby allowing visualization of the nascent proteome of the treated cell.",

They were then incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of cap0-or cap1-globin25 RNA, before thermal stability analysis.

Mutation of the charged residues in the cap-binding loop had little effect on cap1-RNA binding.

Mutation of both Glu 50 and Arg 54 to the equivalent residues in Ifit1 and conserved in human IFIT1 (glutamine and leucine, respectively) restored cap1 binding back to WT levels (Fig. 6C) . Previously, in human IFIT1, mutation of these residues to alanine only slightly reduced cap0-RNA binding (8), indicating that they contribute to stable cap binding, but their exact identity is not critical. We also observed a slight increase in cap0-RNA binding by the E50A and E50Q/R54L mutants, indicating that they may impact RNA-binding specificity, even though these residues do not contact the first RNA nucleotide (Fig. 6D, left  panel) . Together, these results indicate that Ifit1b likely engages the cap using the conserved tryptophan 144 residue, but the other face of the cap-guanosine is coordinated nonspecifically, in this case by long, polar side chains in the cap-binding loop, which may impact cap-binding specificity.",

Therefore, His 192 was investigated for its contribution to RNA methylation sensing, by mutation to alanine, arginine, or glutamate. Mutation to alanine reduced stabilization by cap1 RNA by half, whereas mutation to glutamate had no effect on cap1-RNA binding. However, H192E increased stabilization of Ifit1b by cap0 RNA by 2-fold, indicating that His 192 may indeed play a role in discriminating RNA methylation state (Fig. 6C) . Mutation of His 192 to arginine, mimicking human IFIT1 and murine Ifit1, abrogated RNA binding entirely. However, Ifit1b H192R was less stable than WT Ifit1b, indicating that H192R may disrupt the correct folding of Ifit1b, accounting for the loss of RNA-binding activity.

Human IFIT1 was recently described to homodimerize in a concentration-dependent manner, via the C-terminal YXXXL motif (39) . BSA, which is a 65-kDa monomer with a small proportion of 132-kDa dimeric species, was used as a size marker for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). When analyzed by SEC, Ifit1 and Ifit1b eluted after the BSA dimer but before the BSA monomer peak, indicating that these proteins are homodimers (Fig. S11, A and B) . This was confirmed for Ifit1b, which had the molecular weight of a dimer when analyzed by SEC coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) at different concentrations (Fig. S11C) . When the YXXXL motif was mutated in either Ifit1 or Ifit1b, the mutant proteins eluted later on the SEC column, after the BSA monomer, indicating that they are indeed monomeric (Fig. S11, A and B). When analyzed by SEC, MBP-Ifit1c CTD eluted in the void fraction, consistent with the poor stability of this protein and its tendency to aggregate, and so was not suitable for SEC-MALS analysis.",

(13) for the interrogation of human IFIT interactions. Equimolar MBP-tagged bait and Histagged prey proteins were incubated together at 30\u02daC for 1 h, before precipitation on amylose resin. Ifit3 was included as a negative control in each experiment and, consistent with a recent report (13), did not coprecipitate with any of the baits tested (Fig. 7, B-D) . MBP-Ifit1 precipitated both Ifit1b and Ifit1 ( Fig. 7B and S12A) , whereas MBP-Ifit1b precipitated both Ifit1 and Ifit1b (Fig. 7C and Fig. S12B ), indicating that Ifit1 and Ifit1b are capable of heterocomplexing. When Ifit1 and Ifit1b were incubated together and analyzed by SEC, the eluting species was the same size as the Ifit1 or Ifit1b homodimers, and higher order species were not detected (Fig. S11D ). MBP alone did not interact with Ifit1b or Ifit3 (Fig. 7B , lower panel) but pulled down a trace amount of Ifit1 (Fig. 7C, lower panel) . Because Ifit1 had a tendency to precipitate during this assay, this likely represents nonspecific binding of Ifit1 to the MBP or to the beads themselves.",

However, despite the contaminants present in the recombinant MBP-Ifit1c, Ifit1b was clearly visible in the precipitate, indicative of an interaction (Fig. S12D) . Because of the presence of a contaminant band in Ifit1c at the same molecular weight as Ifit1, this interaction was more difficult to confirm (Fig. S12C ). To circumvent this, a truncated MBP-tagged Ifit1c construct was generated, containing the three most C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (MBP-Ifit1c CTD , amino acids 338-470; Fig.  S12E ), which allowed purification of clean recombinant Ifit1c for use as bait. Ifit1 and Ifit1b both precipitated with MBP-Ifit1c CTD , whereas Ifit3 did not (Fig. 7D) . Therefore, Ifit1c can specifically form complexes with both Ifit1 and Ifit1b via its Cterminal domain.",

MBP-tagged Ifits were used as bait and incubated with prey protein at 30\u02daC before binding to amylose resin, as previously. The beads were then washed with increasing concentrations of a competitor prey protein, with the expectation that higher affinity interactions should displace lower affinity ones. However, we observed that even high concentrations of Ifit1b could not disrupt the interaction between Ifit1 and MBP-Ifit1c CTD (Fig. S12F) , and likewise Ifit1 did not disrupt the Ifit1b-MBP-Ifit1c CTD complex (Fig. S12G) . Next, MBP-Ifit1c CTD was incubated together with both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, at different temperatures. When incubated together on ice MBP-Ifit1c CTD coprecipitated both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, to a similar extent (Fig. S12H ). Because this interaction occurred even at low temperatures, it indicates that heterocomplexing is preferential and high affinity, but Ifit1c binds to both Ifit1 and Ifit1b with comparable affinity. Slightly more Ifit1 coprecipitated with MBP-Ifit1c CTD when the proteins were incubated at 30\u02daC (Fig. S12I) , which may be indicative of aggregation, rather than true preferential interaction, as we observed with MBP-only (Fig. 7C, lower panel) . Therefore, these experiments indicate that purified Ifit1c can interact with both Ifit1 and Ifit1b to a similar extent, and these interactions are preferential over homodimerization.",

The 2A sequence efficiently skips a peptide bond during translation elongation, effectively cleaving the two proteins (40) , allowing stoichiometric coexpression of Ifit proteins from the same plasmid. Ifit1c was either WT or had a mutant YXXXL (YL) motif to disrupt heterocomplexing. For consistency and clarity, in Fig. 8 both mCherry-Ifit1 and eGFP-Ifit1b fluorescent proteins are shown in green, whereas FLAG-Ifit1c is shown in magenta (Fig. 8A) .",

MBP-Ifit1c CTD also enhanced translation inhibition by Ifit1b at higher concentrations, allowing almost complete inhibition of translation, suggesting that Ifit1c may promote saturation of RNA binding by Ifit1b. The addition of mutant MBP-Ifit1c CTD -YL did not enhance translation inhibition, indicating that interaction between Ifit1 or Ifit1b and Ifit1c is necessary for Ifit1c cofactor activity (Fig. 9, B and C) . When human IFIT3 was added to a translation reaction with human IFIT1, inhibition of cap0-MHV-Fluc translation was enhanced, as we previously described (14) . By comparison, the addition of Ifit1c CTD did not affect translation inhibition by human IFIT1 (Fig. 9D) . Together, these results indicate that Ifit1c can specifically act as a cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b to enhance their translation inhibition activity. Melting temperatures (T m ) were interpolated from the data presented in Fig. 6 . The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Boltzmann equation: y = LL (UL -LL)/(1 1 exp(T mx)/a), where LL and UL are the lower and upper limit, respectively. Mouse Ifit1b paralogues are functional antiviral effectors Discussion IFIT proteins play extensive and diverse roles not only in antiviral defense, but also in inflammation, cancer, and autoimmunity (reviewed in Refs. 15, 43, and 44). Studying their function in vivo is invaluable for properly understanding their role in modulating such complex diseases. Given the widespread use of animal models, particularly mice, in biomedical research, it is important to understand how their innate immune systems differ from that of humans to properly evaluate the usefulness of data generated by animal studies with regards to human disease. However, in recent years it has become increasingly clear that the human and murine IFIT families differ in key aspects in terms of both their function and their regulation.",

The antiviral effect of Ifit2, however, was due to an enhancement of innate immune signaling, much like we reported recently for murine Ifit1 (32), rather than a direct effect on viral replication. Human IFIT1 can inhibit cap0-mutant strains of a number of human coronaviruses, whereas murine Ifit1 can inhibit cap0-mutant MHV, but neither could inhibit the replication of WT virus (21) (22) (23) .",

Previously, IFIT proteins have been identified that can bind to cap1-RNA with low affinity, particularly rabbit IFIT1B, but in all cases could also bind strongly to cap0-RNA (4, 8, 9, 11) . Our mutational analysis implicated histidine 192 as a key residue in Ifit1b cap1 sensing, although the exact mechanism of cap1 discrimination remains uncertain. It is possible that specific contacts are made between His 192 and the RNA 29-O-methyl group itself, to stabilize the Ifit1b-RNA complex, allowing preferential binding to cap1 over cap0. This mechanism of RNA-binding has been shown previously for eIF4E5, one isoform of the cap-binding translation initiation factor eIF4E, from trypanosome parasites. eIF4E5 interacts with cap4-methylated mRNA, a methylation state unique to these parasites, by making specific contacts between certain hydrophobic sidechains and the methylated RNA backbone, resulting in significantly higher affinity of eIF4E5 for cap4over cap0-RNA (46) .",

Furthermore, even though Ifit1 is expressed throughout the brain following WNV infection (50) , WNV infection in the central nervous system was unaffected by Ifit1 knockout (18) . However, both murine Ifit1 and human IFIT1 can restrict cap0-mutant WNV replication in certain cell lines (13, 17, 18) Differences in the expression or activity of IFIT proteins in different tissues between humans and mice may have major implications for the safety and efficacy of a cap0 WNV vaccine strain.",

However, murine Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c maintain the YXXXL motif at the C terminus, and we found that these proteins can interact, likely as heterodimers. Like human IFIT complexes, interaction between murine Ifit proteins was shown to increase their thermal stability, suggesting that heterocomplexing is a thermodynamically preferable state. In mouse cells, Ifit1c expression was significantly enhanced by coexpression with Ifit1 or Ifit1b.

We previously hypothesized that the long C-terminal domain of human IFIT3, which is extended by two a-helices relative to IFIT1, promoted RNA binding by IFIT1 (14) . IFIT3 was shown to make contacts with the C-terminal and pivot domains of IFIT1 (13) , which suggested that IFIT3 may alter the flexibility of IFIT1, causing it to remain bound to cap0-RNA and thereby increasing its affinity. This, in turn, allows IFIT1 to more effectively out-compete eIF4E for binding to the mRNA cap, inhibiting translation initiation at lower IFIT concentrations. However, in mice, Ifit1c does not have a long C-terminal tail, which would allow an analogous mechanism of action, suggesting that Ifit1c may act in a different way to enhance RNA binding by Ifit1 and Ifit1b. This may explain why murine Ifit1c could not enhance translation inhibition by human IFIT1 and why human IFIT3 did not bind to murine Ifit1 in a previous study (13) .",

Given that IFIT1 and IFIT1B are cap-RNA-binding proteins, this proposes a situation in which the IFIT proteins that are capable of binding to capped RNA need to form complexes with regulatory IFIT cofactors. This may allow fine-tuned expression of IFIT proteins that have the potential to inhibit cellular translation (51) and therefore pose a cytotoxic risk. It may also be a way of integrating IFIT-RNA binding into the wider innate immune response. IFIT3 in humans, for example, is known to stimulate innate immune signaling by promoting the interaction between MAVS, an adaptor protein in the cytoplasm downstream of dsRNA sensing and its activating kinase TBK1 (52, 53) . The impact of a heterocomplex of IFIT1 and IFIT3, bound to nonself RNA, on innate immune signaling has yet to be investigated. IFIT3 additionally forms a heterocomplex with the proapoptotic IFIT2, via a different interaction interface in the N terminus, and decreases IFIT2-directed cell death (14, 54) . Therefore, in humans but not in mice, the regulation of IFIT1 is intrinsically linked to the regulation of IFIT2, because they share a cofactor. The implications of IFIT coregulation in innate immunity, apoptosis, and other cellular processes are still unknown.",

            "text": "In summary, this present study, coupled with previous evolutionary analyses of the IFIT family (3, 4) , has revealed convergent mechanisms for RNA binding and complex formation between species, even though the IFIT locus itself has undergone major restructuring. A model for convergent human IFIT and murine Ifit function is presented in Fig. 10 . In humans there is a single protein, IFIT1, which binds very strongly to nonself cap0-RNA, but may also weakly bind to self cap1-RNA and inhibit its translation (4, 8, 11, 16) . Human IFIT1 is highly expressed in response to IFN (12), along with its cofactor IFIT3, which promotes its stability and translation inhibition activity (13, 14) . By contrast in mice, murine Ifit1 binds only to cap0-RNA and is highly expressed (16) , whereas murine Ifit1b binds strongly to cap1-RNA but is poorly expressed in stimulated mouse cells, as we have demonstrated here. Both proteins are regulated by Ifit1c, which acts as a cofactor analogous to human IFIT3. In this way, murine and human cells may achieve the same balance of cap0-and cap1-RNA binding during the IFN response. Therefore, considering the IFIT locus together, rather than examining individual genes, could be more valuable in examining IFIT molecular function.",

Protein expression was induced using 1 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, at During an antiviral response in humans, IFIT1 is highly expressed following IFN stimulation. Human IFIT1 binds strongly to cap0-RNA (red) but weakly to cap1-RNA (blue) and inhibits their translation. Cap0-RNA is associated with viral infection and is recognized as \"nonself,\" whereas cellular RNA is typically cap1 modified and is therefore recognized as \"self.\" As such, IFIT1 strongly inhibits the translation of nonself viral RNA while only weakly inhibiting self cellular RNA. In stimulated mouse cells, murine Ifit1 is strongly expressed and binds to cap0-RNA, whereas murine Ifit1b is poorly expressed and binds strongly to cap1-RNA. In this way, murine Ifit1 and Ifit1b acting together can strongly inhibit the translation of nonself viral RNA while weakly inhibiting self cellular RNA. Human IFIT1 stability and activity is regulated by human IFIT3, which interacts via a conserved C-terminal interaction motif. Human IFIT3 also interacts with human IFIT2, via the N terminus, and regulates IFIT2-mediated apoptosis. As such the human IFIT1-IFIT2-IFIT3 complex is coregulated and is involved in multiple stages of the antiviral response. Murine Ifit1 and Ifit1b are both regulated by murine Ifit1c, which also interacts via the C-terminal domain. Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c do not bind to Ifit3; therefore the functions of Ifit heterocomplexes in mice are regulated separately.",

Quantification is shown in the left panels, expressed as the increase in melting temperature (T m ) over protein alone (dT m ) (means 6 S.E. from two-three independent experiments), and representative melt curves are shown in the right panels. T m values were derived by nonlinear regression using the Boltzmann equation, y = LL (UL -LL)/(1 1 exp(T mx)/a), where LL and UL are the lower and upper limits, respectively. See also Fig. S8.",

The equivalent residues in murine Ifit1b, where divergent, are listed in red. B, Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (upper panel) and anti-His Western blotting (lower panel) of WT and mutant Ifit1b. C, thermal shift assay of 2 mM WT and mutant Ifit1b with 4 mM cap0 or cap1 RNA, showing the difference in melting temperature (dT m ) between protein only and protein with RNA. The graph shows the means and standard deviations of three (cap0) or two (cap1) experimental replicates. D, a model of Ifit1b (cyan) was generated in SWISS-MODEL, based on the structure of human IFIT1 (Protein Data Bank entry 5W5H) and is shown superposed with human IFIT1 (yellow). Left panel, residues in the cap-binding loop, distal to the 29-O-hydroxyl group of the first RNA nucleotide, that impact cap0/cap1 binding specificity are shown as sticks. Right panel, residues proximal to the first RNA nucleotide are shown. In murine Ifit1b, a number of mutations (relative to IFIT1) are present in this region, which may allow accommodation of 29-O-methylated/ cap1-RNA.",
