The analysis does not assess the size of the change in the number of positive test reports between the two time periods, but only evaluates whether a region had reported an increase in positive tests or not. iii. Another issue arises in comparing countries with enormous differences in terms of testing capacities and/ or strategies, availability of vaccines, socioeconomic factors and demographic structures of the populations. One way to overcome this limitation could have been the stratification of the results according to continent awhile accounting for age. The lack of presentation of results makes their interpretation very challenging. iv. Citing preliminary data from the CDC [2] , the authors report an increase in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths amongst the fully vaccinated. However, this representation is incorrect as the CDC report rather evaluates the proportion of fully vaccinated among those hospitalized. The latter proportion is expected to rise as the number of fully vaccinated people increases. Furthermore, this statistic is subject to Simpson's paradox as the vaccination rate among the elderly is particularly high, as is their risk for severe COVID-19 disease [3] .",

In ecological studies, confounders and within-group misclassification may dilute, inflate, or even reverse any association. None of these limitations are mentioned or discussed.",
