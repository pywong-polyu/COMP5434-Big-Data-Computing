            "text": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in the suspension of many routine audiology services due to the risk of crossinfections in closed spaces. This has driven the need for exploring alternatives to conventional face-to-face consultations in the hospital outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of remote consultations and assessments for patients on the waiting list for consideration of bone conduction hearing devices (BCHDs), and whether this type of consultation could continue beyond the COVID-19 era. Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional study in a tertiary Neuro-otology Department. All new patients on the waiting list for assessment for BCHD as of 1 March 2020 were included. Patients' case notes were reviewed. All underwent a telephone consultation with an implant audiologist. If the patient wanted to go ahead with the remote trial, a BCHD sound processor on a headband would be mailed out and the patient would then have to use the device for two weeks and return the device after with their diary. Results There were 49 patients. The mean age was 55 (range 27-88, SD 16.3). Four did not proceed with the trial. All patients returned their devices to the department. Majority of patients (95.6%, n = 43), completed their diary. 75.6% wanted to proceed with surgery. All patients proceeding with surgery were happy with the remote assessment and would recommend this for the future. Conclusion It is possible to satisfactorily assess appropriately screened patients for BCHDs remotely with a structured approach and explanation of process and expectations. It might be possible to consider this type of consultation as an option for assessing potential candidates for BCHDs beyond the COVID-19 era to reduce the number of hospital visits for patients.",

Appointments that could be undertaken via telephone or video conference whenever possible were advised, to reduce the number of hospital visits and potential exposure for patients. This Neuro-otology and Hearing Services Department sees a wide range of conditions and large patient population and a lot of the patients require a physical examination and/or a hearing test, and therefore need to attend the outpatient department in person. This particular cohort of patients who were on the waiting list for BCHD assessment was early on identified as a potential group where they could be assessed safely via telephone consultation. Even though all our patients had some form of hearing loss, there were no occasions where telephone consultation was not possible and communication was not an issue. One early concern was whether patients would bring back the BCHD device that was posted out to them; however, these concerns were unfounded as all patient returned their trial device, though a handful of patients required a phone call reminder to return their device when it was not received a week after the trial had ended.",
