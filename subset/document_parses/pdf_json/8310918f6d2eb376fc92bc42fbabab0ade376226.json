Specifically, whether preexisting health factors, risk aversion, and altruism predict staying at home and socially distancing. If individuals respond to the policy based on their own benefits from compliance, we should expect that those who are at greater risk of severe consequences from an infection, or more risk averse, will be more likely to comply. Likewise, those who are more altruistic should also have higher compliance because this reduces the likelihood of infecting others.",

We did find that more risk tolerant individuals were more likely to leave their homes and not socially distance when obtaining essential services or for employment (i.e., behaviors that were permitted under the order). Yet, when these exceptions are excluded, we no longer found that risk tolerance was predictive of compliance.",

Contrary to our findings, many assume that preferences and 4 California's Stay-at-Home measure (Executive Order N-60-20, implemented March 19, 2020) allowed individuals to leave their home for \"permitted work\" or to obtain essential services (i.e., \"necessities as food, prescriptions, and health care\") during the period of our study. Permitted work included jobs in 16 critical infrastructure sectors, and only essential services such as grocery stores, takeout and delivery restaurants, health care services, pharmacies, and banks remained open (Tan and Bhattacharjee 2020). health risks drive the response to stay-at-home orders. Those who violate social distancing guidelines are accused of being less altruistic (i.e., selfish) (BBC 2020). Likewise, those who argue against the orders claim that risk aversion (i.e., cowardice) is resulting in an overreaction to the pandemic, and that those with greater health risks will naturally continue to socially distance even if restrictions were relaxed (Emerson and DeSilvia 2020; Williams 2020) . Our results suggest that these inferences may be misguided, undermining productive debate on the public policy response to the pandemic.",

In the context of COVID-19, Wise et al. (2020) find that perceived personal risk is associated with preventative behaviors, but that people are poor at assessing their actual risk. In contrast to our findings, Campos-Mercade et al. (2020) find that in Sweden prosocial preferences are predictive of adopting preventative behaviors, including physical distancing. 6 The difference may be explained by the fact that their sample includes adults of all ages and educational achievement, whereas we focus on college students. In addition, the Swedish policy response differed significantly from stay-at-home orders in the United States, and more explicitly relied on individual discretion to socially distance; for example, restaurants, malls, and gyms remained open in Sweden. Finally, responsiveness to the pandemic may have been more politicized in the United States, dampening responsiveness to primary preferences and characteristics. Indeed, risk perception of COVID-19 and social distancing has been shown to be affected by partisan leanings in the United States (Allcott et al. 2020; Barrios and Hochberg 2020) . Also in the context of COVID-19, our findings are generally consistent with the literature that cautions that the decision to socially distance may not reflect one's true marginal benefit from doing so.",

The first question asks about a donation amount: \"Today you unexpectedly received 1,600 USD. How much of this amount would you donate to a good cause?\" The second question asks subjects \"how willing are you to give to good causes without expecting anything in return?,\" using a scale from 0 to 10 that increases in the willingness to give.

We ask them the hospitalization rate of younger adults infected with COVID-19 in the United States (Hosp. Rate), and the number of people that would become infected after ten social links, if each person infects three others (Potential Spread). These latter two questions provided four multiple choice options. Table 1 reports summary statistics for our analysis sample. Fifty-four percent of the sample is male and the majority of our sample is aged 19 to 21 (reflecting their undergraduate status). We do not ask additional demographic questions in our survey instruments, but the undergraduate population at the university is 61% underrepresented minorities, 74% first generation college, and 64% Pell Grant recipients. In general, underrepresented minorities may be more vulnerable to more severe illness from COVID-19 (CDC 2020a). Observations are individual subjects in our primary analysis. If subjects completed multiple responses, we provide the mean over all surveys for the subject. Male and Age variables are indicators of the given characteristic. COVID-19 Symptom is an indicator variable for whether the subject, or anyone with which they are living with, experienced shortness of breathe, cough, or fever in the previous 7 days. Risk Tolerant is a self-reported preference of risk on an 11point scale, increasing in risk tolerance. Altruism Donation is the amount of an unexpected US$1600 that one would donate to a good cause, and is an underlying measure in our main altruism measure. Altruism Scale is a self-reported preference of the willingness to give on an 11-point scale, increasing in altruism, and is an underlying measure in our main altruism measure. High Risk is an indicator for whether the subject, or anyone they are living with, has a characteristic associated with increased likelihood of severe illness from COVID-19. Serious, Health Effective, and Econ Effective are five-point scales that reduce in the belief of how serious a COVID-19 infection is for younger healthy adults, how effective social distancing is at reducing the spread of the virus, and how effective social distancing is at reducing the economic impact from the virus, respectively. Unemployment is the expected unemployment rate in June 2020. Low SD, Misperceptions, Low SD, Externalities, Hosp.

The corresponding mean upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is an associated increase in non-compliance of 13.6 percentage points. Our results are consistent with the Kaiser Family Foundation polls in March, which found similar levels of social distancing, and that social distancing behaviors were no different among those who have a chronic health factor or are over the age of 60 ; Ashley and Brodie 2020). One explanation is that factors correlated with pre-existing health have opposing effects on the decision to socially distance. For example, these individuals may be employed in sectors requiring social contact, or may be more reliant on extended social networks. While this is an explanation for why health factors do not predict social distancing, it still implies that policies that assume that those with greater risk factors will naturally have higher compliance with social distancing may be misguided.",

(2018b) find that young people tend to be more risk tolerant, and that those with higher cognitive ability tend to be more altruistic and also more risk tolerant. In general, young adults comprise a large share of the population and their behaviors meaningfully impact the larger population in the context of an infectious disease. In light of this, our results are not just informative to broad public policy, but also to university policies which generally extend to a large proportion of a local population. Across the country, universities have also had to decide how to enact and enforce their own policies on social distancing as they consider reopening their campuses to young adults.",

However, recent polling suggests that information about prevention, transmission, and risk of coronavirus is well understood , suggesting that lack of information about COVID-19 by itself is not a barrier. However, an individual's best response may still be unclear, and learning over time may result in people becoming increasingly responsive to COVID-19 based on their own underlying preferences and risk factors, as expected. But at least in the initial stages of a pandemic, our findings caution against policies that rely on the assumption that young adults will respond based on their true marginal benefit from doing so.",

Risk Tolerant ranges from 0 to 11 and is increasing in risk tolerance, Altruism ranges from \u22121.94 to 1.94 and is increasing in altruism, and High Risk is an indicator for whether the subject, or anyone they are living with, has a factor that increases the risk of a severe illness from a COVID-19 infection.
