            "text": "Background: 3D printed patient-specific anatomical models have been applied clinically to orthopaedic care for surgical planning and patient education. The estimated cost and print time per model for 3D printers have not yet been compared with clinically representative models across multiple printing technologies. This study investigates six commercially-available 3D printers: Prusa i3 MK3S, Formlabs Form 2, Formlabs Form 3, LulzBot TAZ 6, Stratasys F370, and Stratasys J750 Digital Anatomy. Methods: Seven representative orthopaedic standard tessellation models derived from CT scans were imported into the respective slicing software for each 3D printer. For each printer and corresponding print setting, the slicing software provides a print time and material use estimate. Material quantity was used to calculate estimated model cost. Print settings investigated were infill percentage, layer height, and model orientation on the print bed. The slicing software investigated are Cura LulzBot Edition 3.6.20, GrabCAD Print 1.43, PreForm 3.4.6, and PrusaSlicer 2.2.0. Results: The effect of changing infill between 15% and 20% on estimated print time and material use was negligible. Orientation of the model has considerable impact on time and cost with worst-case differences being as much as 39.30% added print time and 34.56% added costs. Averaged across all investigated settings, horizontal model orientation on the print bed minimizes estimated print time for all 3D printers, while vertical model orientation minimizes cost with the exception of Stratasys J750 Digital Anatomy, in which horizontal orientation also minimized cost. Decreasing layer height for all investigated printers increased estimated print time and decreased estimated cost with the exception of Stratasys F370, in which cost increased. The difference in material cost was two orders of magnitude between the least and most-expensive printers. The difference in build rate (cm 3 /min) was one order of magnitude between the fastest and slowest printers. Conclusions: All investigated 3D printers in this study have the potential for clinical utility. Print time and print cost are dependent on orientation of anatomy and the printers and settings selected. Cost-effective clinical 3D printing of anatomic models should consider an appropriate printer for the complexity of the anatomy and the experience of the printer technicians.",

            "text": "Background 3D printing technology is becoming increasingly involved in the current era of delivering medical care and is being applied towards creating personalized prosthetics, 3D printed surgical instruments, medical student and resident education, and patient-specific anatomical models to help guide surgeons preoperatively and intraoperatively [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Previous studies have demonstrated the possibility of producing cost-effective yet robust 3D printed surgical retractors that far exceed the threshold for clinically excessive retraction in the operating room even after autoclave sterilization [6, 10] . Additionally, literature supports significant cost savings due to reduced operating room time associated with the use of 3D printed patient anatomical models in surgical applications [11] . 3D printing has also become especially relevant due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, where 3D printing was employed to combat shortages in essential medical equipment including ventilator components, N95 respirators, nasopharyngeal collection swabs, and splash-proof face shields [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, as 3D printing technologies integrate into medical care, it becomes important to understand and optimize the time and cost needed to produce clinically relevant 3D prints. This knowledge may potentially be applied to timesensitive fracture care [20, 21] .",

The inverse relationship between layer height and estimated print time is expected, as increasing layer height reduces the total number of layers required to complete the 3D print, and therefore print time is expected to decrease [25] . For Prusa i3 MK3S and LulzBot TAZ 6, decreasing layer height decreased estimated cost. Increasing layer height reduces the resolution of the print, thereby creating a stair-step effect as layers are deposited; this effect may consume additional 3D printing material as material is extruded outside the boundaries of the model [26] . For Stratasys F370, however, decreasing layer height increased estimated cost. Therefore for Stratasys F370, from slicer estimates, it is both time and cost-effective to increase layer height. The observed magnitude of change in average estimated cost when changing layer height is relatively small compared to the observed magnitude of change in average print time when changing layer height (Fig. 3) . For all investigated SLA printers, Formlabs Form 2 and Form 3, decreasing layer height increased estimated print time and negligibly decreased estimated cost by less than 1%. As with FDM printers, we observed an expected inverse relationship between layer height and print time. A closer inspection of data reveals that the estimated model volume (mL), a measurement directly related to model cost, was not consistently higher for all models when layer height was set to 0.10 mm as compared to 0.05 mm for both Formlabs Form 2 and Form 3 that leads us to conclude that cost is largely unchanged. SLA printers require additional post-processing steps, including model washing with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and model curing with UV light, which requires an additional 10 min and 15 min respectively per model for the material Clear Resin V4 [27, 28] .
