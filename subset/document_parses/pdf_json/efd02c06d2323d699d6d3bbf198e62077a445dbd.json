As a result, constructing high-performance 3D convolutional neural networks from scratch remains a difficult task in the absence of a sufficient pre-training parameter. Previous efforts on 3D pre-training have frequently relied on selfsupervised approaches, which use either predictive or contrastive learning on unlabeled data to build invariant 3D representations. However, because of the unavailability of large-scale supervision information, obtaining semantically invariant and discriminative representations from these learning frameworks remains problematic. In this paper, we revisit an innovative yet simple fully-supervised 3D network pre-training framework to take advantage of semantic supervisions from large-scale 2D natural image datasets. With a redesigned 3D network architecture, reformulated natural images are used to address the problem of data scarcity and develop powerful 3D representations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed pre-trained models can effectively accelerate convergence while also improving accuracy for a variety of 3D medical imaging tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection. In addition, as compared to training from scratch, it can save up to 60% of annotation efforts. On the NIH DeepLesion dataset, it likewise achieves state-ofthe-art detection performance, outperforming earlier selfsupervised and fully-supervised pre-training approaches, as well as methods that do training from scratch. To facilitate further development of 3D medical models, our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/urmagicsmine/CSPR.",

On the one hand, medical data collecting is strictly regulated for privacy reasons; on the other hand, the requisite specialist knowledge and the tedious nature of medical image annotation make the formation of new annotated medical datasets prohibitively expensive and timeconsuming. As a result, transfer learning employing weights pre-trained on large-scale 2D natural image datasets (e.g. Ima-geNet [8] ) has become the de-facto paradigm for speeding up model convergence and improving overall model performance on small-scale medical image datasets. Despite the fact that there is a domain shift between natural images and medical images, in reality, representations learned from natural images can significantly improve feature discrimination ability for 2D medical image analysis tasks [11] , [12] .",

The data-scarce problem is addressed with our proposed variable dimension transform, which reformulate 2D natural images to yield our source of 3D data. During the process, the color information is transformed to pseudo-3D structure information, which is then used to learn 3D structural and textural representations.

Secondly, this work highlights a comprehensive experimental analysis to confirm the efficacy of the proposed 3D pre-training approach. To validate its universal effectiveness on 3D medical image analysis tasks, we conduct experiments on four benchmark 3D medical datasets and compare our proposed pre-trained 3D models to existing state-ofthe-art self-supervised and fully-supervised pre-trained models on four target tasks, namely, pulmonary nodule classification, pulmonary nodule segmentation, liver segmentation, and lesion detection. The SVD-Net, as simple as it appears, is quite effective in practical applications, supporting the principle of translating color information into 3D structural and textual information for efficient feature learning.

I3D [22] proposed to repeat 2D convolution kernels along the new axis for k times to form the K \u00d7K \u00d7K 3D convolution layers. Similarly, [9] extended the 2D pre-trained convolution kernels to 3D with the additional parameters initialized by the means of zero padding. However, these methods failed to model 3D context in the z-axis with the repeated 2D kernels. It can only be adopted to capture spatial information from multiple axial slices. To make up for the inconsistent representation ability along the depth axis and the height/width axis, ACS [20] further performed a symmetric pseudo-3D convolution operation. It expanded the dimensions of 2D convolution kernel along depth, height and width axis respectively to generate three view-based 3D convolution kernels. Input feature maps are divided into three parts and view-based 3D convolutions are performed on each part. With such a design, 2D weights can be seamlessly copied to the newly generate view-based 3D kernels and the resultant 3D convolutional layers have the ability to model structure and texture information in all three views. However, the kernel-by-kernel conversion might break the correlation among subsequent layers and thus potentially hurt the performance. Therefore, there are more methods that explore to learning 3D representations as a whole network rather than converting existing pre-trained 2D weights kernel by kernel separately.",

To address this issue, [30] aggregated eight datasets from several medical image challenges to build a larger heterogeneous dataset. They further proposed a heterogeneous 3D network called Med3D to obtain a series of pre-trained CNN models with supervised tasks like segmentation. The Med3D enjoys the advantage of a similar data distribution with a number of target tasks, but its small data scale severely limits the performance of the pre-trained models.",

The left part of Figure 1 illustrates the process of converting adjacent slices in CT scan to RGB images. For most well-aligned structures, their appearance after reassembling resembles the original slice input. As for pulmonary vessels, the change in their position and shape among neighboring slices in the original 3D space is transformed into color information in the RGB space. Thus, after such a reformulation, rich 3D structural information is preserved in the 2D space through color encoding.

Universal Lesion Detection 1) Dataset and Implementation Details: Dataset: The NIH DeepLesion is a large-scale dataset for universal lesion detection, which contains 32,735 lesions on 32,120 axial CT slices captured from 4,427 patients. RECIST diameter coordinates and bounding boxes are provided on the key slices, with adjacent slices (above and below 30mm) also provided as contextual information. Only bounding box annotations are used in this experiment. The official split of DeepLesion with training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets are used in our experiments. We evaluate all the compared methods on the test set by reporting sensitivities at different false positives (FPs) per image and their average (mFROC). As for preprocessing, the Hounsfield units (HU) are clipped into the range of [\u22121024, 1050]. We also implement interpolation in the z-axis to normalize the intervals of all CT slices to 2.5mm. Implementation Details: All the compared methods take 9 consecutive slices as input, which can be represented as a gray-scale 3D tensor of 1 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512. Since only 2D annotations (2D bounding boxes on the key slice) are provided in the DeepLesion dataset, we use a similar architecture as MP3D [32] for lesion detection. MP3D neglects all the downsampling operations for the z-axis to keep the depth of all backbone outputs as 9. In our implementation, to further improve model efficiency, we conduct down-sampling for the z-axis like the original ResNet architecture on all the res-blocks, which will result in 3D feature maps of size 1 \u00d7 (9, 5, 3, 1, 1) \u00d7 H \u00d7 W for each FPN level. ResNet3D-18 is adopted as the backbone network for comparison with competing pre-trained methods.",

Large portions of the convolutional kernels will not be updated during pre-training. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a network architecture proposed in [18] , i.e. ResNet3DV1c-18 for pre-training. The ResNet3DV1c-18 model replaces the 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 kernel with three 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 kernels, so that all the parameters will be able to update during pre-training.

With such a model, the depth dimension will be down-sampled to 1 after the first two down-sampling layers, and thus 3D kernels in the succeeding layers will be degenerated to 2D ones, since only the center 3 \u00d7 3 part could be optimized.

This evidently proves that our proposed modification to the pretrained network plays a vital role for effective learning of 3D representations. 4) Performance with Limited Training Data: To evaluate the robustness of the proposed method in data-limited scenarios, we train a series of models with various amount of annotated training data (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) under the same experimental setting.",

Compared to self-supervised methods, the learned representations enforced by semantic annotation are more general and discriminative. Although there exists a certain degree of domain shift between the reformulated natural image and 3D medical image, comprehensive empirical experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-ofthe-art 3D pre-training methods on four benchmark datasets for 3D medical image analysis, validating its strong ability in generalizing to major tasks like classification, segmentation and detection.
