The study confirmed the negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and temperature. It contributed to the resolution of the conflicting results about latitude after organizing it into a categorical variable instead of its continuous form. This approach works because the average temperature in the 15\u00b0S to 15\u00b0N region remains similar to the average temperatures in both the Above 15\u00b0N region and the Below 15\u00b0S region during their summer months because the 15\u00b0S to 15\u00b0N region does not experience the marked seasonal changes in temperature. Given the negative association between temperature and case numbers, this suggests that countries in the 15\u00b0S to 15\u00b0N region might continue exhibiting the low numbers they have thus far exhibited through the second half of this year, even as numbers climb in the Below 15\u00b0S region. To succeed, their policymakers must control importation of the disease by implementing effective testing, quarantining, and contact tracing for people entering their borders. Policymakers in countries Below 15\u00b0S region may manage their inherent risks by applying lessons learned from countries in the Above 15\u00b0N region during these past months.

They conclude that neither income nor latitude is statistically significant in its association with COVID-19 growth. Heneghan and Jefferson (8) explored the association between the same variables using total number of cases as of April 28, 2020 in 128 countries as the dependent variable. They concluded that both income and latitude are strongly associated with COVID-19 incidence and deaths. They go on to say that low community infections in countries with high temperature and high relative humidity may be explained by their locations. Livadiotis (9) confirmed a negative relationship between environmental temperature and infection growth rates in Italy and the United States, lending support to the latitude (as proxy for temperature) hypothesis. Another study suggested that the low mortality from COVID-19 in countries south of Latitude 35\u00b0N may be a result of Vitamin D's role in mitigating disease severity (10) , which further contribute to temperature's role in the unfolding story.

The average increased by about 70.1% a month later and by almost 165% two months later.

The decreasing coefficient of determination may be attributed to the decreasing variability in the number of COVID-19 cases per million over time, confirmed by the coefficient of variation statistics discussed above. The results show that the log of confirmed number of COVID-19 cases per million people is increasing in the GNI per capita at a decreasing rate, with both the linear and quadratic forms of GNI per capita being statistically significant (p < 0.000). Furthermore, coefficients on the linear and quadratic forms of GNI per capita both decreased in absolute terms over time. The GNI/capita elasticities of case numbers per million for April, May and June were, respectively, 0.37 (p < 0.000), 0.25 (p < 0.000), and 0.75 (p < 0.000) at the mean.

For May, the elasticities were 0.42 (p < 0.000), 0.32 (p < 0.000), and 0.31 (p < 0.000). And for April, the estimated elasticities were 0.27 (p < 0.000), 0.22 (p < 0.000), and 0.43 (p < 0.000). The results also suggest that being in the Above Latitude 15\u00b0N instead of in the 15\u00b0N to 15\u00b0S category is associated with an increase of 1.2% in the number of confirmed cases (p < 0.000) for May and June and about 1.3% (p < 0.000) for April. To this end, it is concluded that the hypothesis that the GNI per capita elasticity of the number of confirmed cases is positive cannot be rejected. However, because the categorical form of latitude provided a stronger explanatory power than the continuous form, the discontinuity character of latitude is recognized. The hypothesis that the latitude elasticity of the number of confirmed cases is positive is not rejected for the Above 15\u00b0N category, but rejected for the Below 15\u00b0S category, using the 15\u00b0N to 15\u00b0S category as the reference.
