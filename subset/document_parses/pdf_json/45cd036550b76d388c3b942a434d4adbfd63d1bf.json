Furthermore, such booths utilize alcohol, bleach, chlorine solution, or chloroxylenol which are harmful to human health (Mallhi et al. 2020) . Therefore, it is not advisable to fog or spray particular chemical products, i.e., quaternary ammonium compounds, chlorine-based agents, or formaldehyde. Meanwhile, according to the guidelines of the US CDC, registered disinfectants can only be utilized in the disinfecting and cleaning facilities under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) 2020). Moreover, the Allergy Society of South Africa strongly condemns the use of a disinfection booth under any circumstances (Gray and van Niekerk 2020).",

Even some hospitals and police stations have installed them. To show the current scenario in Bangladesh, a few photos of different places that installed disinfection booths, from the newspaper and our personal collection, are presented in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Figure 1 , which we collected personally on 16 July 2020, shows a disinfection booth in front of a police station. Figs. 2 and 3 were taken from newspapers, with Fig. 2 showing a disinfection booth installed by the Bangladesh Army at the city street of Jashore for use by local people (Army installs disinfection booth in Jashore 2020). Fig. 3 shows a scenario of a disinfection booth that has been installed on the foot overbridge of a highly populated shopping mall-New Market (COVID-19: New Market traders install disinfection tunnels, resume business 2020). Bangladesh used these booths since April 2020 to minimize the COVID-19 spreading rate, but the infection statistics of COVID-19 from April 2020 to date do not show any noticeable reduction of spreading rate (Bangladesh Overview 2020) .",

Meanwhile, it has a negative impact on human health in some cases because of harmful chemicals when it is spread over the full body. Therefore, general people, higher authorities of government, and non-government organizations of Bangladesh need to be more concerned to follow COVID-19 guidelines properly. In fact, we urge higher health authorities of Bangladesh and other nations as well to discourage the utilization of a disinfection booth and rather to emphasize the necessity of proper hand hygiene, wearing of masks, and using physical distancing for preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the general public.",
