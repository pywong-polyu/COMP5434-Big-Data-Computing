We run a randomised controlled trial in Denmark to test different versions of a reminder to stay home at the beginning of the crisis. Using a two-stage design, we follow up with recipients and analyse their subsequent self-reported behaviour. We find that the reminder increases ex-ante intentions to comply when it emphasises the consequences of non-compliance for the subjects themselves and their families, while it has no effect when the emphasis is on other people or the country as a whole. We also find, however, that impacts on intentions do not translate into equivalent impacts on actions. Only people in poor health react to the reminder by staying home significantly more. Our results shed light on important gaps between people's intentions and their actions in responding to the recommendations of health authorities.",

It is also difficult to enforce. In its most extreme form, social distancing implies that people should remain in their homes and avoid contact with others, unless strictly necessary. Such strict forms of distancing have been applied in countries like Italy and France. Milder forms of social distancing have been encouraged across the globe. Since social distancing is disruptive for people's lives, authorities have been struggling to find ways of promoting it ( [9] ). Awareness campaigns have been numerous in many countries and reminders of different sorts have been used, ranging from social media campaigns to SMSs like those sent by the Danish Police to every mobile user (March 22) (Source: The Local DK (March 24, 2020) [link]) or the British government to every UK resident (March 24) (Source: UK Government website (March 24, 2020) [link] ). In other contexts, such as smoking cessation, medical adherence ( [10] [11] [12] [13] ), physical activity ( [14] ), seat belt usage ( [15] ), take-up of social benefits ( [16] ), electricity consumption ( [17, 18] ), and giving to charitable organizations ( [19] [20] [21] ), reminders have been shown to cause behavioural change ( [22] ).",

Our main finding, however, is that respondents largely do not follow through with their intentions, as the reminder has no significant impacts on subsequent behaviour. This is consistent with the existence of imporatnt intention-to-action gaps. While the behaviour we study is self-reported, this does not pose a threat to our conclusions, since potential mis-reporting would likely go in the direction of compliance being over-stated ( [37] ). Despite that, we find no impact of the reminder on behaviour, despite the effect on ex-ante intentions.",

The first one, in the loss domain, emphasises the risks of not complying with the recommendation (for the respondent, the family, others, and the country). The second, in the gain domain, emphasises the benefits of complying with the recommendation. This approach builds on prospect theory ( [50] ), which predicts that losses motivate behaviour more than equivalent gains. This is because in prospect theory decision making is based on value relative to a reference point and people typically weigh losses more than equal gains. The theory has found confirmation across a range of contexts. A classic example related to our experiment is that medical treatments described as having a \"75% survival rate\" are viewed more positively than those with a \"25% mortality rate\" ( [51] [52] [53] ). It follows that people are commonly more responsive to incentives framed as potential losses relative to an initial endowment than to equivalent gains relative to a reference point of 0. Recent work demonstrates this in the context of a smoking-cessation intervention where incentives framed as losses relative to an endowment had significantly stronger effects than incentives framed as equivalent gains relative to no initial endowment ( [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] ).",

We believe this is a better characterisation than assuming the reminders provided new information, given that basic knowledge about COVID-19 spread very quickly at the onset of the pandemic. Another way to describe our approach is to say that we consider reminders as preference nudges. Preference nudges have an impact on the expected utility in an inattentive choice situation, without altering the attentive choice ( [59] ). In standard utility theory, attentive choices are those in which individuals make an informed choice resulting in the preferred outcome. On the contrary, inattentive choices are based on heuristics ",

Appendix E in S1 Appendix, provides a detailed timeline of the initial phase of the crisis in Denmark and shows that our study falls within the most critical period. The different reminders were randomised within a representative sample of 29,756 Danish residents between the age of 18 and 69, who represent close to 1% of the population. A randomly selected control group received no reminder. Statistics Denmark (the national statistical office) carried out the randomisation and distributed the treatment via e-Boks-the official system of communication used by public authorities in Denmark, which is akin to a personal email account. By focusing on the general population of Danish residents, we avoid having to rely on selected panels of respondents on dedicated survey platforms, who may have been solicited frequently during the COVID-19 crisis and may be subject to fatigue ( [60, 61] ). Respondents received a message inviting them to participate in a survey to investigate people's habits at the time of the COVID-19 crisis. Upon receiving the invitation to participate, subjects were informed about the purpose of the study and they were asked for their consent (which they could give by clicking on a button on their screen). Those who agreed to participate landed on a dedicated webpage where they were first shown the reminder (if they were in one of the treated groups) and then answered eight questions (control subjects only saw the questions).",

We drop 2 respondents whose answers to the questions on time spent home exceed 24 hours and 7 observations in which the follow-up refers to the day before the treatment occurred (which was the result of a technical problem). Furthermore, since some of the participants responded with some delay, it is possible that the answers to the follow-up questionnaire do not refer to the same day as the answers to the first questionnaire. To prevent major inconsistencies, we drop from the analysis respondents whose answers to the first questionnaire referred to a weekday, while their answers to the follow-up questionnaire referred to a day of the weekend, and vice-versa. This makes our results more precise, but does not change them qualitatively (as discussed below). This leaves us with a balanced panel of 5,310 respondents, which we use for the analysis. In Appendix F in S1 Appendix, we test whether the probability that a respondent drops out of the sample between the first and the follow-up survey correlates with assignment to treatment. Table 4 in S1 Appendix shows that attrition is balanced across treatment groups and does not depend on the kind of reminder respondents receive.

We test the null hypothesis of no difference between the control and each treatment group using standard significance testing.

For ease of exposition, we report treatment effects as percentage changes relative to the control group, together with the corresponding p-values and F-statistics. Fig 2 summarises the results, while Table 2 shows the full set of estimates. For simplicity, it reports them as percent increases relative to the share of people who stay home in the control group, which is just below 15% (i.e., an effect of 20 percent amounts to a 3-percentage point increase in the share of people who stay home, or 3 people out of 100). With both the \"you\" and the \"family\" framing, the treatment effect amounts to an increase in the share of people who intend to stay home of about 46% (p = 0.007 and p = 0.008, respectively) compared to the control group. On the other hand, the reminders have insignificant effects on intentions to stay home when they are framed with respect to the consequences for other people in general (12% with p = 0.459) and for the country as a whole (26.6% with p = 0.11). Similarly, the reminder with no framing-akin to the slogans commonly seen on social media (e.g., # STAY-HOME) and promoted by governments around the world (e.g. . These findings are in line with the hypothesis that emotional proximity to the people affected by the respondent's actions plays a strong role in determining the success of a message. They are also consistent with the findings of an interesting recent literature that uses experimental methods to study pro-social behaviour as a driver of health behaviour, including social distancing ( [3, 26, 34] ). We complement those findings by showing that individuals who comply with social distancing to protect others may do so primarily to protect their family.",

The estimated treatment effect on intentions ranges from 42% (p = 0.044) for the \"family\" treatment in the gain domain to 49% (p = 0.017) for the \"family\" treatment in the loss domain. The other treatments (\"others\" and \"country\") have no statistically significant impacts on intentions neither in the gain nor in the loss domain. The full set of results is available in Table 2 . In general, we find that framing the reminders in terms of gains or losses has little impact on the results. This may be due to the fact that the differences between our alternative framings are too subtle to trigger the behavioural patterns predicted by prospect theory. Some respondents are reminded that going out may lead them to become infected (a loss). Some other respondents are reminded that staying home would prevent them from getting infected (a gain, but only relative to a hypothetical situation in which going out leads to becoming infected). Testing these differences was valuable to inform policymaking, but further work will be necessary to dig deeper into the framing effects predicted by prospect theory in this context. Table 2 are divided by the share of people who intend to stay home (intentions) and stayed home (actions) in the control group). Intentions refer to the day after the first interview, actions refer to the day before the follow-up interview. The reminder increases respondents' intentions to stay home by 46% when it is framed with respect to personal consequences (p = 0.007) and consequences for one's family (p = 0.008). It has a lower insignificant effect on intentions when it refers to consequences for other people in general (p = 0.459), for the country as a whole (p = 0.110), and when it has no specific framing (p = 0.190). Changes in intentions do not translate into sizeable changes in actions. The reminders with a focus on personal consequences and consequences for one's family only increase the share of people who stay home by 19.7% (p = 0.127) and 14.9% (p = 0.251), respectively. As for intentions, the reminders have no significant impact on actions when they focus on \"others\" (p = 0.467), \"country\" (p = 0.113), or have no framing (p = 0.15).

Such gaps may be due to systematic behavioural biases (e.g., time inconsistency, planning fallacy), or idiosyncratic shocks forcing people to deviate from their intentions. While explaining such mechanisms is beyond the scope of this paper, documenting the divergence between intentions and actions is crucial for our understanding of how effective reminders are.

When assessing this possibility, it is important to remark that the effect sizes we estimate on actions are small. Small effects on social distancing behaviour are consistent with recent work conducted during the pandemic ( [64] ). Since compliance in the control group is below 15%, an increase of approximately 20% in the probability of staying home corresponds to a change of less than 3 percentage points (or 3 people every 100). Detecting such a small impact would pose a statistical challenge even with a larger sample, which was beyond our possibilities. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to argue that an effect of such magnitude would be considered of limited societal relevance by many policy-makers, even if estimated more precisely. Finally, our conclusions are robust to the possibility that respondents may over-report staying home due to experimenter demand effects ( [37] ).

Are such groups responsive to the reminders? To answer this question, we split subjects according to their health status and repeat the analysis on separate samples. The lowest two (out of five) values of a variable indicating health status are considered bad health conditions for the purpose of this analysis (this is the categorisation that appears to be most sensible, since only considering in bad health those with the lowest value would leave us with a very small sample size).

Upon doing that, we find that the magnitude of the effects of the most effective treatments (\"you\" and \"family\") decreases slightly, but treated subjects still declare an intention to stay Table 3 are divided by the probability of staying home in the control group). Among respondents who are in bad health conditions (N = 603), the share of those who declare they will stay home more than doubles after receiving a reminder that emphasises risks for family (p = 0.036), and the share of those who actually stay home increases by 80% (p = 0.034). Similar impacts of the \"you\" treatment are not statistically significant. Among respondents who are in good health (N = 4,704), the impacts of the reminder are much smaller and not statistically significant. It is important to note that while impacts of over 30% may appear sizeable, they a relative to a low compliance level in the control group (where less than 15% of respondents stay home). Respondents classify their health status on a 5-point scale. The lowest two values are considered bad health conditions for the purpose of this analysis (health information is missing for 3 observations used in the main regressions).

We complement the literature on the impacts of behavioural tools by showing that intentions to comply may fail to translate into equivalent behavioural change.Our study is also of immediate policy relevance. By focusing on the decision to stay home, we test the effectiveness of a key recommendation provided by health authorities across the world.From the UK Prime Minister (Source: BBC (March 23, 2020) [link]), to the President of the United States (Source: The Washington Times (March 31, 2020) [link]), to the Queen of Denmark (Source: The Local DK (March 18, 2020) [link]), the advice to stay home as much as possible has been ubiquitous during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, convincing people to follow this recommendation is difficult, since it implies major changes to their routine and can be perceived as a severe limitation of individual freedom. This study shed light on those challenges.",
