            "text": "Methods: Firstly, three male and female dogs from German shepherd (Saray), German black (Kuzhi) and Labrador (Marco) breeds had been intensively trained throughout the classical conditioning method for 7 weeks. They were introduced to human specimens obtained from the throat and pharyngeal secretions of participants who were already reported positive or negative for SARS-COV-2 infection be RT-PCR. Each dog underwent the conditioning process for almost 1000 times. In the meantime another similar condition process was conducted on clothes and masks of COVID-19 patient using another three male and female dogs from Labrador (Lexi), Border gypsy (Sami), and Golden retriever (Zhico) breeds. In verification test for the first three dogs, 80 pharyngeal secretion samples consisting of 26 positive and 54 negative samples from different medical centers who underwent RT-PCR test were in a single-blind method. In the second verification test for the other three dogs, masks and clothes of 50 RT-PCR positive and 70 RT-PCR negative cases from different medical center were used. Results: In verification test using pharyngeal secretion, the sniffer dogs' detection capability was associated with a 65% of sensitivity and 89% of specificity and they amanged to identify 17 out of the 26 positive and 48 out of the 54 true negative samples. In the next verification test using patients' face masks and clothes, 43 out of the 50 positive samples were correctly identified by the dogs. Moreover, out of the 70 negative samples, 65 samples were correctly found to be negative. The sensitivity of this test was as high as 86% and its specificity was 92.9%. In addition, the positive and negative predictive values were 89.6 and 90.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Dogs are capable of being trained to identify COVID-19 cases by sniffing their odour, so they can be used as a reliable tool in limited screening.",

            "text": "The meticulous canine olfactory system is well-known, which is equipped with an extensive scent epithelium (170 cm 2 and 17 times greater than humans) as well as a large number of olfactory receptors (beyond 200 million receptors in comparison to 5 million in humans) [15, 16] . This ability is currently and commonly being used in detecting explosive materials, drugs, and dead bodies. The use of sniffer dogs in medical literature dates back to a case report in 1989, in which a dog could smell the mole of its owner [17] . When she wore a skirt, the dog wanted to bite one specific mole, while was indifferent about other moles on her body. The owner became suspicious and consulted a dermatologist, who came up with the diagnosis of melanoma. Since then many studies focused on the utility of dog olfaction for screening or diagnosis of different medical condition. The possible use of dogs in the diagnosis of some diseases such as malignancies, diabetes, Parkinson's, seizures, and certain hormonal and enzymatic defects has been investigated by many studies [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . It is commonly believed that dogs can be trained to detect the odour of particular molecules and compounds that changed during diseases. These odours are mainly believed to come from Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), produced by altered biochemical interactions inside body in the presence of malignancies, inflammations, infections, and other pathological events. Metabolic changes in the body result in a set of certain odours that may be recognisable for animals, specifically for dogs, as they have an extremly powerful olfactory system and also a very complex and unique analytical mechanism for interpretation of odours at their molecular levels [24] . Accordingly, COVID-19 should not be an exception. At the present time, the diagnosis of Covid-19 is based on sophisticated biochemical and genetic tests and CT-scan imaging. These modalities are relatively expensive and require accurate medical equipment, trained staffs and interpretation experts, which are not available everywhere across the world. Thus, the golden time may be lost for detecting affected people to cut the chain of transmission or to start the suitable treatments for affected people [29] . It is suggested that the use of trained dogs leads to earlier detection of infected persons at a lower cost. This helps separate asymptomatic carriers quickly as each dog has a screening capacity of 250 samples per hour, which is effective enough to be used in certain places to control transmission of the disease.",

Thirdly, at the nearly end of the dog training phase, Iran managed to substantially cut the number of new cases, so we were unable to raise the number of samples in regard of achieving statistically stronger results. Lastly if we could reduce the false negatives rate to a figure nearly zero, then the sensitivity would largely increase. ",
