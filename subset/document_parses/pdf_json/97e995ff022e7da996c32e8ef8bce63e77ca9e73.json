            "text": "An aptasensor for electrochemical detection of carbendazim is reported with mulberry fruit-like gold nanocrystal (MF-Au)/ multiple graphene aerogel (MGA) and DNA cycle amplification. HAuCl 4 was reduced by ascorbic acid in a CTAC solution containing KBr and KI and formed trioctahedron gold nanocrystal. The gold nanocrystal underwent structural evolution under enantioselective direction of L-cysteine. The resulting MF-Au shows a mulberry fruit-like nanostructure composed of gold nanocrystals of about 200 nm as the core and many irregular gold nanoparticles of about 30 nm as the shell. The exposure of high-index facets improves the catalytic activity of MF-Au. MF-Au/MGA was used for the construction of an aptasensor for electrochemical detection of carbendazim. The aptamer hybridizes with assistant strand DNA to form duplex DNA. Carbendazim binds with the formed duplex DNA to release assistant strand DNA, triggering one three-cascade DNA cycle. The utilization of a DNA cycle allows one carbendazim molecule to bring many methylene blue-labeled DNA fragments to the electrode surface. This promotes significant signal amplification due to the redox reaction of methylene blue. The detection signal is further enhanced by the catalysis of MF-Au and MGA towards the redox of methylene blue. A differential pulse voltammetric signal, best measured at \u2212 0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl, increases linearly with the carbendazim concentration ranging from 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u221216 to 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u221211 M with a detection limit of 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u221217 M. The method provides ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity and was successfully applied to the electrochemical detection of carbendazim in cucumber.",

HPLC and GC-MS are classical analytical methods for the detection of pesticides in the laboratory, with high sensitivity and selectivity, but these often Wang Jin and Li Ruiyi contributed equally to this work. require one complex sample pretreatment [11] . SERS offers a high sensitivity, but its instability of detection signal results in poor accuracy and repeatability [12] . The colorimetric method can use the naked eye to recognize the detection results and is suitable for on-site rapid carbendazim detection. However, its sensitivity is much lower than that of SERS, the fluorescent method, and the electrochemical sensor. This greatly limits its applications in the detection of carbendazim at low levels [13] . The fluorescent method has good sensitivity and specificity, but it often needs to use commercially unavailable luminescent materials as the optical probe for achieving response to carbendazim. In addition, the fluorescent methods based on common luminescent materials also suffer from the background fluorescence interference from biomacromolecules in food [1] . The electrochemical sensor has received more attention due to its ease of operation, high sensitivity, high selectivity, low cost, and portability [14] .",

            "text": "To improve the sensitivity, some nanomaterials have been used as the sensing materials for electrochemical detection of insecticides such as carbon nanohorns [15] , porous gold [16] , copper [17] , phosphorus-doped helical carbon fiber [18] , and graphene [19] . Graphene and gold nanocrystal are the most frequently used sensing materials for the construction of electrochemical sensors due to their special property and structure. For example, Zhang et al. reported on one beta-cyclodextringraphene for the electrochemical detection of paichongding [20] . There was a linear relationship between peak current and pesticide concentration in the range from 1 to 10 \u03bcM. The detection limit reaches to 0.11 \u03bcM for the electrochemical detection of paichongding. Fei et al. reported on a composite composed of gold nanoparticle, multiwalled carbon nanotube, and reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon [21] . The composite has been successfully applied in the electrochemical detection of acetamiprid. Compared with common graphene, the sensor based on graphene aerogel exhibits an improved sensitivity for electrochemical detection. This is because graphene aerogel has a well-defined three-dimensional structure that can realize a high electron/ion conductivity [22] . However, the graphene aerogel prepared by using the traditional method is a kind of ultralight material composed of sparse graphene networks. The structural characteristic will greatly limit the improvement of electrical and mechanical properties of graphene. To resolve the problem, our group reported one strategy for the synthesis of multiple graphene aerogel (MGA) [23] . Such a MGA can achieve higher electron/ion conductivity and mechanical property compared with the common graphene aerogel, which further improves the sensitivity and repeatability for electrochemical detection. Different from graphene, gold nanocrystal possesses a special catalytic activity. In addition, gold nanocrystal can be also used to immobilize biomolecules on the electrode surface via the Au-S bond [24] . Compared with the low-index facets, high-index facets of gold nanocrystals have a better catalytic activity. Thus, the shape-controlled synthesis of gold nanocrystals with more exposed high-index facets becomes a new research hotspot [25] . Based on the above considerations, we have reason to believe that the combination of MGA with the gold nanocrystal with more exposed highindex facets could present a better electrochemical performance for the detection of carbendazim. However, there is no relevant research report up to now.",

            "text": "Synthesis of MF-Au includes two cumulative steps, namely preparation of gold seed and MF-Au. Firstly, gold seed was made via the reduction of HAuCl 4 with ascorbic acid in the presence of CTAC, KBr, and KI. In the synthesis, CTAC was used as a surfactant to make the soft template. The template offers an independent space for the reduction of HAuCl 4 and subsequent gold crystal growth. A relatively large volume of the template leads to the formation of a relatively gold nanocrystal with a particle size of hundreds of nanometers. In addition, CTAC was also used as a shape inducer to make trioctahedron gold seeds. The previous investigation has revealed that CTA + can be selectively adsorbed on the surface of gold nanocrystals [26] . Due to a higher surface energy, the low-index facet of gold nanocrystals has a higher adsorption ability towards CTA + and Cl \u2212 compared with the high-index facet. As more adsorption results in a greater decrease in the growth rate of crystal facets, the adsorption can effectively inhibit the growth of low-index facets and leads to the formation of polyhedral gold nanocrystals [27] . Both KBr and KI were used to improve the morphology uniformity of gold seeds. Although Cl \u2212 , Br \u2212 , and I \u2212 have similar chemical properties, there exists an obvious difference in their adsorption ability on the different crystal facets and corresponding kinetic behavior. As a result, the gold seed induced by different halogen anions may offer a different nanostructure [28] . To make full use of the complementarity of Cl \u2212 , Br \u2212 , and I \u2212 in the shape induction, the mixture of Cl \u2212 , Br \u2212 , and I \u2212 was adopted for the shape-controlled synthesis of gold seeds. The resulting gold seeds were characterized by SEM analysis shown in Fig. s1 . The gold seeds exhibits a trioctahedron-like nanostructure. Next, the as-prepared gold seeds were grown in the presence of L-cysteine to finally produce MF-Au.",

Figure 1 presents SEM, TEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), electron image, elemental mappings, and EDS layered image of the MF-Au. The MF-Au shows a mulberry fruit-like nanostructure, composed of the gold nanocrystal with a particle size of about 200 nm as the core and many irregular gold nanocrystals with a particle size of about 30 nm as the shell. The integration of a large gold core with a shell composed of irregular gold nanoparticles simultaneously achieves high electrical conductivity, a large specific surface, and more exposed high-index facets. The large specific surface increases the contact area between the catalyst and the redox probe. The exposed highindex facets improve the catalytic activity [25] . The plane spacings of (200) and (111) facets on the HRTEM image were measured by the ImageJ software. The plane spacings are 0.22 \u00b1 0.03 for the (200) facet and 0.28 \u00b1 0.02 nm for the (111) facet. The elemental mapping images of the Au, I, Br, Cl, S, and N elements in MF-Au indicate that all elements exhibit a uniform distribution. This demonstrates that these elements were involved in the formation and growth of gold nanocrystals. Further, the EDS analysis was used to determine the element composition on the surface of MF-Au ( Fig. s2 and Table s2 ). It was found from Table s2 that the atomic percentages of the Au, I, Br, Cl, S and N elements are 91.65, 0.2, 1.57, 4.14, 2.24, and 0.2. Since the S element only comes from Lcysteine, a relatively high S context proves a strong affinity between the gold nanocrystal and L-cysteine during the gold crystal growth process.",

Its structure was characterized by SEM and TEM techniques and the results were shown in Fig. s4 . Compared with the gold seed, the Au-C offers a larger particle size. During the growth process of gold seeds, a large number of Au 3+ ions were reduced into Au 0 atoms. These Au 0 atoms finally deposited on the surface of the gold seeds and formed larger gold nanocrystals. However, the Au-C displays a similar morphology with the corresponding gold seed but different from that of the MF-Au. For the synthesis of Au-C and gold seed, the same soft template (CTAC) and shape inducers (CTAC, KBr, and KI) were used for the formation of gold nanocrystals. This will lead to the formation of trioctahedron-like morphologies in the Au-C and the gold seed. Different from the Au-C and gold seed, there are many irregular edges and corners on the crystal face of MF-Au. As for the synthesis of Au-C and MF-Au, the only difference between them is that L-cysteine was also used as a shape inducer in the synthesis of MF-Au; the formation of irregular edges and corners in MF-Au cold be attributed to the use of L-cysteine. L-Cysteine contains a chiral carbon atom and a sulfhydryl group. The enantioselective interaction on the interfaces caused by L-cysteine achieves asymmetric structural evolution of gold nanocrystals. This improves the exposure of high-index facets [25] .",

In the detection, AP was firstly hybridized with AS-DNA to produce duplex DNA (AP-AS-DNA). Then, carbendazim binds with the formed duplex DNA to release AS-DNA. This results in triggering a three-cascade DNA recycle. The released AS-DNA was combined with MB-H1 to produce MB-H1-AS-DNA duplex DNA that contains one restriction endonuclease Nt.AlwI recognition site. Nt.AlwI can cleavage H1 sequence at the recognition site in MB-H1-AS-DNA to produce a secondary trigger strand DNA (STS-DNA) and methylene blue-modified signal strand DNA (MB-SS-DNA), leading to the release of AS-DNA. The released AS-DNA interacts with MB-H1 to initiate the next DNA recycle and produces many MB-SS-DNA (cycle I). Meanwhile, the formed STS-DNA will specifically bind with H2 to produce H2-STS-DNA with the Nt.AlwI recognition site. Nt.AlwI cleavages H2-STS-DNA at the recognition site to release To understand the sensing principle, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) behaviors of different electrodes were studied in 1 mM Fe(CN) 6 4 \u2212 in PBS of pH 7.4. As shown in Fig. 4 , all CV curves contain one pair of redox peaks, which are attributed to the oxidization and reduction of Fe(CN) 6 ] 3\u2212/4\u2212 on the electrode surface. The immobilization of MF-Au-MGA results in an increased CV current density with a reduced charge transfer impedance (R ct ). The increase is due to high electron/ion conductivity of MF-Au-MGA. The high conductivity accelerates the electrode reaction and brings a more sensitive CV current response. The current density will rapidly increase with the increase of the scan rate, and the peak current has a linear relationship with the square root of the scan rate (Fig. s6 ). This verifies that the redox of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3\u2212/4 on the electrode surface is a quasi-reversible electrochemical process. However, the CV current will decrease after the L-DNA was connected on the MF-Au-MGA/GCE with the increase of the R ct value. This is because the L-DNA partly blocks the channels for electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte. In addition, the negative charge of the DNA backbone is responsible for an impeded electron transfer, assuming electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged L-DNA molecule To examine the response towards carbendazim, the as-prepared aptasensor was incubated in a mixed reaction solution composed of AP, AS-DNA, MB-H1, H2, and Nt.AlwI for 1 h in the presence of carbendazim. After that, its CV and EIS curves were measured. The result shows that the incubation further decreases the CV current density with increasing R ct value. This is because in the presence of carbendazim one carbendazim molecule brings many methylene blue-labeled DNA fragments to the electrode surface by the DNA cycle. The poor electrical conductivity of the DNA fragments on the electrode surface leads to an increase in R ct and a reduced CV current density. More importantly, the above result demonstrates that carbendazim can trigger the three-cascade recycle and achieves a sensitive electrochemical response. Therefore, the proposed aptasensor can be applied in the electrochemical detection of carbendazim.",

Figure 5 shows that in the absence of carbendazim, there is a very weak peak on the DPV curve. The weak DPV signal may be due to the background current produced by the measurement system. However, the incubation causes an obviously increased peak current in the presence of carbendazim. This is because the presence of carbendazim triggers the three-cascade DNA cycle. By the DNA cycle, many MB redox probes were immobilized on the electrode surface. The redox of these MB molecules produces a high DPV current response.",

For each system, the aptasensor was incubated for 1 h in the presence of 1 \u00d7 10 \u221212 M carbendazim and then used for the DPV measurement in PBS of pH 7.4. Figure 6 shows the aptasensors incubated in system I and system II give a small DPV peak current (I p ). This is because in the absence of MB-H1 or Nt.AlwI the three-cascade cycle cannot be triggered. As no MB probes were brought to the electrode surface, the aptasensor gives a low I p value due to the lack of any redox probes on the electrode surface. However, the aptasensor incubated in system III offers an obviously increased I p value. In the absence of H2, only cycle I can be achieved. By cycle I, one carbendazim molecule can bring many MB redox probes to the electrode surface. The redox of these MB probes produces a sensitive DPV current response. When system III was replaced by system IV, the I p value will be further enhanced. For system IV, the threecascade recycle can be triggered by carbendazim. As the three-cascade DNA recycle has a much higher efficiency to produce MB-SS-DNA sequences compared with single cycle I, the aptasensor incubated in system IV exhibits a much higher I p value than that in system III due to more MB redox probes on the electrode surface.",

Fig. s7 presents the relationship curves of the I p value with the Nt.Alwl concentration and the cleavage time. If the cleavage time was fixed at 60 min, the I p value rapidly increased with increasing Nt.AlwI concentration when the concentration was less than 1.2 U \u03bcL \u22121 . However, the increasing trend of the I p value slowed down when the Nt.AlwI concentration was more than 1.2 U \u03bcL \u22121 , reached the maximum at 1.5 U \u03bcL \u22121 , and then tended to be stable with the increase of Nt.Alwl concentration. If the Nt.AlwI concentration was fixed at 2 U \u03bcL \u22121 , the I p value increased with the increase of cleavage time when the cleavage time was less than 45 min. The value remained almost unchanged after 45 min. This is because the remaining H1 and H2 in the reaction system will rapidly decrease with the increase of cleavage time. The reduction will eventually lead to a decrease in the speed of MB probes being carried to the electrode surface. Consequently, the growth rate of the DPV peak current decreases with the increase of cleavage time. When the cleavage time is more than 45 min, the capture of MB probes by the electrode surface and the process of MB probes leaving the electrode surface reaches its equilibrium state. At the equilibrium state, the DPV current response could not be changed by prolonging the cleavage time because the number of MB molecules can remain almost unchanged. To obtain a high sensitivity and save the analysis time, the Nt.AlwI concentration of 2 U \u03bcL \u22121 and the cleavage time of 60 min were selected for electrochemical detection of carbendazim.",

Table 1 shows that the proposed aptasensor gives the highest sensitivity among the reported methods. This is due to high catalytic activity of MF-Au unless DNA cycle amplification. Because of high catalytic activity, the catalytic effect of MF-Au on the redox of MB greatly improves the DPV response towards carbendazim. To evaluate the catalytic activity of MF-Au/MGA, DPV behaviors of the electrodes modified by different materials were investigated, including gold seed, MF-Au, MF-Au/graphene, MF-Au/MGA , and the spherical gold nanoparticles (Au-S) prepared by the same procedure used in the synthesis of gold seeds unless there was no addition of CTAC. The results are shown in Fig. 9 . For the bare GCE, there is one peak on the DPV curve. This is due to the oxidation of the MB probe. The current will obviously increase when the Au-S was modified on the GCE surface. This demonstrates that the Au-S can offer the catalytic activity towards the MB probe. When the Au-S was replaced by the gold seed, the current increased. This confirmed that the gold seed had a better catalytic activity towards the MB probe compared with the Au-S. Different from the Au-S, the gold seed showed a trioctahedron-like nanostructure with more exposed high-index facets. The exposure improved the catalytic activity and accelerated the oxidation of the MB probe, leading to an increased current response. The CV current further increased when the gold seed was replaced by MF-Au. This demonstrated that the MF-Au can offer the highest catalytic activity among the three kinds of gold nanomaterials. This is because the MF-Au provides more exposed high-index facets compared with the gold seed. Interestingly, the combination of MF-Au with graphene brings a higher DPV current. In the MF-Au/graphene composite, a large graphene sheet acts as a particle connector to connect the isolated MF-Au particles into a whole. This further enhances the electrical conductivity and realizes a better catalytic activity. Compared with common graphene, the MGA creates a much higher electron/ion conductivity and mechanical property. As a result, the combination of MF-Au with MGA achieves the highest DPV current response. This helps to greatly improve the sensitivity and repeatability for electrochemical detection of carbendazim.",

The released STS-DNA was directly used for the next cleavage cycle of H2, triggering cycle II.The released AS-DNA in cycle II was directly used to trigger cycle I and initiates one new DNA recycling (cycle III). By the three-cascade recycle, one carbendazim molecule can produce many MB-SS-DNA probes, which were combined with the L-DNA immobilized on the electrode surface by base complementary pairing. The redox of these MB probes on the electrode surface brings a significant signal amplification.
