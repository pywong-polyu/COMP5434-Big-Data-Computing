            "text": "Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the strict national policies regarding social distancing behavior in Europe, America and Australia, people became reliant on social media as a means for gathering information and as a tool for staying connected to family, friends and work. This is the first trans-national study exploring the qualitative experiences and challenges of using social media while in lockdown or shelter-in-place during the current pandemic. Methods: This study was part of a wider cross-sectional online survey conducted in Norway, the UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. The manuscript reports on the qualitative free-text component of the study asking about the challenges of social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, USA and Australia. A total of 1991 responses were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted independently by two researchers. Results: Three overarching themes identified were: Emotional/Mental Health, Information and Being Connected. Participants experienced that using social media during the pandemic amplified anxiety, depression, fear, panic, anger, frustration and loneliness. They felt that there was information overload and social media was full of misleading or polarized opinions which were difficult to switch off. Nonetheless, participants also thought that there was an urge for connection and learning, which was positive and stressful at the same time. Conclusion: Using social media while in a shelter-in-place or lockdown could have a negative impact on the emotional and mental health of some of the population. To support policy and practice in strengthening mental health care in the community, social media could be used to deliver practical advice on coping and stress management. Communication with the public should be strengthened by unambiguous and clear messages and clear communication pathways. We should be looking at alternative ways of staying connected.",

First, the two researchers read all the data twice in order to get familiarized with it. For phases two and three, the researchers generated initial codes and then searched for themes among the codes independently. The researchers then met to discuss their findings and to extract the main themes. After this, phase 4 and 5 followed, where M.S. and J.L. met and reviewed (checked if the themes worked in relation to the code extracts and the overall data set) and defined and named (further analysis to refine the specifics of each theme) the themes before agreeing on the final names of the key themes and sub-themes (see Table 1 ).

For instance, we found that a range of emotions, such as anxiety, depression, frustration, anger, panic, fear and loneliness, was amplified from using social media during the quarantine. This finding could be seen as a contradiction with the findings of a recent rapid review, where the suggested strategies of having internet access and activating social media were recommended to reduce panic, isolation and stress among those in a quarantine [4] . However, we do not know if the amplified emotions recognized by the participants in this study are a direct result of using social media or are perhaps a result of being in a quarantine, which we know amplifies negative emotions and triggers further mental health issues [4, 38] . Alternatively, it could be that during the pandemic, participants spent a. longer time passively using social media. This is in line with other research suggesting that in a crisis, there is a tendency of an increasing time of social media use [30, 38] . Evidence suggests that the prolonged passive use of social media (scrolling through a social media news feed) is associated with depression [39] .",

We also know that obtaining correct information in a timely manner should reassure people when dealing with a crisis or when in a quarantine and should therefore lessen the feelings of fear, panic and distress [5, 13, 14] . However, a recent study suggests that regardless of having correct information in a timely matter on social media, the distribution of accurate and non-accurate information in social media has similar spreading patterns [18] . These spreading patterns are mainly driven by the specific interaction patterns of users engaging with a certain topic on the specific media platforms. Thus, it could be that work needs to be done on understanding the social dynamics behind the urge for content consumption. This, in return, could help with designing better communication models for social media that could account for social behavior and therefore provide more efficient communication strategies in a crisis situation and reduce the amplified negative emotions. Lastly, the participants expressed some positive urges to be connected and to learn new ways of communication via social media. Many participants reported that they used social media to be connected with their family and friends. While at times, this way of connecting was not perfect or as good as in-person, it helped many of the participants remain connected or feel less isolated than if social media was unavailable. This is in line with previous findings where people in crisis felt more supported and optimistic about the future when social media was extensively involved [43] . This brings an important consideration about the reasons why social media is used by the participants and about its ways of passive and active use. Previous studies suggest that when people use social media in an active way to connect with other people, share and reveal emotions, by uploading either text, videos or pictures, social media becomes a tool of emotional regulation, and therefore, their experiences of using social media are positive and increase the feelings of being connected or supported [44, 45] . In contrast, when people use social media in a passive way, they often have amplified negative feelings [46] . Thus, social media use has both positive and negative effects on us. The negative effects may be perceived as more dominant in the early stages of this crisis (rapid spread, confusion about which measures should be taken and the consequences they will have for the individuals). This could mean that as the pandemic progresses, people will start to use social media in positive ways and deliberately seek information that can bring more positive emotions, which in return can help with coping with the crisis situation.",

            "text": "There are several limitations associated with this study. There might have been a selection bias in that those who held particularly strong feelings about the topic could have been more likely to participate in the study. Additionally, most of the participants were from the UK, so there might not be equal representation of all themes, and the results may have been different if the Norwegian population had been included. This has to be taken into consideration in later research. The survey title used in the advert for participants was: 'The effects of COVID-19 on mental health and quality of life', so awareness or need to improve mental health and quality of life may be greater in the sample population when compared to the general population or those that participated could be more comfortable discussing mental health issues. The Norwegian sample was not asked the qualitative question, which warrants future research. A substantial proportion of participants did not answer the qualitative question. The missing data may include a mix of people who had not experienced any challenges with social media use during the COVID-19 lockdown or shelter-in-place and those who had but did not respond. Future research that first asks a filter question may help to reduce the level of missing data due to no challenges to report. The wording of the qualitative question was 'what challenges have you experienced in using social media?', which may have led to more negatively focused responses than if the wording was different, for example, asking more broadly about 'experiences' instead of 'challenges'. Nonetheless, while the question asked participants to report any challenges, still, some positives were reported. The positives and how social media has been helpful to the community throughout the pandemic may be equally important to understand in addition to challenges faced, and therefore warrants investigation in future research.",

Some of these negative effects on mental health can be longerterm and policymakers and public health organizations should consider measures to respond to the likely surge of ill mental health after the lockdown and shelter-in-place. While anxiety and depression were some of the most common themes from the study, there were a number of participants seeking positive or helpful information via social media. This could be an opportunity for the development of future therapeutic interventions that could be delivered or partially delivered via social media and, in return, mitigate the amplified negative feelings of the population. In addition, appropriate attention is needed for those that either had previous ill mental health or those for whom the shelter-in-place and lockdown triggered more serious mental health issues.",

However, they should also consider the social dynamics in their countries and how that knowledge can be used to improve communication. One suggestion is utilizing the dialogic communication theory [48] and creating a dialogic loop [49] , where the government and the general public engage in a negotiated interchange of ideas and opinions that promote the realization of mutual satisfaction and creation of common meaning [50] . In addition to combating misleading information on social media, its psychological impacts needs to be addressed.",
