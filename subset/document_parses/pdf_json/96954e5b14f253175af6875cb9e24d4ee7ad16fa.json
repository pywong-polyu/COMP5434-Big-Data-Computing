The model consists of a lattice of cells that can be in four different states: susceptible, infected, recovered or death. An infected cell can transmit the disease to any other susceptible cell within some random range R. The transmission mechanism follows the physics laws for the interaction between a particle and a target. Each infected particle affects the interaction region a number n of times, according to its energy. The number of interactions is proportional to the interaction cross section \u03c3 and to the target surface density \u03c1. The discrete energy follows a Planck distribution law, which depends on the temperature T of the system. For any interaction, infection, recovery and death probabilities are applied. We investigate the results of viral transmission for different sets of parameters and compare them with available COVID-19 data. The parameters of the model can be made time dependent in order to consider, for instance, the effects of lockdown in the middle of the pandemic.",

Further Monte Carlo-type studies have been devel-oped to simulate the pandemic transmission [18] [19] [20] , but use other approaches such as, for instance, a 2Drandom walk Monte Carlo simulation based on proximity infection spread. In the present MCP model we take a physical point of view, where the infection is a result of an interaction, and it follows to some extent statistical laws similar to the interaction in a system of many particles. Thus we model the infection as a likely result of a physical interaction. We apply concepts taken from statistical and nuclear physics such as interaction range, energy, temperature, and interaction cross section. These concepts, adapted to the present case of interest, are useful to describe probability distributions and interaction coefficients in physical systems, which are here characterized by epidemiological probabilities of infection, recovery and death.",

This provides a method for estimating a prediction for the total number of deaths D(\u221e) = a/c (a 1 /c 1 + a 2 + c 2 in the case of the D2-model). This value D(\u221e) is used as input to set the parameters of the Monte Carlo simulation since we know that the D model works well as a starting point for pandemic forecasting [9] . Thus the Monte Carlo will be useful to study the stochastic distribution of daily cases, since the SIR models only provide the mean values without statistical fluctuations. The simulation was started assuming that in the initial instant t = 0 there is an infected individual in the central cell of the array and all the others cells are susceptible. The algorithm of the previous sections is then applied by assuming time steps \u2206t = 1 day. In Figure  1 we show the results of the Monte Carlo simulation of the deaths-per-day, \u2206(t), in Spain. We fitted the data until May 30, 2020, where clearly the first COVID-19 wave had practically ended. We first fitted the D2 model (as the sum of two logistic functions) to the data to better estimate the end of the epidemic, and then we fitted the MCP paremeters to the curve of total accumulated deaths D(t) of the D2-model. It is worth mentioning that fitting the Monte Carlo to the accumulated deaths curve is more reliable than fitting the daily data, \u2206D(t), and gives better results.
