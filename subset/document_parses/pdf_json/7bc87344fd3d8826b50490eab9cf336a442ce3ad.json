HIV has been associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes from respiratory infections including seasonal influenza, 4, 5 and people living with HIV at any stage of infection are considered a clinical risk group in seasonal influenza vaccination guidance in the UK. 6 But the importance of HIV infection to outcomes from 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza was unclear, with no substantive evidence that HIV-infected individuals were at higher risk of being infected or experience poor outcomes, unless at an advanced stage of immunosuppression. 7 Evidence from the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is limited. A large population-based cohort study in South Africa found COVID-19 mortality risk among people living with HIV to be double the risk of those without HIV. 8 A high prevalence of critical illness was observed among HIV-infected patients with COVID-19 in Madrid, though there was no non-HIV comparison group. 9 Other small studies of hospitalised patients have failed to detect any raised risk of severe outcomes in people living with HIV. 10, 11 We therefore aimed to investigate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death using populationbased data from England.

Our results are similar to those from a population-based cohort study from the Western Cape in South Africa involving 3.5 million individuals, published as a preprint, which found an overall adjusted HR of 2.14 (1.98-3.43), compared with 2.30 (1.55-3.41) in the present study. 8 It is noteworthy that the association was similar in an English setting with higher levels of antiretroviral treatment and viral suppression; however, this is consistent with stratified analyses in the South African data, which found a more than doubled risk of COVID-19 death even among those with a recent prescription for antiretroviral treatment and a recent viral load measure of <1000 copies/ml. Early data from small cohorts and case series in other countries included a high proportion of patients experiencing severe disease. [22] [23] [24] A single-centre cohort in Madrid found that among 51 people living with HIV and diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 required hospital admission, and 13 had severe disease; the mortality rate among COVID-19 cases co-infected with HIV in this study was noted to be around double that in similar aged individuals in the general population. 9 Associations between HIV and adverse COVID-19 outcomes appear to be smaller among patients already hospitalised with COVID-19: the HR for mortality was attenuated to 1.45 (1.14-1.84) in the Western Cape study when restricted to hospitalised patients, 8 while an analysis of patients hospitalised in New York found no difference in adverse outcomes between HIV infected and demographically similar uninfected individuals. 11 However, any role that HIV may have in increasing the risk of infection and/or development of severe disease is effectively conditioned out by restriction to hospitalised individuals who are already infected with SARS-COV-2 and likely to be experiencing severe disease at the point of inclusion. 25 The larger association between HIV and COVID-19 death among people of black ethnicity has not previously been described. We have previously shown a larger overall risk of COVID-19 death in black and minority ethnic (BAME) compared with white groups in England, 2 and a systematic review suggested that BAME individuals may have a higher risk of both acquiring COVID-19 infection, and experiencing worse clinical outcomes. 26 HIV infection could plausibly exacerbate both of these, though It is not possible to delineate from our study which parts of the pathway are more or less affected by HIV status. BAME individuals are also at higher risk of negative HIV outcomes including virological rebound. 27 Over a quarter of people with HIV in our study were black, compared to just 1.9% in the general population comparison group; understanding the reasons for the disproportionately large association between HIV and COVID-19 mortality in this group will be a priority if effective policies are to be developed to mitigate any increased risks. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint", "cite_spans": [{"start": 318, "end": 319, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 855, "end": 859, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 860, "end": 864, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 865, "end": 869, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1200, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1453, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1624, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1923, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2346, "end": 2348, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2626, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Comparison with other evidence"}, {"text": "The copyright holder for this this version posted August 7, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169490 doi: medRxiv preprint", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Comparison with other evidence"}, {"text": "Our study was large, so that even in a setting with a relatively low prevalence of HIV, we were able to investigate the role of HIV accounting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle-related factors including BMI and smoking, and relevant comorbidities. We tested the robustness of our findings to different missing data approaches and to non-proportional hazards. We investigated effect modification by key covariates, and were able to detect differences by ethnicity. However the relatively small number of deaths among those with HIV, reflecting the young age distribution of the HIV group, prevented definitive conclusions about the role of comorbidities, and changes in the role of HIV over time. We noted a suggestion of a larger association between HIV and COVID-19 death early in the epidemic. If confirmed, this might suggest a higher risk of infection before widespread social distancing was introduced, which could have reduced if people living with HIV were highly adherent to social distancing guidance; furthermore, some people living with HIV initially received incorrect government advice that they were considered in the highest risk category and should take extra \"shielding\" precautions, which might have further reduced any HIV-associated risk. 28 We could not rule out that the observed trend over time reflected chance variation; analysis of pre-mortality indicators of severe disease, such as hospitalisation, would have greater statistical power to clarify this, but we could not obtain linked hospital data for people living with HIV, because HIV codes are considered sensitive in NHS data and transfer is legally restricted. 12, 29 For similar reasons, we were unable to include data on antiretroviral therapy use, level of viral suppression, or CD4 count, so it was not possible to stratify results, or quantify how much of the raised risk was driven by the minority of individuals with poorly controlled HIV. HIV in the UK is commonly managed in specialist clinics, but restrictions on the sharing of HIV-related codes along with policy guidance that cautions against sharing HIVrelated information with the patient's primary care provider meant that we could not access key data from routine HIV care. Whilst stratification by such factors would have added additional insights, we do not consider the lack of these data to critically undermine the utility of our findings, given that 94% of diagnosed HIV-positive individuals in the UK are on antiretrovirals and have good viral suppression (97% on therapy, and 97% of these with undetectable viral load). 13 This high level of viral suppression in the population means that it is unlikely that the association between HIV and COVID-19 death could have been driven entirely by the 6% assumed untreated or with detectable viral load: if all deaths had been within this group, it would amount to over 1.5% becoming infected and dying from COVID-19, compared with just <0.01% of the general population. There are no available routinely-collected data on injection drug use, which could act as a confounder, though a post-hoc adjustment for history of hepatitis C infection, as a marker of possible prior injection drug use, made little difference to our results. No data are available on occupation, or any markers for contact patterns, which could have helped to evaluate the role of exposure to infection. A further limitation is that we relied on primary care records to capture HIV status.
