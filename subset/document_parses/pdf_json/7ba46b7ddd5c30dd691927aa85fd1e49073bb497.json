            "text": "Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some K-12 schools resumed in-person classes with varying degrees of mitigation plans in the fall 2020. Physical distancing and face coverings can minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, no research has focused on adherence to mitigation strategies during school days. Thus, we sought to develop a systematic observation protocol to capture COVID-19 mitigation strategy adherence in school environments: The Systematic Observation of COVID-19 Mitigation (SOCOM). Methods: We extended previously validated and internationally used tools to develop the SOCOM training and implementation protocols to assess physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors. SOCOM was tested in diverse indoor and outdoor settings (classrooms, lunchrooms, physical education [PE], and recess) among diverse schools (elementary, secondary, and special needs). Results: For the unique metrics of physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors, areas with less activity and a maximum of 10-15 students were more favorable for accurately capturing data. Overall proportion of agreement was high for physical distancing (90.9%), face covering (88.6%), activity type (89.2%), and physical activity level (87.9%). Agreement was lowest during active recess, PE, and observation areas with \u226520 students. Conclusions: Millions of children throughout the USA are likely to return to school in the months ahead. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive research tool that can be implemented by schools to determine mitigation strategy adherence and to assess protocols that allow students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19.",

When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, schools were among the first operations to close to prevent community spread. However, in the fall of 2020, 56 million school-aged children (5-17 years of age) resumed education as some schools opened to in-person classes with varying public health mitigation plans [1] . Children and adolescents comprise asymptomatic, symptomatic, and hospitalized populations of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and their capability of spreading disease to school staff and family has yet to be resolved [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, mitigation procedures can minimize SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks even in the close quarters of overnight summer camps [6] .",

Comprehensive return-to-school plans emphasize adherence to accepted SARS-CoV-2 viral mitigation strategies procedures, including physical distancing (staying at least 6 feet from others who are not from the same household) and face cover wearing [7] [8] [9] . Specifically, new guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight the need to promote behaviors that reduce COVID-19's spread, including maintaining healthy environments and operations, and preparing for when someone gets sick [10] . Recognizing mitigation strategies represent unnatural behaviors for K-12 students, attention has been focused on strategies to implement and operationalize mitigation protocols in schools. Little emphasis has been given to how to quantify adherence. Without adherence metrics, effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation procedures cannot be ascertained.",

During the second scan, observers recorded data for each female student's face covering. For PE classes and active recesses, a third scan was performed to record the PA level of each female student as sedentary, walking, or vigorous. Finally, for female students, a scan was made to categorize each as being interactive or individual. This scanning procedure was then completed for male students, female adults, and male adults in the target area (if any). Observers then moved to the next target area. Occasionally (e.g., unusual large numbers of people in the area), target areas were subdivided into smaller sub-areas so more accurate measures could be obtained and data for these sub-areas were later summed to provide an overall measure.

The current study was limited to observing only traditional classrooms, communal dining, active recess, and PE classes. Nonetheless, we believe the tool can be used in other school settings, such as music classes, laboratories, teachers' lounges, and hallways as well as when students arrive at and depart the school grounds.

Training materials for SOCOM were obtained from existing valid and reliable methods. Although previous training materials focused mainly on capturing PA levels, we found that training to observe physical-distancing and face-covering behaviors was readily adaptable. Field-based observational training using the protocol in real-time were imperative. Our training included an initial visit to each school to familiarize observers with features of the school's physical environment and review details of the school's COVID-19 schedule, rules, and restrictions. Visits permitted the development of appropriate weekly and daily observation schedules for each school and was welcomed by school leadership and staff. Visits were necessary for positioning observers in areas where they could have a clear view and to minimize interactions with students and staff. However, a limitation of SOCOM is the potential for observation bias as individuals may be inclined to be on their best behavior while under observation. To decrease observation bias in the future, observers should be school personnel. Training teachers, staff, and administration to use SOCOM in schools can also provide schools with real-time feedback that may impact practices and policies for in-person learning.",

At the time of this writing, a vaccine has not been approved to be used among children <16 years old and no child under the age of 12 years has been enrolled in any safety or efficacy vaccine trials, thus the potential for widespread COVID-19 vaccinations in school-aged children to diminish the need for mitigation procedures in schools is many months away. Quantifying the success of SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation in school settings is likely to be useful for the foreseeable future. Standardized methods of measuring the fidelity of mitigation procedures will likely aid in identifying the most effective ways to minimize SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission. SOCOM is a relatively inexpensive tool that can be implemented by schools in various settings, including the school day, after school programs, and school sports and competitions, to determine mitigation strategy adherence to help students return to school safely and slow the spread of COVID-19.",

NOTE: Occasionally students moved their desks and chairs closer to others and were not 6ft apart). Scenario 2: Students shared a desk and had a plastic divider between them.Communal dining There were 36 rectangle tables, 6 circle tables, and 6 square tables. Rectangular tables had designated stickers to identify where students could sit. Circle and square tables had plastic dividers on the tabletop. Custodians cleaned the tables during transition times from one class to another.~4 -6 at each table Active recess Multiple areas were used for active recess that were shared with other grades.
