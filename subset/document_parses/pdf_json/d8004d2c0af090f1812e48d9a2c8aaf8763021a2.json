The present experimental study evaluated the effect of exposure to messages targeting cognitive attitude plus anticipated positive (pride) or negative (regret) affective reactions on intention to get vaccinated. Participants included 484 Italian adults randomly allocated to one of four conditions: 1) cognitive attitude message; 2) cognitive attitude plus positive affect message; 3) cognitive attitude plus negative affect message; 4) control condition (no message). Results showed that participants in the second condition reported greater intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those in the control condition. Parallel mediation analysis indicated that the effect of the second condition on intention was fully mediated by cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affect. These findings suggest that future campaigns aimed at promoting COVID-19 vaccination intention could usefully target both cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affect.",

Several studies carried out before the approval of any vaccine against COVID-19 showed similar results. For example, Caserotti et al. (2021) reported that Italians had strong intentions to get vaccinated in the early stages of the pandemic (February-June 2020), particularly during the lockdown phase, with 86% of the participants saying that they were willing to pay to receive the vaccine when available. However, in another study (Graffigna et al., 2020) conducted during the early days of the reopening after the first lockdown, only 59% of the respondents declared that they would accept the vaccine, whereas 15% said that they would refuse it, and the remaining 26% were hesitant. Later in the pandemic, with the approval of the first COVID vaccines (i.e., Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), the percentage of people who reported being uncertain about the vaccine appears to have increased. For example, in a study on a representative sample of one Italian region (Emilia Romagna), 31% of participants declared themselves hesitant to receive the COVID vaccine (Reno et al., 2021) .",

The current research focuses on testing the effectiveness of interventions to promote the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

This is in line with previous literature demonstrating that attitude is the strongest predictor of intention to get vaccinated (e.g., Britt and Englebert, 2018; Cha and Kim, 2019; Hofman et al., 2014; Lehmann et al., 2014; Ratanasiripong et al., 2018) . In particular, cognitive evaluations about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in question represent important determinants of vaccination intention and behaviour (Xiao, 2019) . The role of attitude has been widely emphasised in the context of social cognitive models of health behaviour, such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) . Although these models have proved effective in predicting several health behaviours, including vaccination (e.g., Caso et al., 2019) , they are predominantly cognitive theories that ignore the role of affective processes that can affect intention and behaviour (Williams et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, in recent years, a growing literature has explored and demonstrated the usefulness of including an affective component, especially in the TPB model (e. g., Conner et al., 2013; Stevens et al., 2019) . In particular, it has been widely shown that adding the component of anticipated affective reactions (e.g., anticipated regret) to the TPB increases the proportion of the explained variance in intention and behaviour (Sandberg and Conner, 2008) .",

Anticipated regret has proven to be a key factor both in influencing the decision to get personally vaccinated (Christy et al., 2016; Weinstein et al., 2007) and vaccinate someone else (e.g., in the case of mandatory or recommended vaccinations for children and adolescents; Caso et al., 2019 Caso et al., , 2021a Ziarnowski et al., 2009) . For example, in a recent study on the HPV and influenza vaccinations, Pen\u0163a et al. (2020) found that inaction anticipated regret was the strongest predictor of intention for both types of vaccinations, over and above cognitive variables (knowledge, perceived susceptibility and severity in relation to the disease, perceived vaccine effectiveness and safety). A very similar result was also found in a study by Christy et al. (2016) , who reported that inaction anticipated regret was associated with intention to receive the HPV vaccine, beyond a series of cognitive variables (e.g., perceived risk of developing genital warts or cancer), but only among male participants. Generally, inaction anticipated regret appears to be more relevant than action anticipated regret in the context of vaccination (Brewer et al., 2016) .",

For example, Stevens et al. (2019) tested the effect of both anticipated positive and negative positive affects on intentions to perform health-promoting and health-risk behaviours; results showed that anticipated positive affects (i.e., pride), differently from anticipated regret, did not predict intention to engage in the analysed health behaviours, including influenza vaccination. On the other hand, Radic et al. (2021) examined the factors influencing intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as a precondition to travel abroad. Although the study investigated a particular type of intention, the results highlighted that anticipated feelings of pride influenced the personal norm concerning vaccination (i.e., the sense of moral obligation to get vaccinated), which in turn affected intention. It should be noted that the results of these studies are insufficient to draw strong conclusions regarding the possible impact of anticipated positive affects on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. That is why, in the present study, we decided to explore the role of both anticipated positive (pride) and negative (regret) affects on intention, implementing an experimental design based on the creation of persuasive messages targeting such affective responses (Conner et al., 2020) .",

In particular, numerous intervention and experimental studies successfully targeted anticipated affects to promote different health behaviours (see Conner et al., 2020) . For example, Martinez (2014) found that persuasive messages focused on attitude plus anticipated regret, compared with messages focused on attitude only, significantly increased participants' intention to consume folic acid. Similarly, manipulating anticipated negative affects proved effective in increasing intention to drink at least 2L of water a day (Carfora et al., 2018) , willingness to become an organ donor (O'Carroll et al., 2011) , and cancer screening attendance (O'Carroll et al., 2015; Sandberg and Conner, 2009 ). Regarding vaccination behaviour, Kim (2020) demonstrated that the effect of health promotion messages on attitude and intention to receive the HPV vaccine was fully mediated by changes in inaction anticipated regret. In addition, another relevant result emerged from the study by Cox et al. (2014) . These authors demonstrated that simply asking anticipated regret questions increased mothers' intention to vaccinate their daughters against human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite the fact that, in this study, the effect of the anticipated regret questions only worked in mothers who had been exposed to a graphic message about the possible consequences of HPV vaccination (compared with those exposed to a text-only message), such results emphasise the potential of targeting anticipated affects in promoting vaccination intention.",

In response to RQ1, the results showed that only participants in the cognitive attitude plus positive affect message condition reported significantly higher intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with participants in the control group. This highlights that cognitive attitude and anticipated pride could play a crucial role in the decision-making process related to COVID-19 vaccination. Instead, in contrast with studies (e.g., Cox et al., 2014; Ziarnowski et al., 2009 ) that showed the effectiveness of manipulating anticipated regret to increase vaccination intention, participants exposed to the message focused on cognitive attitude plus anticipated negative affect (regret) did not report higher levels of intention compared with those in the control condition. These findings can have more than one explanation. As Chou and Budenz (2020) suggested, on the one hand, negative emotional appeals tend to be effective in piquing the interest of people who are emotionally disengaged about the promoted behaviour, whereas, on the other hand, they could even be counterproductive when negative emotions are already pervasive in the target population (which may be likely during a global pandemic). In such a context, activating positive affects in relation to the possibility of being vaccinated could be Note. Condition 1 = cognitive attitude message; Condition 2 = cognitive attitude plus positive affect message; Condition 3 = cognitive attitude plus negative affect message.",

Conversely, emphasising pride that one might feel immediately after engaging in the recommended behaviour can be a more salient factor in influencing vaccination-related decision-making. Moreover, in response to RQ2, our results showed that both cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affective reactions fully mediated the effect of the experimental condition (targeting cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affect) on intention to get vaccinated. Although the message targeting only cognitive attitude did not prove sufficient in modifying intention, these findings instead show the usefulness of working jointly on cognitive and positive affective aspects in promoting vaccination intention. Of course, enormous efforts must be devoted to improving people's attitudes toward the vaccine, with particular emphasis on its safety and efficacy aspects, and appealing to affects could represent that extra step that makes the persuasive message really effective. Promoting a more positive approach with respect to vaccination behaviour should take into consideration the process that leads to the intention to vaccinate in its complexity, which includes, without doubt, the role of affective variables.",

            "text": "This study is not without limitations. First of all, data collection started about a month before any COVID-19 vaccine was officially approved, that is, in a period in which accurate information was not available on the characteristics of the candidate vaccines, in particular about their efficacy, safety, and the possible side effects. With the start of the vaccination campaign, the intention to get vaccinated may likely have changed in light of the clearer information about the vaccines, the experiences of people who have already received them, and, not less importantly, government decisions and the daily news broadcast by the media. As specified above, the data on the time course of the vaccination campaign in Italy are in line with those of the neighbouring countries of the EU (around 60% of fully vaccinated people). However, the percentage of people still hesitant about the vaccine should not be underestimated, particularly in the older age groups (e.g., over 60s and 70s), where there is currently the lowest adhesion to vaccines (Italian Ministry of Health, 2021b). For this reason, further studies are needed to verify whether the type of persuasive message that we have identified as the most effective in promoting intention to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine also works in increasing intention to get the currently approved vaccines and the consequent behaviour and its impact on different socio-demographic groups. Secondly, since we used a convenience sample recruited by advertising the study through various online channels (e.g., Facebook groups), we cannot conclude that our results are generalisable to the general population and, above all, that participants did not already have high levels of vaccination intention. However, the heterogeneity of participants in terms of socio-demographic characteristics may have partially reduced this bias. Thirdly, although in the literature there is no convincing evidence that affective attitudeunlike anticipated affective reactionscan predict vaccination intention, future studies with larger samples could simultaneously manipulate both components of the attitude (cognitive vs affective) plus anticipated affective reactions to clarify better if and how these processes are mutually exclusive in the context of the decision-making process related to COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, it should be noted that we have not focused on all the variables of the TPB model but only on attitude and intention. Future studies should also consider, for example, the possible effect of subjective norms on the intention to get vaccinated against COVID, since the literature shows that subjective norms, after attitude, are the strongest predictors of vaccination intentions (e.g., Askelson et al., 2010) . Injunctive norms, i.e. what significant others (family, friends) think the person should do (to get vaccinated or not), and descriptive norms, i.e. what they do themselves (they intend to get vaccinated or not), are both aspects that could have a substantial impact on the decision to get vaccinated, especially in consideration of the context of uncertainty (e.g., doubts about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines) in which this decision is taken. Furthermore, considering that many countries are starting to vaccinate or consider vaccinating children and young people, studying the impact of social influences is even more relevant. Indeed, younger people's attitudes toward vaccines appear to be heavily influenced by social norms (Rambout et al., 2014) ; in this perspective, learning that most people significant to them (e.g., parents or friends) get vaccinated can represent, for the youngest, an important motivational factor.",

Since changing vaccination intentions presumably requires more than exposure to a single message, it would be unrealistic to expect larger effects. Nevertheless, as Funder and Ozer (2019) highlighted, small effects can matter in the long run, particularly when analysing psychological processes that influence the behaviour of many individuals simultaneously. This is especially true when it comes to vaccination, since increasing the intentions to get vaccinated of even a few people can have huge practical consequences, as vaccinated people protect not only themselves but also people around them. Also, the result that the exposure to a single persuasive message has produced a small but significant effect on intentions appears to us somewhat encouraging, as it suggests that a more structured intervention (e.g., daily exposure to persuasive messages) in larger populations could have a stronger effect.",

Surprisingly, most studies that have tested the effectiveness of persuasive messages in the context of vaccination behaviour focused only on the classic distinction between gain-framed and loss-framed messages (e.g., Abhyankar et al., 2008) , leaving aside the possible role of the affective components. As far as we know, ours is the first study in which the combined effect of affective and cognitive variables is examined. Even though further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of persuasive messages targeting cognitive attitude plus anticipated positive affective reactions, our results emphasise the need for future COVID-19 (and not only) vaccination promotion campaigns to take into account the role of affective processes in the design and implementation of more effective communication strategies to promote vaccination intention and behaviour. More generally, interventions to increase trust in vaccines, while not directly increasing vaccine uptake, could act indirectly by strengthening the effectiveness of public health policies on vaccination (Brewer et al., 2017) . These efforts need to be even more focused when planning to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates, as the development of a new vaccine is always accompanied by fear, indecision, and misinformation, all of which could jeopardise the success of the vaccination campaign and, consequently, the battle against the pandemic.
