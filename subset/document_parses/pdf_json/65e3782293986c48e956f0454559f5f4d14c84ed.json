The clinical presentation of CD is extremely variable, ranging from typical gastrointestinal symptomatology to extraintestinal symptoms or have no symptoms at all. Importantly, extraintestinal symptoms comprise a substantial proportion of the clinical manifestations of CD such as dermatitis herpetiformis, arthritis, neurological symptoms, anaemia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, tooth enamel defects, aphthous stomatitis, hypertransaminasemia, etc. [1] [2] [3] . The pathogenesis of CD involves structural changes in the small intestinal mucosa and intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration when gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) resistant to digestive enzymes cross the epithelial barrier to the lamina propria, leading to the activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses [2, 4] .",

Strict adherence to the GFD is crucial to reverse the clinical manifestations and to prevent long-term complications [1, 3, [5] [6] [7] . However, a diet with the total exclusion of gluten is challenging for most patients, who need high levels of discipline and motivation [1] . Moreover, GFD is more expensive, less palatable, and imposes social constraints, such as when dining out and traveling [8] [9] [10] . Consequently, a substantial number of patients with CD, especially those who are asymptomatic, commit diet transgressions and they are at risk of developing histological lesions and complications as a result of their condition [11] . The reported rates of GFD adherence range between 12% and 90% in adults [11] [12] [13] and between 23% and 98% in children [14] .",

These proteins are fundamental for dough formation in bakery products because of their viscoelasticity; however, their applications in the food industry are broader [18] . Wheat gluten prolamins, called gliadins and glutenins, are characterized by being rich in proline and glutamine amino acids, which make them resistant to hydrolysis by gastric and pancreatic enzymes [17] . As a result, an innumerable diversity of GIP is produced in the gastrointestinal tract, triggering an immune response in individuals with CD. In any case, most of the immunogenicity could be assigned to a limited number of gluten epitopes [19] ; among the GIP containing the most active T cell epitopes of CD, the \u03b1-gliadin 33-mer peptide has been described as a paradigm of immunodominance [20] .",

Several authors have reported the detection of GIP in the urine of patients with CD and healthy individuals using mass spectrometry and antibody-based methods [11, 13, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Urine is an advantageous sample for disease monitoring, as it can be collected fully non-invasively, in large amounts, and repeatedly over long periods of time [29] . Urine is a complex matrix of different components, such as water, glucose, proteins, amino acids, and inorganic salts [29] . However, the usual low concentration of protein in urine and its heterogeneity within and between individuals complicate the determination of the specific moment of analyte excretion [29] . The aim of this study was to determine the individual variability and the dynamics and limit of detection (LoD) of urine GIP excretion after two different amounts of low/moderate gluten ingestion (50 mg and 2 g) by monitoring a significant number of participants with minimized diet variations.",

[23] were the first to demonstrate that the same LFIA method could detect the ingestion of 25 mg and 50 mg of gluten from processed bread in the urine of healthy volunteers. Their results revealed that GIP from those gluten doses were detectable 3-9 h post ingestion; however, the time of GIP disappearance after a normal gluten-containing diet was extended to 16-34 h compared to this study. They estimated that the time of excretion of gluten-derived peptides ranged from 1 to 2 days. In agreement with these data, other authors found an association between confirmed gluten exposure and GIP presence in urine within 36 h after ingestion in patients with CD [26, 27] . Although the results exhibited a high interindividual variability, the interval between gluten consumption and GIP detection in urine was generally consistent, ranging from <4 to >24 h. Our results with more participants (n = 20) showed GIP detection in the first 15 h after the 2 g gluten challenge. Thus, depending on the amount of gluten consumed, the period of GIP detection may vary, with a positive trend between gluten consumption and GIP excretion. Nonetheless, it seems that the interval of time between 3 and 9 h post ingestion may be crucial for GIP detection, independent of the magnitude of gluten exposure. In any case, disagreement in the period to excrete all GIP could also vary depending on the type of ingested gluten, for instance, capsulated gluten in this study vs. other alternatives such as cookies, bread, or cereal bars that have been used in other studies [23, 26, 27] .",

Urine composition can vary between individuals due to differences in biological factors, body size, physical exercise, environmental conditions, and fluid, salt, and high protein ingestion [32] . Moreover, the sample collection timing in relation to exposure, variation in the kinetics of elimination within and between individuals, and physicochemical properties of the urine matrix should be considered [33] . Hydration status plays a crucial role in variations in the urinary flow rate (volume of urine produced per unit time), and therefore in the concentrations of the biomarker in the study [33] . Although the mechanisms of GIP elimination in urine are currently unknown, our results showed a significant inverse correlation between liquid consumption and GIP concentration in urine (p < 0.001), as expected for a higher dilution of the urine peptides. However, we did not find a correlation between the urination frequency and GIP concentrations. Thus, it seems that urinary GIP detection may be affected by the amount of liquid ingested. On the other hand, some individuals may not absorb and excrete sufficient GIP in urine to be detected or a fraction of the absorbed GIP might go back to the portal circulation after their pass through the kidneys. Despite one of the participants of the present study obtaining negative results in all the urine samples collected after the 2 g gluten ingestion, GIP were significantly found in the stools coming from the same period, confirming the gluten exposure (data published separately). Another explanation could be that this participant missed the collection of one or more samples due to the tedious methodology employed in the study.",

Furthermore, it was suggested that inadvertent gluten ingestion may be more recurrent than intentional intake, not only when eating out, but also at home [12, 26, 27] . The main goal of this study was to comprehensively determine the pattern of GIP excretion in urine related to a single ingestion of a low amount of gluten, which is the expected situation for inadvertent-involuntary gluten exposure. This information will be valuable in providing more accurate guidance for the use of the GIP tests in patients with CD.

Other authors reported a rate of 69.8% of patients with at least one GIP+ in urine when they collected weekly samples on weekends over 4 weeks [13] . Thus, considering the short period of GIP detection in urine (3-12 h) after gluten intake and the variability in GIP excretion within and between individuals in our study, it seems that the increase in the frequency of tests may be a worthwhile approach to reduce the probability of false negative results due to punctual gluten consumptions [11, 13] . In this scenario, the use of three LFIA tests in urine collected at different times during weekdays and weekends may reach a sensitivity of 19.6% for very low gluten intakes, such as 50 mg, while this sensitivity could increase to 93.1% with higher gluten exposures, such as 2 g.",

Hence, it seems that the last urine in the night, or alternatively the first one in the morning, would meet most of these conditions. Routinely, first-morning urine samples are required for urinary analysis as a representative sample of the average urine of the day and because they have the highest concentration of peptides [33] . However, food ingestion occurs during the day, therefore, depending on the dynamics of excretion, analyte detection among subjects could fluctuate [33] . Alternations of first-morning urine and the last urine in the day may offer more probabilities to reveal a diet transgression made at lunch and dinner times. Moreno et al. [23] suggested the collection of 24-h total urine to increase the probability of GIP detection from a low amount of gluten ingestion; however, the complexity for patients is higher and urine samples with detectable amounts of GIP could be diluted, decreasing the concentration of the final sample.",

The complexity of the study design, requiring a big effort from the volunteers, and the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic make the recruitment process a difficult task. Furthermore, the inclusion of patients with CD had ethical concerns. Although it is generally believed that gluten metabolism is similar between patients with CD and healthy subjects, several aspects need to be addressed when the CD population is considered as they may present digestive alterations, intestinal permeability, and differences in the microbiota involved in the gluten degradation process [21, 36, 37] . In fact, it was described that patients with CD may have a higher proteolytic activity in the intestine leading to a gluten reduction in feces in comparison to healthy subjects and first-degree relatives on normal diet [37] . Moreover, a recent study confirmed that patients with CD consuming wheat excreted in urine a significantly higher diversity of gluten-derived peptides than healthy subjects, however differences the healing of the intestinal epithelia between patients with CD were not contemplated [28] . Thus, since the test for GIP detection in urine is intended for use by people suffering from CD and gluten-related disorders, future studies with these populations with similar gluten consumptions will confirm the compatibility of our results for the definition of clinical practice guidelines for the application of GIP in the monitoring of GFD.",
