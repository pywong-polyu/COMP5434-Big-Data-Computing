Herein, we developed an ELISA method to detect antibodies specific to peptides and proteins derived from SARS-CoV-2 virus in immunized golden Syrian hamsters. Under optimized conditions, this assay quantitates antibodies specific for individual viral peptides, peptide pools, and proteins. Hence, this ELISA method allows investigators to quantitatively assess humoral immune responses at the peptide and protein levels and has potential application in the development of peptide-based vaccines to be tested in hamsters.",

Various animal models have been explored for SARS-CoV-2 studies, of which the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has emerged as one of the best clinically relevant small animal models (Lakdawala and Menachery, 2020; Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2021) . Similar to other respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2005; Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2018) , both in silico study and experimental conditions have shown that the golden Syrian hamster is natively susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection without the need for genetic alteration of the host and/or virus (as is necessary with the murine model of disease) and develops signs of respiratory diseases similar to those observed in humans suffering from mild to moderate COVID-19. Therefore, it is a permissive model that recapitulates many of the clinical characteristics of human disease, making it an excellent animal model for SARS-CoV-2related studies (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020) . However, the lack of available immunological assays (and reagents) limits the utilization of hamsters as an animal model to assess immune responses to viral infection and/or vaccination.",

            "text": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are a well-known laboratory technique used in both clinics and research laboratories for the detection of proteins, peptides, and other small molecules (Engvall and Perlmann, 1972) . A key feature of ELISA lies in the specific interaction of an antibody and its ligands, which is exploited to detect the presence of either the antibody or its ligands (Lequin, 2005 ). An ELISA method has been optimized for the detection of antibodies against the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus in immunized hamsters (Shete et al., 2021) , the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in mice (Bayarri-Olmos et al., 2021; Shalash et al., 2021) . Unfortunately, there exists no ELISA method for the detection of peptidespecific antibodies in hamster sera following infection/vaccination with SARS-CoV-2. With the increasing use of golden Syrian hamsters in vaccine research for SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development of an ELISA method for the detection of protein-specific and peptide-specific antibodies in hamster serum. With respect to controlling or resolving the COVID-19 pandemic, effective vaccines are a critical tool (Randolph and Barreiro, 2020) . Almost all current COVID-19 vaccines, despite different strategies and platforms, are designed using the viral S protein as the antigenic component. Although it is a logical choice of antigen, S protein is characterized by a high rate of mutation, leading to new variants with the ability to partly, or even fully, evade vaccine-induced immunity, necessitating the development of newer COVID-19 vaccines. Of the many potential vaccine strategies, peptide-based vaccines are emerging as a promising approach for broadly protective COVID-19 vaccines (Poland et al., 2021) . In this study, we developed a new ELISA method to detect peptide-specific antibodies in hamster serum. Our data show that this new ELISA detects both protein-specific and peptide-specific antibodies in immunized hamsters, demonstrating that this ELISA is a useful method for evaluating the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines, including peptide-based vaccines, in golden Syrian hamsters.",

However, one of practical issues with high-binding surfaces is the direct adsorption of reactants to these surfaces, leading to high background and false positive signals. Blocking (step 2 in Fig. 1 ) is a critical step to prevent direct absorption. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a common choice of blocking agents (Xiao and Isaacs, 2012) . In an initial experiment, the uncoated wells were blocked with BSA (step 2 in Fig. 1 ) then the secondary antibody (step 4 in Fig. 1 ) and other reactants from step 4 onwards were added. There was no significant difference between 1% and 2% BSA (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that 1% BSA was sufficient to block the well surface from direct adsorption of secondary CpG and CFA in a 2-dose regimen with 14-day interval. Hamster serum was prepared for ELISA at 14 days after the second dose. (B) Comparison of two blocking conditions in uncoated wells. The \"+\" symbol indicates the addition of reactants while the \"-\" symbol means no reactant was added.

(G) Serum from each hamster was serially diluted and anti-N antibodies were detected by using the optimized conditions. \"ns\" stands for nonsignificant difference while \"*\" indicates a statistically significant difference with p < 0.05. \"*\" at \"diluent\" in Fig. 2G indicates a significantly lower level of OD450 in the diluent as compared to all dilution factors of the anti-N serum.

Hamsters were immunized with a pool of 20 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. These peptides were derived from N, S, open reading frame (ORF), and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus. These peptides varied in length from 9 to 24 amino acids, had varying degrees of hydrophobicity and a range of isoelectric points. Peptides were mixed with CFA, a wellknown water-in-oil emulsion, and ODN2395 (InvivoGen), a CpG class C TLR-9 agonist. Using peptides predicted to be immunogenic, the peptide vaccine formulation served as a useful model to validate the peptidespecific antibody detection capacity of this ELISA method.",

Numerous blocking agents have been evaluated for their abilities to prevent this non-specific binding (P\u00e9terfi and Kocsis, 2000; Xiao and Isaacs, 2012; Waritani et al., 2017) , but BSA is one of the most efficient blocking agents and was used in this study. Investigators wishing to use other blocking agents should optimize those conditions before using this protocol. Although blocking with 1% BSA was sufficient to prevent the direct adsorption of secondary antibody onto the surface of the plate wells (Fig. 2B) , it did not completely prevent direct absorption of the antibodies in hamster serum (Fig. 2B) , resulting in increased background. It was noted that with 1% BSA, OD450 detected in anti-N serum was higher than that in na\u00efve serum (Fig. 2B) , probably due to a higher amount of total IgG in anti-N serum than in na\u00efve serum. At 2% BSA blocking, we confirmed that there were no significant nonspecific interactions between antibody-containing reactants and the plate wells, or between protein coated wells and the secondary antibody reagent ( Fig. 2B and C) . It was noteworthy that the OD450 in the wells coated with 0.5 \u03bcg/well of N protein was 96% of that in the wells coated with 1 \u03bcg/well (Fig. 2E) . Hence, coating with 0.5 \u03bcg/well may not result in a significant loss of OD450 if antigen quantities are limited.",
