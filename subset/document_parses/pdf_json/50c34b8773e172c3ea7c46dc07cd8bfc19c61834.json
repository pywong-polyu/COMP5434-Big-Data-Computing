We aimed to provide practical methods for COVID-19 risk reduction during breast cancer screening mammography (MMG) by examining an overview of potential contamination routes of aerosols and possible risks for patients and health care providers. Methods Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for airflow and aerosol dispersion in a 3D virtual model of a mobile MMG laboratory room. This model was constructed based on the actual mobile screening MMG bus 'Cosmos' in the Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion & Disease Prevention. Examiner and patient geometries were obtained by scanning an actual human using a 3D Scanner. Contamination of the room was evaluated by counting the numbers of suspended and deposited aerosols. Results We applied the CFD simulation model to the exhalation of small or large aerosols from a patient and examiner in the MMG laboratory. Only 14.5% and 54.5% of large and small aerosols, respectively, were discharged out of the room with two doors open. In contrast, the proportion of large and small aerosols discharged out of the room increased to 96.6% and 97.9%, respectively, with the addition of forced gentle wind by the blower fan. This simulation was verified by a mist aerosol experiment conducted in the mobile MMG laboratory. Conclusion Adding forced ventilation to a MMG laboratory with two doors open may enable risk reduction dramatically. This could be applied to other clinical situations.",

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries in 2002-2003 [2] .

Large aerosols settle faster than they evaporate and contaminate various surfaces with a viable virus titer [12] . Small aerosols evaporate faster than they settle, so they can float in the air for hours and be transported over long distances. Both aerosol sizes can accumulate in poorly ventilated venues and be carried in air currents. Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 is thought to occur via two routes, which are (i) physical contact with droplets deposited on a surface and subsequent transfer to the recipient's respiratory mucosa and (ii) the 'airborne' transmission route [13] . SARS-CoV-2 is spread by contaminated surfaces or through close contact. It has been elucidated that SARS-CoV-2 might spread through respiratory aerosols or droplets; to date, viral RNA has been identified from air sampling in some studies [11, 14] .",

MMG, chest X-ray, or ultrasound for screening requires isolation from the surroundings to consider privacy, so the ventilation of these rooms is potentially challenging, especially in mobile service systems.

Figure 4 shows simulation data of an MMG laboratory with an examiner and a patient with two doors open, with air conditioner, ventilation fan on, and with/without blower fan on. Figure 4a and b show snapshots of a number of simulations, where the aerosols exhaled by the examiner and When aerosol dynamics are considered, the smaller aerosol fraction, which was exhaled by the examiner and patient, drifts mostly in the room, but some are evacuated from the ceiling fan (Fig. 4a) . The larger aerosol fraction exhibits the same behavior, except that some adhere to the survey instrument or floor (Fig. 4b) . It should be noted that the two doors are open and located diagonally from each other in the room. Opening the door is generally considered best for ventilation; however, this simulation indicates that only having the door open will not be sufficient ventilation for removing an aerosol. Figure 4c and d both display forced ventilation with a blower from one door to the other. About 97.9% of the smaller fraction of the aerosols is removed by forced airflow (Fig. 4c, Table 1 ). Forced airflow removed the smaller and larger fractions of aerosols by about 97.9% and 97%, respectively. It should be noted that forced airflow dramatically reduced the adhered large particles from 76.1% to 1.4% with doors open (Fig. 4c, d, Table 1 ).",

The transport of particles by this jet plays an important role in the reduction of deposited particles due to the blower ventilation in Fig. 4d . For indoor ventilation that contains particles with sedimentation, such as large particles, the conventional concept of replacement ventilation of replacing air is not sufficient, and particles are captured with a flow that is an order of magnitude higher than the sedimentation rate as in this case. It is considered effective to transport the particles to the outside.",

Furthermore, the direction of the forced wind should be from one door to the other, and the patient and examiner should be located inside the path of the jet flow (Fig. 4) .",

The most notable aspect with respect to the MMG examination is that the examiner cannot perform the examination without close contact with the patient. Therefore, it seems essential to take measures for aerosols even if everyone wears a mask.",
