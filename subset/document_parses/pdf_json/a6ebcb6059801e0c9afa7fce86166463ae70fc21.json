In this paper we discuss the limited expressiveness of these labels may fail to accommodate varying degrees of user preference, and thus lead to conflicts during model training, which we call annotation bias. To solve this issue, we find the soft-labeling property of pairwise labels could be utilized to alleviate the bias of pointwise labels. To this end, we propose a momentum contrast framework (MP2) that combines pointwise and pairwise learning for recommendation. MP2 has a three-tower network structure: one user network and two item networks. The two item networks are used for computing pointwise and pairwise loss respectively. To alleviate the influence of the annotation bias, we perform a momentum update to ensure a consistent item representation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.",

However, user preferences are not stable and often influenced by context. For example, in Fig. 1 we can see that item is annotated as 0 and 1 labels in different contexts but neither of them can accurately represent the user's exact preference 0.7. We call it annotation bias, which is widely ignored in binary pointwise labels. (In reality, zero labels are also collected from users' impression logs, so the annotation bias is different from the well-studied exposure bias [14, 15] ). One drawback of having annotation bias for the deep model is a high fluctuation of learned representations. For example, the two conflict labels of item will give opposite optimizing signals to its item representation.",

However, we clarify that our proposed model differs from the aforementioned methods in motivation.

Further, we can get the following findings. 1) Models with joint loss (i.e., MP2, T3, and APPL) are generally better than models with pairwise loss (Ranknet-NN and BPR) or pointwise loss (NeuMF), showing that combining pointwise and pairwise learning is a promising approach for recommendation. 2) Pairwise models are empirically better than pointwise models. This is mainly because pairwise models capture relative relations of items and datasets are free of annotation bias. 3) Ranknet-NN (deep pairwise model) outperforms BPR (non-deep pairwise model) with a large margin on four datasets. Their loss function are the same and the difference is that Ranknet-NN applies a neural network, which could learn high-order feature interactions. In contrast, BPR is based on matrix factorization and it can only leverage shallow feature interactions for recommendation. 4) MP2 is superior to three tower and APPL, which indicates the effectiveness of momentum update and the weighting strategy. We also find that T3 is better than APPL, verifying the superiority of the three-tower structure over the two-tower structure. By the above analysis, we can conclude that MP2 is effective and competitive.",
