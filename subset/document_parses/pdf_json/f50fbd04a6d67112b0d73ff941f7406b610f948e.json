Therefore, we investigated whether Phenylalanine increased the mortality of ARDS in a mouse model. The ARDS mouse model was established and Phenylalanine was administrated by intravenous injection. As shown in Fig. 5a , mice were pretreated with Phenylalanine at 0 h and received intratracheal injection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) at 24 h. The ARDS mice and sham mice were administrated with either a dose of Phenylalanine or PBS every 24 h, following which the mice started to die at 24 h after injection of PAO1. A significant increase of mortality rate was observed around 54 h, at which time 48% of the mice injected with Phenylalanine and 30% of mice injected with PBS found dead. At 7 days after PAO1 injection, the Phenylalanine group had significantly lower survival rate (8%) compared to those treated with PBS (14%) (Fig. 5b) . The same amount of Phenylalanine was administrated in sham mice without ARDS every 24 h for 7 days and no death was observed during the period (Fig.  5b) , confirming that the concentration of Phenylalanine we used was not lethal in control mice.

We found the levels of glutamine and tryptophan (not significantly) in BALF also increased after injection of Phenylalanine ( Figure S3 ). The lung injury of mice were assayed 24 h post injection with PAO1, protein and white cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Fig. 5b-c) increased in ARDS mice injected with Phenylalanine compared to those treated with PBS, indicating that Phenylalanine increased the recruitment of inflammatory cells and impairment of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathological changes in lungs of mice with ARDS assayed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining indicated severer destruction of alveoli and inflammation in Phenylalanine group than that in PBS group (Fig. 5e) .

Striking difference in the metabolomic profile was also noticed between the survivors and the non-survivors of this disease. By metabolomics analysis, we uncovered metabolites differences as well as the altered pathways that attributed to the mortality of ARDS patients. Of note, we showed that the level of Phenylalanine increased in the non-survivors compared to the survivors and we confirmed using a mouse model that Phenylalanine administration increased the lung injury and mortality of mice with ARDS. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid required for biosynthesis of neurotransmitters [12] . The high serum Phenylalanine is neurotoxic, producing intellectual disability, and other neurologic features [13] . Recently, the role of Phenylalanine in acute inflammatory diseases has been increasingly investigated. It was found that the serum Phenylalanine increased in patients post trauma or with sepsis [14] and was associated with the activation of immune response [15, 16] . In a recent study, Shie-Shian Huang and et al. uncovered that high levels of serum Phenylalanine was associated with high mortality risk in patients with severe infection [17] . Consistent with our findings of Phenylalanine, Akhila Viswan and his colleagues reported that the relative concentration of Phenylalanine increased in non-survivors of ARDS patients compared to survivors [4] . Another study also revealed the upregulation of Phenylalanine metabolism in patients with more severe ARDS compared to those with less severity. Although these studies provided supportive evidence of the associations between Phenylalanine and the prognosis of ARDS, it is hard to determine whether the increased Phenylalanine was just a phenotype reflecting the severity or it also played a role in the process of ARDS [3] . Through the injection of Phenylalanine in ARDS mice, our study demonstrated that Phenylalanine played a detrimental role of in ARDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 869, "end": 873, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1137, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1141, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1319, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1529, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1954, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The accumulation of Phenylalanine could be a consequence of reduced activity of Phenylalanine 4hydroxylase (PHA) and its cofactor 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) [18] . These enzymes convert Phenylalanine into tyrosine. To be noted that, in our results, the levels of tyrosine decreased in the non-survivors compared to the survivors of ARDS patients (not a significant difference though), which means the turnover of Phenylalanine into tyrosine in the non-survivors may be impaired. A number of studies have indicated that the deficiency of PHA and BH4 in inflammatory disease may be due to the overwhelming production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [12, 19] . Therefore, it was possible but not conclusive that the increased Phenylalanine in the non-survivors of ARDS was due to the deficiency of PHA and BH4 induced by inflammation. The accumulated Phenylalanine in turn amplified the already existing inflammation. A study found that intraperitoneal injection of Phenylalanine increased IL-2 secretion in early pregnancy mice, which implied that Phenylalanine could sustain T cell proliferation and thereby enhance the adaptive immune in response [20] . More recently, Ming Jiang et.al demonstrated that Phenylalanine enhanced the innate immune response of the host [21] . Multiple immunological processes involving neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells participate in mediating lung tissue injury in ARDS [22] . Thus the activation of immune response by Phenylalanine may exert negative impact on ARDS. Our data showed that Phenylalanine increased the lung injury of mice with ARDS, which we speculated was associated with the role of Phenylalanine in promoting inflammation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 168, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 655, "end": 659, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 660, "end": 663, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1278, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1426, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Phenylacetylglutamine was recently reported to be a gut microbiota generated metabolite fermented from dietary Phenylalanine [23] . The levels of phenylacetylglutamine significantly decreased in human after a 7-day course of oral broad spectrum antibiotics cocktail. Further investigation revealed microbial porA gene in Clostridium facilitated the conversion of Phenylalanine into phenylacetylglutamine [23] . In our study, the levels of phenylacetylglutamine were lower in ARDS than that in controls, which was presumably due to the damage of gut microbiota caused by antibiotics use in ARDS patients. Phenylacetylglutamine was demonstrated to enhance platelet activation-related phenotypes and thrombosis potential in animal models of arterial injury [23] . Pulmonary thrombosis is common in sepsis-induced ARDS shown by human and animal studies [24] . Platelets could promote pulmonary vascular damage in sepsis induced ARDS, thereby aggravating the lung injury [25] . We found the non-survivors of ARDS had higher levels of phenylacetylglutamine than survivors, the mechanisms underlying may be related to the roles of phenylacetylglutamine in modulating platelets and thrombosis. In the last decades, a broad range of drug therapies emerged for improving ARDS, but none showed efficacy in phase II and III trials [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Given the high mortality rate of ARDS, even a small improvement can save many lives. Nutritional input may be a good choice as a new adjuvant strategy for ARDS, since most metabolites can be manipulated by simply controlling the uptake from food.

The color and size of each circle are based on P values and pathway impact values, respectively. The deeper the red of the nod, the more significant alteration of the pathway is observed. Small P value and big pathway impact circles indicate that the pathway is greatly influenced. c The pathways that are altered between ARDS and healthy controls (pink circle) or between survivors and non-survivors (blue circle). The pathways in the cross area were identified in both groups. d Schematic diagram of metabolic pathway networks. The metabolites involved in the selected pathways (P < 0.05,impact factor > 0) altered between the survivors and the non-survivors were marked in different colors. Light blue means those metabolites are not in my data and are used as background for enrichment analysis; red (P < 0.05) and yellow (P > 0.05) means the metabolites are upregulated in the survivors deep green (P < 0.05) and light green (P > 0.05) mean that the metabolites are downregulated in survivors with different levels of significance. The metabolites in the box belong to the same pathway treatment of ARDS but ended up with a negative results, one of the reasons for this could be the failure of identifying specific metabolites in ARDS patients [32] . However, with the development of metabolomics, we are able to screen the most specific metabolites that play a role in ARDS [2] . Our study has revealed that controlling the uptake of Phenylalanine might be a novel strategy for treating ARDS. This would also open new avenues in the control of pathological inflammatory responses. Sufficient (high-dose) protein was suggested to be provided in critically ill patients [33] , nevertheless, eight essential amino acids including Phenylalanine were indispensable The survival rate of ARDS mice (n = 27/group) and Sham mice (n = 5/group) treated with Phenylalanine or PBS. c The levels of Phenylalanine and tyrosine in BALF of sham mice treated with Phenylalanine or PBS (n = 4-5/group). d The protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (n = 3-5 /group). e The white cell counts in BALF (n = 3-5 /group). f The hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung tissue (n = 3-5 /group) Phe = Phenylalanine.
