We examined cases where a word has, in addition to the pronunciation of the word in isolation, a context-specific pronunciation variant that appears only when the following word includes specific sounds. To the extent that the speaker uses the variant specific to the following context, we can infer that the phonological content of the upcoming word is included in the current planning scope. We hypothesize that the time alignment between selection of the phonetic variant in the currently-being-encoded word and retrieval of segmental details of the upcoming word is variable from moment to moment depending on current task demands and the dynamics of lexical access for each word involved. The results showed that the use of a context-sensitive phonetic variant of /t/ (\"flapping\") by English speakers reliably increased under conditions which favor advance planning. Our hypothesis was supported by evidence compatible with its three key predictions: an increase in flapping in phrases with a higher frequency following word, more flapping in a procedure with a response delay relative to a speeded response, and an attenuation of the following word frequency effect with delayed responses. This reveals that within speakers, the degree of advance planning varies continuously from moment to moment, reflecting (in part) the accessibility of form properties of individual words in the utterance.",

When a response delay was imposed-allowing more planning time-there was overall more use of the contextually conditioned variant, but also a significant reduction in the effect of the second word's frequency, suggesting this frequency effect is specifically linked to advance planning of the second word.

In psycholinguistic theories of speech production, word form encoding is typically assumed to require at least two stages: 1 phonological encoding and phonetic encoding. Phonological encoding involves the retrieval of the segmental content associated with selected words, construction of a prosodic frame, and association of segments to positions in the frame (see Goldrick, 2014 , for a review). This frame includes minimally the syllabic level, which is organized into prosodic word groupings (a prosodic word is typically made up of a single content word plus surrounding unstressed function words; Wheeldon & Lahiri, 1997) . Phonetic encoding begins once segments are associated to prosodic positions, then contextual adjustments based on syllable structure and phonological context (e.g., flapping in English) are specified in a phonetic representation (with both discrete and gradient aspects), which in turn serves as the basis for articulatory processing (see Buchwald, 2014 , for a review).",

One source of evidence comes from the contextual adjustments implemented during word form encoding, since the adjustments are often influenced by the phonology of surrounding words. For example, in many varieties of English, the final /t/ sound in the word write is pronounced with a shorter, voiced articulation called flap [R] when it is followed by a vowel, as in wri[R]a letter, but with an affricate [tS] in wri [tS] you a letter (De Jong, 1998) . Since these variants are only used in those specific phonologically defined contexts (i.e., followed by a vowel or palatal glide), it must be the case that upcoming words (e.g., a and you in the above examples) have had their word forms activated sufficiently to provide a viable context for the selection of the wri [R] or wri [tS] variants. However, the degree to which 1 It should be noted that research on speech planning is based in large part on speakers of Western European languages. As the comparative work of O'Seaghdha, Chen, and Chen (2010) demonstrates, speech planning may differ substantially for speakers of other languages in ways that are challenging to account for in current speech planning theories. The authors acknowledge that these issues limit the generalizability of the findings reviewed here, and that the same caveat should be applied to the results of the current study. multiple word forms can or must be planned in advance is a subject of ongoing investigation.",

Damian and Dumay (2009) used repetition priming to probe the timing of noun's phonological processing in adjective-noun phrases. Pictures described via phrases in which words shared a segment were named faster than pictures with descriptions which did not (e.g., green goat named faster than green chair). This implies that the segmental content of the second word is to some degree activated prior to speech onset. The conceptually related phonological consistency paradigm has been used to provide additional evidence that segmental content of multiple words is coactivated prior to speech onset. In this paradigm, researchers measure reaction times for determiner-adjective-noun phrases in which the determiner's pronunciation depends on the sound that follows (e.g., a/an in English). It has been reported that phrases with \"matching\" adjective and noun (e.g., a purple giraffe, cf. a giraffe) have initiation times compared to mismatching phrases like a purple elephant (cf. an elephant) (Spalek, Bock, & Schriefers, 2010) . This phonological consistency effect has been replicated with determiners in other Romance and Germanic languages B\u00fcrki et al., 2014 B\u00fcrki et al., , 2015 B\u00fcrki et al., , 2016 Miozzo & Caramazza, 1999) . This phenomenon suggests that the specification of a determiner's form takes place at a moment when there is substantial co-activation of the segmental content of multiple subsequent words.",

Since the flap variant of /t/ only appears if a vowel follows, its presence serves as a diagnostic for simultaneous encoding of both words in the phrase. We hypothesize that the likelihood of simultaneous word form encoding for any given utterance depends on the joint influence of task demands and the planning load imposed by individual words in the utterance. This predicts that speakers should use fewer flaps in a task which encourages highly incremental planning, and more flaps when the task favors advance planning. We test this prediction across participants by comparing phrases produced in a speeded or delayed response procedure.",

Our experiments test this prediction by pairing adjectives with three nouns of varying lexical frequency, a variable which is well-known to affect reaction times in picture-naming with single words (Oldfield & Wingfield, 1964; Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994) , and is significantly correlated with pre-speech gaze times (Levelt & Meyer, 2000) . Our hypothesis predicts that flapping will be less likely in a phrase with a low frequency noun, e.g., great oyster, compared to a phrase with a high frequency noun, e.g., great artist. The precise locus or loci of lexical frequency effects is still being debated, and it is likely that distinct frequency effects arise at multiple levels of processing, ranging from lexical selection and phonological encoding (Kittredge, Dell, Verkuilen, & Schwartz, 2008) to phonetic encoding (Buchwald, 2014) . What is crucial for the manipulation here is that at least some of these wordfrequency-related delays arise before phonetic encoding of the adjective is complete (and all context-related adjustments to the adjective form have been specified). Because the phonological and/or phonetic properties of lower-frequency words take longer to retrieve/specify than those of high-frequency words, they are less likely to influence phonetic encoding of the adjective.",

There were 30 female, one nonbinary, and 19 male participants. Most participants reported learning English in the United States, one in Australia, and two in India.

The adjectives for the critical items were selected from a range of frequencies, and adjective frequency was included as a covariate in the statistical analysis. Assuming that the retrieval of word forms is initiated sequentially, as suggested by, e.g., Alario, Costa, and Caramazza (2002) and Levelt and Meyer (2000) , the frequency of the adjective would affect how quickly planning of the noun can begin, and potentially modulate whether noun frequency itself could have an effect. The adjectives also varied in length between one and three syllables. Previous work on dual picture naming suggests that the time alignment between initiation of articulation and gaze to the second object, which indexes planning of the second object's name, differs depending on whether the first object name is one or three syllables long (Griffin, 2003; Meyer, Belke, H\u00e4cker, & Mortensen, 2007) . Meyer, Belke, H\u00e4cker, and Mortensen (2007) proposes that this is because when the first word is longer, speakers have additional time during the articulation of the first word to plan the second word. Therefore in our experiments, we might expect that longer adjectives will be more likely to use the flap variant. All nouns were two syllables long, but varied in stress pattern. Nouns with unstressed initial syllables are expected to have higher flapping rates (De Jong, 1998) . Therefore, following a reviewer's suggestion, noun stress was added as a covariate in the statistical model, despite not being included in the pre-registered analysis plan.",

Bar height represents the estimated fixed effect size, and error bars represent 95% confidence intervals based on the subject-level variance of random slope for noun frequency. Individual gray points show subject random slope estimates on a probabilistic phonological pattern in which there is a dependency between two adjacent phonemes belonging to different words, namely /t/-flapping in English. Since the use of a flap variant requires \"look ahead\" to check whether the next word begins with a vowel, the presence of a flap serves as an index advance planning. Our results show that in adjective-noun phrases, the probability of flap use, and therefore the degree of advance planning, is based on word-specific utterance characteristics (lexical frequency) in addition to current task demands. Flapping was more likely to occur when nouns were easier to retrieve (i.e., higher frequency). When a response delay was enforced, more advance planning occurred, diminishing the disadvantage of low frequency nouns and increasing the overall likelihood of flap use.",

Kilbourn-Ceron et al. (2020) investigated flapping in spontaneous speech, and found that higher conditional probability of the upcoming word given the target word (e.g., the probability of artist coming after great) led to increased likelihood of flapping. They did not find any effect of second word frequency, as we did in this study. However, the two measures are highly correlated in spontaneous speech, making it difficult to disentangle their effects. Future work could investigate the effect of conditional probability experimentally, where these two factors can be decorrelated. Our proposal predicts that there should indeed be an effect proportional to the influence of conditional probability on the degree of advance planning. Some preliminary supporting evidence has been found for liaison in French (Wagner, Lachapelle, and Kilbourn-Ceron, 2020) The manipulations in this study targeted individual words (frequency, length) and global task demands (response delays). It is likely that many other factors could affect the degree of advance planning at the word form stage. Even within speech planning, the advance planning of word forms must be bounded by the extent of advance planning at earlier stages, at least according to serial models of speech planning. Future work should investigate whether delays in processing of semantic and grammatical aspects of the utterance have downstream consequences for the extent of advance planning at the word form level.",
