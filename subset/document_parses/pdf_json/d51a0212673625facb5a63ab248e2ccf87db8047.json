The UK heart transplant waiting list population consists of a significant proportion of urgent, inpatient candidates, at risk of clinical deterioration and death, as a result of progression of their underlying pathology. The risk of both acquiring COVID-19 and suffering from the more severe form of the infection is likely to be higher in these patients. With increasing hospital prevalence of COVID-19",

The risk considerations included the urgency of the candidate (and the risk of remaining on the waiting list) and the risk of COVID-19 in the early post-transplant period. Thirty-eight heart transplants were performed in the UK during the early pandemic period, March to May 2020, compared to 41 for the same period of 2019, a reduction in activity of 10%. Trends in donors offered for heart transplantation and heart transplant activity are shown in Figure 1. Activity was distributed across all UK heart transplant centers. Recipient characteristics are shown in Table 4. The proportion of patients transplanted, by urgency, remained unchanged. The 30-day survival for those patients transplanted during the early pandemic period was 92% (76.9-97.3), which compares to 90.0% (75.5-96.1) for the same period of 2019 (P =.7830).",

Where outpatient attendance has continued, measures have been implemented to decrease the number of patients in attendance, to reduce the use of waiting areas and implement social distancing measures. One center reported the use of online video conferencing platforms to conduct recipient follow-up. All centers stated that no changes were made to immunosuppression therapy in long-term heart transplant recipients, who remained well.

            "text": "the experience of other solid-organ transplant programs globally. Donors offered for heart transplantation in the UK during the pandemic were significantly younger and not hypertensive, compared to those offered during the same period of 2019. With this, the number of donors utilized for heart transplant, as a proportion of those offered, increased from 26% March to May 2019 to 35% during the early pandemic period. In pre-pandemic practice, between 2015 and 2018, the UK heart utilization has sat around 19% each year. Heart transplant activity has been well maintained, across all centers, during this early pandemic period, compared to the same period of 2019. Small month-to-month and year-to-year variation in transplant numbers is normally seen, and between 2015 and 2018, on average, 200 heart transplants have been performed per year, or 15 to 20 per month.In survey responses, staff reported confidence, which increased throughout the early pandemic period that where deceased donors were offered for heart transplantation, the risk of COVID-19 in the donor was low. This was facilitated by the development of national policy for donor screening and testing, candidate testing, and donormanagement practice. 11 Potential donors are epidemiologically screened for history of symptoms, positive test or contact with a positive, and/or symptomatic person. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is performed in all donors using nose and throat swab, as well as endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. Potential recipient screening is performed in the same way. Where possible, potential donors are transferred to COVID-light areas within the hospital. COVID-light describes the physical separation of COVID-19-positive and -negative patients within designated areas within hospitals or for an entire hospital, function as an NHS network, 10 and facilitates safe continuation of healthcare service for non-COVID-related disease. As yet, there is no published evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from a donor to a recipient, although the number of transplants performed from COVID-19-positive donors remains low. The first single case report of a COVID-19-positive donor successfully resulting in lung transplantation has been published, 12 and, as the pandemic continues, and the number of people within the general population who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 increases, new questions, including time since exposure and confidence in viral testing, will need to be answered, to ensure safe and on-going utilization of donors. National guidance in the UK will no doubt to evolve as the pandemic continues. Currently donors who have previously tested positive and recovered (with a period of 28 days from full clinical recovery) may be considered for organ donation, with liaison with microbiology/virology. Within all healthcare practice in the UK at this time, concerns regarding a surge in COVID-19 cases, and the subsequent demands on ICU capacity and staff resource, lead to local decision-making surrounding the continuation of non-essential services. This included elective and non-urgent cardiothoracic surgical activity, in line with national guidance for the temporary suspension of non-essential services throughout the NHS. In UK heart transplant practice, a significant proportion of candidates are listed for urgent or superurgent allocation. Over the last 5 years, urgent and super-urgent heart transplant candidates have made up approximately 12% of the total heart transplant waiting list and 70%-80% of the annual heart transplant activity. 13 During the early pandemic period, the proportion of activity represented by recipient urgency has remained unchanged. As the majority of heart transplant activity is performed for candidates in the urgent inpatient allocation category, the balance of risk was shifted in favor of transplantation, to a greater degree than that experienced within some other solid-organ transplant programs, including lung transplantation. In considering the risks to urgent heart transplant candidates of remaining on the waiting list versus transplant during this time, individual clinicians, including those in ICU, were able to make decisions regarding their capacity at the time of organ offering. Transplant clinicians balanced the risks to the candidate of remaining on the waiting list versus nosocomial COVID-19 infection, on an individual candidate basis. This facilitated the continuation of activity and all UK adult heart transplant centers continued activity despite noted variation in the geographic spread of the virus and additional burden on ICU and staff capacity seen in some centers. Pediatric heart transplant activity represents around 30 transplants per year in the UK, or 2.6 transplants per month. During the early pandemic period, heart transplant activity included 10 pediatric recipients over the 3-month period, a borderline significant increase on 2019, and higher than the monthly activity averages over the last 5 years. At the same time, the median age of donors decreased (to 40 years) but there was no change in the proportion of pediatric donors. The apparent driver for the increase in pediatric heart transplant activity was the availability of pediatric units to continue transplantation at a time when adult transplant centers were stretched due to COVID-19 cases. Pediatric heart transplant centers (2 in the UK) were relatively better protected from COVID-19, a combination of prevalence of the disease in the hospital, but also environment, facilities and ability to protect some ICU capacity and working areas from COVID.With the maintained heart transplant activity, there was little change in waiting list outcomes during the early pandemic period.A reduction in the number of long-term bridging mechanical circulatory support devices is noted. The number of new registrations to the waiting list did fall and similar trends, with reduced waiting list additions, have been reported in the USA. 7 Transplant assessment for routine patients was paused during the early pandemic period and, as described in the survey responses, was recommencing in May/June 2020 with reduced capacity, reduced inpatient stay and in some cases, increased use of online platforms, to facilitate social distancing and reduced face-to-face contact. One pediatric heart transplant center reported the positive impact of this",

Continued investment and development in technology to facilitate consultations provide an area for quality improvement.Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 have been reported,6 and concerns that the risk of contracting the disease, and experiencing the more severe form of illness in the immunecompromised recipient population, have been raised. Analysis of COVID-19 in the UK solid-organ recipient population has been published14 and, more specifically, in a small series of heart transplant recipients.15,16 A relatively small number of heart recipients with COVID-19 were reported to UKTR during the study period, and information on patient outcomes is limited. The number of deaths reported here, in the COVID-19 recipient group, is high; however, we use caution in drawing conclusions from this, due to the reliability of reporting patient numbers and outcomes. In addition, the small number of positive recipients may be, in part, due to strict shielding advice given to solid-organ recipients in the UK and there is somepublished evidence of strong adherence to isolation measures for thoracic transplant recipients during the pandemic. 17 . Understanding the risk factors, clinical characteristics and severity of COVID-19 in this patient population are of fundamental importance, but cannot be addressed by this study. Further work is required to better understand COVID-19, clinical course, and management in the solid-organ transplant population.",
