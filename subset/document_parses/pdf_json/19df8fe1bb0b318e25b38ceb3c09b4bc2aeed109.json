FI is associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. We selected these four chronic diseases given their global prevalence and comorbid associations with each other. We evaluated the most recent literature published over the past 5 years and offer strategies for the screening of FI. Recent Findings Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses report an association between FI and obesity in adult women as well as adult men and women living in low-and middle-income countries. Gender differences also were observed between FI and type 2 diabetes, such that adult women showed an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. This association was influenced by social determinants of health. Very low food security (i.e., high FI) was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and a higher risk for cardiovascular disease mortality. Finally, several studies showed an association between FI and adverse mental health outcomes, including increased risk for stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation. Summary FI and its negative association with body weight, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health provide a compelling rationale for identification of FI in clinical settings. Brief, well-validated screening measures are available in multiple languages. Despite the need for FI screening, many guidelines do not address its implementation. For this reason, more research and targeted interventions are needed to increase FI screening rates and close the loop in the coordination of resources.",

Conversely, Rasmusson and colleagues [39] found people with low and very low FI had increased odds for obesity as well as binge-eating disorder. Irregular eating patterns may explain the mechanism through which FI and overweight/ obesity are associated. Specifically, people in food insecure households may experience periods of deprivation and/or underconsumption of food as well as periods of overconsumption to compensate for those periods when resources were limited [40] . Similarly, Nettle and colleagues proposed an evolutionary adaptive strategy they called the \"insurance hypothesis\" where the body stores additional fat during times of limited access to a stable food supply [41] . Further, Seligman and colleagues [42] suggest the \"substitution\" effect wherein higher-quality, less calorie dense foods are substituted for lower-quality, more calorie dense foods because they are cheaper and have a longer shelf-life. A combination of these theories and effects likely explain the relationship between FI and body weight. More well-designed longitudinal studies are necessary to determine temporal relationships between FI and One to two reported problems with food access. Most common problem is anxiety over food sufficiency or shortage of food in the house.

Recent research by Strings and colleagues [44] observed gender and racial differences in FI and type 2 diabetes using the California Health Interview Survey dataset. They found an association between FI and increased risk for type 2 diabetes in Latinx women and White men and women, but not Latinx men or African American/ Black men and women [44] . This finding lends support to prior research that suggested gender and race moderated the relationship between FI and type 2 diabetes [25, 28] . Another study by Schroeder and colleagues [45] documented differences in gender and race as well as comorbidity status and socioeconomic characteristics. Specifically, they found adults with type 2 diabetes identifying as women, minorities, single, current smokers, with multiple comorbidities, and/or a lower education level were more likely to experience FI [45] . Importantly, more research is needed to understand these observed differences by gender, race, and socioeconomic status in order to identify the root causes of these health disparities. FI negatively impacts type 2 diabetes outcomes, psychosocial well-being, and health expenditures. Schroeder and colleagues [45] showed FI in adults with type 2 diabetes increased the odds of emergency department visits (OR=1.40, 95% CI: 1. 15 [47] measured biomarkers of inflammation and stress to examine the association between FI and insulin resistance. They found that FI was associated with elevated insulin resistance and that this association was partially mediated by inflammation (i.e., cortisol) and stress hormones (i.e., hsCRP) [47] . In sum, the evidence establishing an association between FI and type 2 diabetes is considerable; however, a common limitation of this research is the use of cross-sectional study designs. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm causal associations between FI and type 2 diabetes and to identify potential mechanisms in this pathway to target areas for intervention.",

When controlling for pre-existing CVD conditions (e.g., myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure), FI had an independent effect on CVD mortality, thereby demonstrating FI's importance in determining risk profiles for CVD mortality [51] . While most studies centered on FI and the risk of CVD, Charkhchi and colleagues [52] used the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to establish a reverse relationship between CVD and increased odds of FI (OR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.73).

            "text": "The need to screen for FI in a healthcare setting has been recognized for more than 20 years, with the first such recommendation from the Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [61] . Specifically, ACOG recommended that obstetricians and gynecologists inquire about and document a patient's access to food and safe drinking water, in addition to other social determinants of health, to improve patient-centered care and decrease inequities in reproductive healthcare [61] . While initial FI screening recommendations focused on the psychosocial issues facing pregnant women, widespread attention to address social determinants of health across all population groups [62, 63] has led many organizations to incorporate FI screening in their recommended guidelines across the lifespan, from children [64] [65] [66] [67] to older adults [68] . Further, federal resources in the USA have expanded to include FI screening tools and resources among Medicare and Medicaid recipients [69] and families with children [70] . Recently, one of the five goals of US Healthy People 2030 focused on social determinants of health, with a specific community objective aimed at reducing household FI [71] . In addition to social determinants of health, FI screening is important because FI can mask underlying health conditions [72] , lead to medical misdiagnoses [72] , decrease medication adherence in chronic disease management [73] , increase emergency department use [74] , prolong hospital stays [74] , and increase healthcare expenditures [75] . Thus, the reasons for incorporating FI screening into a medical visit are numerous. The following sections address the challenges noted by clinicians in screening for FI as well as opportunities to provides resources and support for those who screen positive.",

            "text": "Despite the recognized need and interest in addressing FI as part of the clinical experience, most guidelines do not address implementation or impact [76] . A 2019 systematic review by De Marchis and colleagues [77] yielded only 25 peerreviewed articles on FI screening, acceptability, and implementation in a healthcare setting, most conducted in pediatric settings and all within the USA [77] . While physician acceptability of FI screening was found to be quite high, 85-90% [78, 79] , physicians noted time burden as a key barrier to incorporating screening practices within the medical encounter [77] . In addition to time constraints and lack of guidance on the optimal staffing resources to dedicate to FI screening [69, 77, 80] , physicians also experienced a fear of \"not having the answers\" if a patient disclosed FI in the appointment [81] . Specifically, there was a disconnect in the acknowledgement of FI and the knowledge of resources and community organizations that offer programs and services to address FI [69, 81] . A recent study by Runkle and Nelson in 2021 [81] found family medicine and pediatric physicians expressed concern over the stigma associated with discussing FI in the clinic; however, another study by Kopparapu and colleagues in 2020 [82] showed that 83.9% of primary care patients stated that asking about FI was important and 82.7% felt it demonstrated that the clinic cared about their well-being. Another important consideration is a patient's preferences for FI screening. Kopparapu and colleagues [82] also identified that primary care patients preferred having a nurse ask the screening questions, and Palakshappa and colleagues [83] found that patients preferred a written questionnaire versus a face-to-face screening method [82, 83] . These challenges represent opportunities for future research to design interventions that target FI training, screening uptake, and closed-loop referral management with tracking of local resources Considering these challenges to FI screening, several nonprofit organizations have developed recommendations for screening in a clinical setting [72, [84] [85] [86] . Collectively, these recommendations endorse universal screening using the 2item FI screen [87] to ensure that no patients who are food insecure are missed [72, [84] [85] [86] (see Table 2 , a list of brief validated FI screening tools with language translations). If practices do not want to incorporate universal screening, key populations to screen include young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, older adults, and individuals with diet-related chronic diseases [86] . These documents recommend including the FI screen on the EMR home page to remind clinicians and staff to ask the questions as well as to log the responses from each patient. These recommendations advocate that all clinical staff are trained in FI screening as well as how to respond to a positive screen. The decision for who screens patients is made by individual practices and healthcare systems. For patients who screen positive, these organizations recommend a variety of resources, including written materials with local nutrition resources, referrals to community-based organizations, active referrals and warm handoffs to community-based organizations, vitamin supplementation, and on-site food assistance with emergency food boxes and access to a food pantry. Also, clinical staff buy-in is critical to guarantee the success of FI screening and resource support. Further, maintaining a patient's dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the screening process is of utmost importance.",

Previously, she applied for a medical card three times and was denied each time. She also mentioned she did not have a support system to help her with these issues. Based on the positive screen, her diabetologist referred her to the local diabetes patient navigator. The role of a patient navigator is to help patients overcome barriers and help them navigate the health care system. The patient navigator was available to all providers in the county via a federally funded initiative to support chronic disease management in rural regions in the US. The patient navigator met with her multiple times and identified Ms. H's most emergent needs. The navigator was able to increase her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; federal nutrition assistance program) benefits from $16/month to $169/month. In addition, the navigator enrolled her in the Social Security Extra Help program that provided Medicare Part D coverage at no cost. Now, Ms. H's monthly medications cost $7 each saving her $800 a month. Finally, the navigator worked with three different agencies to grant Ms. H a 100% discount on medical bills saving her $300. Over the next three months, Ms. H increased her physical activity, lowered her Hemoglobin A 1c by 0.4%, decreased her triglycerides, and improved her total cholesterol.",

            "text": "While language guidelines have been developed surrounding stigma related to other conditions (i.e., obesity, diabetes, substance abuse, mental health), we did not find such guidelines specific for talking to patients about FI. As a starting point, clinicians may consider using language suggestions for people with obesity, diabetes, or other health conditions when communicating with patients experiencing FI. For example, Pont and colleagues [95] recommend nonbiased behaviors and language to reduce weight-related stigma. These recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatricians and The Obesity Society recommend peoplefirst language such as referring to a \"person with obesity\" instead of saying an \"obese patient\" [95] . In recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and Association of Diabetes Education and Care Specialists, Dickinson and colleagues [96] recommend the five following language recommendations to minimize diabetes stigma: [1] use nonjudgmental, fact-based language; [2] use stigma-free language; [3] use inclusive, strengths-based language; [4] use collaborative Dedicate on-site staff Consider having a champion staff member to help patients navigate referrals to resources and manage relationships with community organizations language; and [5] use person-centered language [96] . When applying these concepts to FI, clinicians should avoid using stereotypes around people who receive food assistance benefits or labeling individuals who are food insecure. Clinicians can focus on patient strengths surrounding how they are approaching their FI or health conditions and ask questions to gain cooperation as opposed to telling patients what they should or should not do or labeling a choice as good or bad. In summary, the links between FI and adverse health outcomes are well-established. Screening in healthcare settings is instrumental in the fight to reduce FI and improve cardiovascular and mental health outcomes. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FI accentuate the need for this to be addressed. Local contexts and resources need to be considered in this implementation. Clinicians need not only guidance on the process of implementation but also on how to best address the topic with patients experiencing FI to avoid reinforcing or introducing stigma associated with the experience of not being able to access or provide sufficient food.",
