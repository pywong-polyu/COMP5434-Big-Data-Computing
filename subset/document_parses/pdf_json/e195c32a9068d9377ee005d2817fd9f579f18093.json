CHARM2 (counseling Husbands and wives to Achieve Reproductive Health and Marital Equity) builds upon a prior three-session male engagement intervention by integrating female-focused sessions emphasizing women's choice and agency (i.e., gender synchronization). We hypothesized that CHARM2 participants will be more likely to report marital contraceptive use and communication and women's contraceptive agency, and less likely to report unintended pregnancy, relative to participants in the control condition.",

We assigned all participants within that geographic cluster to the corresponding cluster treatment condition; participants, investigators, and study staff were not masked to treatment assignment. Eligibility criteria included wife aged 18\u221229, couple residing together for at least six months with no plan for migration, and neither spouse sterilized or infertile. The CHARM2 intervention included five provider-delivered sessions on gender equity and family planning, two delivered in parallel to husbands and wives separately by gender-matched providers, and one final joint session, delivered within the four months subsequent to baseline survey. We conducted surveys and pregnancy testing at baseline and 9-month and 18-month follow-up. We used difference-in-differences multilevel mixed effects logistic regressions to assess CHARM2 effects on marital contraceptive use and communication, and women's contraceptive agency; we used single time point mixed effects logistic regressions for pregnancy outcomes. All analyses used an intention-to-treat approach.",

Prior research from India involved evaluation of such an approach, the CHARM (counseling Husbands to Achieve Reproductive health and Marital equity) intervention, a three-session gender equity and family planning (GE+FP) counseling intervention delivered by male health care providers to married men, both alone and with their wives. CHARM session attendance by men was high (91%), and a randomized controlled trial evaluating CHARM found significant impacts on contraceptive use and men's gender role ideologies over an 18-month follow-up period. 8, 9 However, despite the effectiveness of the intervention, and high male participation, impact on contraception was largely limited to condoms, and only half of women participated in couple sessions. 8 Inadequate focus on women may have impeded their participation and uptake of female-controlled reversible contraceptive methods. Further, low engagement of women in an FP program can impede women's reproductive agency.",

            "text": "Building upon this work, we developed the gendersynchronized CHARM2 (counseling Husbands and wives to Achieve Reproductive health and Marital equity) intervention. CHARM2 is a five session GE+FP counseling intervention, which added two female-only sessions (delivered by female health providers) in parallel with the two male-only sessions provided in the original CHARM intervention, followed by a joint session for the couples. 10 CHARM2 built upon the original CHARM intervention by offering a broader array of contraceptives (e.g., intrauterine devices (IUDs), and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)) directly to women by a gender-matched provider across the multiple sessions. We use a person-centered care approach, a proven model that places women at the center of FP decision-making, relative to the provider and the male partner. 11\u221215 This approach, which borrowed from prior reproductive coercion-focused clinical interventions with women, 16, 17 was designed to ensure that the intervention did not just emphasize male engagement but also female reproductive agency. 4 The CHARM2 model is a briefer intervention than most evaluated interventions with demonstrated effectiveness in reproductive and sexual health outcomes in low and middle income countries (LMICs), which tend to be community-based rather than provider-delivered, and are ongoing via mass media or groups rather than individual or couple focused care. 18, 19 We found couplelevel interventions lacking in the literature. The local provider-delivered CHARM2 model offers only three required points of contact for men and women, respectively, with the last point of contact for the couple jointly. This approach allows for a more personally tailored approach and greater ease for participation, given the localized access combined with low required number of contacts. Fewer contact requirements can facilitate uptake and scale of this intervention. This approach requires more contact that the World Health Organization-recommended brief intervention approach, which involves one session for less than 60 min, 20,21 but a one-session intervention would be difficult to carry out with coverage of sensitive gender equity issues, such as son preference and intimate partner violence (IPV), in conjunction with FP counseling. Nonetheless, our approach included strategies used in brief sexual and reproductive health interventions with proven effectiveness, including education on social and health consequences, behavioral demonstration and feedback, and use of a credible source. 22 ",

The complete study protocol is published elsewhere and included as an appendix (see Supplemental Document 1). 10 Briefly, married couples were recruited from households in the rural Pune district of Maharashtra, India. The study area was selected due to lower than state-level modern spacing contraceptive use and higher male to female sex ratio (indicating strong son preference). 10 We collected data from couples at three time points: baseline (September 2018\u2212June 2019), nine-month (July 2019\u2212March 2020), and 18-month (June-December 2020) follow-up.

            "text": "The Indian government has a long-standing public FP program, dating back to 1952. 23 They continue to renew their commitments to this issue, with a US$2 billion commitment to expand contraceptive options and FP counseling availability in 2012, and establishment of the Mission Parivar Vikas Programme in 2016 with additional funds and support to improve these same services in high fertility districts in seven states (not including Maharashtra). 24, 25 Analysis of funding distribution indicates that more than two-thirds of this funding went to support services and incentives for female sterilization. 25 Hence, while the Government of India covers IUDs, OCPs, condoms, and male sterilization, as well as injectable contraceptives in some contexts, 23 these continue to receive less focus and support from the public health system. 25 As part of the country's 2012 commitments to improved contraceptive access, 24 the government of India revised their guidelines for SCs to support rural areas across India. Each SC serves a population of 3000 \u22125000, depending on the terrain for ease of outreach, and each must include at least one female auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) (preferably two) and one male health worker. SCs provide contraceptives and FP counseling within villages, and support accredited social health activists (ASHAs) to provide contraceptives and FP counseling as well. 26 Per policy, community-based as well as SC-based clinical efforts should include education and motivation on contraceptives and the social and health benefits of FP, as well as maintaining supply and provision of condoms, OCPs, emergency contraceptives, and IUDs. 26 SC facilities must have all necessary materials and conditions for IUD insertion, including a trained ANM. ANMs also offer counseling and referral for safe abortion services and follow-up for any complications from abortion, 26 and they also maintain records of households regarding reproductive, maternal, and child health needs, including information regarding contraceptive practices of married household members. They outreach to couples as well as women to support contraceptive uptake and provide follow-up for contraceptive acceptors to address any side effects or concerns related to continuation of contraceptive use. 26 The public health system trains ANMs and ASHAs in FP counseling and monitors their provision of services and quality of care. 26 The State Government of Maharashtra additionally has two gender equity schemes to reduce son preference. 27 The Majhi Kanya Bhagyashree provides payment of IRs.50,000 (approximately US$715) toward one girl child and IRs.25,000 (approximately US$360) for each of two girls. The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme supports community engagement to build norms and practices that improve the value of the girl child. While there is not clarity on the effectiveness of these schemes, their existence does indicate a policy environment supportive of shifts on the issue of son preference, an issue known to affect contraceptive use in India. 25, 28, 29 Intervention The CHARM2 intervention involves five sessions of FP +GE counseling delivered over four to six months, with one month between sessions. Two sessions were delivered separately to husbands and wives (i.e., gender-synchronized) by gender-matched health providers, and a final session for couples provided by either the male or female provider who delivered the individual sessions for either spouse, based on availability or participants' preference. Providers included the ANM attached to the SC as well as local private health providers of both genders, both allopathic and non-allopathic (ayurvedic and Articles homeopathic) doctors. CHARM2 providers, including ANMs and physicians, received a two-day training on gender equity issues, person-centered FP, and the CHARM2 intervention in addition to receipt of standard government FP training. The public health system provided training on IUD insertion to all ANMs in the CHARM2 program, and they made available their IUD insertion training available for allopathic physicians providing CHARM2. We gave all providers in the intervention clusters a visual flip chart covering the themes of CHARM2 content as well as cards with FP methods to facilitate counseling sessions inclusive of contraceptive choice.",

If the women preferred an IUD and there was no trained provider available, the provider scheduled a follow up visit with a trained provider for this service. While we hoped to provide CHARM2 to women through ANMs within the public health system and at the cluster-based SCs, in practice, we often found ANM vacancies at SCs. In these cases, ANMs from other SCs offered coverage. (See Supplemental Document 2.) This offered inconsistent coverage, so trained private and public female physicians provided CHARM2 to women in these clusters.",

            "text": "We find that the CHARM2 intervention had a significant impact on modern contraceptive use at nine months, largely in the form of increased condom use, but this impact dissipated by the 18-month follow-up. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, particularly given that data collection at 18-months occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, when access to the public health system, including some FP services, may have been constrained due to state-wide shutdowns and public health resources re-focused on COVID-19. Additional data collection is likely required to assess longer-term impacts of the intervention, as well as potential impediments to impact attributable to the pandemic, though safety measures such as phone interviews may be required due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic. The emphasis on condom use among CHARM2 participants may be, at least in part, because of our focus on male engagement, but also because this remains the most common method of reversible contraception in the country and state, as was noted in our original CHARM intervention study. 8 This has been seen in a number of other male engagement-focused FP evaluation studies, as well. 30 We found significant effects of the CHARM2 intervention on contraceptive communication at nine-month and 18-month follow-ups, as was seen in our original CHARM study, as well as sustained effects on women's agency in terms of self-efficacy related to both contraceptive use and contraceptive communication. However, we did not see sustained intervention effect on women's perceptions that they had an equal right as their husband to decide what contraceptive to use, which was seen at 9-month follow-up but lost at 18- month follow-up. This loss of effect, which corresponds with loss of effect on contraceptive use, may indicate need for booster session to sustain intervention effects; prior research shows that FP interventions likely require booster sessions for sustained impact. 18 Loss of effect on women's perception of their equal right in contraceptive decision-making may also be due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in gender regressive practices in households, reinforcing male dominance and authority, 31 as well as impeding mobility and contraceptive access for women. 31, 32 With regard to women's perceptions that they could use contraception even if their husband did not want to, findings are more complex. We saw no intervention effect and in fact, we found a steady decline in women's reports of this form of agency over time, from 44% at baseline to 22% at 18-month followup for sample as a whole (Appendix Table 2 ). Possibly, male engagement itself, in the study and program, may affect a woman's ability to use contraception independently of their husband, even while it increases her involvement and support from him for contraceptive use and FP. Taken together, these findings suggest that male engagement efforts may be more easily achieved and sustained than are women's agency impacts for these types of GE interventions. Further data is needed to understand how to create and sustain gendered impacts in gender-synchronized FP interventions with regard to women's contraceptive behaviors independent of their male partners. The paucity of FP interventions that include evaluation of effects on female agency outcomes hinders understanding of these issues, but this work offers some insight, which can be built upon in future research. We found that approximately half of all participants, regardless of group, were pregnant at some point over our 18-month follow-up period. This is unsurprising given that our sample is young couples and there are strong pro-fertility norms in this context. Importantly, about one-quarter of these pregnancies were unintended, where women reported that they did not want the pregnancy then or wanted no more pregnancies at all; we found no significant difference in this outcome by treatment group (Appendix Table 4 ). However, when we further assessed the pregnancies in the follow-up period based on baseline report of whether they wanted no more children, another child, or were unsure, we found a marginal difference by treatment status among the subsample of participants who were unsure and subsequently had a pregnancy in the follow-up period (47% of control vs 19% of intervention participants; p = 0\u00a207) (Appendix Table 5 ). These findings suggest that while the intervention was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in unintended pregnancy overall, it did potentially affect likelihood of pregnancy among those who were uncertain of their fertility goals at baseline. Ultimately, these findings relied on a small number of observations and should be interpreted with caution, but these exploratory findings support future research to better understand pregnancy intention and ambivalence in FP interventions.",

            "text": "Because we embedded the CHARM2 intervention into the local health system, training and overseeing local providers to deliver the gender equity and FP intervention to couples, findings from this study not only show intervention effects but also the capacity for local providers to deliver the intervention. We found that participants enjoy and, largely, complete all program sessions. These findings support sustainability and scale-up of the CHARM2 intervention. Further indicating support for scale up are responses from key stakeholders in the community, including leadership in the health system and community leaders, as seen from our report on stakeholder interviews and mapping of local providers. (See Supplemental Document 2). These providers and stakeholders indicated that the local system and communities could manage the program and that they believe it should be continued. An additional important finding for scale up is that the intervention likely requires a context with competent and available private providers, particularly given vacancies in the public health system, but these providers can include allopathic as well as non-allopathic practitioners. However, regardless of type of provider and whether they are private or public providers, they must be well trained, have clear values regarding women's agency in FP and gender equity, and provide high-quality care, as recommended from prior research. 14 Further examination of data from CHARM2 should assess the provider-client counseling relationship, given the importance of these issues, and given that too few FP evaluation studies from LMICs include data on counseling interactions. 33 The CHARM2 model advances the state of the field, which has largely seen effective FP interventions focus solely on women and unmarried adolescents, rather than couples and men, and measure contraceptive use but not women's contraceptive agency as outcomes. 18, 19 Focus on men and couples remains under-researched and underutilized at scale, despite decades of calls for male engagement in FP. 34 Prior FP interventions with men are largely community-based, much lengthier, and do not include female partners, 18, 19, 34 where the briefer CHARM2 model builds on the health system, facilitating implementation at scale. Further, while previously evaluated male engagement FP interventions include gender equity issues, such as IPV and son preference, they typically do not include feminist theory and female partners, impeding a womancentered focus on FP with male engagement. 35 CHARM2 provides woman-centered care as part of gender-synchronized counseling for couples, personalized risk assessment, and ease of implementation. It uses key elements of proven FP interventions, including education on social and health consequences, behavioral demonstration and feedback, and use of a credible source, 22 as well as social and behavioral change approaches proven to affect key gender equity issues in India, such as IPV and son preference and couple communication. 25, 29 These findings extend on prior research documenting the value of Prachar, a more intensive gender synchronized family intervention for young couples in Bihar, India, 36 and our original CHARM FP intervention, which was also brief and able to engage husbands in rural Maharashtra, 8 highlighting CHARM2 as brief and effective with couples. Findings should be considered in context of study limitations. Outcomes were largely reliant on self-report and collected by interview, and are, therefore, vulnerable to recall and social desirability biases. We found slight but statistically significant differences between treatment groups at baseline in terms of religion and residence with motherin-law despite randomization. Additionally, while study retention was high, there were some small differences between participants retained and not retained in the study over time. We conducted the study in a single rural district in India among non-sterilized and married women, limiting generalizability. Finally, data collection at follow-up encompassed the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown periods in India, and the pandemic may have affected access to contraceptives as well as women's agency, 37,38 potentially affecting our study outcomes at 18-month follow-up. Longer-term follow-up after the pandemic will offer greater insight into potential sustained intervention effects.",

Over time, there was a loss of effects in contraceptive use and agency, but not male participation. These losses in impact over time may be, at least in part, due to the COVID-pandemic; the pandemic may have affected access to modern contraceptives and women's autonomy generally in the country. 37, 38 Nonetheless, these findings offer an important contribution to the field highlighting the value of GE focused interventions that increase male engagement and partner communication in FP while simultaneously supporting women's reproductive agency. At the same time, the study reveals that FP intervention effects on women's agency may be more tenuous than effects on male engagement, and thus may require greater support over time, such as booster sessions, for sustained impact. Findings also suggest the potential value of GE+FP interventions to support planned pregnancies among women who are undecided about their fertility goals. Overall, these findings suggest the value of gender synchronized GE+FP interventions but highlight those effects can be tenuous in the context of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",
