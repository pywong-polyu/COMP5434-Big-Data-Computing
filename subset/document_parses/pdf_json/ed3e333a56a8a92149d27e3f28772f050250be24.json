            "text": "There are thousands of flights carrying millions of passengers each day, having three or more Internet-connected devices with them on average. Usually, onboard devices remain idle for most of the journey (which can be of several hours), therefore, we can tap on their underutilized potential. Although these devices are generally becoming more and more resourceful, for complex services (such as related to machine learning, augmented/virtual reality, smart healthcare, and so on) those devices do not suffice standalone. This makes a case for multi-device resource aggregation such as through femto-cloud. As our first contribution, we present the utility of femto-cloud for aerial users. But for that sake, a reliable and faster Internet is required (to access online services or cloud resources), which is currently not the case with satellite-based Internet. That is the second challenge we try to address in our paper, by presenting an adaptive beamforming-based solution for aerial Internet provisioning. However, on average, most of the flight path is above waters. Given that, we propose that beamforming transceivers can be docked on stationery ships deployed in the vast waters (such as the ocean). Nevertheless, certain services would be delay-sensitive, and accessing their on-ground servers or cloud may not be feasible (in terms of delay). Similarly, certain complex services may require resources in addition to the flight-local femto-cloud. That is the third challenge we try to tackle in this paper, by proposing that the traditional fog computing (which is a cloud-like but localized pool of resources) can also be extended to the waters on the ships harboring beamforming transceivers. We name it Floating Fog. In addition to that, Floating Fog will enable several new services such as live black-box. We also present a cost and bandwidth analysis to highlight the potentials of Floating Fog. Lastly, we identify some challenges to tackle the successful deployment of Floating Fog.",

Moreover, most of the flights fly over the oceans because most of the Earth consists of water. Along with other busy routes over the oceans, the route between Europe and America [North Atlantic Corridor (NAC)] is one of the busiest routes in the world.

Currently, in commercial airlines, the airborne Internet provided to areal users does not satisfy areal users' applications and services due to high cost, low bandwidth, and other restrictions, etc. Furthermore, if cloud access is required (for example, for cloud services such as task offloading), it can only be obtained via satellite-based Internet. However, given the vast distance between a satellite and an aircraft (almost 36,000 km), the average end-to-end latency is around 600 ms [50] . Such a delay is only suitable for non-real-time applications like web browsing, and modern resource-rich devices are unable to conduct any complex delay-sensitive tasks. As the first major contribution of this paper, we suggest aerial Internet provision using adaptive beamforming technology. Traditional beamforming sends focused signals to the receiving equipment (in this case, an airplane), allowing for faster and more reliable communication [33] . Adaptive beamforming, on the other hand, can dynamically steer a radio beam toward a specific user to maximise array gain to reduce inter-cell interference and extend network coverage [11] . As a result, cloud access would be substantially faster, because of a far more consistent and high-bandwidth Internet. That would, however, only be true until an airplane is above the earth.",

When we extend the cloud to a localized pool of resources (computation, storage, memory, applications, data), it becomes fog computing [3] . Since fog is localized, it can be strategically extended, along with transceivers, to waters (e.g., ocean) through stationed ships (we term it Floating Fog). This serves two purposes. First, the required stable and faster Internet can be seamlessly provided (through adaptive beamforming) to the aerial users, regardless of where the plane is flying above the ocean. Second, through fog computing, the necessary resource pool would be available throughout the aerial commute for the sake of task/data offloading-enabling complex services [3] . Fog nodes can be docked on a ship and deployed in the waters (such as an ocean). The backbone connectivity can be provided directly through marine cables. The average distance between a Floating Fog and an aerial user (35,000 ft.) would be much less than that of a satellite (36,000 km) [33] . Hence, latency can be reduced significantly, to serve delay-sensitive applications as well.",

Aircraft's black-box feed can be communicated to Floating Fog in at least near real-time, eliminating the dependency of searching for the black-box in the case of an unfortunate event of an air crash [19] . Similarly, opportunistic computing such as opportunistic healthcare can be enabled. We shed more light on this in Sect. 2. We then provide a detailed technical architecture of Floating Fog, along with its deployment and communications (Sect. 3). To assess the feasibility of our proposed Floating Fog, we go into the details of cost and bandwidth analyses, as well as the role of femto-cloud, in Sect. 4. Later in the article, we present some key challenges and future research directions in this domain (Sect. 5).",

            "text": "Due to the global coverage of satellite, it is one of the popular choices for providing Internet to the flights, although much slower. The basic infrastructure of satellitebased Internet provisioning is shown in Fig. 1 . For covering a large geographic area, geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) satellites are usually used to provide Internet. However, due to the huge distance between a flight and a satellite (average 36,000 km) and the four-way handshake mechanism of satellite communication, the average end-toend delay incurred is approximately 600 ms [50] . Four-way handshake, in the current context, is the total delay incurred from request generation of Internet content to the provision of the requested content to the user. This process initiates via a request by user equipment (UE) to satellite, then the satellite requests for the content from Internet service provider (ISP) on the ground, then the ISP sends the required content to satellite, and satellite sends that content to the UE. Usually, a direct satellite-receiver system is deployed on an airplane, along with backchannel communication infrastructure and a network installed in the aircraft. This system provides Internet to passengers through a Wi-Fi connection. If we consider the distance from the ground to satellite as 36,000 km, the one-way propagation delay from the ground to satellite is 120 ms. Hence, the propagation delay in a four-way handshake is 480 ms. Such delay can only allow basic web browsing, and limits modern devices to perform many complex tasks (e.g., remote monitoring through wearable, telemedicine, and online-gaming). This way, the devices remain underutilized throughout the period of commute, which can be up to tens of hours.",

            "text": "Cost is another main concern in satellite-based solutions. For instance, the cost of installing equipment on aircraft to provide satellite-based Internet is almost $500,000 [33] . Due to expensive equipment, uplink/downlink channel cost, and maintenance cost of the satellite, and so on, the data transfer charges in satellite communication are between $300 and $2000 per month [33] . Therefore, commercial flights charge a significant amount for Internet service. For example, British Airways charges \u00a38 per hour from passengers onboard. In addition, airlines providing Internet have several restrictions (e.g., Air China provides in-flight Internet but it is not allowed on smartphones) [12] . Also, different airlines can not provide uninterrupted high-speed Internet throughout the journey. Some notable approaches for providing Internet in an aircraft utilizing satellite links can also be found in the literature. Khan presented a satellite links-based approach, by exploiting the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite, instead of the GEO satellite, which significantly reduces its scalability [22] . Reid et al., also discussed the use of LEO, however, focusing more on using LEO communication for augmenting navigation [39] . Starlink is another Internet provision system exploiting LEO satellite [27] . Although it is relatively better than conventional satellite-based solutions in terms of latency and bandwidth, however, it has several limitations including low coverage and requires a huge number of satellites for decent coverage. Also, it is very costly (i.e., $90 per month) and is functional in some parts of the USA and Canada. Moreover, it is still in experimental stages and expected to gain claimed bandwidth in 2026 (only suitable in dense populations). Volner argued in their work that Internet access in the aircraft and passengers accessing it creates security concerns, nevertheless, safety can be improved by communicating key data to a ground station (GS) [47] .",

Sakhaee and Jamalipour presented an in-flight Internet solution through both satellite and GSs [41] . This scheme uses a cluster of aircraft and a large cache to store recently requested Internet content and share it locally within a cluster through the cluster head. Although the proposed solution prefers GSs for Internet delivery, but as an aircraft flies away from those GSs (installed on a seashore in the Cluster Computing case of flights flying over ocean), it relies on satellite-based links only. Jalali et al., proposed a hybrid approach that exploits both satellite links as well as a ground base station to provide Internet to passengers onboard. This approach gives preference to G2A links, but due to lack of (ground) base stations covering the flying aircraft' range, in most of the cases, the proposed system relies on satellite [20] . Tadayon et al., proposed a solution for providing in-flight Internet through ground cellular base stations. They exploited the long-term evolution (LTE) infrastructure for Internet access [44] . Gupta and Aggarwal presented an Internet provisioning scheme limited to flights flying over the ground [16] . In the proposed solution, authors suggested the idea of providing Internet from GS to the aircraft in its vicinity, which acts as a gateway. That gateway aircraft is responsible for providing Internet to the other aircraft. GoGo Internet has been introduced by AirCel (rebranded as Gogo Business Aviation). Gogo uses ground cellular base stations in the USA to provide Internet to flying aircraft. They adopt the same mechanism of handover that is used in cellular networks on the ground, with certain limitations [31] .",

Moreover, they also lack in terms of reliability and scalability. Similarly, the solutions specifically devised for airborne Internet for flights flying across oceans have their own set of problems. For example, although Reference [28] try to solve the problem of airborne Internet to some extent, through an ad hoc network which is not scalable because in a denser network (during peak hours), the performance degrades significantly and it becomes extremely difficult to provide reliable Internet. Hence, it is not suitable for several applications that require high bandwidth and low latency. Whereas, in Reference [33] , adaptive beamforming is used for LoS communication with high bandwidth, but the issue in this scheme is it's limited scope. Since this solution is only devised for flights flying over the submarine optical fiber cables (within LoS), therefore, it does not provide Internet access to flights flying away from the vicinity of the proposed oceanic BSes.",

Since adaptive beamforming would provide the communication, accompanied fog node on the FS would provide resources for data or task offloading. Fog node can cache content according to the usage pattern (of the aerial users) or importance of particular content. Hence, quick access is provided, ensuring a better quality of service (QoS) and eventually, enhanced quality of experience (QoE). The tasks that are beyond the capacity of UE (or even femtocloud) can be offloaded to fog node (residing on FS). This way, complex services can be created, such as opportunistic healthcare (including air ambulance and telemedicine, for any onboard patient) [1, 26, 45, 49] , augmented reality, and other machine learning-based services. Floating Fog can offer a new set of services as well. With a reliable and high bandwidth on-the-fly Internet availability, an aircraft would be able to transmit critical black-box data to the GS (server), enabling live black-box. It would be very critical in avoiding unexpected situations, and especially, in the case of an unfortunate air crash, it would eliminate the dependency on searching for a lost black-box (historically, which can be very expensive and time taking process) Similarly, cloud can be involved when necessary, such as to access particular data or service, or even more complex tasks, such as deep learning-based .",

Providing bandwidth better than what aerial users currently get (recalling average delay of 600 ms) is not limited to making possible new use-cases (e.g. live black-box). Depriving aerial users of the technologies they make use of on the ground is also a significant under-utilization of human and device's resources, during several hours of commute, which can be greatly minimized.

Given that, the data rate can still be increased either by elevating b or/and increasing the value of SNR. We note here that by increasing frequency band b, the data rate can be increased linearly. Whereas, increasing SNR results in a logarithmic improvement in data rate. SNR can be improved in certain ways such as by reducing path loss, efficient channel estimation, and reducing interference by using better hardware, and so on.

Femto-cloud refers to the combination of resources from edge devices (smartphone, laptop, IoT devices) [32] . Modern devices are equipped with very sophisticated processors (octa-core, 2? GHz) and memory (up to 8 GB). These devices mostly remain idle during flight and are not fully utilized. This is mainly due to the poor (yet expensive) internet. Even though powering the devices is not a problem, as most flights have charging stations. While a better internet (like the one we propose) would allow users in the air to access their preferred applications (e.g. cloudbased services), we can also get more out of these devices and human potential. Access to a cloud would only be necessary if a service is specific to a cloud service provider (e.g. Dropbox, YouTube). Otherwise, the cloud would be expensive [7] and less privacy friendly [2] and can therefore be avoided (especially when it comes to outsourcing various tasks). The combined resources of passengers' devices on board can easily form a micro-data center. If we assume that the average RAM of a smartphone is 2.4 GB [34] and the number of passengers on board is 200 with a processing speed of 2 GHz per mobile device, then the cumulative RAM of all passengers is 480 GB and the cumulative processing power of 400 GHz for the duration of the flight (which can be over 17 h). These statistics show that most high-performance servers cannot have such a large processing power and primary storage. In other words, we can process cloud-like tasks locally on regular smartphones without spending money and without setting up resource-intensive data centers. For example, the above RAM is enough for more than three IBM QRadar SIEM All-in-One Virtual 3199 with 30,000 events/s and 1,000,000 flows/min [10] .",

This is also possible if certain health data is shared among passengers (keeping privacy in mind). Again, it is important to have a femto-cloud on board.",

            "text": "Resource allocation in the case of Floating Fog is different from a regular data-center/fog. This is mainly due to several variables involved in the resource allocation process. First of all, the flights are moving at high speed, hence, determining the required resources could be a complex task. The primary objective of any computing framework is to provide sufficient resources for the tasks offloaded to it. However, that could result in the over-allocation of resources. In that case, resources remain underutilized, which may result in the degradation of the performance of the other tasks or even the entire system. On the other hand, if the fog computing system is unable to provide sufficient resources to accomplish particular offloaded tasks from the end-user, it results in quick redundant and unnecessary offloading. This also degrades the performance of the system and consumes more energy and bandwidth. Therefore, careful allocation of resources by the fog server is of grave importance. Optimal resource allocation allows the prediction and customization of resources alongside managing the resources for highly heterogeneous devices and diversified data [23] . Proper resource allocation policy allows inter-fog server resource synchronization. High definition Telepresence 24 Mbps [14] Tom Raider 29 Mbps [9] Brain to Computer Interface 26 Mbps [29] Cluster Computing Moreover, resource allocation plays a vital role in deciding the execution of the offloaded task locally on the fog server or further offloading to the cloud. With the femto-cloud in our architecture, it would be important to determine the participating devices (because, even though mostly onboard devices would be idle, it does not mean that they would be willing to lend their resources throughout the trip). For that sake, there should be a master fog node onboard that keeps track of participating devices, their contributions, and the incentives for them (e.g., reciprocating task execution).",

This may be possible by enabling realistic and robust inter-fog communication.

Avoiding offloading without any benefit is common in inter-device offloading (i.e., a mobile device does not allow other mobile devices to use its resources through task offloading without any financial benefits). Incentives may be in the form of air miles, shopping discounts, and so on. However, the incentive may not necessarily be monetary but based on a reciprocal computing model. For example, a mobile device m 1 may allow the other device m 2 to offload a task, but in return, m 1 is expecting from m 2 to execute its tasks as well. This incentive-based offloading is one of the most complex challenges in offloading to fog servers as well as inter-device offloading.

The cloud in our analysis consists of a datacenter with a host with the following configuration: Xen as Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), x86 architecture, Linux operating system and a virtual machine (VM) with 2048 MB RAM and a host with 16,384 MB from RAM. In the case of Fog, a data center broker is set up to act as a Fog node and has a VM with 512 MB from RAM. The tasks are executed on this Fog node. Figure 6 shows the application execution feasibility in terms of delay. The figure depicts that most of the applications can only be executed on floating fog due to their delay constraints. As the matter of fact, average delay for cloud computing for aerial users is almost 600 ms. However, there are some application that can afford more delay (for example web-browsing and emails, etc.), such applications can be executed on cloud for load balancing over Floating Fog. Figure 6 summaries that, the delay tolerant applications that can afford the delay of more than 600 ms are forwarded to cloud if, floating fog has significant load. However, applications that has the delay requirement of less than 600 ms, can only be executed on floating fog. In addition the delay tolerant applications are executed on floating fog if the floating fog servers are idle or doing very little execution at that particular time. Figure 8 shows the processing delay (for tasks ranging from 10 to 1000 BI) in milliseconds in the case of clouds and fog. For a 10 BI task (task 1), the delay for cloud is 167 ms. For fog, the delay remained at 10 ms for the same size task. This shows the impact of fog in terms of processing delay compared to the cloud scenario. For a 20 BI task size, the delay is 602 ms for the cloud but 73 ms for the fog. The trend continues up to very large tasks (more than 10,000 BI), as shown in Fig. 9 . Figure 9 shows the results obtained with different task lengths. Even though the fog generally reduces the processing delay significantly, there is a limit to its efficiency, and this limit depends on the length of the task that the fog can handle (i.e., the processing power of the fog). The difference between the processing delay by the cloud and the fog decreases when the size of the tasks increases noticeably. For tasks with 10-1000 BI, the performance of Fog and Cloud shows a similar trend. For tasks larger than 10,000 BI, the delay of Fog is higher than that of Cloud. For a task length of 10,000 BI, the processing delay with Cloud is 83,811 ms and with Fog is 102,293 ms. This shows that based on the processing capacities defined in our setup, Fog has to offload the tasks to Cloud since the tasks are larger than the feasible processing limit of Fog. If Fog is unavoidable even for very large tasks, Fog's capabilities can be improved.",

While in the case of the current satellite-based Internet, the cost of only installing the required equipment could be as much as $500,000.
