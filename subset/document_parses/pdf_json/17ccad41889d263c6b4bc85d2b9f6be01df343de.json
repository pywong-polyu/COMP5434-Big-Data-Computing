During EBV infection, the absolute number of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells increases 5-10-fold in IM patients compared with asymptomatic individuals (17, 18) . Infiltrating EBV-infected CD8+ T-cells and proliferating NK cells lead to hepatic injury and cause hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and other clinical features, palpebral edema is related to the compression of swollen lymph nodes in the neck (Caused by lymphocyte infiltration) that makes lymphatic drainage not smooth (1). The pathogenesis of hepatic injury caused by EBV infection is now inclined to be regarded as an indirect immune injury caused by EBV as an immune initiating factor. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes with CD8+ in the body after EBV infection are the most important effector cell population when the liver is invaded. EBV-infected CD8+ T lymphocytes (19) (20) (21) . Liver biopsy results of IM patients showed significant infiltration of lymphocytes around the portal vein, significant degeneration and necrosis of individual liver cells, and significant Kupffer cell activation (22) . Although hepatic injury is common in EBV infection, fatal liver failure is rare in IM patients, which is in line with our result. Most reported fatal EBV infections are associated with complicated immunodeficiency syndrome (23) .",

There is no significant correlation between EBV-DNA level in peripheral blood and ALT in this study. The mechanism of liver cell damage is mainly mediated by immune mechanisms, not directly caused by EBV (15, 16) . In the host infected with EBV, the immunoactivity is an important determinant of liver damage (18, 28) , which explains why EBV infection has milder symptoms in infants and young children (this period when the body's cellular and humoral immune mechanisms are immature). In children, EBV is mostly asymptomatic, while 50 to 70 percent of adolescents and adults (ages 15-25) seem to have symptoms (29) . Wang et al. reported the levels of atypical lymphocytes and liver enzymes were higher in young adults with infectious mononucleosis than in preschoolers (30) . ALT levels increase with age for 2 reasons: 1) The ability of young children to synthesize IgG, IgA, and other immunoglobulins, as well as the antigen presentation ability of monocytes/macrophages increase with age (31) . Stronger immune responses to EBV infection cause more damage to liver cells. 2) Humoral immunity and cellular immunity play an important role in the process of EBV infection and pathogenesis. After EBV primary infection, it stimulates B lymphocytes to secrete and produce immunoglobulins, triggering humoral immune responses, and the corresponding body is specific for EBV latency antigens Sexually toxic T lymphocytes proliferate in large numbers, followed by an amount of apoptosis. Only a few antigen-specific memory T cells are latent in the body and circulate with the blood for a long time. When EBV proliferates again and produces a large number of specific antigens, the memory T cells can quickly enter the activation State and proliferate in large quantities, resulting in a more rapid and effective immune response (32, 33) .",

In the study of EBV-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), the onset age of secondary HLH caused by infection was lower than that of HLH caused by other causes (34) . Therefore, follow-up should be executed to infants to alert serious complications after being infected with EBV.",

The estimated frequency of splenomegaly in IM ranges from 41 to 61.5% and lasts for \u223c21 days (30, 38, 39) . The positive rate of splenomegaly in this study (68%) was slightly higher, resulting from the splenomegaly in this study being derived from the B-ultrasound examination rather than the doctor's physical examination. Splenomegaly is often difficult to find in physical examinations, so ultrasound examination of splenomegaly often has a higher positive rate (38) . Splenomegaly is caused by the infiltration of lymphocytes in the spleen. The increase in spleen volume is related to the number of B lymphocytes, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells infected by EBV (40) . Therefore, this common pathological mechanism of splenomegaly and hepatic injury supports the relationship between splenomegaly and hepatic injury.",

Secondly, the cases in this study were confined to Anhui Province, and the results could not be representative of China. Therefore, we will verify these results in larger sample sizes and multi-center studies in the future. Thirdly, Although the liver length measured by ultrasound has a moderate correlation with the liver volume (41), hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are clinical entities, defined based on clinical examination. Ultrasound may be useful in determining the nature of the parenchymal presentation, but not reliable in defining neither hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly. To improve accuracy, we will define it based on clinical examination in future studies. Fourth, there is the lack of data about potential correlation of CD8+ lymphocytosis or biomarkers of lymphocyte activation and proliferation as soluble CD25 levels and other inflammatory cytokines. Last but not least, as a case retrospective study, certain important liver function indicators (such as total bilirubin, coagulation function) and immune function index cannot be obtained in the medical records, and cannot be remedied at this stage, unfortunately. In future studies, we will highlight the collection of more comprehensive index of hepatic injury and immune function to better describe the patient's hepatic injury and to establish a more accurate and reliable forecasting model.",
