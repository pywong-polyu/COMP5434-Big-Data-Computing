            "text": "The porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is responsible for significant economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus are major viral contributors to PRDC. Vaccines are cost-effective measures for controlling PRRS, however, their efficacy in the context of coinfections has been poorly investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of PRRSV-2 and swine influenza H3N2 virus co-infection on the efficacy of PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) vaccination, which is widely used in the field. Following simultaneous challenge with contemporary PRRSV-2 and H3N2 field isolates, we found that the protective effect of PRRS MLV vaccination on clinical disease and pathology was abrogated, although viral load was unaffected and antibody responses were enhanced. In contrast, co-infection in non-immunized animals reduced PRRSV-2 viremia and H3N2 virus load in the upper respiratory tract and potentiated T cell responses against both PRRSV-2 and H3N2 in the lung. Further analysis suggested that an upregulation of inhibitory cytokines gene expression in the lungs of vaccinated pigs may have influenced responses to H3N2 and PRRSV-2. These findings provide important insights into the effect of viral co-infections on PRRS vaccine efficacy that may help identify more effective vaccination strategies against PRDC in the field.",

The disease can be subclinical depending on the strain (2, 3) , however typical clinical signs are reproductive failure in sows, respiratory distress and reduction of growth performance in weaned and growing pigs (4) . Mortality can be observed in infected piglets, with rates ranging from 7.5-18.5% (5) and up to 100% with highly pathogenic PRRSV isolates (HP-PRRSV) (6) . The etiologic agents are PRRS viruses (PRRSV), single stranded positive RNA viruses from the Arteriviridae family (7) . The first clinical description of PRRS dates to the late 1980's, with genetically distinct PRRSV isolates described in Europe and North America, which are now recognized as two separate species PRRSV-1 (Betaarterivirus suid 1) and -2 (Betaarterivirus suid 2), respectively (7) . Both species have since spread globally, but PRRSV-1 remains predominant in Europe, while PRRSV-2 predominates in the Americas and Asia. The rapid evolution of PRRSV due to a high mutation rate when replicating its genome, and recombination between strains have resulted in substantial genetic diversity, which poses challenges for the control of PRRS by vaccination (8) .",

Commercially available vaccines include inactivated and live attenuated (also known as modified live virus; MLV) vaccines for both PRRSV-1 and -2 (9) . Although inactivated vaccines are considered safer, MLVs are preferentially used for their higher protective efficacy (8, 10) . Studies have demonstrated an induction of a high level of PRRSV-specific antibodies which is associated with clinical protection against challenge infection with related PRRSV strains (9) , but rather weak T cell responses after MLV immunization (11) . Passive transfer of purified IgG from PRRS-convalescent pigs have suggested that vaccine-induced protection against reproductive failure and vertical transmission in utero is also mediated by antibodies (12, 13) . Since PRRS MLV vaccine-induced antibodies often lack strong virus neutralizing properties in vitro (14) , non-neutralizing antibody functions may also contribute but these remain poorly defined (15) .",

Indeed, respiratory diseases in pigs in the field are often multifactorial, involving mixed infections with different viral and/or bacterial pathogens, defined as the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). PRRSV and swine influenza A virus (swIAV), an enveloped single stranded segmented negative RNA virus within the Orthomyxoviridae family (7) , are important contributors to the PRDC. Primary infection with PRRSV and swIAV leads to pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens, such as Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma hyopneumonia, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica (16) . Previous in vivo PRRSV/ swIAV superinfection studies demonstrated a potentiation of disease compared to single infection (17, 18) . It was recently shown that concomitant swIAV infection modulated the immune response to PRRS MLV vaccination, albeit without impacting efficacy (19) , but it remains unknown whether such viral co-infection interferes with protection conferred by PRRS vaccination.",

Thirty-six, 5-7 weeks-old, Large White-Landrace-Hampshire crossbred female pigs were sourced from a high health status commercial herd and were housed in a high biocontainment facility at The Pirbright Institute. Animals were tested for the absence of exposure to IAV and PRRSV prior to their arrival by serological tests via hemagglutination inhibition test against four standard IAV antigens (pdmH1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and avian-like H1N1 strains), and antibody (Ab) ELISA and RT-PCR tests against PRRSV (Animal and Plant Health Agency, Weybridge, UK).

To determine the viral RNA copies/mL in a sample, an RNA standard was generated. PRRSV-2 RNA was used to amplify cDNA encoding the full-length of N gene by RT-PCR (One-step RT-PCR, QIAGEN) using specific primers with the forward containing a T7 promoter sequence at the 5' end. The PCR product was gel purified (Illustra \u2122 GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit, Merck) and used as template for in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After DNase treatment, the concentration of RNA was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the number of RNA molecules/mL was calculated using Avogadro's number (6.023 \u00d7 10 23 ). The qRT-PCR was performed with 5 \u00b5L of the eluted samples and 15 \u00b5L of the master mix.

A reduction (average 4-fold) of the PRRSV-2 RNA load was observed in the Vac + PRRSV-2 group compared to Ctrl + PRRSV-2 group although the difference was not significant, indicating that intramuscularly administered PRRS MLV may help to limit the viral replication in the lung at 5 dpc.

The increased PRRSV-specific, but lowered H3N2-specific T cell responses in the Vac + PRRSV-2/H3N2 compared to the Ctrl + PRRSV-2/ H3N2 suggest that PRRS MLV may potentially drive the host immune response toward PRRSV-specific, and rather away from the H3N2-specific responses.

            "text": "The PRDC is responsible for major economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. The PRDC commonly results from mixed infections, in combination with environmental stressors (16) . PRRSV and swIAV, alone or in combination, are two major viral pathogens involved in the PRDC, often leading to secondary infections with opportunistic bacteria. Previous experimental in vivo PRRSV/swIAV co-infection studies reported variable outcomes in terms of clinical or virological parameters, which may reflect differences in the timing of infections (18, 45, 46) . Superinfection, i.e., infection of pigs with H1N1 3 days after a primary infection with PRRSV-1 led to more severe disease and a delayed shedding of H1N1 compared to pigs that were infected 14 days later (17) , whereas simultaneous PRRSV-1/H1N1 coinfection did not alter the clinical and virological course of infection of either virus (46) . Several studies have also assessed the effect of concurrent infections and superinfections on vaccines efficacy and demonstrated that PRRSV infection decreases the efficacy of swIAV (47) , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (48) , and classical swine fever (49) vaccines although underlying mechanisms involved have not been demonstrated. Whilst vaccination with PRRS MLV is widely practiced in efforts to control PRRS, swIAV vaccination is less often used. Reflecting the field situation, a recent study experimentally assessed the impact of swIAV superinfection on vaccination with PRRS MLV efficacy and found a delay in MLV replication and Ab responses, but this did not affect vaccine efficacy (19) . In our study here, we investigated the effect of PRRSV-2/H3N2 co-infection on the protection provided by a commercial PRRS MLV vaccine. The PRRS MLV protected against clinical disease, reduced lung pathology and viremia, but not virus shedding, as previously reported (14, (50) (51) (52) . However, PRRSV-2/H3N2 co-infection abrogated the protective effect of PRRS MLV vaccination on clinical disease and pathology. Co-infection did not affect the vaccine-induced reduction in PRRSV-2 load and enhanced CD8 + T cell responses in the lung and Ab responses. In contrast, coinfection in non-immunized animals had a beneficial effect by reducing PRRSV-2 viremia and H3N2 virus loads in BALF and nasal swabs at day 5 post-infection and did not affect clinical signs or pathology.",

However, there was significantly more IL-12p40 gene expression, in the lung, and a trend for higher number of H3N2specific T cell responses (IL-2 + CD4 + , IFN-g + CD8 + , IL-17 + CD2gd and TNF + CD2gd T cells) and PRRSV-2-specific T cell responses (IL-17 + CD2gd T cells TNF + CD2gd T cells) in the BALF of the co-infected unimmunized animals.

In vaccinated pigs, coinfection induced a greater PRRSV-specific TNF + CD8 + T cell response in the BALF and an increased Ab response.

Moreover, PRRS MLV vaccination can induce systemic secretion of IL-10 (61). It is therefore plausible that the vaccine used in our study may exhibit similar immunomodulatory features. We observed that, in comparison to unvaccinated pigs, lungs from vaccinated pigs co-infected with PRRSV-2/H3N2 displayed a lower level of proinflammatory IL-12p40 gene expression, along with a trend for higher expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and TGF-b as measured by qRT-PCR. In a study on Litomosoides sigmodontis helminth infection (61), helminth-infected mice exhibited lower HA-specific antibody responses post-IAV vaccination, linked with a higher viral load in the lung compared to non-infected mice. The level of HA-specific induced by the vaccine was restored after the blockade of IL-10 using an anti-IL-10 receptor mAb. PRRS MLV vaccination may have potentially impaired the host immune response to H3N2 and perhaps facilitated its replication. In addition to the highest lung pathology seen in the PRRS MLV vaccinated co-infected pigs, the beneficial effect of the co-infection in reducing H3N2 viral loads was also abrogated in vaccinated pigs. These data suggests that PRRS MLV may initiate a strong PRRS specific response and may suppress H3N2 specific responses leading to increased pathology and poor disease outcome. However, a group of pigs vaccinated with PRRS MLV and challenged with H3N2 would have confirmed this hypothesis, but this group could not be included due to limited capacity in the animal facility. Another question is whether immunizing pigs against swIAV followed by co-infection with PRRSV and swIAV would result in an increased pathology. SwIAV-immunized pigs exposed to PRRSV prior to swIAV challenge had increased levels of lesions compared those challenged simultaneously with swIAV and PRRSV-2 or swIAV only, indicating decreased swIAV vaccine efficacy (47) . In addition, pigs vaccinated in the presence of PRRSV showed increased clinical disease and shedding of swIAV during the acute phase of swIAV infection. Although no alterations in the systemic or local antibody response to either swIAV vaccination or challenge were observed. Collectively, these observations suggest that PRRSV and swIAV co-infection has an impact on swIAV vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "Whilst confirmatory studies are required, the demonstration that co-infection with H3N2 can abrogate the clinical protective effect of PRRSV MLV suggests that implementation of control measures against swIAV might improve vaccine-induced protection against PRRSV in the field. Large number of herds are endemically infected with swIAV and suffer intermittent bouts of disease. SwIAV contributes to suboptimal weight gain and reproductive performance and is occasionally associated with fever-induced abortion in sows (62) . Immunization can be a cost-effective control measure to combat swIAV, but the rapid evolution of the virus is a major obstacle (63) . Not all swIAV-endemic countries use vaccines to control the disease, for example, current UK policy does not involve immunization against swIAV, although it is used in some European countries and widely in the USA (64) . We have used recent field PRRS and swIAV strains from Thailand. As in the UK, immunization of pigs against swIAV is not mandatory in Thailand, although some farms use the GRIPORK \u00ae vaccine (Hipra, Spain) containing inactivated H1N1 and H3N2 strains. Inactivated vaccines induce neutralizing Ab against the immunizing strain but do not induce sufficient heterologous protection due to the rapid viral escape that occurs through antigenic drift of the surface glycoproteins (65) , so that coincident infection with PRRS and swIAV remains possible. There is a need to develop more broadly protective influenza vaccines that could provide a better control of swIAV, reducing the zoonotic risk (66) , the contribution to the PRDC and its potentially harmful effect on PRRS vaccine efficacy.",
