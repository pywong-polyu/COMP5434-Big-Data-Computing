SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, was declared an international emergency disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) only one month after its existence was known [2, 3] . Although it was not the first disease to be classified by the WHO as an international emergency disease, its appearance was an unprecedented and global milestone worldwide due to the health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic [4] , this has led to a change in certain habits in the child and adolescent population. Some of these modified habits are related to the time dedicated to the practice of daily physical activity as well as the time spent using new technologies [3, 5] .",

Some of these risk factors for serious disease are closely linked to sedentary lifestyles and physical inactivity as well as to the dietary habits of the population. Spain has one of the highest prevalences of childhood overweight and obesity in the European Union, being one of the most important risk factors in the paediatric population [8] . In addition to this risk factor, paediatric COVID-19 patients have unusually low vitamin D levels [9] , which is an essential vitamin for muscle and bone function in relation to physical activity [10] . This is why the school-age population presents values of 85% in girls and 78% in boys that do not perform the minimum minutes of daily physical activity established by the WHO for their age range [11] , a direct consequence of sedentary lifestyles and excessive time spent using technology. If these low levels of physical activity are combined with inadequate eating habits where ultra-processed foods are prevalent, an obesogenic environment is generated in children, which leads to increased rates of overweight and obesity and further accentuates the few minutes a day devoted to physical activity [5, 12] .",

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the impact of the largescale confinement due to SARS-CoV-2 on physical fitness values in the 11-12 year-old population. The relationships between physical fitness values, dietary habits and sociodemographic data (e.g., type of housing, place of residence, time spent in physical activity) were also studied. In this research, the physical fitness values established in the dimensions of musculoskeletal capacity (3 items), motor capacity (1 item) and aerobic capacity (1 item) of the Alpha-Fitness Battery were studied [22] : right hand pressure, left hand pressure, long jump with feet together, 4 \u00d7 10 m agility speed test and the Leger test.",

The use of a validated instrument to assess food consumption, habits and practices in 8-11 year-olds [25] and an ad hoc survey for parents or legal guardians to collect socio-demographic data on the study participants as well as data on the different variables under study were the instruments used to define the independent variables.",

All the results of the fitness variables compared between pre lockdown 2 and post lockdown and shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 have shown significant differences. With the exception of hand pressure of the right hand, which, despite having worsened after lockdown, did not show significant results. According to the reference values of the Helena study [26] , the results of this research show that the mean value of the manual pressure of the pre-lockdown sample was very low in both boys (\u226421.4) and girls (\u226419.9) and with lower values in the post-lockdown. Regarding the long jump, the mean values were low (136-152) for boys and medium (134-147) for girls and were very low (\u2264135) for boys and low (119-133) for girls in the post-lockdown. In the agility speed, the boys had average pre-lockdown results (11.8-12.2), while the girls had high results (11.9-12.4). However, the values of this same test postlockdown have shown low values (12.3-12.9 ) in boys and a clear decrease in the girls results to very low values (\u226521.4). Finally, the results obtained in the aerobic capacity by means of the Leger Test and taking the stages reached as reference values, in the pre-lockdown results the boys obtained average values (5.0-6.0) and the girls very high values (\u22655.0). Furthermore, these results in post-lockdown suffered a worsening in the boys to very low values (\u22643.0) and a notable decrease in the girls to low values (2.5-2.5). These results, both pre-lockdown and post-lockdown, show that the sample started the research in poor physical condition and that this situation was aggravated by the period of lockdown as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2.",

This situation, together with the time spent in other sedentary activities, has become an important determinant of low levels of physical fitness among children, as well as the existence of changes in body parameters, thus favouring the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity [39, 40] . Another important factor for maintaining a good level of physical fitness and favouring the body's recovery processes is rest. The WHO recommends that children of this age should sleep at least 11 h a day, a situation that was not met by any member of the sample in this study.",

This survey is used for the elaboration of the EUROSTAT reports [44] . Both documents also show a parallelism in the characteristics of the sample of this research with the general population of the same age group in relation to the values of physical activity and eating habits. For this reason, and although this limitation means that it is not possible to generalise the results and evidence found, the study provides unique evidence and information. The evidence found goes deeper into results obtained by direct methods that are unlikely to be repeated in similar circumstances. Moreover, this study can become an excellent indicator of the consequences that such measures of social isolation, whether as a consequence of lockdown or any other circumstance, can have on the population of this age group.",

A descriptive and comparative analysis of the results obtained for the different physical condition variables analysed during lockdown are also shown in relation to the time spent by the children in the sample on activities related to the use of new technologies during lockdown. The results show that the children who spent the most time using new technologies were the ones who showed the worst physical fitness values in some variables. In this type of sedentary activities, we highlight the use of tablets or computers, video game consoles, television and mobile phones. The results show that children who have used technological devices have had worse results in some of the physical fitness variables analysed. This worsening of results presents different values depending on the technological device used. There was a decrease in the values of kg mobilised in hand pressure, both right and left, in the sample that used video game consoles (\u22120.98 and \u22120.44, respectively), computers (\u22120.21 in right hand) and tablets (\u22122.70 and \u22120.53, respectively) in particular. The results for the long jump with feet together only showed a worsening for the children who used the television (\u22122.98) to a greater extent. However, agility speed (+0.86), Leger's test (\u22121.55) and VO 2 max (\u22124.4) showed worse values in all members of the sample who used technological devices during the lockdown period.",
