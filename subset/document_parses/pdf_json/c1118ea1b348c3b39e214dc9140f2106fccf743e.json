However, there continues to be a number of uncertainties regarding the wide-ranging manifestations of the disease, it is appropriate treatment and management, and optimal ways of preventing transmission. [7] [8] [9] [10] Additionally, there are many misconceptions among the general public and a need for reliable information for the public. The internet is a frequently used resource for providing patient education materials (PEM). Studies show that of the 78% of adults in the United States who have internet access, 83% of them utilize the internet to search for health information. 11 However, much of the health information available online is written above the sixth grade reading level recommended for PEM by the National Institute of Health and US Department of Health and Human Services. 12 It is critical to maximize the readability of PEMs on COVID-19 to effectively disseminate accurate information. Increasing public knowledge about this infection can potentially improve health outcomes by teaching early identification of symptoms and effective methods for preventing the spread of disease. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the readability, content, and quality of web-based PEMs on COVID-19 from US academic medical centers.",

Actionability is whether an action is identifiable in the text and how easily that action can be acted on. PEMAT-P scores range from 0-100% in either domain. A score of less than 70% reflects poor performance. 20 Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. The mean readability scores of the PEMs were compared, using a one-sample t test, to the scores that indicted a sixth grade reading level. Content proportions were analyzed using binomial distribution, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All data were analyzed with STATA SE (Version 12, College Station, TX).

Further, only half of PEMs emphasized that ill individuals should isolate from other people. Testing is key to identifying and limiting spread of the novel coronavirus. 27 Description of testing types may prove useful in public decision making as polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M testing is reflective of current infection, while immunoglobulin G tests for past infection. While many PEMs discussed testing for the virus, less than a third discussed what the results of a positive or a negative test mean. Testing for the virus has evolved over time, with some tests having a false negative rate as high as 29%. 28 The possibility and implications of a false negative is important to include in PEMs as a negative result may lead to a false sense of security. 29 As the pandemic has progressed, criteria for safe return after illness has continued to change. 30 Yet, it was rare for PEMs to address when patients could return after symptoms abate or after an asymptomatic positive test result. 31 Interestingly, it was rare for PEMs to describe the high-risk populations for COVID-19. Early data released by the World Health Organization showed how those with co-existing disease are at greater risk, particularly those with obesity, hypertension, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. 32 Only a quarter of those at-risk populations were addressed within the PEMs; furthermore, risk factors of obesity and residence in long-term care facilities were mentioned least. This is of concern as 68% of Americans are considered obese. 33, 34 Furthermore, as seen in other viral diseases such as influenza, the elderly are disproportionately affected. 34 Future PEMs need to ensure they address those that are most at risk.",
