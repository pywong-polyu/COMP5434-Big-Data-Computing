Our aim is to estimate weather-dependent signatures in the early phase of the pandemic, while controlling for socio-economic factors and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identify a modest non-linear association between mean temperature and the effective reproduction number (R e ) in 409 cities in 26 countries, with a decrease of 0.087 (95% CI: 0.025; 0.148) for a 10\u00b0C increase. Early interventions have a greater effect on R e with a decrease of 0.285 (95% CI 0.223; 0.347) for a 5th -95th percentile increase in the government response index. The variation in the effective reproduction number explained by government interventions is 6 times greater than for mean temperature. We find little evidence of meteorological conditions having influenced the early stages of local epidemics and conclude that population behaviour and government interventions are more important drivers of transmission.",

Sustained local transmission has occurred in most countries, leading to political, social and economic challenges and devastating loss of life. From the early phase of the pandemic, there has been speculation that weather conditions could modulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. The debate has been driven by analogy with existing seasonal endemic respiratory viral infections, such as influenza and other human coronaviruses, which tend to peak in the drier and colder winter months in temperate climates 1 . However, specific mechanisms behind this seasonality, in terms of host immunity and susceptibility, viral stability or weathersensitive human behaviour are poorly understood 2 . Dynamic transmission modelling has shown that meteorological variables, such as temperature and humidity, are unlikely to have been a dominant transmission risk factor in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, given high population susceptibility 3, 4 . As SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to humans, with <1 year of data available at the time of writing, ascertaining the potential for weather modulated transmission is challenging. Several studies have attempted such analyses. However, many such studies had methodological weaknesses and the results were at times conflicting 5, 6 . Study findings for temperature resulted in either a positive 7, 8 , negative 9,10 , non-linear 11, 12 or non-significant association 13, 14 with the COVID-19 response variable. For example, most studies did not control for key modulating factors, such as varying government restrictions, socio-economic indicators, population density or age structure [15] [16] [17] .",

The study is based on an extensive dataset, collected by the Multi-Country Multi-City MCC Collaborative Research Network (https:// mccstudy.lshtm.ac.uk/), consisting of time series of daily COVID-19 cases registered between 11 January and 28 April 2020 in 409 locations (cities or small regions) in 26 countries. In the first stage, we estimated the effective reproduction number (R e ), in each city, over a city-specific time window early in the epidemic. We use a renewal equation-based approach that estimates latent infections and then map these infections to observed notifications via an incubation period, a report delay and a negative binomial observation model with a day of the week effect 18 . Focusing on the early phase of the pandemic allows us to minimise possible biases coming from factors impacting R e (in particular non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)), which developed as the pandemic progressed. These include change of ascertainment methods and strategies, the implementation of strong NPIs (e.g. travel bans, school closures and lockdown), the appearance of new variants and ultimately vaccination campaigns. Also, in the first stage we define our exposure variables as mean values of meteorological variables (including daily mean temperature, relative and absolute humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and precipitation), for each city, over the early-phase time window, using the ERA5 fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate 19 . In a second 'cross-sectional' stage, we estimate the association of city-level R e , calculated for the city-specific window (allowing for standard errors), with each meteorological variable, controlling for confounding by total population, population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, percentage of population >65 years, pollution levels (i.e. particulate matter, PM 2.5 ) and the lagged Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) Government Response Index at the endpoint of the selected time window (lagged by 10 days), allowing for the two-level (cities and countries) structure of the data using a multilevel meta-regression model 20 (see 'Methods' for further details). We believe the data used and the analysis performed in this study improves upon previous approaches. Specifically, the fine spatial scale of the city-level data and the methodological design, accounting for confounding of NPIs and city-level covariates, allows us to accurately quantify the relationship between meteorological variables and R e .",

Mean temperatures over the observation period (between January and April 2020) reflect the late winter/early spring in 381 cities situated in the northern hemisphere and the summer/early autumn seasons in 28 cities in the southern hemisphere. Of the 136 cities classified as having high R e values, 35 cities experienced low temperatures, 64 medium temperatures and 34 high temperatures ( Fig. 1) . When visualising the unadjusted association of R e with mean temperature, relative humidity (RH), absolute humidity (AH), solar radiation at the surface and stratified by climate zone, we found no clear pattern (Fig. 2) .",

Using a two-stage meta-regression model, we quantified the influence of meteorological variables, including mean temperature, on R e between cities, while controlling for confounding factors including government interventions. After adjusting for the city-level characteristics (e.g. socio-economic and demographic factors) and the country's OxCGRT Government Response Index, we found a modest, non-linear association of mean temperature and AH with R e ( Table 2) . Less strong evidence of association was found for RH, with no evidence of association for solar radiation, wind speed and precipitation ( Table 2 ). The association between mean temperature and R e is non-linear, with R e initially rising to a peak at 10.2\u00b0C, then falling to a trough at 20\u00b0C, 0.087 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.025; 0.148) lower than the peak, and finally rising again (Fig. 3) .

We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results considering alternative analytic or selection choices (see Supplementary Table 5 ). The main results are stable when including a country-level fixed effect in the meta-regression model, i.e. considering the only withincountry variation of covariates and outcome. Restricting the analysis to cities with weaker interventions (OxCGRT Government Response Index <60) also gives similar results to the main analysis, apart from wind speed and precipitation also showing an association with R e . The association between mean temperature and the effective reproduction number holds across all the sensitivity analyses, apart from in tropical and southern hemisphere cities, when stratifying by tropical and non-tropical or northern and southern hemisphere regions. However, this may be explained by the small number of cities and the resulting low power in the tropical and southern hemisphere sub-group. The association between AH and the effective reproduction number is somewhat less robust with no association observed when excluding tropical or southern hemisphere cities, when excluding China and Brazil (countries with earlier and later observation periods) and when considering meteorological variables lagged by 10 days. Excluding the ten cities with R e < 1 shows a tendency of an increased R e for cities with low RH (p = 0.009) and a lower R e in cities with higher solar radiation at the surface (p = 0.047) (Supplementary Figure 5) . We observed similar overall tendencies to our main results when we did not control for the OxCGRT Government Response Index in our model, although the effect of temperature and AH was enhanced (Supplementary Figure 6) , and when considering meteorological variables lagged by 10 days (Supplementary Table 5 ). We found no evidence of an interaction between mean temperature and RH categorised in two levels (\u226465% and >65%) using the median value of 65% as the category threshold (p = 0.428).",

We found evidence of a modest non-monotonic association of outdoor mean temperature and AH with early-phaseR e , after controlling for potential confounders, including NPIs. Temperature explained 2.4% and AH 2.0% of the variation in R e , compared to 13.8% explained by the OxCGRT Government Response Index in the adjusted analysis. The associations of temperature and AH with R e were not The number of cities per country, total reported COVID-19 cases in the time window, mid-period of the pre-defined window of early transmission, effective reproduction number (Re) and the lagged OxCGRT Government Response Index at the endpoint of the pre-defined window. independent; the high correlation between them precluded control of one for the other. Overall, there was little evidence for any change in the R e of COVID-19 associated with RH and no evidence for precipitation and wind speed. Associations between temperature, humidity and SARS-CoV-2 transmission might be explained by three mechanisms. First, like other viruses with a lipid envelope, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be sensitive to temperature, humidity and solar radiation under laboratory conditions [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , which affects its ability to survive on surfaces and in aerosols. The droplet behaviour in aerosols changes with different temperature and humidity levels. Low RH promotes the accumulation of aerosol particles (since evaporation leaves behind floating droplet nuclei) increasing the likelihood to be inhaled 26, 27 . Second, innate and adaptive immune response mechanisms have been shown to be modulated by seasonal changes. Lower levels of vitamin D, mediated by decreased Effect size and variation explained by including, in turn, mean temperature (\u00b0C), absolute humidity (g/m 3 ), relative humidity (%), surface solar radiation downwards (J/m 2 ), wind speed (m/s), total precipitation (m) and OxCGRT (0-100) in the model of Re. P values were obtained from a two-sided Wald test in the multivariable meta-regression multilevel models adjusted by population (log scale), population density (log scale), GDP (log scale), % population >65 years, PM2.5 (\u03bcg/m 3 , log scale) and the OxCGRT Government Response Index, with cities nested within countries. a The exposure contrast for which effect size is presented is that between the values predicting minimum and maximum Re, where clear minima and maxima are observed (mean temperature, absolute humidity and relative humidity), otherwise the 5th to 95th percentiles. ultraviolet B radiation exposure during winter might lead to impaired antiviral innate immune defences [28] [29] [30] . Breathing dry air can impair mucociliary clearance, reducing the ability of cilia cells to secrete mucus and remove viral particles (innate immune response) 27, 31 . Interferon-stimulated genes, usually inducing an antiviral state as part of the innate immune response have been found to be impaired at low RH 32 . High temperatures have been shown to hinder virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses and antibody production (adaptive immune system) 33 . Third, human mobility, contact patterns and time spent indoors are affected by weather conditions 34 . Very hot and very cold conditions can lead to more time spent in enclosed spaces, which might increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Findings from this study are only partly consistent with findings from other global studies using statistical approaches to investigate meteorological effects on COVID-19 transmission. Meyer et al. 9 found that mean temperature had a modest negative association with COVID-19 incidence for temperatures above \u221215\u00b0C based on a dataset of 100 countries, after controlling for surveillance capacity, time since first reported case, population density and median population age, whereas RH had a negative nonsignificant association with case incidence. J\u00fcni et al. 13 covering 144 geopolitical areas showed that temperature and humidity measures were not significantly associated with epidemic growth while significant associations were found for restrictions of mass gatherings, school closures and measures of social distancing, which are consistent with our findings of a stronger impact of the OxCGRT Government Response Index compared to climatic conditions. Wu et al. 35 incorporating data from 166 countries found that a 1\u00b0C increase in temperature and RH was associated with a 3% and 0.85% decrease in daily new cases, respectively, after controlling for wind speed, median population age, Global Health Index, Human Development Index and population density. Interestingly, non-linear associations between mean daily temperature and the instantaneous reproduction number (R t ) in the United States of America were found in a study by Rubin et al. 12 with R t decreasing to a minimum as temperatures rose to 11\u00b0C, increasing between 11 and 20\u00b0C and then declining again at temperatures >20\u00b0C. The shape of the association may be influenced by the indirect effect of weather in varying the likelihood of social interactions, e.g. at higher temperatures people may congregate in public cities, such as beaches and festivals 12 , while colder temperatures could limit social activities, such as sporting events 34 . Runkle et al. 11 concluded from varying longitudinal associations in four cities that specific humidity in the range of 6-9 g/kg (i.e. AH range of 7.6-11.4 g/m 3 ) was a significant predictor of the COVID-19 growth rate, in line with our findings.",

Similar methodological challenges were highlighted when evaluating the association between air pollution and COVID-19 outbreaks 36, 37 . The novelty of the virus, with less than a full annual cycle of data available in most places, makes it difficult to disentangle a seasonal signal or inter-annual trends from meteorological factors using time-series models 38 . Moreover, different interventions (e.g. restrictions of mass gatherings, international travel and school closures) adopted by countries at different times after the onset of local outbreaks potentially confound the association between weather variables and COVID-19 spread. These challenges have led us to consider an ecological approach where we compared the outbreak curve early in the epidemic, minimising the confounding effect of NPIs. Despite this, we found a strong association of the OxCGRT Government Response Index with R e , confirming the importance of interventions implemented early on in the epidemic in controlling COVID-19 dynamics 39 .",

The estimated high proportion of asymptomatic cases compromises the use of COVID-19 case counts to estimate transmission dynamics 40 . We used an estimated response variable, i.e. the effective reproduction number, calculated accounting for reporting delays and other sources of uncertainty. The 20-day duration was chosen as a compromise between needing enough days for a more precise R e estimation, while, at the same time, limiting the window to provide more constant weather, case ascertainment and R e estimates within the window. A larger window would bias estimates in ways that cannot be readily adjusted for. Our meta-analysis approach accounts for the uncertainty in R e estimates, which in turn reduces the level of certainty in the results. Further, 20 days is~4 generations of infections, which, under most reporting scenarios, is sufficient to be confident about estimates in the level of transmission. We assume that within the 20-day time window, the case definition is constant within a city or country and R e is not affected by differences in case definition between countries.",

Our analysis covers all major climate zones across the globe, ranging from temperate, continental to tropical and dry climate settings. Another strength is our flexible methodological and statistical approach. We used multilevel meta-analytic models that take into account uncertainty of the response variable, i.e. the effective reproduction number. The model allowed for possible non-linearity of the exposures, and we adjusted for a selection of key socio-economic and demographic factors, as well as using a random effect to account for the country-and city-level differences. We chose covariates based on their potential impact on viral transmission that might confound the examined association of weather and COVID-19 dynamics. Indeed, population density leads to higher contact rates, potentially increasing the likelihood of transmission 41 . The age structure of a population is relevant given that elderly people were found to be more susceptible to infection and more likely to experience clinical symptoms of COVID-19 compared to younger age groups, increasing the likelihood of seeking medical care and getting tested 42 . Moreover, differences in contact patterns among different age groups can further affect the number of COVID-19 cases in each age group 42 . Socioeconomic indicators, such as GDP per capita, are important to consider as more deprived populations might be at higher risk of infection due to potential conditions of overcrowded accommodation, inability to work from home or limited access to medical care 43 . Also, among air quality factors, a positive association between PM 2.5 and COVID-19 incidence and mortality has been reported 44, 45 .",

We found a high correlation between mean temperature and AH (Supplementary Figure 2) . Socio-economic and demographic characteristics were extracted from the OECD Regional and Metropolitan database 60 and Worldcities database 61 (Supplementary Table 2 ). We selected, a priori, the following set of confounders: total population, population density, % elderly population (>65 years) and GDP (per capita). Pollution data (PM 2.5 ) for the observation period (10-20 days) was obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service global near-real-time service [62] [63] [64] . This product provides hourly modelled values of surface PM 2.5 (\u03bcg/m 3 ) at a 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 arc degrees grid cell resolution. The hourly time series were averaged over the observation period and linked to the city using the city centroid coordinates. Cities vary in terms of sociodemographic characteristics (Supplementary Table 3 ). The correlation between socio-demographic characteristics is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 and the correlation between meteorological variables, OxCGRT Government Response Index, day of the year and R e in Supplementary Figure 4 . To account for differences in NPIs we used the OxCGRT Government Response Index 65 . In this study, we considered the 10 days lagged value of the OxCGRT Government Response Index, and for each city, we assigned the index on the last day of the specified window for each city 39 . Note, in our analysis, meteorological variables and socio-demographic covariates were collated and summarised at the city level, while the COVID-19 time series were defined at the smallest administrative level containing the city. We only included cities for which the COVID-19 time series were available for an area in which most of the population resided in that city. We, therefore, refer to our unit of analysis as a city.",
