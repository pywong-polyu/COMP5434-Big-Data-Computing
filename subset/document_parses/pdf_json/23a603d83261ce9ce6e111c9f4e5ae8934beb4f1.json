Herein, we describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of COVID-19-associated pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum in critical care settings. Materials and methods: We hereby present a case series of 12 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and developed air leak injuries in critical care settings in a tertiary care center in Northern India. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 was confirmed by nasal/oropharyngeal swab testing using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test. The clinical spectrum and outcomes of these patients were assessed. Each case has been presented as a brief synopsis. Results: The onset of pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum varied from 11 to 28 days after the occurrence of initial symptoms and caused worsening of respiratory parameters in most patients. Of the 12 patients, eight were males who developed air leak injuries. One patient was a current smoker, and three patients had underlying lung disorders. Two patients with spontaneous breathing were managed conservatively. All intubated patients who developed air leak injuries died (100% mortality rate). Conclusion: Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum is a rare and life-threatening complication in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology behind the development of air leak injuries in patients with COVID-19.",

Although a considerable amount has been discussed in the literature regarding ground-glass attenuation, septal thickening, and lung infiltrate in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium are rare presentations with an incidence of less than 2%. 1 -3 High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), barotrauma, and undiagnosed bullous lung disease have taken all the blame for this air leak in patients with COVID-19. 4, 5 In this article, we present cases of 12 patients with COVID-19 from a Northern Indian tertiary care hospital who developed air leak injury and had varying PEEP levels. These patients included those who were spontaneously breathing and those who were mechanically ventilated. This case series has been approved by the institutional ethics committee (IEC/20/655), and informed consent was obtained from all patients.",

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of oropharyngeal and nasal swabs were positive for COVID-19, and subsequently, she was transferred to the critical care unit.

However, the patient's condition worsened clinically, and she required NIV support (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ]: 0.6, pressure support [PS]: 10, PEEP: 6) for the next 4 days. Gradually, her oxygenation status deteriorated, and she developed subcutaneous emphysema over the chest. Later, she was intubated. Highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed that the patient had mediastinal emphysema with ground-glass opacity, for which an interventional radiologist inserted a mediastinal drain and subsequently, her oxygen requirement reduced ( Figure 1 ). However, the patient developed secondary bacterial pneumonia and died on day 42 of illness due to worsening hypoxemia.",

However, this article describes a series of 12 patients who developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pneumopericardium with varying PEEP level; these patients also include those who were spontaneously breathing. In our study, the onset of pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum/pneumopericardium varied from 11 to 28 days after the occurrence of initial COVID-19 symptoms and led to deterioration in most patients.",

Similar to study published in China by Chen et al., in our study, being a male was a risk factor for air leak injuries. 7 In our study, more than 60% of cases developed air leak injuries spontaneously or with lower requirements of positive pressure ventilation. The relation between air leak injuries and disease process is complex and not completely understood. Postmortem analysis of patients who succumbed to COVID-19 revealed diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs. 8, 9 The pathological features of our patients were very similar to those of patients with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 10, 11 However, the incidence of pneumothorax in patients with MERS varied from 15% to 30%. 12 Multiple studies have demonstrated early cyst formation and extensive alveolar destruction in the area of airspace disease, which in turn can result in air leakage and interstitial emphysema. 13 -16 Apart from that, severe endothelial injury and intussusceptive angiogenesis 17 were also documented in lung autopsy specimens. It is possible that these complex molecular and pathogenic changes can predispose patients to air leak injuries. Management of air leak injury varies from conservative treatment to the use of drain placement, and in refractory cases, surgical intervention is opted. 18 In our study, patients who were not on positive pressure ventilation were managed conservatively. For those requiring invasive ventilation, an intercostal drain was placed, followed by a mediastinal drain. One patient developed nonresolving pneumothorax and was scheduled for surgical intervention; however, he was hemodynamically unstable and developed severe acidosis and died before any intervention.",

            "text": "CASE 1: Tension Pneumothorax with surgical emphysema Case 3: Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax on high-flow nasal cannulaA 62-year-old male patient was admitted to emergency department with a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR report from another hospital. He complained of low-grade fever and nonproductive, intermittent cough since 7 days along with shortness of breath since a day. The patient had a saturation of 84% on 15 L/min oxygen therapy on arrival and was started on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery (flow: 60 L/ min, FiO 2 : 1.0). His baseline HRCT revealed a CTSS of 36/40 along with pneumomediastinum and minimal right-sided pneumothorax, which was managed conservatively(Figure 3aandFigure 3b). He then received treatment as per the institutional protocol. However, his clinical condition worsened, and he required mechanical ventilation on day 20 of illness. Despite aggressive therapy, he succumbed to his illness on day 29 of illness.",
