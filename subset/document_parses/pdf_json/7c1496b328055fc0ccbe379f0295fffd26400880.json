            "text": "Introduction. Synchronous telemedicine using teleconferencing may play a role in clinical care. In a tertiary care center, video conferencing-enhanced virtual clinics were established via a new application platform. They were introduced during COVID-19 pandemic to connect patients to trained health-care providers via a secured line. While maintaining patients' privacy, they were theorized to offer effective communications and continuous clinical care. In this cross-sectional cohort study, we ought to examine the impact of service and the assistance they may offer to cardiac patients in the outpatient setup. Methods. A prospective cohort study looking at all video-conferencing virtual clinics' visits during the pandemic with primary focus on cardiac outpatient clinic, addressing primary endpoints of need for admission or emergency visits from cardiac demises during the pandemic and secondary endpoint of patient satisfaction based on patients' experiences. Results. A total of 6000 live care video-based chats were made over 10 months period from March 10 th , 2020, to January 30 th , 2021, among which 277 patients were evaluated in the virtual cardiac clinic, of these 193 (69.7%) were males, with mean age of 48 \u00b1 15:60 (22.3%), patients were requested to present to clinic for further evaluation and testing, 20 (7.2%) patients were asked to visit the emergency room, of whom 8 (2.8%) patients were hospitalized. All 8 were admitted for high-risk findings that require immediate medical attention, 4/8 underwent cardiac catheterization, mean duration of admission was 2 \u00b1 1 days. When compared to regular walkin care, there was a statistical difference in admission rate and emergency visits p = 0:001 and p = 0:0001, respectively, both were statistically higher in the virtual clinic. The satisfaction rate in a 5-scale grading system was 97% of 4 and above recommending the continuation of the service beyond pandemic time. Conclusions. Video-enhanced virtual cardiology clinic works safely and efficiently during COVID-19 pandemic with a difference in admission rate and ER visits when compared to walk-in clinic. It can be used during nonpandemic time to reduce load on hospital and clinic crowdedness. It also decreases the chances of COVID-19 transmission indirectly by reenforcing physical distance. monitoring, diagnosing patients at home, treating, and counseling. This eventually leads to cost-effectiveness by saving money and time for end users [2, 3] .",

Range of satisfaction includes 5 points of the following: \"1-Not at all Satisfied\", \"2-Partly Satisfied\", \"3-Satisfied\", \"4-More than Satisfied,\" and \"5-Very Satisfied,\" numbering 1 to 5 as an interval scale. The same scale was used to assess several points that pertain to the clinic, including physician performance like listening to patient complaints and addressing them appropriately, formulating a sound plan of care that is understandable, and establishing a professional rapport with patients. Accessibility and quality of other services like administration, scheduling appointment, diagnostic laboratory tests, imaging, and pharmacy were also evaluated. Finally, the application itself as a platform of telemedicine was addressed with two questions \"weatherwas it easy and user friendly?\" and secondly, \"were there any technical issues related to connectivity or responsiveness?\" Finally, overall rating to support continuation of the service was collected using the same scaling system.

The rate of admission was statistically significant compared to the admission rate from the regular walk-in clinic. The rate of satisfaction was exceedingly high, we believe that patients valued the surface provided to them via liveCare platform as more than 97% were with continuation of the service. Comparing virtual telecardiology services to regular outpatient services, there was lower numbers of patients physically present in the clinics, and time consumed in clinic was shorter with more efficiency in serving more patients.

Once the service is activated, an ambulance will be dispatched to the location of the patient using the nearest possible route on the map screen in the command center after defining caller location, and an ECG is done as soon as possible before it gets sent wirelessly to the on-call cardiologist, this can be sent to hospital application dedicated for clinicians to access its services to be sure that data are safely stored, the cardiologist can then activate the catheterization lab ahead of time to be ready to receive the patient (Figure 4) .

The rate of admission via the clinic was higher than expected and that could be related to the patient presentations and clinical symptoms in addition to lack of hands-on assessment by clinicians, the last makes providers more concerned that they might have missed something serious, these factors led to more ER visits and subsequently more admissions. Telecardiology clinic despite its inherited limitations related to limited access to critical information like vital signs, clinical exam findings, and closer eye assessment was successful in this short series to treat patients effectively and efficiently. It is also reenforced social distance as mean of reducing COVID-19 transmission from person to person. Finally, no death reported among callers for the entire period of the study. It is worth mentioning that other modalities of telecardiology were used such as direct phone calls, type-in chatting, and automated services (medications refill), when compared to video chatting, they There are quite some limitations to this study as the number of patients is relatively small, the area where the study was conducted in the City of Riyadh is considered one of the high socioeconomic regions. And affordability to the service was attainable by most known patients to the hospital. There are also some challenges to the service, including legality related to missing major findings that only will be picked up in hospital, there is also a socioeconmic disparity in acceptance and affordability related to financial constraints but also can be self-preferences. Prior experience in Telemedicine has highlighted these challenges very well addressing the need for unified approach that provides high-quality care with reduced cost and more accessibilities to public [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Larger study with more international centers could illustrate better the impact of diverse cultures and socioeconomic stratum on the provision of clinical care using video-assisted chatting as a mean of telemedicine in any clinical field.",
