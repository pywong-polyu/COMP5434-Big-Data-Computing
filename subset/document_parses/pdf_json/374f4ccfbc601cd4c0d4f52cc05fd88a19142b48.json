Because treatment options are very limited, people affected by such devastating diseases have extremely low survival rates. Organ transplantation is the most effective radical treatment currently available. Nevertheless, the application of this technique faces several hurdles due to lack of donors and posttransplantation adverse events, including surgical trauma and immune rejection. Against this background, cell replacement therapy comes to the fore, opening a door of life for desperate patients. It is a treatment that uses the patient's own (or allogeneic) mature cells (or stem cells) to repair tissues and organs. Currently, the most representative cell therapy strategy is chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, which uses genetic engineering techniques to generate CAR-T cells that only recognize and kill tumor cells. [1] Cell transplantation brings cells from the laboratory to the operating room.",

[3, 4] They carry exactly the same genetic material as the patient, possess similar capacity for self-renewal and pluripotent differentiation as embryonic stem cells, and overcome the ethical and technical limitations of the clinical selection of specific cells. Latest research has shown that iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells can produce inflammatory cytokines and exert strong cytotoxicity against an array of hematologic and solid tumors. [5] NK cells mediate both direct tumor lysis and T cell activation and recruitment. A robust and efficient manufacturing system for the differentiation and expansion of high-quality iNK cells was developed to fight tumors.

[11] CAR-T cell therapy has shown great promise in some hematologic malignancies, but solid tumors have been difficult to target. One obstacle to success is that the treatment can be more toxic to normal tissues than cancer tissues.

Nowadays, CAR-T therapy for pancreatic cancer is included in several clinical studies.

[24] [25] [26] However, for islet cell transplantation, the in situ procedure is preferable, because the environment of the pancreas is the most suitable for islet cell survival and proliferation, and may even help stem cells differentiate into islet cells. The methods available for, however, have certain limitations: percutaneous puncture poses difficultly in accurately targeting a specific region of the pancreas, while laparoscopic techniques could be quite traumatic for patients and could easily damage the pancreas and other organs. Compared with these techniques, EUS-guided puncture requires a shorter operation time and lower cost. Further, the equipment used has good device mobility with flexible angles to reach deep abdominal structures, which allows transplantation at a precise location and is also less traumatic for patients, facilitating their faster postoperative recovery. Accordingly, EUS is especially suitable for transplantation in deep retroperitoneal organs such as the pancreas. [27] In EUS, an ultrasonic endoscope is first inserted into the stomach, following which the transplanted cells can be precisely injected into the organs bearing the tumors, by avoiding the blood vessels of the punctured organs under the guidance of ultrasound and finding the parts with abundant blood flow for malignant cell survival and proliferation through the blood flow diagram of EUS. Furthermore, EUS can be used to perform simple imaging or cell biopsy for follow-up observation and intervention after transplantation. In some studies, islet cells were transplanted into the gastric submucosa through endoscopy so as to be conducive to biopsy evaluation for immune rejection. [28] EUS-guided cell transplantation is an exciting new technique falling at the crossroads of EUS and cell bioengineering. It may not only help overcome the present limitations of pancreatic cancer treatment but also expand the spectrum of therapeutic interventions for diabetes and other pancreatic ailments, resulting in improved therapeutic effect with reduced damage to surrounding tissues.",

Cell therapy is required to be widely applied in clinical research for the effective treatment of several diseases, and EUS gives a much-needed helping hand.
