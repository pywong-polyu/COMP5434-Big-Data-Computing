A model setup is a set of N nodes, each with (x, y) coordinates and an assigned role. All setups used in the experiments in this paper have only one producing node and N d = N /2 demanders.

A supply network is a set of M directed edges that represent transportation routes in the system. Edges can start and end at any type of node: Cases, where an edge goes to producer or warehouse, represent resupply of delivery vehicles. Cases, where an edge goes from a demander node, represent parts of subsequent delivery routes. Each network has the following parameters: number of edges M, network cost c , and robustness r . Network cost c is the sum of the Euclidean distances of all edges in the network. It reflects how optimal the product paths in the network are with respect to edge length.",

Inspecting the optimization results in form of Pareto fronts (Fig. 4) it can be seen that depending on the allowed number of edges high or low robustness areas become less populated. To analyze the structures of robust and vulnerable networks, we are sampling one network with low and one network with high robustness from each of the 50 optimizations. The low and high robustness, in this case, are defined as 10 and 90 percentiles of the r values for each edge limit. Figures 5 and 6 show motif patterns of low and high robustness networks from 50 different setups. The analysis of different M boundaries shows that the range between (16, 22) and (19, 25) yields the clearest signal for both vulnerable and robust networks. The vulnerable networks have a pattern similar to the superfamily associated with words sequences in languages from Milo et al. (2004) (2007) . Simpler subgraphs (1-5) in such networks are overrepresented, while the more complex subgraphs that contribute more to the robustness (7, 8, 9, 11) are underrepresented. The main difference with the languages superfamily in the vulnerable networks is the role of the feedforward and feedback loops. The lack of feedforward loops is much less significant, while the underrepresentation of the feedback loops is the feature that distinguishes the vulnerable supply networks from the null model. As can be seen in Fig. 5 , the signal of vulnerable networks disappears fast with the growth of M, as the low robustness becomes hard to achieve with more edges. The robust networks have an over-and underrepresentation pattern of three-node subgraphs similar to the second superfamily from Milo et al. (2004) . This superfamily is associated with biological networks (signaling network of living organisms, gene regulatory networks, neuronal networks). Important features of this motif signature are the neutrality of z-scores for subgraphs 3, 6, 8, the importance of the feedforward loop and its bi-directional version (7, 9) . This pattern is also present across a wider range of M compared to the signature of vulnerable networks. The signal, however, becomes less informative at the higher M values, as installing robustness becomes Fig. S4 ) networks show the same motif signatures for both robust and vulnerable networks. The peak strength of the pattern signal appears when M \u2248 N , indicating that for the investigated setup the signal strength depends on the network's average degree, rather than on the connectivity.",

As a next step we will now address the opposite direction of this statistical association between robustness and motif signatures: If we generate a network with the required pattern, will it necessarily be more robust than the others? Or will such a network have the same high level of robustness but at a lower network cost? In the existing literature, an approach of installing robustness via generating a certain motif pattern is not well investigated, perhaps related to the computational complexity of computing network motifs, which is O(M 4 ) , as compared to the O(M 2 ) for the robustness. This is a relevant question, as in principle it could be that the set of networks with the pattern is bigger Fig. 7 The target network motif pattern typical to the robust biological systems, reproduced from Milo et al.

Due to the time complexity of optimizing \u03c3 , this experiment has been performed for a single set of edge boundaries (M min , M max ) = (16, 22) and N = 20 , i.e. the edge range for which the low and the high robustness signals were the strongest. This optimization had one additional constraint, namely that only edges not longer than a certain length l were allowed to form networks. The allowed length l is defined as 120% of the length that makes the network connected. Our numerical simulations have shown that this length constraint greatly enhances the association of the motif signature with robustness.

Even more striking, networks with the opposite motif pattern (negative \u03c3 values in Additional file 1: Fig. S5 ) reach robustness values that are comparable to those with target pattern. This observation indicates that not all networks with the given motif pattern will necessarily be robust.

This parameter represents the number of additional routes from the whole transportation network data that are included in the transportation network of a single product. When t = 0 , the transportation network consists purely of direct links from the producer to demanders. With highest t, the network turns into the full transportation network from the data.

As expected, for higher values of t the robustness also increases. More interesting is whether for a given t there is a connection between r and \u03c3 . A Spearman correlation analysis of these two quantities in Fig. 10b , shows a strong (> 0.5) and significant (p \u2212 value << 0.05) correlation of these two quantities. Analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient confirms these observations (see Additional file 1: Fig. S8 ) but is less reliable due to the non-Gaussian distributions of the quantities investigated. As we are going to the region of bigger neighborhood sizes, product sub-networks include more and more edges and become closer to one another, making any analysis meaningless.",

Although the model is based on one simple mechanism of matching the demand and supply, it proves to be powerful in describing the concepts of robustness and efficiency in supply networks. The optimal networks generated in this framework show structural patterns that are also typical to biological systems. This finding unites the nature of two network worldsthose found in natural systems that have been developed under evolutionary processes and industrial systems that are artificially created with the main goal of being cost-efficient. Having this evidence of similarity, it is possible to explore both systems from the perspective of another and potentially transfer the knowledge between them. One of the questions addressed in our investigation is whether one can use motif patterns as a building recipe for robust networks. This approach turns out to be much more complex on the computational side, while also showing only a weak benefit in comparison to a random pattern. This numerical observation indicates that the family of networks with the given motif pattern is wider and includes not only the robust networks. An important finding, however, is that requiring a spatial locality of the network edges forces robust networks to adhere to the given motif signature. The discussed motif pattern thus should not be associated with robustness in isolation but should be augmented by some additional factors such as spatial aggregation.",

            "text": "Finally, while the suggested supply network model is minimal, it has substantial potential for further investigations. The most obvious approach is to go beyond the singleproduct dimension. In the explored setups there was only one producing node which, as can be seen from the industrial data, is usually not the case in reality. Also, the spatial distribution of the nodes is not uniform, especially in the case of worldwide supply networks. Another modification that might bring the model closer to the reality is a setup that has an overlay of different products, each with its own demanders and producers. In this setup, some transportation routes will be used to deliver multiple products, thus reducing the networks costs but imply a higher influence on the robustness. Alternatively, one can explore systems where the robustness has a tolerance margin. For example, networks that have at least 90% demand satisfaction after damaging edges are still considered robust. In the single-product setup, reducing the demand satisfaction threshold results in simpler networks. However, combined with multi-product modification that should increase the complexity of the system the reduced demand satisfaction requirement would balance the system to be informative. Another possible approach is to apply different distance measures to compute network cost c . For example, instead of the standard Euclidean distance edges that are shorter than some threshold distance x can have a length of 1, while the longer edges can have an infinite length. This will model the situation when the delivery vehicles can travel no longer than x per one go.",

From the resulting Pareto fronts, we take 50 vulnerable networks with given r and compute their motifs. For a single network, the result of motif computations are 13 z-scores that indicate how over-or underrepresented each subgraph is in the original network, compared to its randomized versions. This gives 50 z-score values for each of the subgraphs that form a distribution drawn with shaded vertical violin plots.

Similarly to Fig. 5 we take 50 networks with high r from the Pareto fronts easier with the help of any of the subgraphs. This appearance and decay of both high and low robustness signals can be observed in Additional file 1: Fig. S2, where the pattern strength is plotted as the function of robustness r . Around M \u2208 [16, 22] and [19, 25] the signal is the strongest, showing the biggest difference between high and low robustness networks. Networks with the lowest M \u2208 [10, 16] and [13, 19] have too few edges to reach the peak of signal: on the one hand, the highest robustness of r > 0.8 is hard to achieve, on the other hand, vulnerable networks produce degenerate motif patterns with only few subgraphs present.
