This study observed survival time at 37.5\u00b0C and at 13-16 days of age of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster flies and dFOXO mutants, after they were subjected to 5 or 10 min daily at 37.5\u00b0C for 5 days starting at 5 days of age. This mild stress increased survival time of the mutants, this effect being nearly not observed in wild-type flies. Previous studies showed that another mild stress, the cold, can increase survival time to heat of wild-type flies, but not of dFOXO mutants, while hypergravity increased survival time of mutants but not of wild-type flies. Therefore, three mild stresses, cold, hypergravity, and heat can increase resistance to heat but the pathways mediating this effect are seemingly different, as cold does not increase resistance in dFOXO mutants but increases it in wild-type flies, while hypergravity and heat have opposite effects. It appears that dFOXO may be needed or not to observe hormetic effects.",

This can be observed in flies, nematodes, mammals, including human beings (reviews in e.g. Le Bourg 2009; Rattan and Le Bourg 2014 ; Rattan and Kyriazis 2019), but the mechanisms explaining these effects are still elusive. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster showed that two antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) are probably not involved (Le Bourg and Fournier 2004) , that heat-shock proteins (HSP70) could explain, at least partly, the better resistance to heat (Le Bourg et al. 2002; Kristensen et al. 2003; S\u00f8rensen et al. 2007) , and that the NF-jB-like transcription factor DIF (dorsal-related immunity factor) could explain the better resistance to fungi and heat, but not to cold (Le Bourg et al. 2012) . These studies pretreated flies with different mild stresses (heat, cold, and hypergravity, i.e. gravity levels higher than 1g, the Earth gravity level: 3 or 5g) before observing resistance to a severe stress.",

This transcription factor remains in the cytoplasm when nutrients are abundant but translocates to the nucleus in starvation conditions where it directs the expression of genes involved in resistance to various stresses. In the laboratory, dFOXO mutant flies are viable (e.g. J\u00fcnger et al. 2003) , which could be an argument for a minor role of FOXO, but flies live in the wild where fasting episodes can be frequent. Increasing the responses to various stresses can then be crucial, because starved organisms can be frailer and starvation in the wild can occur concomitantly with other stresses. For instance, dFOXO modulates heat-shock proteins, at play against heat shock (Donovan and Marr 2016) , but also induces the translocation of the innate immunity transcription factor Relish involved in resistance to hypoxia (Barretto et al. 2020) , or the expression of anti-microbial genes involved in resistance to bacteria (Fink et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "The role in mediating the positive effects of mild stress on resistance to severe stress has also been studied. Fasting, a mild stress increasing resistance of wild-type flies to a severe cold stress (Le Bourg 2013), could also slightly increase that of dFOXO mutants (Le Bourg and Massou 2015) , but a mild irradiation did not increase tolerance of the same mutants to a strong irradiation, contrarily to what was observed in wild-type flies (Moskalev et al. 2011) . A mild cold stress increased survival time at 37\u00b0C of wild-type flies, but not that of two dFOXO mutants (Polesello and Le Bourg 2017) . The heat stress strongly increased dFOXO nuclear translocation, but to a less extent in cold-pretreated wild-type males, the cold pretreatment alone having nearly no effect. Because cold-pretreated wild-type males survived heat longer and had a lower dFOXO translocation after a heat stress than notpretreated flies, it seems that, although dFOXO is required to resist heat, other mechanisms partly substitute to dFOXO translocation in cold-pretreated flies. After this study, the survival time at 37\u00b0C of wild-type flies and dFOXO mutants was observed after they lived or not for two weeks in hypergravity (3 or 5g). Hypergravity increased survival time of the mutants, this effect being less or not observed in wild-type flies (Le Bourg and Polesello 2019). The heat stress increased dFOXO translocation similarly in all gravity groups in a wild-type strain, and hypergravity decreased dFOXO translocation similarly in heat-stressed or not heat-stressed males, no clear effect of hypergravity being observed in females. Because hypergravity increased resistance to heat in dFOXO mutants and the translocation was not tightly dependent on the gravity level, one can conclude that dFOXO does not mediate the effect of hypergravity on resistance to heat. Therefore, two mild stresses, cold and hypergravity, can increase resistance to heat but the pathways mediating this effect are seemingly different, as cold does not increase resistance in dFOXO mutants while hypergravity increases it.",

            "text": "A puzzling result is that the positive effect of hypergravity on resistance to heat was more important in mutants than in wild-type flies, which allows to suspect that dFOXO could be in some cases an obstacle to the existence of hormetic effects or, at least, that it does not mediate hormetic effects in some cases. One can thus wonder what is the exact role of dFOXO in mediating resistance to severe stress after a mild stress and it is of interest to make use of a third mild stress known to increase resistance to heat and lifespan, as mild cold stress and hypergravity do (review in Le Bourg 2009). Short heat stresses have been shown to very slightly increase survival time at 37\u00b0C and lifespan (Le Bourg et al. 2001) in the same Meyzieu wild-type strain as the one used by Polesello and Le Bourg (2017) and Le Bourg and Polesello (2019) . The window of these effects was narrow, as only 5 and 10 min heat shocks had positive effects, while longer ones were detrimental or neutral. Because the positive effects were not impressive, this mild stress was no longer used in subsequent studies, mild cold stress and hypergravity having more positive effects. However, it could be wondered whether, as it is the case for hypergravity, dFOXO mutants would display more positive effects than wild-type flies. Indeed, it could be that only weak effects of mild heat shocks on resistance to a severe heat stress are observed in wild-type flies because dFOXO can, in some cases, prevent the occurrence of hormetic effects. Therefore, knowing whether dFOXO has similar effects when different mild stresses are used could allow to conclude whether dFOXO can be an important player in inducing hormetic effects. In addition to survival time at 37\u00b0C, we also observed lifespan of flies subjected or not to the mild heat stress.",

The sex by heat pretreatment interaction (F(2, 564) = 3.46, p = 0.0321) showed that the pretreatment effect was more important in males (control, 5 and 10 min males, respectively:",

            "text": "Mild stress can increase the resistance of D. melanogaster flies to severe stress, such as lethal heat (see references in the introduction), and different mild stresses are not efficient to the same extent. Short heat stresses were shown to very slightly increase survival time at 37\u00b0C and lifespan (Le Bourg et al. 2001) , while hypergravity (e.g. Le Bourg and Minois 1997) and mild cold stress (e.g. Le Bourg 2007) had larger effects on both phenotypes in the same Meyzieu wildtype strain, which explains why mild heat stress was no longer used in our lab to study hormetic effects. When a significant effect of the pretreatment on resistance to heat is observed, the percentage of increase for 5 and 10 min groups compared to the control group is indicated, a 0 meaning less than a 1% variation. The results of the two sexes are reported when there is a significant interaction between the pretreatment and the sex factors. A 0 on the line means that no significant effect was observed, even if there was a tendency for a positive effect of the 10 min pretreatment in the 21/25 flies (see text). For the lifespan results, the results of the mutant and of its control are reported only when there is a significant interaction between the pretreatment and the genotype factors, and a 0 on the line means that no significant effect of the pretreatment was observed However, when studying whether dFOXO could explain the occurrence of hormetic effects, the puzzling result was that a pretreatment with cold stress increased survival time at 37\u00b0C of wild-type flies, but not that of two dFOXO mutants (Polesello and Le Bourg 2017), while hypergravity increased survival time of these mutants, this effect being less or not observed in wild-type flies (Le Bourg and Polesello 2019). These contrasted results made necessary to use a third mild stress increasing survival time at 37\u00b0C, i.e. mild heat stress. Because mild heat stress was expected to only barely increase survival time at 37\u00b0C of wild-type flies (Le Bourg et al. 2001) , it could be wondered whether, as for hypergravity, it would be less able to increase the resistance to lethal heat of wild-type flies than of dFOXO mutants, and also whether lifespan of wild-type and mutant flies subjected to this mild heat stress could increase.",

The main difference between these three pretreatments is that mild heat stress (this study) and hypergravity do not kill flies (e.g. Le Bourg et al. 2000) , while the daily cold stresses can kill up to 70% of females in 21/25 flies and in the mix of 21/? and 25/? ones (15% of males also die), and even up to 90% of dFOXO D94 flies (Polesello and Le Bourg 2017) . Supplementary experiments in Le Bourg and Polesello (2019) confirmed this weak resistance of mutants to cold. However, the daily cold stresses also killed up to 30% of Meyzieu females, but nearly no fly in the w 1118 strain (Polesello and Le Bourg 2017) . The However, even if 21/25 males better resisted than females to the cold pretreatment, this pretreatment decreased survival time at 37\u00b0C in both sexes. On the whole, even if it could be hypothesised that mutant flies surviving to the daily cold stresses are frailer than not-pretreated ones, it seems that there is not a clear link between resistance to the daily cold pretreatments and survival time at 37\u00b0C.",

However, FOXO is of some use when other mild stresses are used (cold: Polesello and Le Bourg 2017; irradiation: Moskalev et al. 2011) , because the positive effect of mild stress is observed in wild-type flies but not in the mutants. Thus, the effect of dFOXO is variable, depending on the pretreatment preceding a severe stress, and it cannot simply be concluded that it mediates or not the hormetic effects in flies. dFOXO mutants have lower lifespan and resistance to heat than control ones, showing that the mutation increases frailty, but the Fig. 4 Comparison of the effects of the pretreatment and of the dFOXO mutation on survival time at 37\u00b0C in flies subjected or not to cold, hypergravity or heat pretreatment at young age.

Thus, this result is not only observed with hypergravity but also with a mild heat stress, while no clear or weaker effects of these mild stresses are observed in wild-type flies. One could tentatively imagine, as an attempt to explain the existence of hormetic effects in dFOXO mutants and not in control flies subjected to some pretreatments, that the absence of dFOXO is a signal for implementing other pathways mediating hormetic effects that are not in use in the wild-type controls subjected to this pretreatment. In any case, this result deserves attention, as it implies that hormetic effects can be observed in mutants but not in their controls and, thus, studying mutants can bring to the fore phenotypes that can be hidden otherwise. In such conditions, one could imagine to search for other possible mechanisms of hormetic effects by studying other mutants pretreated with a mild heat stress, because mild heat stress has only slight effects in wild-type strains: if these pretreated mutants would display a longer survival time at 37\u00b0C, by contrast to their controls, it would mean that this genotype does not mediate this hormetic effect. The usual strategy, when studying mutants, is to look for impairments when compared to wild-type controls, and thus this is the opposite strategy: looking for improvements in mutants when only weak effects are expected in wild-type flies.",

As indicated in the introduction of this article, superoxide dismutase and catalase are probably not involved (Le Bourg and Fournier 2004) , heatshock proteins (HSP70) could explain, at least partly, the better resistance to heat (Le Bourg et al. 2002; Kristensen et al. 2003; S\u00f8rensen et al. 2007) , the NF-jB-like transcription factor DIF could explain the better resistance to fungi and heat, but not to cold (Le Bourg et al. 2012) , and dFOXO can explain the better resistance to heat if flies are pretreated with a mild cold stress, but not with hypergravity or a mild heat stress. However, heat-shock proteins and dFOXO are linked, because the transcription of heat-shock proteins in flies subjected to oxidative stress with the herbicide paraquat can be strongly lowered in dFOXO mutants (Donovan and Marr 2016) .",

This conclusion could seem to be over-pessimistic because studies in Caenorhabdidtis elegans have shown that DAF-16, the homologue of dFOXO, can be needed to observe hormetic effects in this nematode. A meta-analysis showed that DAF-16 was needed in the 7 articles studying the hormetic effects of chemicals (Sun et al. 2020 ; see also e.g. Schmeisser et al. 2013 ). DAF-16 was also required to observe hormetic effects of flavonoids or heat shock on lifespan, but it was not to observe increased thermotolerance after a heat shock or living in a H 2 S atmosphere (review in Le Bourg 2009 ). However, while daf-16 mutants like control worms show this increased thermotolerance one day after a mild heat stress, this effect is lost 4, 6, or 8 days after the mild heat stress, by contrast to what is observed in control worms (Dues et al. 2016) . Therefore, like in flies, it appears that DAF-16 in worms may be needed or not to observe hormetic effects.",
