Early on, the number of screening kits was limited [2, 3] , and screening focused mainly on symptomatic individuals (with isolation of those detected with the infection). As availability increased, more routine screening, especially in residential facilities where people lived in close proximity to each other (e.g., college campuses, nursing homes, prisons, military bases), was deployed. Starting in December 2020 [4] , vaccines started receiving emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (U.S.), and by respective regulatory agencies in other parts of the world. As vaccine supplies increased, vaccines were progressively made available to the public based on pre-established priority groups. Initially these policies lacked coordination among screening and vaccination efforts, necessitating research to develop decision-making tools as well insights on effective, coordinated interventions. By developing such a tool and insights on effective vaccination and routine screening practices for college campuses, this paper contributes to this stream of research.",

We discuss how the effectiveness of the different strategies depend on community and disease characteristics, including initial vaccine coverage, estimated compliance for on-campus screening and vaccination, available screening and vaccination supplies/capacity, disease transmission and adverse outcome rates, as well as the number of infections and peak hospitalizations the college is willing to tolerate. In particular, our model is more detailed than those in the literature, and is built specifically to model strategies that not only include initial vaccine coverage, but also on-campus vaccination, as well as different variants of routine on-campus screening, to allow for the targeted screening population to include only the unvaccinated, or the unvaccinated and the newly vaccinated. We perform a detailed comparative study of the different interventions, characterized by the level of on-campus vaccination and screening, for various community and disease characteristics and disease-related outcome measures.",

An optimal strategy may involve a combination of the different interventions, implemented with different frequencies, and needs to be revised over time and customized for each region, as the available interventions (e.g., screening kits, vaccine) and their supplies, and the local situation of the pandemic change. In this paper, we focus on integrated strategies of routine screening and vaccination, which we always pair with the isolation of infected individuals detected through screening. We show, through a case study of a college campus during the Fall 2021 semester, that vaccination and screening work synergistically, and lower the total number of infections and hospitalizations, and the number of infections and hospitalizations at the peak day, thus flattening the infection curve, over what either intervention can achieve alone given an initial vaccine coverage; however, the effectiveness of such on-campus interventions also depend heavily on the initial vaccine coverage. In addition to the timely detection and quarantine of infected individuals, routine screening further allows for an efficient allocation of the limited vaccine supplies: It does so by removing those individuals who are infected and asymptomatic, or those with a prior infection, from the vaccination pool. This redirects on-campus vaccination efforts from those who would not receive much benefit, to those who would. On the other hand, vaccination shrinks the susceptible population. We also provide insight on strategies that are effective in various phases of a pandemic response, characterized by different availability of screening and vaccination supplies, current vaccine coverage, and the severity of infection spread (transmission rate) in the community, as well as adverse outcome rates of the infection. Our qualitative findings should continue to hold for COVID-19 variants with similar reproduction numbers, disease dynamics, and vaccine effectiveness values as the Delta variant.",

We consider routine screening that excludes symptomatic individuals who go into isolation immediately upon the start of their symptoms (following a separate testing process, as needed). Regarding routine screening, the subjects to be screened each day are selected according to the given screening strategy (i.e., screening population and frequency). Partial screening applies to those subjects that are either susceptible, or \"thought\" to be susceptible; while full screening extends routine screening to \"vaccinated-but-not-yetimmune\" subjects. All screening uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which can detect, with high accuracy, the presence of the virus [19, 20] . It takes 8 hours to receive the test result, and a positive test result leads to the immediate isolation of the affected subject. For vaccination, we consider that some proportion of each group starts the semester as fully vaccinated (i.e., with initial immunity). Then, subjects to be vaccinated each day on campus are randomly selected from those subjects that are either susceptible, or \"thought\" to be susceptible (thus excluding those initially immune), and is restricted by the given vaccination rate per day. We assume that the vaccines administered on campus correspond to either the two-dose Pfizer vaccine (60%) or the two-dose Moderna vaccine (40%) [21] , both of which have high effectiveness against the Delta variant. We do not consider one-dose vaccines, because they represent less than 4% of the total number of vaccines administered in the U.S. [21] ; and we do not consider waning immunity for those vaccinated (either at the outset or while on campus) due to the relatively short, 80-day period of the semester. Overall, we consider four strategies that represent various combinations of vaccination and screening efforts, and the no-intervention strategy, as summarized in Table 1 . We assume perfect compliance for all isolation orders, and model imperfect compliance for screening and vaccination.",

We conduct various sensitivity analyses through three scenarios, which represent different levels of pandemic severity and test efficacy, and through varying the values for the daily vaccination rate, screening frequency, compliance (for each of screening and vaccination), and initial vaccine coverage (for each of faculty and students). Each scenario is characterized by the level of infection spread (modeled by group transmission rates, \u03b2(f) and \u03b2(s), reported in terms of an overall reproduction number, R T , computed as a weighted average of each group's reproduction number, see S1 Appendix); exogenous conditions (X weekly imported infections, i.e., X new infections introduced to campus residents each week from external contacts, such as family or community members); and test efficacy, in terms of test specificity (spec) and sensitivity (sens). We label these scenarios as the worst-case (high infection spread, low test sensitivity and specificity, high imported infections), best-case (low Table 1 . Strategy description (V= \ufffd V denotes vaccination/no vaccination; S P =S F = \ufffd S denotes partial/full/no screening). infection spread, high test specificity, medium test sensitivity, low imported infections), and base-case (medium infection spread, low test specificity, medium test sensitivity, medium imported infections), Table 2 . For each scenario, we vary the screening frequency (every 1,2,3,7, and 14 days) for all strategies that involve screening; and the daily vaccination rate (30/ day, 60/day, 120/day) for all strategies that involve vaccination, Table 1 . These strategies represent different situations where screening frequency and daily vaccination rate may be restricted due to limited testing capacity, testing kits, or vaccine supply; the proportion of students who are exempt from a vaccination mandate or are unwilling to be vaccinated; or other logistical issues involved with test or vaccine administration. Moreover, we consider different compliance rates for screening (\u03b7) and vaccination (\u03b1), Table D in S1 Appendix, and different levels of initial vaccine coverage for students (L s ), Table B in S1 Appendix and faculty (L f ), Table C in S1 Appendix, for the different strategies. Setting and parameters. We consider a hypothetical college campus of 5,000 students and 455 faculty members, with 10 students and one faculty member having undetected, asymptotic SARS-CoV-2 infections at the outset (representing 0.2% of each group), and with some individuals arriving to campus as fully vaccinated (i.e., with initial immunity). The study period is an 80-day Fall 2021 academic semester, when Delta variant was the predominant strain. We consider the COVID-19 PCR test, which is the primary test used to detect SARS--CoV-2 [32] , with sensitivity 70% to 80%, and specificity 98% to 99.7%, based on published works [28] [29] [30] [31] . Vaccination rates of 60/day or higher lead to the ability to vaccinate all the eligible subjects within the 80-day period (i.e., by the end of the semester) under all scenarios, assuming initial vaccine coverage of at least 30% for both faculty and students. Table 2 reports all key parameters, along with references, see S1 Appendix for details. Outcome measures of interest. Total number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths over the 80-day semester for each of the student and faculty groups; the peak number and peak day of new infections, the peak number of hospitalizations.",

At 30% initial vaccine coverage, even more aggressive on-campus vaccination (120 vaccines/ day) and screening efforts continue to result in a high number of infections: 1,020 to 2,040 for daily partial screening; 280 to 900 with daily full screening; and 1,530 to 2,480 infections with 2-day partial screening in the base-and worst-case scenarios, respectively considering reproduction numbers of 4.75 to 6.75 (Table F in S1 Appendix).",

Considering the Fall 2021 academic semester and the then-predominant Delta variant, the results from the extended compartmental model in this study suggest that routine screening and vaccination work synergistically to contain a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and achieve a level of success that neither strategy can achieve alone. However, to maximize the effectiveness, the strategy needs to be customized for each setting, considering community and disease characteristics. Vaccination is an effective and sustainable tool for fighting disease outbreaks [33] , and reduces infection transmission [34, 35] and the consequent hospitalization and death [10, 36, 37] . Although it is of critical importance to deliver and administer the available vaccines in a swift manner, vaccination efforts might be limited by resource scarcity [38] [39] [40] , especially during the earlier stages of a pandemic, as well as vaccine hesitancy due, for example, to lack of trust and confidence in vaccines or health systems, or fear of side effects [41] [42] [43] [44] . By December 2021, 60% of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated for COVID-19, with 71% of the population receiving at least one dose of a two-dose vaccine [45] , and only 17% receiving a booster shot [46] , despite that vaccines have been available for every adult in the U.S. since April 2021 [47] , and for 12 and over since May 2021 [48] . Because the proportion of the fully vaccinated population is still below the 70%-85% threshold estimated to contain an infection [49, 50] , and because vaccines do not provide immediate protection against the infection [51] and vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time [52] , it is critical to understand how vaccination, screening, and isolation can be utilized in the containment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak for a college campus, and whether such on-campus efforts can substitute for low vaccination rates at the start of the semester.",

For the study population of 5,455 over an 80-day semester in Fall 2021, with the Delta variant as the predominant strain, with low initial vaccine coverage (30% in our study), even aggressive on-campus vaccination and screening efforts with moderate compliance (75%) result in a high number of infections: 1,020 to 2,040 for routine daily screening of the unvaccinated population; 280 to 900 with extended screening to also cover the newly vaccinated population; and 1,530 to 2,480 infections for every 2-day screening of the unvaccinated population, in the base-and worst-case scenarios (see Table F in S1 Appendix), respectively considering reproduction numbers of 4.75 and 6.75, representative of the COVID-19 Delta variant [53] . These results suggest that aggressive on-campus interventions throughout the semester cannot typically compensate for low initial vaccination rates, that is, when starting the semester with a highly susceptible population, especially when the disease reproduction number is relatively high. These findings underscore the importance of heavily promoting, even mandating, full vaccination (which may imply different doses and timing for different variants) at the start of the semester.",

For example, at a moderate initial vaccine coverage of 60%, an integrated vaccination and screening strategy of 60 vaccines per day and 2-day screening dominates both an aggressive vaccination-only (at 120 vaccines per day) strategy and an aggressive screening-only (daily screening) strategy in terms of the number of infections. Of course, the dominating strategy depends on initial vaccine coverage, and needs to be carefully chosen. Equally important is the finding that integrating routine screening (both partial and full, at every 14 days or less) with daily vaccination is beneficial at all vaccination rates and initial vaccine coverage levels, and is associated with a lower number of infections and improved peak number of hospitalizations over an 80-day semester. This result suggests that even a mild regime of routine screening, followed by immediate isolation of the positive cases, can complement vaccination and help mitigate the spread of the disease and alleviate the burden on the hospital systems, especially in institutions such as college campuses, nursing homes, prisons, or military bases where higher contact rates are expected.",

The findings in this study suggest that including the vaccinated population in the screening pool can potentially decrease the number of infections, although the degree of these benefits varies with screening frequency as well as the daily number of vaccines administered. Another policy decision related to an integrated intervention effort is the frequency of administering each intervention. Although the daily vaccination rate is expected to be constrained by the number of available doses as well as the public's willingness to be vaccinated, especially in the early stages of vaccination efforts, screening resources are generally abundant, and their frequency may be set considering the health return and feasibility of each strategy. The results of this study show that the incremental benefit of more frequent screening diminishes as the daily vaccination rate increases.",

While many colleges mandated either vaccination, or medium to high frequency screening if unvaccinated [54] , others required neither, even in regions with low vaccination rates. These differences underscore the importance of an outcome-based analysis of different potential interventions, such as the study conducted in this paper, to guide the decision-maker (e.g., college) in the most appropriate strategy given their unique characteristics. Our findings imply that multiple factors and constraints need to be included in assessing the best strategy and measures for fighting disease outbreaks. These factors may include the daily or total number of infections a college is willing to tolerate, the peak level of hospitalization that local hospitals can cope with, screening and vaccination capacity that the campus is able to achieve, initial vaccine coverage on campus, and the transmission severity scenario. It should also be considered that a partially-vaccinated campus environment (i.e., without a vaccine mandate) could provide a false sense of security for the overall student population, including those who are unvaccinated, and, as a result, infections may rise quite rapidly during the academic semester. Our results also suggest that increasing vaccination compliance has a more substantial effect in reducing the number of infections than increasing routine screening compliance. This implies that compliance for vaccination and screening do not have symmetric effects.",

We do not consider waning immunity or booster shots. While we model noncompliance with on-campus screening and vaccination guidelines, we assume that the population with symptoms or positive test results fully comply with isolation recommendations. We do not consider other mitigation tools, such as mask wearing and contact tracing.",

For this study period, we show that integrated routine screening and vaccination can be highly effective for containing a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on a college campus, as long as initial vaccine coverage is sufficiently high, depending on the reproduction rate of the disease. Vaccination and routine screening work synergistically to achieve a level of success that neither strategy can achieve alone. However, the incremental benefit of integrated screening decreases as vaccination rate and/or initial vaccine coverage increases. Further, to maximize efficacy, the intervention strategy needs to be customized for the setting, considering community and disease characteristics, including the vaccine coverage at the start of the semester, estimated screening and vaccination compliance rates, as well as the threshold number of infections and the peak number of hospitalization a campus is willing to tolerate. The model developed in this paper can be used to establish effective strategies for containing disease outbreaks in high-density settings, including college campuses, nursing homes, and military bases.",
