In this work, we describe how we rapidly transformed two design courses in the middle two years of the biomedical engineering (BME) program to an online format during the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. In addition to time and safety constraints, we identified access to design spaces with biochemistry, computing, electronic, computing, and manufacturing tools, and team-based learning as major challenges to distance learning in BME design courses. To this end, we mapped and translated various course and design activities to an online environment using a combination of customized athome laboratory kits and distributed team structures. Drawing upon our pilot experience as well as principles from online and adult learning theories, we offer an overview of strategies to retain hands-on and team-based activities and rapidly implement BME design courses in online or distance modalities.",

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic challenged the status quo and forced all courses, including design courses, to be moved to distance or online modalities.",

Of these, the design courses in the middle two years-Sophomore Intermediate Design (BME 210) and Medical Device Design (BME 310)-are specific to BME. In the sophomore design course, students learn general concepts of mechanical, elec-tronic, and software design and engage in the creation and control of electromechanical systems (e.g., robotic arm to activate switches). The course culminates in a design competition where students demonstrate their electromechanical system for a given set of constraints. In the junior design course, students design medical devices using wireless electronics, design and simulation software, microfluidics, and biochemical analysis. The course culminates in a team-defined medical device challenge where students demonstrate the design, implementation, and testing of their device.",

First, access to design spaces, expensive manufacturing equipment, and hardware resources were no longer feasible because of stay-at-home orders and physical distancing restrictions. Second, teambased learning as well as personalized support from course staff to student teams were also challenging, given that several students had to change their living arrangements multiple times during the semester, among various other reasons. We present how the two design courses were rapidly transformed to enable distance learning during Spring 2020 semester and provide instructional and administrative strategies that can be readily adapted for similar design courses in the near-term (2020-2021 academic year) and beyond.",

For the competition at the end of the course, students worked in virtual teams to define and design a medical device. Teams were provided a catalog of integrated components and sensors that they could select from. As a part of their team and project management plan, students self-organized their team workload distribution and selected components and microcontrollers, which were then shipped for experimentation and firmware design, while mechanical design, electronics layout, and documentation were completed digitally.

The submission system, developed based on Google Forms and Google Drive, allowed for uploading of design files (e.g., .STL for 3D printing and .DXF for laser cutting), along with metadata necessary for review and version control (time, design version, author etc.).

This contract can also be used for formative assessment of team activities. Additionally, remote pair programming and designing can be encouraged, where team members meet virtually and alternate between driver and navigator roles-the driver performs a design activity (assembly, CAD, firmware programming etc.) and the navigator observes and reviews each step of the activity). While certain teams in medical device design course adopted variants of pair programming and designing for their team work, this strategy was not explicitly enforced and assessed in our design courses and is an area of future work using evidence from software engineering literature. 6, 11 Adopt low stakes formative assessment throughout the design cycle: The modular and iterative nature of the design process allows for a series of low stakes assessment starting with development of a team contract, followed by two intermediate design reviews, and ending with development and execution of test plans. For virtual team work assessment, it is critical to require student teams to develop a detailed operational plan for pair programming and designing and submit a reflection summarizing their role (driver vs. navigator), time spent, type of design activity, and overall experience for each paired virtual session.",

Given that working in distributed teams will become even more prevalent in engineering practice post COVID-19, the experience and approaches from the existing online course will need to be translated to foster a virtual team-based experience in design courses. For example, a well-structured and interactive digital environment is needed to enable effective communication within and across design teams as well as collaborative decision-making and problem-solving among team members. Such an environment may also include a more automated submission and version control system to streamline management of design revisions. While we used Google for Education (G Suite) as the preferred environment, Microsoft Teams \u00d2 and Open EdX \u00d2 are potential alternatives for design courses. Institutionally-supported learning management systems may also be considered, provided they offer seamless management of design assets as well as facilitate effective interactions between the students, educator(s), and content.",
