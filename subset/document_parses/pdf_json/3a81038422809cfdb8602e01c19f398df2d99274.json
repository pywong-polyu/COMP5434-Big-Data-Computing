This has scaled up research on the virus and the resulting infection with the goal of developing new vaccines and therapies. Natural products are known to be a rich source of lead compounds for drug discovery, including against infectious diseases caused by microbes (viruses, bacteria and fungi). In this review article, we conducted a literature survey aimed at identifying natural products with inhibitory concentrations against the coronaviruses or their target proteins, which lie below 10 \u00b5M. This led to the identification of 42 compounds belonging to the alkaloid, flavonoid, terpenoid, phenolic, xanthone and saponin classes. The cut off concentration of 10 \u00b5M was to limit the study to the most potent chemical entities, which could be developed into therapies against the viral infection to make a contribution towards limiting the spread of the disease.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease resulting from the virus to be a pandemic, which has prompted an exponential increase in scientific research towards finding a drug or a vaccine to limit its spread and the number of casualties. At the time of writing this manuscript, the entire world had experienced about 150 million new infections, about 120 million recoveries and almost 3 million deaths [5] . Two earlier coronaviruses were associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The symptoms associated with COVID-19 include (as in the earlier respiratory syndromes; SARS and MERS) fever, cough, dizziness, and shortness of breath, which might lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, causing death [6, 7] . The virus associated with SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are air-borne and transmissible by contact with infected persons. However, COVID-19 has surpassed the earlier two syndromes in terms of the number of individuals infected and the number of deaths [6] .",

Viruses belonging to this family and sub-family are known to be large in terms of genome size (26\u221232 kb) [8] , are enveloped, have a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and can infect both animals and humans. CoVs can be subdivided into four genera, i.e., alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3) and delta (\u03b4) coronaviruses, according to their genotype and serology [9] . Presently all CoVs that can cause infection in humans belong to the first two categories, i.e., the alpha-coronaviruses (\u03b1-CoVs) and the beta-coronaviruses (\u03b2-CoVs). Examples of \u03b1-CoVs include the human coronavirus Nether-land63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), named after a student specimen coded 229E, while examples of \u03b2-CoVs include the human coronavirus Organ All pertinent information about the botanical description, conventional uses, phytochemicals and the pharmacological activities of the isolated compounds were collected from available recently published literature. The electronic databases employed for the assortment of relevant information include Scopus, NISCAIR, Scifinder, PubMed, Springer Link, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and an exhaustive library search. The chemical structures of the compounds were drawn using ChemDraw Ultra 8.0 software. PubChem and ChemSpider databases have been used to check the IUPAC names of the isolated phytoconstituents. The workflow for collecting the literature and writing the report has been provided in Fig. 1. ",

A summary of alkaloids with potential for drug development against SARS-CoV-2 has been provided in Table 1 . Berberine (1), Fig. 2 , is an isoquinoline alkaloid, known to be biosynthesized by many plant species, particularly those of the genus Berberis from which the compound derives its name. Some medicinal properties of 1 reported include anti-inflammatory [40] , antiviral [41] , antidiabetic [42] , antihypertensive [43] , hepatoprotective [44] and anticancer [45] , additionally is a widely used dietary supplement due to these medicinal properties. According to Warowicka et al. compound 1 could be a possible lead compound against SARS-COV-2, which might act by modulating the nuclear factor kappa of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [46] . NF-\u03baB is a protein required for DNA transcription and many other cell processes including inflammatory and immune responses. The modulation of NF-\u03baB path is one of the ways by which the alkaloid biberine could inhibit virus infections, in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties [47] . Compound 1 has an [25] inhibitory effect on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and therefore might function as an antiviral agent against coronavirus infection. Moreover, during viral infection, the virus regulates expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [48, 49] . Moreover compound 1 is also known to inhibit herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection both the HSV-1 and HSV-2 virus with EC 50 values of 6.77 \u00b1 1.13 \u03bcM and 5.04 \u00b1 1.07 \u03bcM, respectively in a dose dependent manner [50] . [35] Cepharanthine (2), fangchinoline (3) and tetrandrine (7) are bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Stephania tetrandra and other species of the genus Menispermaceae are major sources of bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids which are widely distributed in China and many East Asian countries [51] . A recent review showed the use of S. tetrandra in traditional Chinese medicine as antitumour, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial [52] . Compound 7 exhibits a wide range of pharmacological activities which include anticancer, anti-inflammatory [51] it is also reported to have inhibitory activity against Ebola virus; herein, tetrandrine acts as a closure of key calcium sensor called two pore channels which remain open during viral infection through endosomal or membrane bound route. [53] . Compound 2 (37) Tripterygium regeli IC 50 = 9.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM SARS-CoV 3CL pro [38] 3\u03b2-Hydroxy-28noroleana-12,17-Dien-16-one (38) Camellia japonica EC 50 = 0.28 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcM PEDV [37] 3\u03b2,16\u03b1-Dihydroxy-olean-12-en-28-al 3-O-\u03b2-dglucuronopyranoside (39) Camellia japonica EC 50 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM PEDV [37] Pristimerin (40) Tripterygium regelii IC 50 = 5.5 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM SARS-CoV 3CL pro [38] Iguesterin (41) Tripterygium regelii IC 50 2.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM SARS-CoV 3CL pro [38] has antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virus [54] and HSV-1 virus [55] , while compound 3 replication of HIV-1 [56] . A time addition assay with MRC-5 cells infected with HCoV-OC43 was used to investigate the antiviral activity of compounds 2, 3 and 7, the compounds strongly inhibited HCoV-OC43 virus with IC 50 values of 0.83, 1.01 and 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively. Additionally these compounds have no cytotoxicity effect on MRC-5 cell at concentrations up to 10 \u03bcM [22] . Indigodole B (4) and tryptanthrin (8) have been isolated from methanol extract of the medicinal herb Strobilanthes cusia [57, 58] , which is commonly found in northeast India, Bangladesh, southern China, Myanmar, and Taiwan [59] . The roots and leaf extracts of the plant have been used in traditional herbal medicine based on its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities [60, 61] . According to Tsai et al. the methanol extract of S. cusia reduced HCoV-NL6 viral production with an IC 50 value of 0.12 \u03bcg/mL [24] . Compounds 8 and 4 had high activity against HCoV-NL63, with compound 8 being reported to be the most potent compound, reducing HCoV-NL63 viral production with IC 50 = 0.06 \u03bcM. Meanwhile, compound 4 exhibited an effective virucidal activity against HCoV-NL63 with an IC 50 of 2.09 \u03bcM [24] . Compound 8 specifically altered the antigenic structure of the viral spike protein and further inhibits the cleavage activity of the proteolipid protein 2 (PLP2) gene, associated with virucidal activity, and inhibits the post-entry stage of HCoV-NL63 replication [24] .",

The isolated diarylheptanoids of interest include hirsutenone (9), hirsutanonol (10), rubranoside B (11) and rubranoside A (12) [25] . The isolated diarylheptanoids were tested against SARS-CoV PL pro using a continuous fluorometric assay and showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect against the PL pro [25] . The compounds were found to be reversible inhibitors because an increase in concentration rapidly reduced enzyme activity. For compounds 9 and 10, it was found that \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl and catechol groups may play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV PL pro inhibition by interacting with the PL pro nucleophiles while the monohydroxy substitution led to drop in the inhibitory effect [73] . When the compounds were tested against SARS-CoV 3CL pro , the findings showed that the diarylheptanoids displayed a significant selectivity towards the 3CL pro proteases [25] . The IC 50 values are 4.1, 7.8, 8.0 and 9.1 \u00b5M, respectively. The known viral protease inhibitor curcumin (13) was used as a reference inhibitor (with an IC 50 value of 5.7 \u00b5M) [74] .",

A. keiskei is a large perennial plant widely distributed in Japan, Korean and China. Its traditional uses include as a tonic, diuretic, laxative, and analeptic [81] . The plant extracts have exhibited several biological activities, including antitumor and antimetastatic effects [82] . The compound xanthoangelol E (20) was isolated from A. keiskei [31] . Park et al. subjected this compound to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and cell-based cis-cleavage inhibition assay to measure the SARS-CoV 3CL pro and SARS-CoV PL pro inhibition in vitro [30] . The compound showed a dose-dependent inhibition both in the SARS-CoV PL pro and SARS-CoV 3CL pro , with IC 50 values of 11.4 and 1.2 \u03bcM, respectively [30] . These results show that compound 20 has specific inhibitory activity against the cysteine protease. The crude ethanol extract of Torreya nucifera (a plant found in a snowy area near the sea of Jeju island in Korea) was subjected to FRET assay to measure the inhibitory effectiveness against SARS-CoV 3CL pro [83] . The results showed 62% inhibition at 100 \u03bcg/mL [27] . The bioflavonoid amentoflavone (15) isolated from this species [27] , has shown wide pharmacological importance in the treatment of Alzheimer [84] and in the treatment of bladder cancer [77] . Compound 15 also showed potential antiviral activity against the syncytial virus (RSV), with IC 50 = 5.5 \u03bcg/mL [85] . The compound also showed inhibitory effects against the hepatitis C virus (HCC) [86] , as well as revealed antiviral activity against influenza-A and influenza-B viruses, although only showing moderate activity against the herpes viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) [87, 88] . Moreover, a computational study revealed compound 15 has a good binding affinity against the NS2B-NS3 protease protein in docking simulation (binding affinity of \u2212 9.0 kcal/mol) and showed significant inhibition of the Zika virus from the modelling (14) Amentoflavone (15) D iplacone (16) Hesperetin (17) Myricetin (18) Papyriflavonol A (19) Quercetin ( [27] .",

Compound 18 is known for its iron-chelating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties [91] . Yu et al. examined the inhibitory effect of compound 18 and scutellarein (21) against SARS-CoV helicase, Nsp13, hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase by using the FRET-bases double stranded DNA unwinding assay as well as using a colorimetry-based ATP hydrolysis assay [29] . Compound 21 was isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis (commonly known as Chinese skullcap), which is traditionally used for treating inflammation and respiration [92] . The results showed that compounds 18 and 21 potently inhibited SARS-CoV helicase protein in vitro by acting on ATPase with IC 50 values of 2.71 and 0.86 \u03bcM, respectively, although the compounds did not suppress the helicase activity of the HCV virus [29] . Yu et al. modelling analysis revealed that compounds 18 and 21 could fit in and directly interact with ATP/ADP binding pocket of SARS-CoV helicase protein inhibiting the direct binding of ATP/ADP [29] . Moreover, it was observed that compounds 18 and 21 didn't exhibit cytotoxicity against normal breast epithelial cell lines (MCF10A) [29] .",

Recent studies have shown that antioxidant activity of compound 17 is not limited to its radical scavenging effects, but also boosts antioxidant cellular activity through extracellular signal regulated kinases/nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (ERK/Nrf2) signaling pathway [28] . According to Lin et al. compound 17 showed a dosedependent inhibited cleavage activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in cell-based assay [103] . In addition, the compound is less cytotoxic in Vero cells [103] . In silico studies have shown that 17 binds with high affinity to helicase, spike protein and protease side on the ACE2 receptors used by SARS-CoV-2 to cause COVID-19 (Fig. 6) , suggesting that this compound could be a potential inhibitor of coronavirus cell growth [104] . Papyriflavonol A (19) is a prenylated flavonol from Broussonetia papyrifera [105] . B. papyrifera is a deciduous tree, whose extracts exhibit antifungal [106] , antioxidant [107] and antihepatotoxic properties [108] . The fruits of this plant have been used to treat ophthalmic disorder in China, with its efficacy being proven by pharmacologic experiments [109] . Compound 19 showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV PL pro (IC 50 = 3.7 \u03bcM), when subjected to the fluorogenic peptide Z-RLRGG-AMC assay [30] . The compound also shows a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both \u03b1-glucosidase and cysteine proteases [30] . It is known that PL pro exhibits deubiquitinating (DUB) activity and antagonizes the induction of type-1 interferon (IFN), the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is the most overexpressed gene upon IFN stimulation and it's involved in marking newly synthesised protein during an antiviral response. Both ubiquitin and ISG15 are important for viral replication and pathogenesis, SARS-CoV PL pro can cleave ubiquitin and ISG15 from cellular conjugates, additionally compound 19 strongly inhibits both ubiquitin and ISG15 with an IC 50 values of 7.6 and 8.5 \u00b5M, respectively [30] .",

The plant species S. miltiorrhiza is widely found in China, Korea, and Japan and has been greatly used to treat coronary heart disease, particularly angina pectoris and myocardial infarction [140] . S. miltiorrhiza is known to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties [39] . Tashinones (Fig. 9 ) isolated from S. miltiorrhiza include dihydrotanshinone I (30), tanshinone IIA (31), methyl tanshinonate (32), tanshinone I (33) and cryptotanshinone (34) [36] . All the tanshinones are good inhibitors of the cysteine protease (3CL pro and PL pro ), for 3CL pro the inhibitory activity was assayed following the proteolysis of the fluorogenic substrate in the presence or absence of the test compounds, all compounds except compound 33 exhibited a dose dependent inhibitory effect on 3CL pro the activities ranged from 14.4 to 89.1 \u00b5M while PL pro inhibitory activity was assayed following continuous fluorometric, these compounds impressively show better activity against PL pro have a time dependent inhibitory profile on PL pro with compound 33 having highest activity ( IC 50 value of 0.8 \u00b5M), all compounds have better activity against PL pro compared to 3CL pro [36] . A detailed kinetic mechanism study showed that compounds 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 exhibited slow binding inhibitions with enzyme isomerisation and were shown to be non-competitive inhibitors. Moreover, compound 33 was reported to have a potent activity against cellular DUB with IC 50 = 0.7 \u00b5M [36] . Recent studies have reported the use of compound 31 to treat myocardial infarction and delay of ventricular remodeling, in combination with puerarin. The compound is known to act by inhibiting the inflammation in the early stage of myocardial infarction and plays an important role in inhibiting the ventricular remodeling in the later stage of myocardial infarction. The combination of compound 31 and puerarin can improve cardiac function, improve hemodynamics, reduce myocardial cells and reduce collagen synthesis in mice after myocardial infarction [141] .",

The compounds were tested for their inhibitory effectiveness against PEDV [135] . By targeting the epithelial cells of the small intestine, the PEDV virus can cause severe mucosal atrophy and malabsorption resulting in acute and lethal diarrhea in piglets [127] . The plant species C. japonica is found abundantly in Korea, Japan, and China [128] . The ethanol extract (70%) of C. japonica has a potential inhibitory effect against PEDV replication [133] . The anti-inflammatory [33] and cytotoxic [116] properties of flowers of C. japonica have been exploited traditionally and used in treating hematemesis and internal and external bleeding injury [142] . The compounds 35, 38 and 39 had potent effects against the replication of PEDV. The known drug azauridine was used as a positive control. Additionally, the compounds gave higher selective indices (SI = 14.74, 32.72 and 6.68, respectively), with compound 38 being lower than azauridine (SI = 14.30). Moreover, compound 38 was shown to inhibit the virus replication in a time course study and it was further investigated detailly and found to inhibit PEDV RNA expression, encoding nucleocapsid, spike and membrane protein in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 \u00b5M, respectively [135] . Therefore, the anti-PEDV molecules 35, 38 and 39 could be investigated further as candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Celastrol (36) , tingenone (37) pristimerin (40) and iguesterin (41) are quinone methide triterpenoids isolated from the bark of Tripterygium regelii [143] . T. regelii is a vine found widely in China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan [117] . T. regelii plant has a good cytotoxicity property against numerous cancer cell lines [118] and its efficacy has been reported in rodent models of arthritis and other inflammatory disease [119, 120] . Ryu et al. reported the SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory properties of compounds from this plant species [143] . All compounds displayed dose-dependent inhibitory activities, with the compounds 36, 37, 40 and 41 having IC 50 values of 10.3, 9.9, 5.5 and 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively. Additionally, structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the quinone-methide moiety present in these compounds is important for SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition (Fig. 11 ) [38] . Molecular docking analysis of compounds from this class towards the 3CL pro protein with Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1uk4 revealed that compound 41 could fit well into the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , with the hydroxyl group of C3 of compound 41 forming a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Cys44 and the OH of Thr25 located in domain I of the protein drug target (Fig. 11 ) [38] .

Our results showed that majority of the NPs with inhibitory concentrations against the virus or its target proteins below 10 \u00b5M were terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and diarylheptanoids, respectively. The terpenoids (diterpenoids and triterpenoids) were the most abundant among the isolated NPs, constituting 26.19% of the isolated compounds. This was followed by alkaloids (19.05%), flavonoids (11.90%), diarylheptanoids (9.52%), phenolics (4.76%), saponin (2.38%) and xanthones (2.38%), which showed a similar trend to previous studies [17] [18] [19] .",

            "text": "Natural products (NPs) have provided privileged scaffolds in drug design [16] . The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a positive-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [155] . The virus has infected several million people and caused thousands of deaths worldwide since December 2019 [156] . The pandemic is a significant threat to public health and the global economy [155] . To search for new bioactive compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, 42 NPs with inhibitory concentrations against coronaviruses, their target proteins and other viruses, e.g., HIV. Influenza A virus, human simplex virus or their target proteins which lie below 10 \u00b5M were identified from published data in literature. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was only discovered in 2019. References that show the testing of NPs against other SARS-CoV viruses (e.g. HCoV-NL63) and their targets (e.g. SARS-CoV PL pro , 3CL pro , SARS-CoV helicase, etc.) had earlier been published. We are presenting this review to encourage the testing of these compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In writing this manuscript, we must mention that the compounds were actually tested against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Only ten of the 165 references date after 2020. It was the goal of the authors to summarize the results of compounds and plant species whose extracts have already been tested against earlier discovered coronaviruses so as to ease the task of discovery of NP antivirals that could be next generation drugs to treat infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. The results of the current study reveal that promising NPs as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 were terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and diarylheptanoids, respectively. The mechanism of action of some of the NP hits and the plant species from which they were isolated has been included in the study. It is worth mentioning that some of the medicinal plants and the NPs have shown good safety in vitro studies. This review could serve as a starting point for further development of these NPs hits as potential leads for COVID-19. Thus, it would be interesting in future to evaluate the toxicities and binding mode of some of these NPs using in silico approaches.",
