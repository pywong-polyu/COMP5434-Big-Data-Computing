This is why The Big Bang Collective's music and culture festival program is such an innovation -they have put particle physics in front of tens of thousands of people who would not normally seek to engage with science. Since 2016 Connie Potter (CERN), Roger Jones (Lancaster University), and Chris Thomas (Iowa State University) have organised and run large science installations in many of the best known music and culture festivals across Europe and the UK. Their efforts have introduced general science, Figure 1 : The \"Build Your Own Cloud Chamber\" workshop at Roskilde Festival 2019.

As a result they have not only been able to engage with people in a meaningful way (a constant presence over a 3 or 4 day period, return visitors, and continuing conversations) but have also brought science into the mainstream consciousness, thereby breaking down the all-too-frequent misconception of physics and science as only 'for the smart people' or 'for nerds' or quite simply 'not for me because I just don't understand it'.",

People attending these events are often in awe of the fact that they have actual scientists in front of them and are able to ask them any questions they like. They are relaxed and happy in the festival environment, which is the ideal situation for learning to take place. Even those festival-goers who really did not like science at school, gave up on it and ever since have steered away from all things 'science', have had their curiosity piqued and begun engaging with the subject again.

The Big Bang Collective is looking forward to resuming the live events once the pandemic is over and events can safely take place once again. The Physics Pavilions have had a tremendous impact on festival-goers of all ages. Younger audience members have been enthralled by the hands-on activities, which have often awakened an interest in science and technology. Parents have discovered that their child has a talent for science or computing that they may not have had a chance to nurture before. Volunteers have been asked questions from parents asking what topics their child should study at school as they realise how much they enjoy science. Feedback from adults has been hugely positive as well, with many people reiterating what an excellent idea it is to have science at a music festival. And of course, the ultimate proof of concept is the number of visitors who return to the Physics Pavilion year after year.",

Nielsen Music reports that the average attendee travels approximately 903 miles to attend a festival. In an article in TIME magazine on the rise in popularity of music festivals, it was noted that 'people are more likely now to spend money on experiences over material goods' [12] . That 'experiential economy' works in favour of including other types of 'experiences' on a festival's programming.

The project has served as a musical element of the Physical Pavilions starting in 2019.
