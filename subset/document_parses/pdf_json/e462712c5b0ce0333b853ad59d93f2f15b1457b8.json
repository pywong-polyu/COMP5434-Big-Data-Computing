In multiple sclerosis (MS), the number of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) continues to expand with the number of clinical trials growing rapidly, especially over the past two decades. Phase III trials of DMTs are usually multi-centered, spanning many countries, and involve dozens of centers and hundreds of investigators. Meanwhile, efforts to improve racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials in general in the United States have largely failed (1, 2) . Just 5% of trial participants are African American or Black in the USA (compared to 13% of the population in the last reported U.S. census) and just 1% are Hispanic/LatinX (compared to 18% of the U.S. population) (2) . Clinical trials for people living with MS are no exception to this reality (3, 4) .",

Although clinical trials in MS have often been considered separate from broader social, cultural, and political trends, demands for equity in all aspects of American society are rightly becoming a tour de force. Many stakeholders are beginning to re-examine who enters and leads clinical trials. Increasing scrutiny of the representativeness of people of color is therefore rightly gathering new attention by patients, investigators, and the general public as the science of MS rapidly advances.",

Taking a sense of responsibility for racial and ethnic representativeness to a new level, one recent trial of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 by a U.S.-based company set targets for the enrollment of participants from specific racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and slowed enrollment to ensure adequate representation. Others have followed this trend by publicly delaying completion of enrollment in their trial until benchmarks for representativeness are met (5, 6) . These benchmarks approximate the incidence of the disease in the target population for the proposed product and recognize concentrated epidemics within epidemics. In other sectors, most prominently including corporate America, the role of target numbers or quotas for the inclusion of people of color and women on executive boards has become a matter of not only public trust and confidence, but also enforced regulation. In 2020, California bill AB 979 was passed to eliminate all-White boards of publicly traded companies headquartered in that state (7) . Accountability by major companies to achieve representativeness is considered a public good and sets a new standard which clinical trials can learn from.",

Other characteristics relevant to MS including early life exposures or vitamin D levels may differ (14) . The predilection for spinal cord disease with its resultant disability may be higher in African Americans compared to Caucasian Americans (9), although this is debated. Response to DMTs in certain groups may or may not differ. Since subgroup analyses are not statistically powerful enough to answer concerns around DMT responsiveness in different racial and ethnic groups, even meta-analysis across phase III clinical trials cannot definitively answer questions on racial and ethnic differences in DMT efficacy in 2020 (4). This is in spite of several thousands of MS participants over an entire generation of research. Indeed, some high profile randomized clinical trials in MS do not even report on race and ethnicity in their published manuscripts, likely concealing the low enrollment of people of color in these otherwise pivotal studies.",

Many people with MS in clinical trials have gained earlier access to higher efficacy therapies, often at no cost, and have been rightfully paid to participate, including in extension studies over several years (15) . Since clinical trials are concentrated in academic, usually urbanized centers, they tend to enroll participants who have access to specialized MS care. These centers, even if located in cities of highly diverse racial representation, may not actually serve the most disadvantaged populations in their outpatient MS clinics. Enrollment of participants from investigators' own clinics is usual and costeffective but is not always the most diversifying strategy. According to the Zip Code Analysis Project in the U.S.A., 80% of U.S. people who identify as minorities live in 20% of the zip codes (2) .

Since these efforts are not generally tracked or reported alongside MS trial results, the degree to which concerted efforts have been made across trial planners to optimize representativeness is unclear. Phase III trials for some of the earliest approved MS DMTs, beginning in the early 1990s, had at most 7% enrollment by African Americans with 93-98% of participants reported as white across trials (3). The four most recent, newly-approved novel drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reported by participant characteristics via the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. In their \"Drug Trials Snapshots, \" the percentages of people who are Black, Hispanic, or Asian are overall low: Zinbryta (1% Black, 3% Hispanic, not reported for Asian, approved in 2016); Ocrevus (4, 0, 11%, 2017); Mayzent (1, 3, 6%, 2019); and Zeposia (1, 0, 1%, 2020) (16) . After several decades, merely stating interest in under-represented groups in trial enrollment has therefore not progressed to representative trial enrollment. It must also be noted that enrollment in these trials occurs mostly outside of the USA, with no more than 26% of enrolled participants coming from the USA among the three most recently reported FDA approvals for novel MS DMTs (16) . Since most calls for diversity have come from public funders, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, but most phase III trials are now funded through pharmaceutical and private sources, efforts by U.S. government funders alone are insufficient to make the strides needed to fully diversify MS clinical trials research. Although racial and ethnic diversity may be part of a broad interest of trial planners, pressure to include racially and ethnically diverse populations may be much less than other pressures to bring a new drug successfully to market.",

As just one example, still approximately 20 million Americans lack access to broadband connections in the U.S. (17) . It is likely that many people of socioeconomic disadvantage and certain groups who experience the digital divide in the USA-such as many U.S. Native Americans (or Indigenous Americans) and Alaskan Natives-are not as actively seeking trials online via clinicaltrials.gov or able to access online information as readily.

People of color with MS may have less interest, trust, or willingness to engage in clinical trials in some situations, because the trial appears risky, lacks promise, or does not meet their needs. There are historical examples why this mistrust of trials exists and should be taken seriously (18) . Since an increasing number of people with MS may be stable on DMTs, and some trials are noninferiority studies of biosimilar products, it is clear that each trial is not created equally, and each trial does not necessarily advance the field to the same degree. An argument could be made that enrollment targets ultimately slow down the pace of science and delay progress in drug development, a situation that potentially helps no one. Targets, according to some leaders in America, do not reflect success in representativeness, but overt failures, since all other more voluntary mechanisms to improve diversity have to date therefore failed.

If participants' health insurance or public payor coverage fails to continue the DMT they were given during the trial, additional problems could arise for the participant after trial completion.

Building trust and confidence among all people with MS, present and future, is an important motivation and a potential result of doing better. Translating research into public action and harnessing societal expectations for MS clinical trials is timely and necessary. Enrollment targets have risks but, at least in the short term, are a singularly clear mechanism to remain accountable and attempt to ensure research progress is collective.",
