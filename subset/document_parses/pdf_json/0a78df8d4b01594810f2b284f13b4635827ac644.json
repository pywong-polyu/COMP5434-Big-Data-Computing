These animals had moderate Omicron-specific NAb titers (586-1,434) but negligible Omicron-specific CD8+ T cell responses (0.001-0.006%) prior to challenge (red dots, Fig. S7 ). These 4 vaccinated animals and the 6 sham controls fell into a region of immunologic space defined by low to moderate Omicron NAbs and low Omicron CD8+ T cell responses (Fig. 5) , suggesting that failure of virologic control following Omicron challenge was associated with simultaneously low humoral and cellular immunity to the challenge virus. In contrast, animals with a low NAb titer but a high CD8+ T cell response, or a high NAb titer but a low CD8+ T cell response, demonstrated rapid virologic control following challenge (red arrows,",

These data suggest that immune parameters other than NAb responses likely contribute to protection against severe disease. We previously reported that CD8+ T cells contributed to protection against re-challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent macaques, particularly when antibody responses were suboptimal 30 . Taken together, our data suggest that protection against a highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant involves a combination of humoral and cellular immunity, and not antibody responses alone. Moreover, moderate levels of neutralizing antibodies without substantial CD8+ T cell responses may be insufficient for virologic control. These data have important implications for understanding vaccine immune correlates against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

However, 4 vaccinated animals with moderate Omicron-specific NAb titers but negligible Omicron-specific CD8+ T cell responses failed to control viral replication in NS by day 7. These data suggest the importance of vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cell responses and indicate that both humoral and cellular immune responses likely contribute to protection against the highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in macaques. Correlates of vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection have to date largely focused on neutralizing antibody titers 24,25 , although correlates of protection against severe disease may differ from correlates of protection against infection, and the potential importance of vaccine-elicited T cell responses may be greater for SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Omicron that largely escape NAb responses. In the present study, Omicron-specific NAbs were markedly lower than WA1/2020 NAbs, whereas Omicron-specific T cell responses were similar to WA1/2020 T cell responses, indicating substantial cross-reactivity of cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover, while BNT162b2 induced higher NAb responses than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad26.COV2.S induced higher CD8+ T cell responses than BNT162b2, consistent with human data 17,19,20 .

After staining, cells were washed and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde. All data were acquired on a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer. Subsequent analyses were performed using FlowJo software (BD Bioscience, v.9.9.6). For analyses, in singlet gate, dead cells were excluded by Aqua dye",
