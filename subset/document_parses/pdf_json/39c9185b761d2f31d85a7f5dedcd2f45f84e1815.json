Such perturbations break the homogeneity of the system, making its study challenging. In integrable models the most effective large-scale description of the dynamics in the presence of inhomogeneities is arguably the so-called \"generalised hydrodynamics\" (GHD) [29] [30] [31] . Although GHD correctly predicts the large-scale dynamics of local observables in numerous quench protocols (e.g., in the two-temperatures scenario), the information provided by the theory is sometimes incomplete. The first example of this kind was exhibited in Ref. [32] , considering the massive Heisenberg model: the ingredients of GHD are blind to observables that are odd under spin flip, entailing the inclusion of an additional independent continuity equation. An even more striking example was considered in Refs [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , in which GHD keeps a symmetry that is instead broken in the thermodynamic limit: observables not respecting that symmetry are affected by a class of localised perturbations at arbitrarily long times and large distances from the inhomogeneity.",

To this end we consider a modification of the so-called \"wing-flap protocol\" (see Fig. 1 ) introduced in Ref. [38] to provide insight into the quantum information scrambling. The system is prepared in a low-entangled stationary state, which, we assume, is also an eigenstate of the operator measured by Alice. We then go back in time (a trivial step, since the state is stationary) considering an alternative history in which, at some unknown but fixed ancient time, Bob had performed an unknown projective quantum measurement at an unknown but fixed large distance from Alice. Returning to an alternative present we wonder, following Ref. [39] , whether Alice can still recover the information she had without Bob's intervention. (2) the system evolves for a time \u2212t; (3) Bob applies a \"wing-flap\" perturbation W ; (4) the system evolves for a time t; (5) Alice measures O again. In Ref. [39] W is a \"blind\" local projective quantum measurement at the position of O (no information is kept), and step (5) is upgraded to a quantum state tomography. There it was shown that, if H describes a generic system, the local state can be recovered with a limited amount of effort. We simplify the protocol by trivialising the part highlighted in grey.",

            "text": "Generally, in a shift invariant quantum spin chain the distant Bob's measurement is not expected to have any effect on Alice's subsystem. In particular, Ref. [40] showed that, in noninteracting spin chains, relaxation to a Generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) is not compromised by a localised perturbation. In our setting this implies that, at late times, the effect of Bob's measurement on a finite subsystem fades away. We are not aware of any physical argument against the generalisation of this result to interacting integrable systems. Indeed, this conclusion is supported by numerical investigations, which generally show the irrelevance of localised perturbations on the state after long-enough time. Consider, for example, the numerical tests of the generalised hydrodynamic arXiv:2108.03230v2 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 2 Dec 2021 predictions of time evolution after two different states are joined together [41] . The tests always differ in the way the states are joined, nevertheless the asymptotic behaviours at large times match. In generic systems scrambling is even more pronounced, so a very distant quantum measurement in a low-entangled stationary state is not expected to have visible effects however large the time is. Incidentally, even if the state were not stationary and Bob measured an observable in Alice's subsystem, Alice would be able to recover the original local state [39] .",

We report a striking exception to the empirical rule that a distant localised perturbation in a low-entangled state of a quantum many-body system described by a translationally invariant Hamiltonian does not have visible effects at infinitely large times and distances. To the best of our knowledge, only one exception has been reported so far and it concerns systems prepared in the ground state when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Similarly, we consider an initial state that breaks the conserved charges that completely characterise a basis of energy eigenstates, but, differently, our initial state belongs to an exponentially large degenerate sector. We will show that, in the limit of large time, the jammed sector is asymptotically stable under the wingflap protocol. Quite exceptionally, we also demonstrate that the measurement results in a macroscopic change of the spin profiles on ballistic scales, namely its effect does not fade away at large times, the expectation values of local observables instead approaching nontrivial functions of the ratio between distance and time.",

If both spins at \u22121 and 0 are down,H(P ) acts as a right or left global shift of the spins up by one site.

Factor e i(L+N \u22121)k comes from the lag acquired by the configuration w.r.t. to the position of the effective particle, when the latter traverses the system. Each time a spin up jumps from 0 to \u22121, the right-most spin up remains fixed, except if it itself jumps between these two sites. The total acquired lag is therefore N \u22121 sites, so the configuration needs L+N \u22121 steps before returning to its initial position.

Suppose that the axis of the measurement is fixed. It can be obtained by rotating the z-axis by an angle \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0) around the xy-plane unit vectorn \u03d5 = (cos \u03d5, sin \u03d5, 0), parametrised by \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). Had Bob read off the result of the measurement, the spin would have collapsed into the stateIn our protocol, described in the main text, the measurement is instead blind: Bob does not read off its result.Hence, due to a classical uncertainty, the state after the measurement is computed as an average w.r.t. the Haar measure:The weight \u03c0 2 cos \u03c6 2 in the integral is the probability for the nonzero projection of the spin up onto the measurement axis.At time t after Bob's blind projective measurement at site \u22121, the density matrix of the system readswhere |\u03a8(0) = \u03c3 x \u22121 |\u03a6 , and |\u03a6 = |L n is a jammed state given in Eq. (4) of the main text. Alice's reduced density matrix at site x (at an odd distance x + 1 from Bob's measurement) in general readswhereIn the jammed state |\u03a6 = |L n Alice finds (note that x is even)On the other hand, in the time-evolved part of the state, |\u03a8(t) , the expectation values of Pauli matrices asymptotically depend only on the ray \u03b6 = x/t (we assume large distance x and time t), i.e., \u03a8(t)| \u03c3 \u03b1 x |\u03a8(t) = \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03b6 , \u03b1 \u2208 {x, y, z}. In particular, the z-component of spin at an even site far from Bob's measurement is asymptotically zero, i.e., \u03c3 z \u03b6 = 0 (see Fig. 3 of the main text). States |\u03a6 and |\u03a8(t) enter the classical mixture (S.12) with probabilities 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, whence we finally obtain p x,t = 1 3 \u03c3 x \u03b6 \u2212 2 cos \u03c0x n , \u03c3 y \u03b6 + 2 sin \u03c0x n , 0 .
