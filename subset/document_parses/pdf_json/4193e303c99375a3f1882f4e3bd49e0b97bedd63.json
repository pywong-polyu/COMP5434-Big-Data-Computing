An understanding of the antibody/S escape mutations landscape is urgently needed to preemptively address this threat. Here we describe a rapid method to identify escape mutants for nAbs targeting the S receptor binding site. We identified escape mutants for five nAbs, including three from the public germline class VH3-53 elicited by natural COVID-19 infection. Escape mutations predominantly mapped to the periphery of the ACE2 recognition site on the RBD with K417, D420, Y421, F486, and Q493 as notable hotspots. We provide libraries, methods, and software as an openly available community resource to accelerate new therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

A prophetic understanding of the mutations on S that could evade antibody recognition would enable development of better vaccine boosters and monoclonal antibody therapies. Thus, we sought to develop an S RBD yeast surface display (YSD) platform (Fig. S1 ) (9) , as we hypothesized that broad identification of SARS-CoV-2 S escape mutants could be found by integrating high throughput screening platforms with deep sequencing. While a similar platform uses the loss of nAb binding to identify escape mutants (10, 11) , we rationalized that a functional screening assay that directly measures the ability of a nAb to compete with ACE2 for S RBD binding, would be a comparatively strong predictor of RBD escapability, as it accounts for mutations in RBD that would disrupt S binding to ACE2.",

Six mAbs completely ablated ACE2 binding, one mAb partially inhibited ACE2, and the remaining four did not prevent ACE2 binding (Fig. 1c) . A direct correlation was observed between the previously determined neutralization potency of the antibody (6, 8) and the fluorescence signal increase in the competition assay (Fig. 1c) . We conclude from these experiments that, excluding the S309 epitope, the aglycosylated S RBD platform faithfully recapitulates binding interactions of nAbs with S RBD (7).",

It is made yeast displaying these RBD variants with a saturating concentration of nAb and then co-incubated with a saturating concentration of biotinylated ACE2. We then used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to screen for mutants that could bind ACE2, indicating that the RBD mutation allows for evasion of the nAb while not disrupting the ACE2 interaction critical for cell entry (Fig.  1d, Fig. S3-S4) . Importantly, a control with no ACE2 labeling was sorted to set an empirical false discovery rate (FDR) for putative escape mutant hits (Fig. 1d, Fig. S4 ). Plasmid DNA from sorted cells were prepped and deep sequenced. We determined the enrichment ratio (15) for each mutant in the sorted population relative to a reference population, and then used the control population to set the FDR (Fig. 1e, Fig S5) . We screened five different nAbs identified earlier as having completely ablated ACE2 binding (CC6.29, CC6.31, CC12.1, CC12.3, CC12.13). In all, we identified a total of 97 S RBD mutants that can escape recognition by at least one nAb (Table S2) .",

Antibodies CC12.1, CC12.3 and CC6.29 were screened against the original SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus as well as this panel of mutant pseudoviruses in duplicate (Fig. 1i) , and the resulting IC50s were compared to calculate the effect on antibody neutralization potency ( Fig. 1j; Fig. S12 ). Consistent with RBD mutagenesis library and structural analysis, CC6.29 failed to neutralize F486I, E484K, and T478R variants. Additionally, K417N, K417T, and D420K hotspot mutants completely escaped neutralization for both CC12.1 and CC12. 3 . The only instance we tested where the mutagenesis scanning data differed from the pseudovirus results was at N501Y that was predicted to confer escape from CC12.1 and CC12.3 but had no effect on the in vitro neutralization potency. Although it is unclear why this discrepancy occurred, we note that N501Y significantly increases the affinity of RBD for ACE2, which could result in ACE2 competing off bound nAb.",

The Y505W mutant shared by CC6.31, CC12.1, and CC12.3 also increases ACE2 affinity (10).",

            "text": "We puzzled why mutations at D420 were so deleterious to the neutralization potency of the VH3-53 nAbs given that this residue is on the outer periphery of the binding epitope. To obtain insight into this question, we performed 100 ns aqueous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CC12.1 and CC12.3 in complex with wildtype S RBD and S RBD incorporated with the D420E, D420K, or the Y421N mutation (see SI for details). In the control simulation with CC12.1, D420 on the RBD and CDRH2 S56 on CC12.1 form persistent hydrogen bonds, and Y421 on the RBD is tightly bound within a pocket of CC12.1 residues (Fig. 3a) . With the D420E mutation, the increased length of E420 disrupts its ability to hydrogen bond with S56, requiring it to adopt a bent conformation (Fig. 3b) . This forces Y421 out of the antibody pocket, causing increased fluctuations in neighboring RBD loops which persist throughout the entire 100 ns production simulation (Fig. S14a, b) . With the D420K mutation, hydrogen bonding with S56 is completely disrupted, and with the Y421N mutation, N421 is too short to interact with the antibody pocket (Fig. S14c) . Similar escape mechanisms are observed for CC12.3 with all three RBD mutations, including increased fluctuations at one of the same key sites (K458) on the RBD in response to the D420E mutation (Fig. S14d, e) .",

A survey of the existing escape mutant literature, along with escape mutants identified in the present work, allows us to identify the absolute and near-absolute escape resistant ACE2 receptor binding site (RBS) residues in the context of the original lineage (Fig.  3c) . One resistant patch is found around F456/Y473/N487/Y489 while other residues are discontinuous patches on the remainder of the RBS. We note that many of these same resistant residues are identical to those from SARS-CoV (Y449, N487, Y489, G496, T500 and G502). The lack of a contiguous surface at the RBS that is conserved makes it highly unlikely that one could identify a na\u00efve nAb targeting the RBS that is completely resistant to escape.",

While other platforms to identify escape mutants have recently been described, key advantages of the approach presented here includes: (i.) screening by competitive binding against ACE2 which more precisely mimics how actual viral infection can still persist despite antibody binding; (ii.) a robust and rigorous hit identification algorithm; (iii.) a safe working environment, as it does not use live virus; and (iv.) a relatively fast identification, as the RBD library can be screened against a given nAb and analyzed in under a week. There also exist drawbacks. First, the present method is limited to mapping escape mutants for anti-S-RBD nAbs that directly compete with ACE2 for binding. Many nAbs neutralize by targeting S epitopes across protomers (23) or on the N-terminal domain (24) , and a robust platform for S ectodomain display would enable more comprehensive studies. We attempted to develop a yeast platform for S ectodomain but were unsuccessful: we screened media composition, expression temperature, protein orientation (Fig. S15) , and mutations (1,909 mutants screened with only two potential hits) (Data S2-3, Table S1, Fig. S16) . Second, the presented assay measures the ability of a given mutant to escape nAb blockade of ACE2. While from all available data the assay appears to correlate well in the context of pseudo-virus, each mutation is pleiotropic with unknown fitness effects beyond escape for a given nAb; the true RBS escape mutants that do not appreciably impede viral fitness will be a subset of the mutations identified here.",

Antibodies are color coded according to neutralization potency(7). c.) Competitive binding between IgG and ACE2 was performed by labeled yeast displaying aglycosylated S RBD with 10 g/mL of indicated mAbs followed by labeling with biotinylated ACE2.d.) Single site saturation mutagenesis S RBD libraries were sorted by FACS using a competition experiment. The top cytogram shows the cell population collected for the control population without ACE2 labeling, while the bottom cytogram shows the cell population enriched in mutations able to bind ACE2 in the presence of a competing IgG. The specific cytogram shown is for nAb CC12.3 using the S RBD library corresponding to mutations at positions 437-537. e.) Per-mutation enrichment ratio distributions as a function of average depth of coverage control (top) and CC12.3 nAb competing experiment (bottom). f.) Heatmap showing predicted S RBD escape mutants for CC12.3 in blue. White cells are mutations with a p value for an FDR > 1, while grey cells are mutations not present in the mutational library. S RBD positions directly involved in binding ACE2 are colored gray. g.) Comparison of enrichment ratios (ER) for individual hits for CC12.3 vs. CC12.1. Closed circles represent escape mutant hits for both nAbs, whereas open circlers are escape mutant hits for only one nAb. h.) Solved structure of nAB CC12.3 in complex with S RBD (PDB ID 7KN6). i.)
