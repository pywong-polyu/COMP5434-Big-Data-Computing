TB-associated HLH (TB-HLH) is a rare condition, but it is fatal if not treated. The diagnosis of TB-HLH is challenging and might be missed if not highly considered. The classic manifestations of HLH include pancytopenia, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and coagulopathy. Herein, we present a young immunocompetent adult diagnosed with disseminated TB complicated by HLH. Our patient responded well to the combination of antituberculosis therapy(ATT), corticosteroid, and intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG). This case highlights the importance of considering this fatal complication in TB patients.",

The exact incidence of disseminated TB is not established, albeit, in a review, it is estimated to comprise < 2% of TB cases in immunocompetent adults [2] . Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by excessive activation of macrophage and T-cells, causing excessive cytokines production and subsequent immune-mediated injury of different body organs [3] . It usually occurs secondary to malignancy, infections, or autoimmune disorders [4] . HLH might rarely complicate the clinical course of disseminated TB. In a recent literature review (from 1975 to March 2014), only 63 cases of tuberculosis-associated HLH (TB-HLH) were found [5] . Herein, we report a challenging case of disseminated TB complicated by HLH in an immunocompetent adult with favorable outcomes.

In addition, pulmonary TB workup ( AFB sputum smear and PCR)and Quantiferon test were negative. The differential diagnosis was broad, including malignancy, autoimmune disease, and TB. We decided to request CT (computed tomography)of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis to look for any focus or lymphadenopathy. Pan CT revealed minimal ascites and right pleural effusion, hepatosplenomegaly, multiple small non-enhancing lesions in the splenic parenchyma, and multiple enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes (Figs. 2 and 3). Empirical antibiotics(piperacillin-tazobactam followed by meropenem) were started to cover for sepsis of unknown origin. Bone marrow examination showed significantly increased marrow histiocytes noted with a prominent feature of hemo-erythrophagocytosis. On day 21 of the hospital stay, peritoneal fluid tapping was done and revealed positive MTB PCR. In addition, based on CT findings, a biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node was done to rule out malignancy, specifically lymphoma.",

Upon discharge, her laboratory results are shown in Table 1 . Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient was following in TB virtual clinic. She showed significant improvement on the ATT regimen without any significant adverse effects. However, she traveled back to her home country in the fourth month of ATT, so we could not follow her until the end of therapy course.",

HIV has been associated with HLH; however, the HIV screen was negative in our patient. TB can lead to HLH on infrequent occasions [6] . The pathophysiology of HLH involves excessive immune system stimulation and cytokine storm. However, the underlying pathophysiology of TB-HLH is still unclear.MTB acts as an obligate intracellular organism after phagocytosis by macrophages. This activates macrophages and T-helper cells, further releasing a large number of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in TB -HLH clinical manifestations. In TB patients, the levels of interferon-g, tumor necrosis factora, and granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor are higher than those in a healthy population. On the other hand, HLH patients have increased levels of cytokines mentioned above (as a part of cytokines storm), which might explain how TB can lead to HLH [5, 7, 8] .",

There are two forms of HLH: a primary (mainly genetic) form, mainly occurring in pediatrics, and a secondary (reactive) form, which is the most common form [7] . Malignancy accounts for up to 70% of adult cases and carries the worst prognosis [9] . The symptoms of TB-HLH are nonspecific and usually chronic, including fever, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. Most patients (65%) with TB-HLH have comorbid conditions; however, our patient did not have any comorbidity. The most common clinical signs of TB-HLH include fever(almost 100% of cases), hepatosplenomegaly(70% of cases), and lymphadenopathy(70% of cases). Regarding the laboratory findings in TB-HLH, pancytopenia has been detected in more than 50% of the reported cases. Interestingly, for unexplained mechanisms, serum triglyceride level has been found to be elevated in most TB-HLH cases, including our case [5] . There are two main diagnostic scoring systems for HLH: Hscore (the newest one)and HLH-2004 [3, 10] . The discussion of those diagnostic systems is beyond the scope of our case report, albeit our patient met the criteria for both diagnostic systems. Notably, the presence of hemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirate is not essential to diagnose HLH ( sensitivity=83% and specificity=60%) [9] . Although MTB is present throughout the lungs in disseminated(or miliary) TB, acidfast bacilli(AFB) could not be detected on sputum microscopy in several cases, as in this case. In our case, MTB was initially detected from PCR of peritoneal fluid, and then MTB was isolated from the cultures of different specimens (took up to 6 weeks) [11] .",
