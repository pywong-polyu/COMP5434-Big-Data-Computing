Some countries have already achieved high vaccination rates, offering a glimpse into the so-called \"post-vaccination\" world. We describe here a striking comparison between the similarly-sized and neighboring countries of Bahrain and Qatar. While both countries have achieved impressive vaccination rates, cases increased to unprecedented levels in one country, while decreasing steadily in the other. Although this could be attributed to a number of factors, we argue here that the heavy reliance on alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines may have contributed to these discrepant outcomes. We then expand the analysis to compare the top 10 vaccinated countries, and compare their outcomes based on their reliance on inactivated virus vaccines. The results remarkably align with the initial findings seen in With the race to vaccinate the world against SARS-CoV-2 well on its way, many countries have already achieved impressive vaccination rates, and are quickly reaping the benefits. Yet not all highly-vaccinated populations are seeing the same results. A striking example of such divergent outcomes is currently being seen in the neighboring states of Qatar and Bahrain. In an impressive feat, both nations have vaccinated more than 50% of their population. And while in Qatar infection rates have decreased in a reassuring manner, infection rates have surprisingly sky-rocketed to unprecedented and alarming levels in Bahrain ( Figure 1 ).",

The BIBP vaccine's mechanism is based on an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus with an alum adjuvant. It has been shown to efficiently induce the production of neutralizing antibodies , but there are no studies that directly compare the neutralizing antibody activity from this vaccine to others. One study by Khoury et al used modeling to predict the protective efficacy of different vaccines in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection based on neutralizing antibody titers (Khoury et al., 2021) . While this study did not address the BIBP vaccine directly, it did show that Coronavac, which is also an alumadjuvanted inactivated virus vaccine, had less protective efficacy compared to mRNA and adenovirus-vector vaccines, and that lower protective efficacy correlated strongly with lower 4 neutralizing antibody titers. This study also predicted that a lower starting efficacy would result in a larger reduction in efficacy over time and against variants (Khoury et al., 2021) .",

Data on the cellular immune responses to the BIBP vaccine is lacking. However, it is generally accepted that alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines induce no or weak cellular responses, specifically cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses (Jeyanathan et al., 2020) . On the other hand, mRNA and adenovirus-vector vaccines have shown robust, Th1 predominant cellular adaptive immune responses, with the production of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells (Anderson et al., 2020; Ewer et al., 2021; Jeyanathan et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020) (Anderson et al., 2020; Ewer et al., 2021; Walsh et al., 2020) . The presence of cellular immune responses in combination with neutralizing antibodies is thought to confer long-lasting immunity, and improve outcomes in the case of acute infection (Dan et al., 2021; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020) . In addition, while emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have shown significant escape from neutralizing antibody activity, the activity of cellular immune responses against variants appears to be preserved (Geers et al., 2021) .",

While it is true that the BIBP vaccine showed an efficacy of 73-78% against symptomatic infection, according to an interim-analysis of a phase 3 RCT of the vaccine(Al Kaabi et al., 2021) , it should be noted that the data was collected on young healthy adults (mean age 36.1 years), and for a median follow-up of only 77 days, ending on December 20, 2020. As such, we do not have conclusive data on the duration of protection conferred by the BIBP vaccine, its efficacy in vulnerable populations, its efficacy against variants of concern, its efficacy in preventing severe disease, or its efficacy in preventing transmission of infection. On the other hand, efficacy in the above domains has been demonstrated for mRNA as well as adenovirus-vector vaccines(Public Health England, 2021).",
