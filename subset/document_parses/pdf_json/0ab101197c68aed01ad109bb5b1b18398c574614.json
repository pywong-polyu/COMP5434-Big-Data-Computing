            "text": "The risk of fomite-mediated transmission in the clinic is substantially increasing amid the recent COVID-19 pandemic as personal protective equipment (PPE) of hospital workers is easily contaminated by direct contact with infected patients. In this context, it is crucial to devise a means to reduce such transmission. Herein, we report an antimicrobial, antiviral, and antibiofouling trifunctional polymer that can be easily coated onto the surface of medical protective clothing to effectively prevent pathogen contamination on the PPE. The coating layer is formed on the surfaces of PPE by the simple spray coating of an aqueous solution of the trifunctional polymer, poly(dodecyl methacrylate (DMA)\u2212poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA)\u2212quaternary ammonium (QA)). To establish an optimal ratio of antifouling and antimicrobial functional groups, we performed antifouling, antibacterial, and antiviral tests using four different ratios of the polymers. Antifouling and bactericidal results were assessed using Staphylococcus aureus, a typical pathogenic bacterium that induces an upper respiratory infection. Regardless of the molar ratio, polymer-coated PPE surfaces showed considerable antiadhesion (\u223c65\u221275%) and antibacterial (\u223c75\u221287%) efficacies soon after being in contact with pathogens and maintained their capability for at least 24 h, which is sufficient for disposable PPEs. Further antiviral tests using coronaviruses showed favorable results with PPE coated at two specific ratios (3.5:6:0.5 and 3.5:5.5:1) of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA). Moreover, biocompatibility assessments using the two most effective polymer ratios showed no recognizable local or systemic inflammatory responses in mice, suggesting the potential of this polymer for immediate use in the field.",

Hydro-philic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and zwitterions are commonly used to weaken the interactions between coated surfaces and potential foulants. 5\u22127 Although these polymer brushes hindered the bacterial adhesion and the formation of biofilm, the antifouling property alone without a direct bactericidal property could not eliminate the pathogens that managed to reach the surface through the polymer brushes. 8, 9 In another strategy, surface decorations with antimicrobial peptides, silver-or gold-based nanomaterials, and polycationic compounds have been used to achieve contact-killing of pathogens. 10\u221215 However, these approaches for functionalizing the surfaces of fomites require a multistep fabrication process involving hazardous chemical solvents and show antimicrobial potency that is limited to only certain pathogens; even if it was assumed that these solvents cleared all regulatory processes, these limitations would hamper practical use in the field. 16\u221219 Thus, it is vastly more desirable to design a practical, ready-to-use coating material that shows both antibiofouling and antimicrobial efficacy against a broad spectrum of infectious pathogens.",

An additional finding of note compared to our previous antifouling polymer is that we have tested and confirmed the postmodification of the naive surfaces of medical protective clothing by a facile spray coating method, which warrants the practicality for use in the field. The following evaluations of the antifouling, antibacterial, and antiviral effects of protective coatings of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) were shown to effectively reduce the viability of inbound pathogens.

The antibiofouling and antimicrobial polymer, poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA), was synthesized from the corresponding monomers using a twostep process consisting of radical polymerization and methylation ( Figure 1 ). In the first step, poly(DMA-PEGMA-DMAEMA) was synthesized through radical polymerization of lauryl methacrylate (DMA), poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA), and 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) at four different molar feed ratios of each monomer (3.5:6:0.5, 3.5:5.5:1, 3.5:5:1.5, and 3.5:4.5:2) ( Figure S1 ). In the second step, the tertiary amine group of DMAEMA in each polymer was converted to QA by reacting it with excess iodomethane, yielding four poly(DMA-PEGMA- QA) structures ( Figure S2 ). Because of the presence of highly hydrophilic PEG and QA, the final polymers were fairly soluble in an aqueous solution despite the presence of a long alkyl chain DMA moiety. The rationale for maxing out QA content at 20% is based on the fact that most commercially available quaternary ammonium disinfectant concentrates contain no more than 20% QA, as this is sufficient to kill microbes without causing undesirable collateral damage.",

            "text": "The PPE fabric, boho, made from polyolefin fiber, was used as a model medical protective clothing in tests of whether poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) can be coated onto a substrate through spray coating. It was anticipated that the dodecyl chain of DMA in the polymer would readily anchor onto the hydrophobic surface of the PPE fabric via hydrophobic or van der Waals interactions, resulting in the formation of a nanoscale coating layer, such as that observed in our previous report on urinary catheter coatings ( Figure 1B ). 20 The multiple copies of PEG chains on poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)coated substrates are predicted to exert an antiadhesion effect against incoming airborne pathogens, 30\u221232 whereas antimicrobial QA groups are expected to disinfect the pathogens in contact with the polymer-coated surfaces by disrupting the negatively charged cell membranes of bacteria or enveloped viruses, causing cell lysis. 29,33\u221235 The polymer-coated layers, which were facilely formed by spraying an aqueous solution of the polymer (20 mg/mL in water) onto a PPE fabric, were characterized using various means, including static water contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Each of these measurements was performed on air-dried fabric samples 1 week after the polymer coating process. The water contact angle of a non-coated PPE fabric was 100\u00b0\u00b1 3.7\u00b0; this angle was dramatically decreased to 50.2\u00b0\u00b1 4.3\u00b0for a fabric surface coated with poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) prepared at a monomer ratio of 3.5:6:0.5, indicating that the hydrophobic fabric surface is converted to a hydrophilic surface after the polymer coating process. The contact angle of polymer-coated fabric surfaces decreased as the percentage of QA in the polymer increased, decreasing to 38.3\u00b0\u00b1 4.5\u00b0, 21.8\u00b0\u00b1 3.5\u00b0, and 15.1 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0for monomer ratios of 3.5:5.5:1, 3.5:5:1.5, and 3.5:4.5:2, respectively, indicating the successful formation of a polymer coating layer using a spray-coating method ( Figure  2A ). XPS scans further revealed substantial alterations in the chemical compositions and concentrations of C, O, and N elements present on the four polymer-coated PPE fabric surfaces compared with that of an uncoated PPE fabric. Notable peak changes were observed in C 1s narrow scans with peaks corresponding to C\u2212O\u2212C (282 eV) and O\u2212C\ue0c8O (284.5 eV) bonds being detected only in the polymer-coated surface and not in the parent polyolefin PPE fabric. C\u2212O\u2212C peaks are originated from acrylate and PEG chain groups, and O\u2212C\ue0c8O peaks are attributed to acrylate groups within the polymer. A significant surge in the oxygen peak at \u223c528 eV was also characteristic of the polymer-coated surface owing to the presence of oxygen within acrylate and PEG chain groups, in keeping with the barely existent oxygen in the parent PPE fabric. Lastly, only polymer-coated surfaces displayed nitrogen peaks owing to the presence of the QA moiety ( Figure 2B) . We noticed slight nitrogen peak shifting for the 3.5:6:0.5 ratio, but small changes in the X-ray radiation power and chamber temperature can cause minimal peak shifting in the margin of error; thus, it was not taken into account. 36, 37 Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) measurements of polymers showed ( Figure S3 ) the peaks at 700\u22121200, 1200\u22121700, 1700\u22122200, and 2200\u22122700 (m/z) regions. The most abundant polymer mass ranged from 900 to 1200, and additional mass peaks were observed in 450 to 500 increments. Since poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) is a random copolymer, we expect such mass increment values to correspond to mono-PEGMA, di-DMA, tri-QA, mono-DMA, The PPE fabrics applied with airborne bacteria were incubated for 0.5, 1, and 2 h at ambient temperature, respectively. The incubated bacteria were detached by gentle vortexing and sonication followed by measurements of the viability of collected bacteria using the L/D bacterial viability kit. All data are represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. A two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni posthoc test was performed. Compared with non-coated PPE fabrics at 30 min, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001; at 1 h, # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01, and ### p < 0.001; at 2 h, $ p < 0.05, $$ p < 0.01, and $$$ p < 0.001. and di-QA. Besides, due to PEG in PEGMA, constant spacing between each peak with a m/z value of around 44 was observed ( Figure S3 ).",

The surface roughness of each polymer-coated fabric surface, analyzed by atomic force scanning microscopy (AFM), remained low at different monomer molar ratios: 95.4 nm for 3.5:6:0.5, 103 nm for 3.5:5.5:1, 90.7 nm for 3.5:5:1.5, and 57.4 nm for 3.5:4.5:2, suggesting that the wear rate of the polymer layer due to abrasion and friction should remain low ( Figure S4 ). 38 Furthermore, to demonstrate the durability of the polymer coating, we analyzed the water contact angle of polymer-coated (3.5:4.5:2 ratio as a representative) PPE fabrics for 7 days consecutively. Initially, consistent with our prior contact angle measurements for coating evaluation, we observed a substantial decrease of the water contact angle to \u223c28.7\u00b0\u00b1 2.2\u00b0, reassuring the formation of a hydrophilic coating layer. Throughout the daily measurements of the contact angle for 7 days, no notable changes were observed, suggesting that once formed the polymer coating layer is stable for at least 7 days ( Figure S5A ). Furthermore, the contact angle measurements of polymer-coated PPE kept in a moisturized condition (\u223c80% humidity) were reliably stable for at least 24 h, reassuring the stability of the formed spray-coated polymer layer in a practical situation where PPE can be easily exposed to a humidified condition ( Figure S5B ). Collectively, these characterizations indicate that the polymer coating layer is facilely formed on a PPE fabric substrate by a simple spraying method. Besides, although currently used PPEs in the field are mostly disposable due to the contamination and related health concerns, our coated polymer layer is stable for at least 7 days, possibly elongating the lifespan of conventional PPEs.",

Unlike poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA), which has only antibiofouling properties, poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) is expected to exhibit both antibiofouling and antibacterial properties owing to the presence of QA. 20 S. aureus, one of the most common bacteria strains that cause respiratory infections, 39\u221241 was used to examine antibacterial effects of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA). Bacteria in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of \u223c0.2 were incubated at a 1:1 v/v ratio with 20 mg/mL poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA) or poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) at a monomer ratio of 3.5:4.5:2 (final polymer concentration: 10 mg/mL). Whereas poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA) showed negligible antibacterial effects, poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) showed substantial bactericidal efficacy, as evidenced by a decrease in OD 600 to 0.38 versus 0.58 in the controls; by comparison, the OD 600 for poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA) was 0.53 ( Figure 3A ). Live/Dead (L/D) viability assays confirmed the notable antibacterial effect of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA), which exhibited an L/D ratio of 1.47, a value much lower than that for untreated controls (2.69) and poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA) (2.44) ( Figure 3B ). Fluorescence imaging using SYTO 9, which is detected as green fluorescence in live bacteria, and propidium iodide (PI), which fluoresces red in apoptotic bacteria, further confirmed that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) treatment led to large numbers of dead bacterial aggregates ( Figure 3C ). Next, we assessed the antibacterial effects of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) under harsher conditions. Specifically, four poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) formulations prepared from four different molar ratios of each monomer were incubated with suspensions of S. aureus bacteria in Luria broth (LB) media (OD 600 \u2248 0.2) at a final concentration of 10 mg polymer/mL for 24 h. All polymers effectively suppressed bacterial growth even in LB media conditions ( Figure 3D ). As expected, an increase in the QA ratio in the polymer resulted in greater bactericidal efficacy with ratios of 3.5:6:0.5, 3.5:5.5:1, 3.5:5:1.5, and 3.5:4.5:2 producing OD 600 values of 0.43, 0.42, 0.37, and 0.32, respectively, compared with 0.64 for the controls. A similar trend was observed for L/D assays ( Figure 3E ) and fluorescence imaging of live and dead cells ( Figure 3F ). Collectively, these results clearly indicate that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA), unlike poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA), exerts a considerable bactericidal effect in a manner that is proportional to the content of the permanently positively charged QA moiety in the polymer.",

            "text": "Antibiofouling and Antibacterial Effects of Poly-(DMA-PEGMA-QA)-Coated PPE Fabric Surfaces. Having confirmed the successful coating of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) on a PPE fabric surface and the considerable antibacterial effect of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) in solution, we next examined the antibiofouling and bactericidal effects of the polymer coating on a commercially available PPE using S. aureus. We first incubated a solution of S. aureus (3.0 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL in LB) on polymer-coated PPE surfaces for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and then tested whether the polymer-coating layer could block nonspecific adsorption of bacteria on the corresponding surface. SEM images revealed substantial amounts of individual and aggregated bacteria on a bare PPE fabric surface, whereas the number of bacteria was remarkably reduced on polymer-coated surfaces regardless of monomer ratio ( Figure 4A ). In higher magnification (25 000\u00d7) representative SEM images, we were also able to observe that bacteria incubated on a bare PPE surface showed an intact phenotype, whereas bacterial morphology was distorted on all surfaces coated with poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) regardless of the ratio owing to cellular membrane disruption by the presence of QA ( Figure  4B ). This observation suggests that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) may also be effective against drug-resistant microbes, pathogens rapidly becoming a problem in hospitals. 42 Representative images of incubated agar plates after spreading of surface-detached bacteria showed an obvious reduction in bacterial viability ( Figure 4C) . We next performed quantitative analyses of the antibiofouling and antibacterial potency of PPE surfaces coated with poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA). Crystal violet (CV) assays confirmed a reduction in the adhesion of S. aureus onto polymer-coated PPE fabric surfaces that ranged from \u223c65% to 75% depending on the content of the QA moiety in each polymer ( Figure 4D ). This reduced bacterial adhesion may be attributable to the presence of multiple PEG groups on the polymer-coated surfaces. 43, 44 Next, the viability of bacteria remaining on the surfaces was quantified using a commercial WST-8 assay and an analysis of bacteria colony-forming units (CFUs). WST-8 assays revealed significant reductions (\u223c75\u2212 87%) in live bacteria on all poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)-coated substrates regardless of monomer ratio ( Figure 4E ). For bacterial CFU assays, S. aureus remaining on surfaces after incubation were detached by gentle vortexing and sonication, and the detached bacterial solution was spread on blood agar plates at different dilution factors. CFU counts performed at a 10 000\u00d7 dilution revealed that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)coated PPE was consistently effective in reducing the viability of contacting S. aureus by \u223c70\u221286% ( Figure 4F ). On the other hand, a poly(DMA-PEGMA-AA) coating without the quaternary ammonium group did not exert an efficient antibacterial effect as much, probably due to the absence of a direct bactericidal QA functional moiety, suggesting the necessity of antibacterial efficacy on top of the antifouling property ( Figure  S6 ). Further long-term antibacterial test of polymer-coated (3.5:4.5:2 ratio as a representative) PPE fabrics showed that the functionality of the poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) layer was stable for at least 7 days supporting the durability of the coating layer ( Figure S7) .",

After the incubation, the bacteria on each PPE fabric were detached via vortexing and the viability of the bacteria was assessed using the L/D bacterial viability kit. Regardless of the ratio, the viability of airborne bacteria sprayed and incubated on poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)-coated PPE fabrics rapidly reduced starting at an early time point of 0.5 h. Within 0.5 h of exposure to the poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) layer, the viability of airborne bacteria was decreased by \u223c29\u221235% compared to that of the non-coated fabric. As we analyzed for longer periods, we witnessed a further reduction in airborne bacteria in contact with the poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) layer, and by the time of the 2 h incubation, the viability dropped to \u223c42\u221247% compared to the control for all ratios ( Figure 4H ). Collectively, separate from the monomer ratios, PPE fabrics spray-coated with poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) are capable of effectively killing pathogens within a short period (<0.5 h) in a bacteria airborne condition mimicking the actual circumstances. Despite our effort to find the optimized monomer ratios of the polymer, the combined antifouling and antibacterial results between polymers of varying monomer ratios were marginal. This was probably because, unlike the previous surface graftable polymer with 35\u221245% quaternization, 42, 45 we have limited the biocidal QA content of our polymer to 20% in an effort to minimize the biocompatibility concern, and content changes of PEG and QA were rather not drastic among the groups. For future reference, analysis using a polymer with higher QA composition may exhibit improved results with tendencies. However, to use such polymers in practice, thorough biocompatibility tests will be required to pass safety regulations.",

Viruses remaining on the surfaces were detached by gentle vortexing. Interestingly, poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)-coated PPE surfaces showed a trend in antiviral activity different from that obtained using an aqueous solution of the polymers, which showed considerable antiviral activity regardless of monomer ratio. Specifically, whereas PPE surfaces coated with polymers with monomer ratios of 3.5:6:0.5 and 3.5:5.5:1 exerted high antiviral efficacy, polymer-coated surfaces coated with polymers with monomer ratios of 3.5:5:1.5 and 3.5:4.5:2 were ineffective in reducing virus viability compared with the uncoated bare PPE surface ( Figure 5C,D) . Although this unexpected result is difficult to interpret, it is clear that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) containing a relatively lower QA molar ratio (0.5 or 1.0) and PPE surfaces coated with it exert strong antiviral activity against the coronavirus, PEDV.

The biocompatibility of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) with monomer ratios of 3.5:6:0.5 and 3.5:5.5:1, which exerted potent antibacterial and antiviral activity, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. For cell viability assays, each polymer was coated onto a conventional polystyrene-based cell culture plate under aqueous conditions, 49 and fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) were cultured on coated plates for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Unlike their demonstrated toxicity against bacteria and coronavirus at a working concentration (20 mg/mL), neither polymer-coated surfaces affected the viability of fibroblasts up to a 5-fold higher polymer concentration, 100 mg/mL ( Figure 6A ), suggesting that these polymers are selectively biocompatible with mammalian cells compared to bacteria and viruses. Further in vivo biocompatibility tests were performed using each polymer-coated PPE fabric substrate, as illustrated in Figure  6B . Symptoms of skin irritation and corrosion were assessed after attaching each polymer-coated PPE onto the shaved back of a mouse for 24 h, a paradigm chosen to simulate real-world conditions in which medical personnel wear protective clothing for a longer period without removing it for disposal. This is a far more rigorous condition than the standard skin irritation assessment protocol (chemical\u2212skin interaction time \u2264 4 h) described in the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for classification and labeling of chemicals and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The characteristic erythematous rash and desquamation of skin under the condition of inflammation were not observed. 50 Further histological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and toluidine blue (TB) staining revealed that local skin tissues applied with PPE fabrics coated with either polymer ratios at 20 and 100 mg/mL produced few clinical symptoms of skin irritation, as determined by infiltration of inflammatory and mast cells and Draize scoring (data not shown) (Figures 6C and S8 ). In addition, splenomegaly was not observed, indicating that there was no systemic inflammatory immune cell accumulation ( Figure S9 ). It has been well reported that splenomegaly is related to various infectious and systemic inflammatory diseases. The total number of splenocytes and spleen mass are increased in the systemic inflammation, as the spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ. 51 In particular, spleen enlargement could provide appropriate prognosis information for systemic mastocytosis in which mast cells accumulate in the skin from the inflammatory response. 52 Collectively, our results indicate that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)-coated PPE surfaces can be considered biocompatible and safe for use.",

It should be noted that, owing to the hydrophilic components of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA), this type of polymer is fairly soluble in aqueous solution, circumventing possible biocompatibility issues of other antimicrobial polymers that involve the use of alcohol or hazardous chemical solvents. We also demonstrated the importance of the quaternary ammonium (QA) moiety and further established optimal molar ratios in poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) for antibacterial and antiviral effects. Finally, biocompatibility tests showed that poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)coated surfaces do not induce any noticeable toxicities against fibroblasts in vitro or skin in vivo, suggesting the possibility of immediate use in the field. Taken together, our findings suggest that the antifouling, antimicrobial, and antiviral trifunctional polymer demonstrated herein can be used to minimize fomite-mediated transmission of various pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, by a simple spray coating of medical or other protective clothing surfaces. This easy-to-use, multifunctional polymer coating holds significant promise in stopping fomite transmission of fatal pathogens in the prevailing pandemic environment.",

Reversible addition\u2212fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization was carried out using 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) (Sigma-Aldrich) as an initiator (2% of total mmol) and 2-cyano-2-propyl benzodithioate as a chain-transfer agent (3.5% of total mmol) at 70\u00b0C for 16 h under nitrogen. After the reaction, polymerization was quenched by exposure to air, and the reaction mixtures were purified by dialysis against distilled water for 48 h, followed by lyophilization to obtain the intermediate polymer, poly(DMA-PEGMA-DMAEMA). Finally, dimethylaminoethyl (DMAE) groups in the respective polymers were converted into quaternary ammonium (QA) groups by reacting the polymers with excess methyl iodide in anhydrous THF for 24 h at room temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, THF was removed using a rotary evaporator and the solution was vacuum desiccated for at least 24 h. Synthesis of the final product was confirmed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker 400; Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA, USA).",

Polymer-coated PPEs were incubated with coronavirus in culture media (DMEM supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.02% yeast extract, and 2 \u03bcg of trypsin) for 1 h in a 4\u00b0C incubator. After incubation, the virus suspension was collected for TCID 50 assays. (D) Surfaceremaining viruses on the PPE substrate were detached by vortexing, and TCID 50 assays were performed. N.D, nondetected. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM (***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05; one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test). Antiviral effects of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) per se in aqueous solution were tested by incubating PEDV with poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA) at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Subsequent assays of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) showed that the polymers substantially reduced (by \u223c76\u2212 86%) the viability of coronavirus in a manner that depended on the ratio of each monomer (Figure 5B), indicative of their antiviral activity. Next, we assessed the antiviral effects of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA)-coated PPE surfaces. PEDVs were suspended on each polymer-coated PPE for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and their antiviral activity was assessed by measuring TCID 50 values of viable viruses remaining both in solution and on the coated surfaces (",
