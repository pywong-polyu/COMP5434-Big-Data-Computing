            "text": "A pressure ulcer is an injury of the skin and underlying tissues adjacent to a bony eminence. Patients who suffer from this disease may have difficulty accessing medical care. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this situation. Automatic diagnosis based on machine learning (ML) brings promising solutions. Traditional ML requires complicated preprocessing steps for feature extraction. Its clinical applications are thus limited to particular datasets. Deep learning (DL), which extracts features from convolution layers, can embrace larger datasets that might be deliberately excluded in traditional algorithms. However, DL requires large sets of domain specific labeled data for training. Labeling various tissues of pressure ulcers is a challenge even for experienced plastic surgeons. We propose a superpixel-assisted, region-based method of labeling images for tissue classification. The boundary-based method is applied to create a dataset for wound and re-epithelialization (re-ep) segmentation. Five popular DL models (U-Net, DeeplabV3, PsPNet, FPN, and Mask R-CNN) with encoder (ResNet-101) were trained on the two datasets. A total of 2836 images of pressure ulcers were labeled for tissue classification, while 2893 images were labeled for wound and re-ep segmentation. All five models had satisfactory results. DeeplabV3 had the best performance on both tasks with a precision of 0.9915, recall of 0.9915 and accuracy of 0.9957 on the tissue classification; and a precision of 0.9888, recall of 0.9887 and accuracy of 0.9925 on the wound and re-ep segmentation task. Combining segmentation results with clinical data, our algorithm can detect the signs of wound healing, monitor the progress of healing, estimate the wound size, and suggest the need for surgical debridement.

The causal mechanism is application of pressure to the skin exceeding end capillary pressure, which is 20-30 mmHg. Since no blood can flow in, the tissues gradually undergo necrosis. However, simply applying that level of pressure to the skin may not necessarily result in a pressure ulcer. It was found that pressure must persist for more than 2 hours to cause irreversible ischemic damage [1] . Etiological factors in the development of pressure ulcers include medical conditions, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, shock, malnutrition, antidepressant use, and catheter use [2] . Major surgery or trauma are also contributing factors.",

In Europe, the prevalence rate in hospitals ranges from 8.3% to 23% across different countries [4] . The prevalence rate is higher in long-term care facilities than in hospitals [2, 5] . Although this tissue had got attention from the public, the prevalence of pressure ulcers has remained unchanged over the last decade [3, 6] . As the life span of humans increases, the affected population is expected to rise. Another problem of growing concern is that patients with pressure ulcers often have difficulty accessing medical care because of their underlying diseases.

The first is wound segmentation; the other is tissue classification [12] [13] [14] . Wound segmentation is necessary to separate the wound area from the non-wound area. There are three standard methods to achieve this result: threshold, edge-based and region-based segmentation. Threshold segmentation applies algorithms to separate pixels of the wound in a wound image from pixels of normal skin, which are more homogeneous in intensity [15] [16] [17] . Edgebased segmentation initializes an approximate shape as a border, such as an ellipse or circle. At each iteration, the border is adjusted to minimize the energy function so that the final border fits the edge of the wound [18, 19] . Region-based segmentation selects a small region of the wound and gradually recruits adjacent pixels with similar color energy [20, 21] . The above methods can be further combined to acquire better results [22, 23] . After successful wound segmentation, the size of a wound can be further calculated. Although the size of a wound is the most direct information about wound healing, it is of less clinical usage than the tissue composition of a wound. A pressure ulcer usually takes weeks to months to decrease in size.",

Usually, the luminance components such as the Y channel or L channel are excluded to decrease the light effect in various clinical situations.

After passing through CNN layers, such as ResNet pretrained with a dilated network for feature extraction, the model adopts whole and multiple sub-regional features from larger size to smaller size, which calls a pyramid pooling module. Then, the model up-samples all the sub-regional features and then concatenates the original feature map to form a single layer. The standard Dice loss was chosen as the loss function of U-Net.",

In addition to our testing dataset, images from the Medetec Wound Database were used to test the performance on wound segmentation, re-ep detection ( Fig 5) and tissue classification inside wounds (S4 Fig). Finally, we chose to use DeeplabV3 for the two main tasks in our automatic diagnosis algorithm (S5 Fig). However, it is worth noting that although Mask R-CNN is a powerful model, it performed worse than all other models on the tissue classification task. Mask R-CNN outputs instance segmentation by first defining the bounding box for objects and then proposing segmentation masks. If the bounding box is not defined correctly, the mask will not be segmented correctly. In many ulcerations, granulation tissue encases or intermingles with the slough tissue or vice versa, which presents the wrong range of bounding boxes as well as masks, as shown in Fig 6. The actual wound pixels are then underestimated, and recall is affected the most. This will not cause much of an issue for models that perform semantic segmentation.",

SLIC, a k-means clustering algorithm, has become the most popular superpixel algorithm [29] . Several modified versions of SLIC have been proposed. For example, linear spectral clustering (LSC) uses a ten-dimensional space to get a better boundary [38] . The superpixel based edge detection algorithm (SBED) is a centroid updating approach to decrease the effect from noise [39] . These versions all demand a higher level of computer calculation. We have adopted the original SLIC to draw boundaries for tissues, because it has three crucial properties: it is fast and simple [40] ; it uses a regular shape and similar size; it delivers good adhesion to the object border.",

Among different classes combination, we found that re-ep training with ulceration had better results than re-ep training with other tissues (granulation, eschar, and slough). This finding cannot be easily explained by data numbers. The total pixels of ulceration were more than the sum of the three types of other tissues (S1 Fig) . When re-ep was trained with ulceration, it was actually more in the minority, increasing the degree of imbalance, which should theoretically result in worse re-ep classification [48, 49] . Class overlapping is another factor that will deteriorate classification results. Neither can it be explained by class overlapping because re-ep is more likely to overlap with ulceration than with the other tissues [50] .",

In a study of ImageNet (a large dataset of images comprising a large number of classes consisting of a small number of individual objects), Abramovich et al. found that including more classes improves the accuracy of model classifiers [51] . This is because sorting objects into more classes is an operation of supervised feature extraction. Other studies have found that merging classes can improve a classifier's accuracy because it reduces the inter-class labeling errors of the dataset [52] . For example, if we sorted Giant pandas as Ursus (bear), it would be wrong because they belong to the genus Ailuropoda. Whereas, if we merged Ursus and Ailuropoda into the family Ursidae, Giant pandas could be classed as Ursidae correctly. However, the status of our datasets does not fit the circumstances of the above studies completely. First, our dataset has a different composition from ImageNet, with a small number of classes, each consisting of a large number of individual pixels. Secondly, Re-ep is not a class that can be merged into other classes. Re-ep tissue was more likely to be classified as background when training with other tissues because it lies outside of the wounds, is distinct from the other tissues and comprises a smaller number of pixels.",

Though some studies have considered more tissue types [53, 54] , we used only three primary tissues (granulation, slough, and eschar) for several reasons. More types of tissue increase the difficulty of labeling and augment inter-rater variability. Classifying more tissues may not affect clinical judgement of wound healing. Granulation is the most critical tissue of wound healing to be observed. However, detection of only three types of tissues has limitations if we want the DL model to output more advanced suggestions, such as the need for reconstructive surgery.",

Moreover, our segmentation results did not include the depth information of pressure ulcers. To solve the above problems, 3D wound surface images are needed. Special devices are required to gather more images and information, such as stereo images, multiview by structure light guided or light detection and ranging (LIDAR) guided (time of flight (ToF) array).",

Combining the segmentation results and other clinical information, our algorithm can detect the signs of wound healing, monitor the progress of wound healing, estimate the size of a wound and suggest the need for surgical intervention.
