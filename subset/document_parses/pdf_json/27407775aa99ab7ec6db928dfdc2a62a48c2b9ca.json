            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus causing a global pandemic. Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The virus has four essential structural proteins which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and small envelope (E) protein. Different technologies are being used for vaccine development to battle the pandemic. There are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, protein subunit-based vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines and viruslike particle-based vaccines. Vaccine development has five stages. In the clinical developmental stage, vaccine development can be sped up by combining phase 1 and 2. The vaccines can also be approved more swiftly on an emergent basis and released sooner for usage. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines for emergency use. There are other vaccines that have been approved around the world. The mRNA vaccines have been created using a novel technology and they contain a synthetically created RNA sequence of virus fragments encoding the S-protein which is injected. These vaccines have a relatively low cost of production and faster manufacturing time but can have comparatively lower immunogenicity and more than one dose of vaccine may be required. In the case of viral vector-based vaccines, genes encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are isolated and following gene sequencings are introduced into the adenovirus vector. These vaccines have a relatively fast manufacturing time but the efficacy of the vaccine is variable based on the host's immune response to the viral vector. At the time of this paper, there were 81 vaccines in clinical development stage and 182 vaccines in preclinical development stage. Vaccines are an essential tool in our battle against COVID-19. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines have completed their phase III trials while many other potential vaccines are still in developmental stages. It used to take close to a decade for a vaccine to be developed and undergo rigorous testing until its production and availability to the public, but over the past year, we have seen multiple vaccines in different phases of testing against SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus causing a global pandemic. Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the Orthocoronovirinae subfamily and is classified as a betacoronavirus. It consists of positive sense non-segmented RNA held within an envelope. The virus has four essential structural proteins which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and small envelope (E) protein [1] (Fig. 1) . Under the electron microscope, the virus appears spherical with a diameter that ranges from 60 to 140 nm and the outer surface is studded with spikes that are 9 -12 nm long [2] (Fig. 1) . The spikes give it the appearance of a solar corona. The genome of the virus is about 30 kb. It has a 5'cap structure and a 3'poly(A) tail. RNA replication and transcription requiring multi-stem loop structures are found at the 5' end. The four main structural proteins are encoded at the 3' end of the genome [3] . The N protein makes up the nucleocapsid by binding to the CoV RNA genome. It is considered to play a role in viral replication, transcription and translation. The protein has strong antigenicity and evokes an immunoglobulin G (IgG) driven antibody response to the nucleocapsid [4] . The E protein is an integral membrane protein that allows it to maintain the shape of the viral envelope and the protein also appears to have a role in viral propagation and pathogenicity in the host cells. E protein is now being studied for having potential ion channel properties which could be additive to or causative of its ability to interact with viral and host cell proteins, making it likely for it to have molecular functionality [5] . The M protein is a structural protein and can bind to the other proteins, thus assisting in viral assembly. It also, along with the S protein, seems to play a role in allowing the virus to attach to the host cell and enter into it [6] . The S glycoprotein is a homotrimeric class I fusion protein that mediates the host cell entry of the coronavirus. The S glycoprotein has two functional subunits that allow it to bind to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (S1 subunit) and carry out the fusion between the viral and host cell membranes (S2 subunit) [7] .",

The viral RNA is then released into the host cell and gets translated. Non-structural proteins are formed post-translation and they form the complex that allows viral replication and transcription. During transcription, the viral proteins and genomic RNA are produced that are assembled into virions in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum and are then released out the host cell in vesicles [8] . Once the virions are released, the host's innate immune system made up of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells get activated. Type I interferons (IFNs) are produced in the process that help curb the spread of the contagion and also help accelerate the phagocytosis of the viral antigens by macrophages. The adaptive immune system also plays a role in host immunity. B cells are stimulated by the CD4 + T cells leading to antibodies specifically targeted against the virus. Viral-infected cells are also directly killed by CD8 + T cells. Proinflammatory cytokines are also produced by the CD8 + T cells as part of the immune response [9] .",

After FDA assessment and approval, clinical trials are conducted in three phases. In phase 1 (takes weeks to months), 20 to 100 volunteers are recruited. Information of possible adverse effects and information on efficacy of the vaccine if possible is collected. In phase 2 (can take up to 2 years), hundreds of volunteers are recruited with a diverse group of volunteers for randomized controlled trials. Additional information on safety, side effects, dosage of vaccine and immune response is gathered. In phase 3 (takes from 1 to 4 years), thousands of people are recruited in this phase. Larger sample data collection is conducted. 4) Biologics License Application (BLA) is submitted to the FDA. This includes submission of preclinical, clinical data and details of the manufacturing process and facility information are submitted to the FDA. 5) After approval, prescribing information and [1] [2] [3] [4] and 182 vaccines in preclinical development [11] .

Antibody levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4 + T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8 + immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Results after single dose showed seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with geometric mean titer (GMTs) of 214 (95% confidence interval (CI): 177 -259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200 -295) for the 5 \u00d7 10 10 and 1 \u00d7 10 11 vp dose levels, respectively.

Over 119 million people were infected worldwide and unfortunately 2.64 million people have lost their lives to this deadly virus within a span of 13 months [40] . While the full scale impact of the pandemic is yet to be known in years to come, the magnitude of the pandemic has catapulted us into an accelerated learning curve, research and development including involving testing, treatment, prevention and vaccination. Vaccines have proven to be a tested tool in being the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.",

So far three vaccines have received emergency use authorization in the USA. The mRNA vaccines have used a novel technology and first of their kind promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because of their hypodensity and capacity for rapid development and potential for low cost manufacture and safe administration. These vaccines give us a hope to return to a new normalcy.",

Janssen JNJ-78436735 or Ad26.COV2.S is an adenoviral vector-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 developed by Janssen Phaemaceutica of Johnson & Johnson in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Mechanism of actionThe gene encoding the coronavirus S protein is added to the replication deficient adenovirus 26. The genetically engineered adenovirus 26 is developed into vaccine. The vaccine once injected into the host cell is engulfed by the cell. Once inside the cell's nucleus, the S protein gene is copied into mRNA. The mRNA leaves the nucleus and starts building S proteins, resulting in activation of immune response. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are activated after the first dose. Memory B cells and memory T cells result in longterm immune response which later fights against the virus on exposure.",
