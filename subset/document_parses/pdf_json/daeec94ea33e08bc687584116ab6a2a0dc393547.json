Hip fractures affect elderly populations, necessitate hospital admissions and place this group at particular risk from COVID-19 infection. This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 infection on 30-day hip fracture mortality. Method: Data related to 75 adult hip fractures admitted to two units during March and April 2020 were reviewed. The mean age was 83.5 years (range 65-98 years), and most (53, 70.7%) were women. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality associated with COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "Recently, a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) , originating in China at the end of 2019 has been the cause of a fatal global pandemic. At the time of writing, the death toll from COVID-19 infection in the United Kingdom has surpassed 30,000 and represents the highest record of national deaths in Europe. 1 The overall estimates of COVID-19 death rate in the United Kingdom is 0.66% increasing to 7.8% in the population of over 80 years of age; 2 higher death rates have been reported in cases with underlying health conditions or those of older age. 3, 4 The virus spreads mainly via close contact and respiratory droplets that lead to a high transmission rate in groups in close contact such as hospitalised patients. 5, 6 Fragility hip fractures have an estimated incidence of 70,000 cases per year in the United Kingdom and are expected to reach 6.3 million worldwide by the year 2050. 7, 8 This injury affects elderly populations, necessitates hospital admission and makes this group particularly prone to COVID-19 infection. Hip fracture itself is associated with increased mortality, and the risk of death tends to cluster in the first 30 days after injury and then decreases thereafter. 9 The 30-day mortality rate ranges from 3.5% to 10%, 10, 11 with the National Hip Fracture Database showing a UK 30day mortality rate of 7%. 12 Different predictors and risk factors of hip fracture 30-day mortality have been studied 13, 14 ; however, there is no published evidence on the effect of COVID-19 on hip fracture 30-day mortality. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of COVID-19 infection on hip fracture 30-day mortality.",

Recent estimates based on data from China predict an overall case fatality of 6.4% in those aged over 65 years and 13.4% in over 85 years group. 2 A populationbased study in the United Kingdom, including more than 3.8 million subjects, projects an estimate of 4.4% 1-year mortality rate in high-risk groups. 16 Further findings were an expected death rate of 9.7% in over 85 years of age without comorbidities, which increases to 21.7% in those over 85 years and have more than three comorbidities. The average time to death from admission was 19.8 days in our study. Similar findings have been reported from the Chinese mainland with mean time from disease onset to death of 17.8 days. 2, 17 The COVID-19 virus causes a two-phase immune response. 18 The second phase, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which develops after the first week, causes immunemediated lung damage and/or multi-organ failure and leads to death. CRS is mediated by leucocytes other than lymphocytes, and this leads to leucocytosis associated with lymphopenia. In our study, COVID-19-positive patients had higher mean leucocyte counts and lower mean lymphocyte counts compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Various studies have shown that surgery following trauma acts as a 'second hit' and induces a strong proinflammatory response. 19, 20 We have postulated that in hip fractures associated with COVID-19 infection, there are three potential hits, trauma, COVID-19 infection and surgery. Hip fracture surgery may act as a 'third hit' that boost the hyperimmune state caused by COVID-19 virus which may be a major factor in the increased mortality. A recently published trial involving 6425 patients has shown that the immunosuppressant dexamethasone significantly reduced the death rate in COVID-19-positive patients, 21 supporting the theory of a hyperimmune reaction leading to higher mortality rates in COVID-19 patients.",

The main presenting symptoms in our study were cough and fever. Reports from China found that cough, fever and sore throat were the most common presenting features of COVID-19 infection. 22, 23 Mi et al. studied 10 patients who died due to COVID-19 associated with orthopaedic fractures, six of them presenting with hip fractures; 24 60% of their patients had lymphopenia, similar to our findings.",

To improve the sample size, data have been collected from two different units. Due to small sample size, we have not used statistical tests as they may result in false positive findings. However, our study reported a clinically important difference in the 30-day mortality between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative hip fracture patients. We have postulated a 'third hit' theory; however, further research will be needed to assess the immune response before and after surgery in hip fractures associated with COVID-19 infection.",

While we suggest that mortality is greater in the COVID-19positive group, the numbers are very small in comparison to other recent published works on the topic in which over 6000 patients are included. Our findings may just be chance but we believe they are suggestive of a higher mortality when set against contemporary practices seen in the fight against the virus. Delayed surgery or conservative treatment can be adopted to avoid the 'third hit'. We have adopted a protocol of COVID-19 testing and CXR, for all patients presenting with hip fractures in our unit. This helps in risk stratification and early planning of high-risk surgeries and allows counselling of the patients and family using realistic prognosis. This study should open a door for nationwide studies of COVID-19 virus effect on hip fractures.",
