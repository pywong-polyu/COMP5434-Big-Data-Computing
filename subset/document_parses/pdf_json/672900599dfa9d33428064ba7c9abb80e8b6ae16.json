Our goal is to develop a globally applicable method, integrated in a twice-daily updated dashboard that provides an estimate of the trend in the evolution of the number of cases and deaths from reported data of more than 200 countries and territories, as well as a seven-day forecast. One of the significant difficulties to manage a quickly propagating epidemic is that the details of the dynamic needed to forecast its evolution are obscured by the delays in the identification of cases and deaths and by irregular reporting. Our forecasting methodology substantially relies on estimating the underlying trend in the observed time series using robust seasonal trend decomposition techniques. This allows us to obtain forecasts with simple, yet effective extrapolation methods in linear or log scale. We present the results of an assessment of our forecasting methodology and discuss its application to the production of global and regional risk maps.",

When accurate and reliable, predictions can be very informative to define appropriate policy measures and interventions, such as lockdown and containment measures, border closures, quarantines, school openings, and physical distancing. They are also useful to predict hospital surge capacity, in order to manage hospital resources Lutz et al. [2019] . Given that the pandemic is affected by these measures, testing policies, the appearance of new variants, the diffusions across borders, etc, long term forecasts are difficult and their usefulness remains unclear Ioannidis et al. [2020] , whereas accurate short-term forecasts provide useful actionable information. Nevertheless, even short-term forecasts are far from trivial as recently evidenced by Cramer et al. [2021] , where a simple baseline appears to be not so easy to beat on a one-week horizon.",

            "text": "In this work, we propose a general methodology to produce forecasts on a oneweek horizon, which is applicable to close to 200 countries, and as many states/regions or provinces. An additional challenge to achieve this goal is that the quality of the reported data varies significantly from country to country. This translates into different fluctuations and irregularities that can be observed in the reported time-series Wilke and Bergstrom [2020] . Many countries do not report on a daily basis or delay their reports to particular days of the week. In particular, seasonal patterns with a weekly cycle are observed for many countries. In several countries, e.g. in Switzerland, the number of reported cases shows a significant decline during or immediately after the weekend, which is probably due to the fact that, on those days, fewer patients get tested and/or the reporting is less active and thus delayed. Also, it is important to note that, as illustrated in the data from Spain on Fig. 1 (a) , seasonal patterns are nonstationary and can actually change in time, in particular, if the reporting policies change. Furthermore, delays in reporting, changes in death cause attribution protocols, as well as changes in testing policies lead to abrupt corrections that introduce backlogs on some days, such that a number of daily cases or deaths which are anomalously high or even negative are reported. To take into account these peculiarities, we propose a forecasting methodology that relies on estimating the underlying trend with a robust seasonal-trend decomposition method and using simple extrapolation techniques to make a forecast over a week.",

            "text": "The problem of forecasting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted the attention of many researchers, institutions, and individuals across the globe. As a result, a significant number of dashboards have appeared that monitor and/or make predictions about the evolution of the pandemic based on past observations. All these efforts are also being leveraged to build ensemble predictive models for different regions in the World. For instance, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention provides ensemble predictions for the US at the state level in US Covid-19 Forecast Hub 1 . Similarly, the German and Polish COVID-19 ForecastHub 2 provides ensemble predictions at the regional level for Germany and Poland. And more recently, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) launched a European Covid-19 Forecast Hub 3 to provide short-and long-term ensemble forecasts for Europe. The considered modelling approaches rely on different data sources used (cases or/and death data, tests data, hospital data, mobility data etc.) and aim for forecasting horizons ranging from 1 week to months. Epidemiological compartmental models or models inspired by them are among the most popular ones for the forecasting task e.g., IHME Covid [2021] , YYG-ParamSearch 4 , UMass-MechBayes Gibson et al. [2020] , IEM Health-CovidProject 5 and USC-SIkJalpha Srivastava et al. [2020] . Such models (e.g., SEIR Allen et al. [2008] ) split the population in different groups (age, demographics) and states (susceptible, infected, etc.) and model the transition dynamics of the population between the different states over time. The different parameters of the models can be deterministic or random, or be allowed to vary in time. Other approaches use statistical regression, e.g. UMich-RidgeTfReg 6 , LANL Castro et al. [2020a] , curve fitting, e.g. RobertWalraven-ESG 7 , and machine learning, e.g. GT-DeepCOVID Rodriguez et al. [2020] , to learn a predictor from past observations, or time-series (e.g., ARIMA), e.g. MUNI-ARIMA 8 , to learn a representation describing the evolution of the dynamics of the observed measurements, e.g. CMU TimeSeries 9 , Ahmad et al. [2021] . Some models make strong assumptions on the transmission dynamics Castro et al. [2020b] or specific assumptions on the effect of different policies, e.g. Keskinocak et al. [2020] , Lemaitre et al. [2020] , Bertozzi et al. [2020] . These are just a few sample references and the list is by no means exhaustive. For a more complete list of recent related literature we refer the reader to Friedman et al. [2020] , Cramer et al. [2021] , Bracher et al. [2020 Bracher et al. [ , 2021a , Ray et al. [2020] .",

Second, instead of building directly a forecasting model, our approach implements first a trend estimation model from daily cases/deaths observations that make little or no assumptions about the underlying dynamics, and don't require to estimate a large number of parameters (as opposed to e.g., SEIR-type), hence are robust and easier to apply at a more global scale. Our forecast is then obtained from the trend estimated with a simple extrapolation scheme.

The dashboard has been actively used by epidemiologists and global health experts to analyse the evolution of the epidemiological situation and to provide recommendations to several European governments.

In addition, we provide estimates of the prediction intervals based on the retrospective performance of the forecasting and the effective reproduction number based on our trend estimate via the method of Huisman et al.

Since the magnitude of the seasonal term can reasonably be expected to be proportional to the trend, allowing for the seasonal component to change with time is relevant here, especially since, as discussed, reporting patterns change in time in several time series. To obtain a more quickly adaptive algorithm, we use STL to produce separate trend estimates on windows of 6 weeks and recombine them. Outliers identified as a by-product of the STL procedure are removed, the corresponding counts are redistributed in recent history, and the trend estimation procedure is run one more time on the cleaned data (see the Methods Section for more details). Fig. 1 illustrates the behavior of our trend estimation procedure for different countries that represent a certain diversity. In the cases of Germany and Brazil (b, e) the weekly seasonal effect is quite significant and clearly non-stationary, in particular between December 22nd and January 3rd, 2021. For China (d) , no particular seasonal effect can be identified and several outliers seem to co-occur with the peak of the wave. The state of Kansas (US) (c) illustrates an example of a fairly irregular seasonal effect. In all these cases, the trend estimation proposed appears to be robust to outliers, to changes in seasonality or lack thereof, and adapts to the regularity of the underlying trend. Beyond a qualitative evaluation of the trend estimation, a quantitative evaluation is difficult for the lack of any ground truth, especially since the underlying dynamics of the trend in various countries and provinces are quite different. To some extent, the trend estimation proposed can be validated quantitatively via the forecasting algorithm which relies on it, since the quality of the forecast depends on the quality of the estimation of the trend.",

For the case of an increasing trend the extrapolation is performed in linear scale to prevent overshooting. To forecast the number of deaths, some models have been using lagged cases as input. Given the diversity of situations in different territories, and the fact that the relation between deaths and cases was sometimes quite unclear or changing in a short amount of time, we used the same simple forecasting approach as for cases. See the SI for a discussion and references. Following the recommendations of Cramer et al.

Only 5 countries do not show an improvement in either of these criteria. We also measure the coverage of the estimated prediction intervals, where our forecast is more accurate than the baseline for 66 countries. There are 53 out of 80 countries for which our method shows an improvement in all four metrics (MAE, median AE, average WIS, and coverage). This is the case, for example, for the US where the improvement in MAE and WIS over the baseline is 25%. We note that in the work of Cramer et al. [2021] , which compares forecasting algorithms focusing on US data, only 6 algorithms out of 23 achieve an improvement of more than 20% in MAE over the baseline (for forecasts on horizons of 1 to 4 weeks; see Table 2 in that paper). The countries, for which our method did not perform better than the baseline, typically have long plateaus that the baseline benefits from, or/and have quickly changing seasonality patterns and direction of the trend, where the simple and robust baseline makes smaller errors. We analysed how the AE varies as a function of the growth rate of the trend and evaluated to what extent, as soon as the trend is not flat, our method produces improved forecasts compared to the baseline (see Section F and Fig. S4 in SI). Our method outperforms the baseline predictor when the growth rate is larger than 3% in absolute value, which shows that the proposed forecast is informative as soon as the trend is not flat.",

It should be noted that, as a forecasting method, the considered baseline is uninformative in the sense that it does not attempt to characterize the evolution of the curve. In spite of this, as reported in Cramer et al. [2021] , it is not easy to outperform this type of baseline in terms of pure predictive accuracy. Thus, any forecasting method characterizing the evolution of the curves which improves over this baseline can be useful. Our forecasts are available in the US Covid-19 Forecast Hub, European Covid-19 Forecast Hub, and Apart from producing forecasts and estimates of prediction intervals, the trend estimates that we obtain are of independent interest. We use them in particular to produce a stable estimate of the R-effective (R-eff for short). The R-eff measures the expected number of people that can be infected by an individual at any given time Mahase [2020] and has been used as a key indicator in this pandemic. Since its estimation requires essentially to solve a deconvolution problem Huisman et al. [2020] , it is quite sensitive to the irregularities in the data. In the original paper the authors use LOESS smoothing in order to decrease their influence. In our case, we propose to apply the deconvolution based on our piecewise robust STL trend estimate.",

Green is assigned if the number of weekly cases per 100K inhabitants was below 30, orange is assigned if it is above 30 and the epidemic curve is descending (R-eff\u00a10.9), and red is assigned if it is above 30 the epidemic curve is ascending or plateauing (R-eff\u00bf0.9). Other organisations use similar thresholds for the cumulative rate per 100K. For instance, our choice of a threshold coincides with the upper value of the 3rd level (out of 7) in the ECDC map of the geographic distribution of 14 https://kitmetricslab.github.io/forecasthub/forecast Covid cases. The value of the R-eff is not taken into account in the risk assessment (color code) of a country when the incidence numbers are low since its estimation becomes less reliable. Besides, it theoretically converges to 1 at the end of an epidemic, and in such regime it is no longer an indicator of the severity of the pandemic. As a consequence, if no test data is available, or the number of tests are below 10,000 per 1M population, the region is colored in grey, meaning that the data is missing/unreliable and no risk assessment can be made. An example of a risk map is given in Fig. 5 . These maps are useful to compare the levels of epidemic activity between countries based on a discrete color code. These comparisons can be insightful, especially if the R-eff and different non-pharmaceutical interventions of countries are taken into account.",

We use in particular our trend estimate to produce our own estimates of the R-effective curves, which are in turn used to produce risk maps.

The evaluation on the remaining countries (with the exclusion of 11 countries which had a particularly low number of cases) shows that there remains 42 countries, for which our method still obtains a better MAE than the baseline, only 29 for which we improve in median AE, 63 for which RWIS is improved and 74 with improved total coverage. Many of the countries for which our method performs clearly worse than the baseline are in fact countries with a fairly low number of cases, which were not the focus of our modelling efforts. This is justified by the fact that accurate forecasts are not critical for these countries as long as their number remains low. Furthermore, the corresponding time series of a significant number of these countries have numerous irregularities of the reporting and backlogs which makes it harder to associate the target average weekly number with the true underlying trend. In that case, the simple baseline forecast, which is the average value of the previous week, appears to be closer to the target than the forecast obtained after trend estimation. Different smoothing techniques would be needed to produce better trend estimation for these countries, which take into account the discrete nature of the count and their Poissonian distribution.",

The strategy of estimating the deaths from cases has been particularly successful for the USA at the country and state levels. Among the models participating in the US COVID Forecast Hub, epiforecasts-ensemble1 contains a model which estimates deaths from a convolution of cases, the model MIT Crit Data-GBCF takes 3weeks lagged deaths and cases numbers as a part of the input, etc. Forecasting the number of deaths from a lagged case curve was one of our first approaches, but the diversity of situations encountered across the world and in time for a particular region makes it that this strategy fails in a number of cases. The relation between lagged cases and the number of deaths is sometimes quite unclear: for example, if we consider the evolution of the number of cases and deaths in Egypt in November-December 2021 that we show in Fig. S7 , the number of cases is almost not changing while the number of death is increasing and then decreasing. There are many reasons why the relation between the number of cases might be more complicated, be non-stationary and potentially change relatively quickly: as the virus circulates it affects different groups in the population who are more or less fragile and who protect their senior more or less well, the testing and reporting policies of some countries have sometimes changed quite quickly (including reporting policies for deaths), there is an effect of the vaccination (which is however on a sufficiently slow timescale that it can be reestimated over time), there is the emergence of new variants, etc. Taking into account all of the above, we use the same strategy for the number of deaths forecasting as for cases, i.e. we estimate the trend based solely on the previous deaths observations and predict future numbers by the simple extrapolation. We provide a brief comparison of the performance of our strategy to forecast deaths (individually in the same way as cases) with a few methods from the European forecast Hub for 31 European countries in a similar way to what we did for cases. We identified two forecasting methods IEM Health-CovidProject and RobertWalraven-ES, which were regularly submitting to the European COVID forecast Hub apart from EuroCOVIDhubensemble and EuroCOVIDhub-baseline. The results demonstrate that for 1-week ahead forecast our methodology obtains levels of performance comparable to those of other methods submitted to EU COVID Forecast Hub: on Fig. S8 , S10 and Fig. S9 , S11 one can see that mean absolute error (MAE) and WIS normalized by the respective errors of the EU COVID hub baseline of our method (SDSC ICG) are aligned with the other methods.",

This is of course because, in practice, there is often no distinction made in the reporting protocols. It is however important for our models to be able to distinguish between these two situations. To distinguish missing values from actual zeros, we proceed as follows: if the last observation in the data is zero, we compute an estimate of the Poisson rate by taking the average of observations during the week before zero occurs. If the probability of observing zero new cases given this estimated rate is too low, we consider the zero value to be a missing report one and exclude it from the history for further trend estimation and forecasting. The forecasting starts from the next day from the last initial observation.",

This allows our method to better adapt to changes in the seasonal component, as the hyperparameters defining the smoothing levels can then change in each separate segment modelled. To estimate the trend locally in the whole period of observations, we split the observed time interval into halfoverlapping intervals of 6 weeks. These time intervals are defined from the end of the time series backwards, so that the time series ends with the last segment of 6 months. First, we apply STL to estimate the trend of the last subinterval [T \u2212 L + 1, T ], where L = 42 (corresponding to 4 weeks). For the last subinterval, the STL trend is rescaled to preserve the number of observations in the last L/2 days to obtain the estimate s \u22121 in [T \u2212 L + 1, T ]. Next, the trend estimation proceeds as follows. For the two overlapping subintervals, e.g. consider [T \u2212L+1, T ] and [T \u22123L/2+1, T \u2212L/2], we take the estimate s \u22121 and we estimate the trends in [T \u2212 3L/2 + 1, T \u2212 L/2]. In order to smoothly join two local trends s \u22121 ands \u22122 in the interval [T \u2212 L + 1, T \u2212 L/2] we use a simple weighted interpolation and obtain the trend in [T \u2212 3L/2 + 1, T ] :",

The procedure continues with the next local trend estimate (s) from the corrected data. Note that \u03ba is always computed from raw observations.

For each country, we detect outliers using a sliding window MAD estimate. More precisely, for each daily value, we compute the MAD in a symmetric window of 22 days around that day. For the MAD to be a consistent estimator for the standard deviation, we multiply it by a constant scale factor of 1.4826, which relates the MAD to the standard deviation for a Gaussian distribution. If the daily value differs from the median in the window by more than 2 standard deviations, we consider it as an outlier.

Given that the growth rate as a measure of the slope is comparable across countries, we pool the data from all countries to obtain Fig. S4 . The baseline performs best when there are no changes in the number of cases/deaths (i.e., the growth rate of 0 or constant trend). However, our method outperforms the baseline predictor as soon as the growth rate is larger than 3% in absolute value, which shows that the proposed forecast is informative as soon as the trend is not flat.
