However, in Ecuador, due to a lack of technical knowledge to reduce implementation costs, many of these ISPs deploy their fiber networks without Quality of Service (QoS) designs or subscriber growth. In this document, we propose specific and sequential sizing techniques for the ISP's core equipment.

Additionally, in the subsection \"Identification and segmentation of OLT data traffic\" of this article, it has been stated that one PON port will be used for present data traffic and another PON port for future data traffic, for one specific zone. Therefore, each PON port will provide service to eight NAPs, and each one of these will provide service to eight subscribers. However, because of CoFTTH (subscriber's growth), the SSC and each NAP will have space to install one more 1:8 splitter (next PON port), as shown in Fig. 7 . Consequently, the cable's capacity for the DN is 24 fibers: 8 fibers to provide service to present subscribers, 8 for future subscribers, and 8 for redundancy purposes. The redundancy component is recommended by Ecuador's National Corporation of Telecommunications (CNT EP, by its Spanish acronym) [14] . #FiberCapacity proj (DN) = 24 fibers 6. Results",
