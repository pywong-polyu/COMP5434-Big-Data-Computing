At present, the frequency and quantity of psychological problems among college students are obviously on the rise, so the relevant departments and leaders of the school should find out the students' problems as early as possible, prevent them as early as possible, and try their best to reduce the probability of mental health problems. In order to achieve a good \"match\" between college students' individual and entrepreneurial choices, they must accurately position themselves on the basis of fully understanding their entrepreneurial ability. After students enter school, schools should investigate students' psychology. Besides, they can also use the opportunity of face-to-face communication between students and counselors to fully grasp students' psychological conditions and use professional psychotherapy methods to help students solve psychological obstacles and eliminate bad emotions. Scientific professional psychological counseling plays a certain role in cognitive adjustment and value guidance in the process of college students' entrepreneurship. It can enable college entrepreneurs to set up scientific career planning, clarify the development direction of self-entrepreneurship, and learn to use scientific career planning knowledge to solve many psychological puzzles that may be encountered in the process of entrepreneurship so as to optimize psychological quality and achieve entrepreneurial goals. From reality, in the process of starting a business, personality is very important and crucial, and most successful entrepreneurs have unique personality charm, which shows the importance of personality [24] . We should actively explore the entrepreneurial resources of outstanding entrepreneurs, especially outstanding alumni, and invite them to come to the school to give their own opinions to college students so that college students can choose their social needs, their own love and their own strengths in entrepreneurial practice. At the same time, it will also strengthen college students' entrepreneurial ideals and establish their confidence in the success of entrepreneurship. In the process of mental health education, teachers should guide students' behavior and psychology correctly so that they can actively participate in team activities, exercise their ability to adapt to society, and constantly form a strong will to participate in various activities reasonably. In the long run, students can learn to restrain their bad behaviors, control their bad emotions, and deal with various problems with a very positive attitude. According to the theory of planned behavior, the more positive the attitude and subjective norms are, the stronger the control of perceived behavior is, and the stronger the individual's intention to consider executing behavior is. e data relationship between weight value and evaluation value is shown in Figure 4 .",
