Two milliliters of CSF were stored in cryotubes at \u221280\u00b0C be ore testin . All subjects underwent immunological screening including antibodies against NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, GABA b R, AMPAR, DPPX, Ri, Yo, Ma2, CV2, Hu, amphiphysin, titin (Euroline and Mosaic kit, Euroimmun, Luebeck) and MOG (live cell-based assay) at the Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Italy. In addition, to expand the analyses of unknown antigens or not commercially available autoantibodies, indirect immunofluorescence was performed in eight patients fulfilling criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis [16] using two different fixation protocols on mouse tissue substrate (including CNS and non-CNS tissues in order to exclude patients with non-neural specific autoimmunity) in the Neuroimmunology laboratory at Mayo Clinic, in Rochester; serum was tested after absorption with liver powder at 1:240 and CSF was tested undiluted. Briefly, mouse cryosections were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (1 minute), washed (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]), permeabilized with 0.5% CHAPS (C32H58N2O7S, 1 minute), or directly fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 10 minutes. After washing with PBS, normal goat serum (10% diluted in PBS) was applied for 1 hour and sections were then incubate ith atient's sa les (40 in tes), washed, incubated with anti-human IgG secondary antibodies for 30 minutes, washed and examined by two independent reviewers (AZ, AMcK). This extensive autoimmune screening did not reveal any abnormality in all COV-Enc cases included. All CSF samples were analyzed for inflammatory and neuronal/glial markers at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (M\u00f6lndal, Sweden). CSF cytokine concentrations (including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, L-1\u03b2) were measured using a Mesoscale Discovery multiplexed immunoassay (Rockville, MD). CSF CXCL13 concentration was measured using a o er ial EL S (R D S ste s, innea olis, N). CSF \u03b22 on entration as eas re sin an",

Second, the study potentially exclude cases of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis with severe respiratory COVID-19 who could not undergo a complete MRI, EEG and CSF assessment. Third, the study was cross-sectional in nature and the normalisation of the CSF markers after clinical improvement should be verified in on-going longitudinal studies. Despite these limitations, the study demonstrated for the first time that encephalitis in COVID-19 are associated with alterations within neuronal/glial biomarkers with a specific cytokine pattern indicating inflammatory-mediated underpinning mechanisms in this complication to SARS-. and A.P. contributed to the conception and design of the study; A.P., S.M., I.V, V.D., F.C, S.M., S.F., A.B., B.R., A.B., E.P., E.F., F.C, G.Z., A.Z, A.M., N.J.A., K.B., H.Z., and A.P. contributed to the acquisition and analyses of data; A.P. , S.M., and A.P. contributed to drafting the text.
