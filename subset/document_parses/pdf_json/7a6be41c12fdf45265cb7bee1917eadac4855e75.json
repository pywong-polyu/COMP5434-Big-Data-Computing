In addition, there are children with underlying conditions, such as immunosuppressed individuals and those with comorbidities, who are more likely to suffer diseases and complications from the disease. In addition, the long period of social isolation has made it impossible to practice sports and exercise, which can have repercussions on children's cardiovascular and hormonal systems, making them aware of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (Thompson & Rasmussen, 2021) .Epidemiological studies from the Houston hospital in the USA anteriorly reported that in January, the number of hospitalizations of children with COVID-19 quadrupled with the expansion of infections caused by the \u00d4micron and Delta variants during the end-ofyear festivities, supering the rates found in August 2021, during the wave of the Delta variant (Yan & Caldwell, 2021) . Complications of COVID-19 in children are usually associated with a rare post-infectious syndrome, the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome or Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome -Temporarily Associated with SARS-CoV-2, which exclusively affects children and leads to the hospitalization in most cases (Radia et al., 2021) .",

In its clinical studies, this manufacturer also demonstrated effectiveness and safety in children aged 5 to 11 years, thus obtaining approval in December 2021 for immunization of this population, which represents a significant achievement for the pediatric population (Walter et al., 2022) .Scientific advances and clinical research have shown society that with an investment in science, with severe and rigorous studies, it is possible to quickly and effectively solve pandemic situations. However, in Brasil, the cut of scientific investments, the skepticism, denialism, and propagation of false information, often by members of a scientific society, based on preliminary or questionable scientific studies, raised and casts doubt on the credibility of the immunization process, mainly aimed at children.",

We understand that negative experiences in childhood can reflect negative outcomes in adult life; therefore, although the levels of infant mortality from COVID-19 are not extraordinary, they must be protected from emotional suffering as a result of social distancing, hospitalization, and parental separation.Brazil is world-renowned for its successful history in immunization, eradicating many diseases that plagued children, such as measles and polio. In this way, vaccination of children against SARS-CoV-2 is urgent and essential to achieving the necessary immunity in the fight against the current global pandemic. Because of the above, we affirm that the attitudes of organized civil society, scientific entities, and the various actors in campaigns that call for and encourage the vaccination of children from 5 years of age to be welcomed and positive. However, it is necessary to share reliable scientific data create advertising campaigns to combat false information that is multiplied, aiming at the end of the transmission chain of COVID-19 and beyond, the well-being and health of the entire population worldwide.",
