            "text": "Machine Learning (ML) and in particular Deep Learning (DL) methods nowadays are increasingly replacing traditional methods in many different domains involved with important decision making activities. Sophisticated DL techniques tailor-made for specific tasks such as image recognition, signal processing, or speech analysis are being introduced at a fast pace with many improvements. However, for the domain of time series forecasting, the current state in the ML community is perhaps where other domains such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision were at several years ago. The field of forecasting has mainly been fostered by statisticians/econometricians; consequently the related concepts are not the mainstream knowledge among general ML practitioners. The different forms of non-stationarities associated with time series challenge the capabilities of data-driven ML models. Nevertheless, recent trends in the domain have demonstrated that with the availability of massive amounts of time series, ML and DL techniques are quite competent in time series forecasting, when related pitfalls are properly handled. Therefore, in this work we provide a tutorial-like compilation of the details of one of the most important steps in the overall forecasting process, namely the evaluation. This way, we intend to impart the information associated with forecast evaluation to fit the context of ML, as means of bridging the knowledge gap between traditional methods of forecasting and current state-of-the-art ML techniques. We elaborate the details of the different problematic characteristics of time series such as non-normalities and non-stationarities and how they are associated with common pitfalls in forecast evaluation. Best practices in forecast evaluation are outlined with respect to the different steps such as data partitioning, error calculation, statistical testing, and others. Further guidelines are also provided along selecting valid and suitable error measures depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset at hand.",

Although fields such as NLP and Computer Vision have heavily been dominated by ML and DL based techniques for decades by now, this has hardly been the case for the field of forecasting, until very recently. Forecasting was traditionally the field of statisticians and econometricians. However, nowadays, with many companies hiring data scientists, often these data scientists are tasked with forecasting. Therefore, now in many situations practitioners are tasked with forecasting that have a good background in ML and data science, but that are not aware of the decades of research in the forecasting space. This involves many aspects of the process of forecasting, from the point of data pre-processing, building models to final forecast evaluation. Due to the self-supervised and sequential nature of forecasting tasks, it is often associated with many pitfalls that usual ML practitioners are not aware of. Out of all these aspects, in this particular work, we focus on the evaluation of point forecasts as a key step in the overall process of forecasting.",

The general process involves employing a number of models having different characteristics, training them on a training dataset and then applying them on a validation set afterwards. Then, model selection may be performed by evaluating on the validation set to select the best models. Otherwise, ensemble models may be developed instead, by combining the forecasts from all the different models, and usually a final evaluation is then performed on a test set. In research areas such as classification and regression, there are well-established standard practices for evaluation. Data partitioning is performed by using a standard k-fold Cross-Validation (CV) to tune the model hyperparameters based on the error on a validation sets, the model with the best hyperparameter combination is tested on the testing set, standard error measures such as squared errors, absolute errors or precision, recall, area under curve are computed and finally the best models are selected. These best methods may continue to deliver reasonable predictions for a certain problem task, i.e., they generalise well, under the assumption that there are no changes of the distribution of the underlying data, which otherwise would need to be addressed as concept drift (Webb et al., 2016; Ghomeshi et al., 2019; Ikonomovska et al., 2010) or non-stationarity.",

            "text": "In contrast, evaluating forecasting models can be a surprisingly complicated task. Data partitioning and model selection have many different options in the context of forecasting, including fixed origin, rolling origin evaluation and other CV setups as well as controversial arguments associated with them. Due to the inherent non-independence, non-stationarities and non-normalities of time series, these choices are complex. Also, most error measures are susceptible to break down under certain of these conditions. Other considerations are whether to summarise errors across all available time series or consider different steps of the forecast horizon separately etc. As a consequence, without wanting to call them out here, we regularly come across papers in top AI/ML conferences and journals (even winning best paper awards) that use inadequate and miss-leading benchmark methods for compari-son (e.g., non-seasonal models for long-term forecasting on seasonal series), others that use mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for evaluation with series, e.g., with values in the [\u22121, 1] interval because the authors think the MAPE is a somewhat generic \"time series error measure\", even though MAPE is clearly inadequate in such settings. Other works make statements along the lines of ARIMA being able to tackle non-stationarity whereas ML models can't, neglecting that the only thing ARIMA does is a differencing of the series as a pre-processing step to address non-stationarity. A step that can easily be done as preprocessing for any ML method as well. In other works, we see methods compared using MAE as the error measure, and only the proposed method by those authors is trained with L1 loss, all other competitors with L2 loss, which leads to unfair comparisons as the L1 loss optimises towards MAE, whereas the L2 loss optimises towards RMSE. Many other works evaluate on a handfull of somewhat randomly picked time series and then show plots of forecasts versus actuals as \"proof\" of how well their method works, without considering simple benchmarks or meaningful error measures, and other similar problems. Also, frequently forecasting competitions and research works introduce new evaluation measures and methodologies, sometimes neglecting the prior research, e.g., by seemingly not understanding that dividing a series by its mean will not solve scaling issues for many types of non-stationarities (e.g., strong trends). Thus, there is no generally accepted standard for forecast evaluation in every possible scenario. This gap has harmed progress in ML methods for forecasting significantly in the past. It is damaging the area currently, with spurious results in many papers, with researchers new to the field not being able to distinguish between methods that work and methods that don't, and the associated slower progress and waste of resources.",

            "text": "Overall, this article makes an effort in the direction of raising awareness among ML practitioners regarding the best practices and pitfalls associated with the different steps of the point forecast evaluation process. Similar exhaustive efforts have been taken in the literature to review, formally define and categorise other important concepts in the ML domain such as concept drift (Webb et al., 2016) and mining statistically sound patterns from data (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Webb) . The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 first introduces terminology associated with the domain of forecasting. Next, Section 3 details the motivation for this article, including an introduction to the different forms of nonstationarities/non-normalities seen in time series data, along with common pitfalls related to using competitive benchmarks, visualisation of results using forecast plots and avoiding data leakage in forecast evaluation. Then, Section 4 presents an overview of the process of forecast evaluation. In Section 5, we provide a tutorial/guideline around how to best partition the data for a given forecasting problem such that it is not affecting the sequential nature or the non-stationarities involved with the problem. Section 6 first presents a comprehensive literature review of many different evaluation measures proposed over the years. This is supplemented by a critical analysis of how each of them can break/fail under different circumstances of the time series. This section also provides a guideline on selecting evaluation measures depending on the characteristics of the time series under consideration. In Section 7, we provide details of popular techniques used for statistical testing for significance of differences between models. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper by summarising the overall content of the paper and highlighting the best practices for forecast evaluation.",

In a so-called Auto-Regression (AR), X t in Equation 1 only goes back a fixed amount of lags, usually called the model order. The very name indicates that the regression is performed against the values of the target series itself. An auto-regression of a time series uses an embedded matrix. In the embedded matrix in Figure  2 , when the model order is p, every row has p + 1 consecutive observations from the time series. During model training, every row is considered a separate data instance, where values at lags 1, 2, ... p are considered predictors for the target quantity of the time series at time step p + 1. The process goes through the whole series, shifting the target quantity by one time step in each row, to form a matrix.

            "text": "Using this notion of univariate forecasting, both local models and global models can be developed. For a local model, the parameters \u03b8 of the model are trained only using one series. Therefore, in the scenario where many time series are available, local models need to be developed as one per each series. On the other hand, for global models, the parameters \u03b8 are trained across time series, i.e., using data from all the series. Thus, the embedded matrix contains data instances from many series. However, for the prediction of a single series, X t in Equation 1 only considers the corresponding lags of that particular series . Similar to other ML tasks, validation and test sets are used for hyperparameter tuning of the models and for testing. Evaluations on validation and test sets are often called out-of-sample (OOS) evaluations in forecasting. The two main setups for OOS evaluation in forecasting are fixed origin evaluation and rolling origin evaluation (Tashman, 2000) . Figure 3 shows the difference between the two setups. In the fixed origin setup, the forecast origin is fixed as well as the training region, and the forecasts are computed as one-step ahead or multi-step ahead depending on the requirements. In the rolling origin setup, the size of the forecast horizon is fixed, but the forecast origin changes over the time series (rolling origin), thus effectively creating multiple test periods for evaluation. With every new forecast origin, new data becomes available for the model which can be used for refitting of the model. However, as seen on Figure 3 , since the rolling origin setup allows the data to pass on from the testing set to the training set of the next consecutive evaluation step, this setup, if not used properly, is naturally susceptible to data leakage dangers, where information of the future may leak to the model training phase using past data (further discussed in Section 3.4). The rolling origin setup is also called time series cross-validation (tsCV) and prequential evaluation in the literature (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018; Gama et al., 2013) . Further details of these approaches are discussed in Section 5. Figure 3 : Comparison of fixed origin vs. rolling origin setups. The blue and orange data points represent the training and testing sets respectively at each evaluation. The figure on the left side shows the fixed origin setup where the forecast origin remains constant. The figure on the right shows the rolling origin setup where the forecast origin rolls forward and the forecast horizon is constant. The red dotted lined triangle encloses all the time steps used for testing across all the evaluations. Compared to the fixed origin setup, it is seen that in the rolling origin setup, testing data instances in each evaluation pass on to the training set in the next evaluation step.",

What we refer to as non-stationarity in this work is the violation of strong stationarity defined as in Equation 2 (Cox and Miller, 1965) . Strong stationarity is defined as the distribution of a finite window (sub-sequence) of a time series (discrete-time stochastic process) remaining the same as we shift the window across time. In Equation 2, y t refers to the time series value at time step t; \u03c4 \u2208 Z is the size of the shift of the window and n \u2208 N is the size of the window. F Y (y t+\u03c4 , y t+1+\u03c4 , ..., y t+n+\u03c4 ) refers to the cumulative distribution function of the joint distribution of (y t+\u03c4 , y t+1+\u03c4 , ..., y t+n+\u03c4 ). Hence, according to Equation 2, F Y is not a function of time, it does not depend on the shift of the window. In the rest of this paper, we refer to the violation of strong stationarity simply as non-stationarity.",

            "text": "(2) Figure 4 gives an example of possible problems when building ML models on such data, where the models fail to produce reasonable forecasts as the range of values is different in the training and test sets. Different types of non-stationarities are illustrated in Figure 5 . Seasonality usually means that the mean of the series changes periodically over time, with a fixed length periodicity. Trends can be twofold; 1) deterministic trends -change the mean of the series 2) stochastic trends (resulting from unit roots) -change both the mean and variance of the series (Salles et al., 2019) . Note that neither trend nor seasonality are concepts that have precise formal definitions. They are usually merely defined as smoothed versions of the time series, where for the seasonality the smoothing occurs over particular seasons (e.g., in a daily series, the series of all Mondays needs to be smooth, etc.). Heteroscedasticity changes the variance of the series and structural breaks can change the mean or other properties of the series. Structural break is a term used in Econometrics and Statistics in a time series context to describe a sudden change in the series. It therewith has considerable overlap with the notion of sudden concept drift in an ML environment, where a sudden change of the data distribution is observed (Webb et al., 2016) .",

Figure 7a shows another random walk series, with the na\u00efve forecast as the best forecast by definition of the Data Generating Process (DGP). The figure furthermore shows the forecasts under fixed origin and rolling origin data partitioning schemes. When periodic re-fitting is done with new data coming in as in a rolling origin setup, the na\u00efve forecast gets continuously updated with the last observed value. For the fixed origin context on the other hand, the na\u00efve forecast remains constant as a straight line corresponding to the last seen observation in the training series. We see that with a rolling-origin na\u00efve forecast, the predictions tend to look visually very appealing, as the forecasts follow the actuals and our eyes are deceived by the smaller horizontal distances instead of the vertical distances that are relevant for evaluation. Figure 7b illustrates this behaviour. It is clear how the horizontal distance between the actuals and the na\u00efve forecast at both points A and B are much less compared to the vertical distances which are the relevant ones for evaluation. If a scatter-plot of the actuals against the forecasts as in Figure 7c can be used instead, it may give a much better picture of where the forecasts stand with respect to reality, by discarding the time domain. On the other hand, on a series with integrated behaviour, the na\u00efve method is a strong benchmark and other competitive methods on such a series will also tend to show behaviours of following the actuals. In these situations we need to rely on the error measures, as the plots do not give us much information. Figure 7a shows another issue with forecasts, as the na\u00efve forecast for fixed origin is a constant. Although this does not look realistic, and in most application domains we can be certain that the actuals will not be constant, practitioners may mistakenly identify such behaviour as a potential problem with the models, where this forecast is indeed the best possible forecast in the sense that it minimises the error based on the information available at present. In summary, plots of the forecasts can be deceiving and should be used mostly for sanity checking. Decisions should mostly be made based on evaluations with error measures and not based on plots.",

Fixed origin setup is the usual setup used in many academic contexts such as forecasting competitions since this can effectively avoid data leakage problems as the test set is not disclosed in any way. In fact for competition scenarios where the dates of the series are not aligned (like the M3, M4 competitions), a fixed origin setup may be sufficient. However, for many practical scenarios, a fixed origin setup is problematic and may not be a sufficient evaluation. With a single series, the fixed origin setup only provides one forecast per each forecast step in the horizon. According to Tashman (2000) , a preferred characteristic of OOS forecast evaluation is to have sufficient forecasts at each forecast step. Furthermore, for a single series, the testing period is short unless a long forecast horizon is used. However, with a long forecast horizon, the problem is that we are mixing very different forecasts. For example, for a 400-step-ahead forecast, short-term dynamics due to autocorrelation may be irrelevant, and trend and seasonality may matter the most, where for a one-step-ahead forecast short-term dynamics may be the dominating factor. Thus, a one-step-ahead forecast may have totally different characteristics, in terms of possible accuracy, useful input features, well-performing methods, than a 400-step-ahead forecast (Petropoulos et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Another requirement of OOS forecast evaluation is to make the forecast error measures insensitive to specific phases of business (Tashman, 2000) . However, with a fixed origin setup, the errors may be the result of particular patterns only observable in that particular region of the horizon (Tashman, 2000) , and evaluations will not generalise well to other phases such as Christmas sales, Holiday seasons, etc.. This poses a gap between what practitioners are really interested in and how forecasting is done often in academic settings. Having multiple forecasts for the same forecast step allows to produce a forecast distribution per each step for further analysis. Therefore, the following multi period evaluation setups are introduced as opposed to the fixed origin setup. Armstrong and Grohman (1972) are among the first researchers to give a descriptive explanation of the rolling origin evaluation setup. Although the terms rolling origin setup and tsCV are used interchangeably in the literature, in addition to the forecast origin rolling forward, tsCV also allows to skip origins, effectively rolling forward by more than one step at a time (analogously to the difference between a leave-one-out CV and a k-fold CV). In the field of stream data mining and concept drift, this form of evaluation is furthermore known as interleaved-test-then-train or prequential evaluation (Gama et al., 2013; Ghomeshi et al., 2019) as means of online evaluation. For streaming data, prequential evaluation allows to continuously monitor the performance of a model that evolves over time, and thus detect and act upon concept drifts (Gama et al., 2009; Kiran Bhowmick, 2020) . With such multi period evaluations, each time the forecast origin updates, the model encounters new actual data. Hence, a rolling origin setup is typically the more practical evaluation setup in real-world application. For instance, in a task of forecasting the daily sales of a particular product, the number of actual sales can be obtained at the end of each day and can be incorporated in the model to better predict the next day's demand.",

            "text": "With new data becoming available, we have the options to -in the terminology of Tashman (2000) -either update the model or recalibrate it. Recalibration here refers to either retraining the model weights from scratch or incremental learning as new data comes in. Updating on the other hand means just using the trained model to predict with new data. Although for some of the traditional models such as Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), the usual practice (and the implementation in the forecast package) in a rolling origin setup is to recalibrate (refit) the models, for general ML models it is more common to mostly just accept new data as inputs and only periodically retrain the model. While this is quite straightforward with a stateless ML model, on a model with a state such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), updating still requires stepping through the whole series to construct the state. In this sense, the (updating-based) rolling origin setup comes more natural to many ML methods than to the traditional forecasting methods. Also, as ML methods tend to work better with higher granularities, re-fitting is not an option (for example, a monthly series predicted with ETS vs. a 5-minutely series predicted with Light Gradient Boosting Models). Therefore, retraining as the most recent data becomes available happens in ML methods mostly only when some sort of concept drift (change of the underlying data generating process) is encountered (Webb et al., 2016) . Rolling origin evaluation can be conducted in two ways; 1) Expanding window setup 2) Rolling window setup. Figure 8 illustrates the difference between the two approaches. In the expanding window setup, the training region of the series for the model expands as the forecast origin rolls forward, thus effectively increasing the length of the training data per each evaluation. The expanding window method is a good setup for small datasets/short series (Bell and Smyl, 2018) . However, in the rolling window setup, the size of the training region is kept constant; thus as the forecast origin rolls forward, so does the start of the training period, dropping the oldest observations as new data becomes available (Cerqueira et al., 2020) . The rolling window setup removes the oldest data from training. This will not make a difference with forecasting techniques that only minimally attend the distant past, such as ETS, but may be beneficial with pure autoregressive ML models, that have no notion of time beyond the windows. In a streaming data context as well, the most common methods of performing prequential evaluation are by using a sliding window or by using fading factors which tend to forget instances in the further past and focus on the current window (Mulinka et al., 2018) . This is because the usual prequential evaluation approach with expanding window is known to provide overestimation for the validation error (Gama et al., 2009) . Hidalgo et al. (2019) have empirically demonstrated that prequential evaluation with sliding window is the best approach for validation in comparison to fading factors and expanding window. A potential problem of the rolling origin setup is that the first folds may not have much data available. However, the size of the first folds is not an issue when dealing with long series, thus making rolling origin setup a good choice with sufficient amounts of data. On the other hand, with short series it is also possible to perform a combination of the aforementioned two rolling origin setups where we start with an expanding window setup and then move to a rolling window setup.",

Another form of data partitioning is to use a common randomised CV scheme as first proposed by Stone (1974) . This scheme is visualised in Figure 9 . The dataset is initially shuffled randomly and then partitioned into non-overlapping train and validation sets. Often a k-fold CV scheme is used for this purpose. For example, in a 5-fold CV strategy, the whole training dataset is randomly split into 5 partitions and 4 of them are used to train the model and the remaining partition held out for validation. This is done in iterations until all partitions are considered for validation separately. The set of validation scores produced this way are finally summarised. Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) is the extreme case of the k-fold CV where k is equal to the number of data points in the dataset. Therefore, compared to the aforementioned validation schemes which preserve the temporal order of the data, this form of randomised CV strategy can make efficient use of the data, since all the data is used for both model training as well as evaluation in iterations (Hastie et al., 2009 ). This helps to make a more informed estimation about the generalisation error of the model.",

            "text": "Out of these problems, to address the serial correlation issues, researchers have proposed a few variations of CV. Different forms of blocked CV have been introduced for this purpose, where the folds are selected in blocks, without initial shuffling and preserving the temporal order of the data within the folds (Racine, 2000; Bergmeir and Ben\u00edtez, 2012) . Further non-dependent CV techniques have also been proposed, where a sufficiently sized block of instances surrounding the test instances are discarded to ensure independence between the training and test sets (Burman et al., 1994; Racine, 2000) . Nonetheless, randomised CV can be applied to pure AR models without a problem. Bergmeir et al. (2018) theoretically and empirically show that CV performs well in a pure AR setup, as long as the models nest or approximate the true model, as then the errors are uncorrelated, leaving no dependency between the individual windows. To check this, it is important to estimate the serial correlation of residuals. For this, the Ljung-Box test (Ljung and Box, 1978) can be used on the OOS residuals of the models. While for overfitting models there will be no autocorrelation left in the residuals, if the models are underfitted, some autocorrelation will be left in the OOS residuals. If there is autocorrelation left, then the model still does not use all the information available in the data, which means there will be dependencies between the separate windows. In such a scenario, CV of the time series dataset will not hold valid, and underestimate the true generalisation error. The existence of significant autocorrelations anyway means that the model should be improved to do better on the respective series (increase the AR order to capture autocorrelation etc.), since the model has not captured all the available information. Once the models are sufficiently competent in capturing the patterns of the series, for pure AR setups (without exogenous variables), standard k-fold CV is a valid strategy. Therefore, in situations with short series and small amounts of training data, where it is not practically feasible to apply the aforementioned tsCV techniques due to the initial folds involving very small lengths of the series, the standard CV method with some control of underfitting of the models is a better choice with efficient use of data.",

With the CV strategy, the past observations not in the training data but existing in the test set can be considered missing observations, and the task is seen more as a missing value imputation problem rather than a forecasting problem. Many forecasting models such as ETS (in its implementation in the forecast package (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018)), which iterate throughout the whole series, cannot properly deal with missing data. For RNNs as well, due to their internal states that are propagated forward along the series, standard k-fold CV which partitions data randomly across the series is usually not applicable. Therefore, for such models, the only feasible validation strategy is tsCV. Models such as ETS can anyway train competitively with minimal amounts of data (as is the case with the initial folds of the tsCV technique) and thus, are not quite problematic with tsCV. However, for reasonably trained pure AR models, where the forecasts for one window do not in any way depend on the information from other windows (due to not underfitting and having no internal state), it does not make a difference between filling the missing values in the middle of the series and predicting future values, where both are performed OOS. Nevertheless, the findings by Bergmeir et al. (2018) are restricted to only stationary series. Cerqueira et al. (2020) 's work on the same area has concluded that for stationary series, using a pure AR setup, a blocked CV strategy works the best, and they also perform an analysis on non-stationary data, discussed in the following section.",

            "text": "Cerqueira et al. (2020) experimented using non-stationary series, where they have concluded that OOS validation procedures preserving the temporal order (such as tsCV), are the right choice when non-stationarities exist in the series. However, a possible criticism of that work is the choice of models. We have seen in Section 3 that ML models are oftentimes not able to address certain types of non-stationarities out of the box. More generally speaking, ML models are non-parametric, data-driven models. As such, the models are typically very flexible and the function fitted depends heavily on the characteristics of the observed data. Though recently challenged (Balestriero et al., 2021) , a common notion is that ML models are typically good at interpolation and lack extrapolation capabilities. The models used by Cerqueira et al. (2020) include several ML models such as a Rule-based Regression (RBR) model, a Random Forest (RF) model and a Generalised Linear Model (GLM), without in any way explicitly tackling the non-stationarity in the data (similar to our example in Section 3). Thus, if a model is poor and not producing good forecasts, performing a validation to select hyperparameters, using any of the aforementioned CV strategies, will be of limited value. Furthermore, and more importantly, non-stationarity is a broad concept and it will depend both for the modelling and the evaluation on the type of non-stationarity which procedures will perform well. For example, with abrupt structural breaks and level shifts occurring in the unknown future, but not in the training and test set, it will be impossible for the models to address this change and none of the aforementioned evaluation strategies would do so either. In this situation, even tsCV would grossly underestimate the generalisation error. For a more gradual underlying change of the DGP, a validation set at the end of the series would be more appropriate since in that case, the data points closer to the end of the series may be already undergoing the change of the distribution. On the other hand, if the series has deterministic trend or seasonality, which are straightforward to forecast, they can be simply extracted from the series and predicted separately whereas the stationary remainder can be handled using the model. In such a setup, the k-fold CV scheme will work well for the model, since the remainder complies with the stationarity condition. For other non-deterministic trends, there are several data pre-processing steps mentioned in the literature such as lag-1 differencing, logarithmic transformation (for exponential trends), Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL Decomposition), local window normalisation (Hewamalage et al., 2021) , moving average smoothing, percentage change transform, wavelet transform etc. (Salles et al., 2019) . Salles et al. (2019) have conducted an extensive empirical study to investigate the impact of the choice of the data transformation technique on the accuracy of the model, using a linear ARMA model. Their findings have concluded that there is no single universally best transformation technique across all datasets; rather it depends on the characteristics of the individual datasets. However, for the particular datasets used in their study, differencing and moving average smoothing have generally worked the best for addressing trend. If appropriate data pre-processing steps are applied to enable models to handle non-stationarities, with a pure AR setup, the CV strategy still holds valid after the data transformation, if the transformation achieves stationarity. As such, to conclude, for non-stationarities, tsCV seems the most adequate as it preserves the temporal order in the data. However, there are situations where also tsCV will be misleading, and the forecasting practitioner will already for the modeling need to attempt to understand the type of non-stationarity they are dealing with. This information can subsequently be used for evaluation, which may render CV methods for stationary data applicable after transformations of the data to make them stationary.",

For time series models, it has been found that minimising AIC is asymptotically equivalent to minimising the MSE of OOS one-step ahead forecasts (Inoue and Kilian, 2006) . However, using AIC has several downsides. To use it to compare across models, the respective likelihoods need to be computed the same way, using the same data. Therefore, it cannot be used to compare across models, with different model orders, from different model families such as ETS and ARIMA (since likelihoods for those models are computed in different ways), with and without differencing, since differencing effectively reduces the amount of data points available for the model. Apart from that, AIC is in general used when getting access to a separate test set is expensive (due to limited data), which is often not the case with data-abundant scenarios where ML models are applicable. Therefore, AIC is more suitable for small datasets and this is why models such as ETS and ARIMA that are not very data-intensive, use AIC and other IC internally. Moreover, the definition of AIC uses (an estimation of) the number of parameters of the model, which is not straightforward for complex ML models, since simply counting the number of parameters does not represent well the complexity of such models. Due to these reasons, generally AIC and other IC are not used for ML models that work on large datasets. For such situations, the data partitioning methods discussed before are usually preferable.",

Belt (2017) argue in their work that a bias-variance decomposition of the error measure should be considered. Bias and variance of forecasts may yield different business decisions. Bias in predictions occurs due to errors from wrong model assumptions, which result in a weak model not having captured the exact patterns of the data. This happens mostly due to the selected sample of data (used for model training) being under-representative of the whole distribution, which is also called as the selection bias. Because of this reason, a model can be very accurate (forecasts being very close to actuals), but consistently produce more overestimations than underestimations, which may be concerning from a business perspective. Therefore, forecast bias is calculated with a sign, as opposed to absolute errors, so that it indicates the direction of the forecast errors, either positive or negative. For example, scale-dependent forecast bias can be assessed with the Mean Error (ME) as defined in Equation in 5. Here, y t indicates the true value of the series,\u0177 t the forecast and n, the number of all available errors (across series, across horizons, etc.). The scale-dependent standard deviation (Std) of the errors for the population is defined in Equation 6, assuming a 0 population mean of the errors, i.e., an unbiased model. Note that the Std of the errors for an unbiased model is identical to the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) defined later in Equation 10. Therefore, RMSE produces an estimate of the Std of the distribution of forecast errors. Other scale-free versions of bias and Std can be defined by scaling with respect to appropriate scaling factors, such as actual values of the series.",

The main reason for this is the need to have measures that allow for comparisons across series. For this, the measures need to be scaled, and it has turned out to be next to impossible to develop a scaling procedure that works for any type of possible non-stationarity and non-normality in a time series. Eventually we encounter a particular condition of the time series in the real world, that makes the proposed error measure fail (Svetunkov, 2021) . Thus, new measures usually either focus on specific business needs or have the intention of addressing issues of previously used measures, but have new issues then. This has led to a large pool of proposals in the literature. Researchers/practitioners very often have particular series in mind when evaluating in a certain way (using specific measures) in their work, but these preconditions are often never stated. For example, smart meter or wind power production series do not usually have exponential trends, and they hardly have level shifts or long-term trends etc. On the other hand, growing businesses such as tech start-ups or ride-share providers often have strong trends in any business related time series that they have collected. The key to selecting a particular error measure for forecast evaluation is that it is mathematically and practically robust under the given data. From a business point of view there can be other requirements for an error measure such as being interpretable (easy to communicate) and reflecting on the key performance indicators of the underlying business application such as the net profit; which we do not focus on in this work.",

Therefore, different point forecast evaluation measures are also targeted towards optimising for a specific statistic of the distribution and it is important to distinguish which statistic it is for each error measure. For example, measures with squared base errors such as MSE and RMSE optimise for the mean whereas others with absolute value base errors such as MAE and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) optimise for the median. Although the mean and median are the same for a symmetric distribution, that does not hold for skewed distributions as with intermittent series. There exist numerous controversies in the literature regarding this. Petropoulos et al. (2020) suggest that it is not appropriate to evaluate the same forecasts using many different error measures, since each one optimises for a different statistics of the distribution. Also according to Kolassa (2020) , if different point forecast evaluation measures are considered, multiple point forecasts for each series and time point also need to be created. Kolassa (2020) further argues that, if the ultimate evaluation measure is, e.g., MAE which focusses on the median of the distribution, it does not make sense to optimise the models using an error measure like MSE (which accounts for the mean). It is more meaningful to consider MAE also during model training as well. However, these arguments hold only if it is not an application requirement for the same forecasts to perform generally well under all these measures. Koutsandreas et al. (2021) have empirically shown that, when the sample size is large, a wide variety of error measures agree on the most consistently dominating methods as the best methods for that scenario. They have also demonstrated that using two different error measures for optimising and final evaluation has an insignificant impact on the final accuracy of the models. Berm\u00fadez et al. (2006) have developed a fuzzy ETS model optimised via a multi-objective function combining three error measures MAPE, RMSE and MAE. Empirical results have demonstrated that using such a mix of error measures instead of just one for the loss function leads to overall better, robust and generalisable results even when the final evaluation is performed with just one of those measures. Fry and Lichtendahl (2020) also assess their same forecasts across numerous error measures in a business context.",

This is due to all the pitfalls associated with every point forecast evaluation measure as discussed in the rest of this section. Also, according to that author, evaluating only individual statistics of a distribution is not adequate and the overall predictive distributions need to be considered instead, in order to estimate the uncertainty of the produced point forecasts with a reasonable confidence. Although not the main point of focus in this article, different evaluation measures have been proposed in this respect. Kolassa (2016) explains most of them including randomised probability integral transform (rPIT) and several proper scoring rules such as logarithmic score, Brier score, ranked probability score etc.",

Thus, the number of series further increases the amount of errors available for a single model. For summarising errors across all available series as well as the different steps in the forecast horizon, we can consider a number of statistics such as median, arithmetic mean or geometric mean etc. Using medians and geometric means instead of arithmetic means helps with avoiding sensitivity to outlier series in a set of time series. However, this means that using the arithmetic mean identifies the existence of such outlier errors for certain series. The problem specifically with geometric mean based measures is that a model can perform perfectly (0 or < 1 error) on one series and quite bad on all the others but still become the best (as the overall error becomes 0 or quite small due to multiplication) . Thus, Svetunkov (2021) mentions that the use of several summary operators on the same errors can raise awareness regarding these issues of the individual errors. Summarising across series and across the horizon can be done using the same or different statistical operators. We can also change the order of summarising the errors; for instance we can first summarise the errors for the different time steps separately and then summarise those per time step error measures. When summarising across the horizon, weights can be assigned to different time steps to get a weighted measure as well. Different terminology has been introduced by researchers for these base errors, statistical operators etc. For instance, in the work by Kunst (2016) , the base error functions are named as local distance functions and the statistical operators to summarise base errors are denoted as link functions. The resulting final error functions are known as metrics or distance functions. According to the terminology introduced by Hyndman and Koehler (2006) , which we follow in this paper, the base errors are called Errors, and summarised by using different statistical operators into Error Measures.",

Traditionally in forecasting, one series was mostly considered as a single dataset by practitioners in the domain. Therefore, scaling errors was limited to scales computed per each series or even each time step (to be able to compare errors across series). These approaches had several issues as explained next. However, in the current context of Big Data and global forecasting models, we are now in the situation where we want to compare models across datasets or select models that perform generally well on many datasets each having many series. Consequently, the error measures being introduced have also shifted from computing a scale per-series to a scale for the whole dataset. Such global scaling based error measures can address some of the issues with the per-step or per-series scaling. Nevertheless, Chen et al. (2017) state that despite the type of scaling used, the resulting error measure values need to be closely related to the scale of the series at the specific observation points. Hence, those authors opt for those measures that compute a per-step scaling. Due to the non-stationarities and non-normalities that are inherent in many time series, a constant estimator for scale (along the series or for the whole dataset) has been shown as a comparatively poor form of scaling for time series (Chen et al., 2017) .",

This means that in this range, all errors are simply divided by a fixed constant, irrespective of the actual value or the forecast of the series. This idea is similar to the concept of winsorising of error distributions suggested by Armstrong and Collopy (1992) , which is to clip extreme values/outliers (tails of the distribution) of the errors and replace them with certain limits/thresholds. Arnott et al. (2019) discuss the same idea of winsorisation for the purpose of excluding outliers from the data in the first place. In this sense, msMAPE can be considered as a winsorised version of sMAPE.",

For example, this threshold cannot be the same (say 0.5) on two series where one goes to a maximum value of 1000 and the other has values only in-between 0-1. Also, winsorising basically skews the error measure/data since all values in the distribution are cut off at a certain threshold. Therefore, msMAPE is rather ad-hoc and it does not estimate any statistic like the mean or median of the distribution; it is rather a biased version of mean/median. Apart from that, the issues arising from symmetry in sMAPE are still there in msMAPE as well, but only for larger actuals and forecasts that exceed the threshold. Due to these reasons, msMAPE is often disapproved by researchers, as it has no theoretical foundation and its statistical properties have not been explored.

On the other hand, measures which scale based on benchmark errors give direct interpretation of how good or bad the model is with respect to the benchmark, and thus also become comparable across datasets. However, with these relative measures the relative magnitude of the overall errors that we get depends on the competence of the underlying benchmark method on the respective series. Large errors from the benchmark methods tend to lessen the impact of the errors from our models. The opposite can happen too, where the underlying benchmark method is extremely good on one of the series in the dataset (very low benchmark errors), and thus overly exaggerates the errors from the forecasting model for that particular series, compared to the others. Thus, it becomes hard to capture models that do well on such series. Therefore, the choice of the benchmark method plays an important role for relative errors.",

Otherwise, in the one-step forecasts case, it basically resolves to computing a relative error per each step, which brings back all the issues of relative errors as discussed later in the next section.

Using a one-step ahead in-sample na\u00efve forecast as benchmark will often result in huge errors (>> 1) for the forecasts far ahead in the horizon, simply because the benchmark tackles an easier forecasting problem. Another problem is that this procedure makes the MASE errors coming from two datasets with two different sizes of the forecast horizon incomparable with each other. The solution is to consider in-sample multi-step ahead forecasts (with the same size as the forecast horizon) for the benchmark method as well, for reasonable comparison (Hyndman and Koehler, 2006) . However, this procedure may be complicated to implement and may hinder interpretability. Also, care needs to be taken about which benchmark is used.

When evaluating across series, the total error with scale-dependent error measures is dominated by those series that have higher scales/volumes. Because of this, a model can perform poorly on higher scaled series and really good on all the other series, but still end up as the worse model, with scale-dependent measures. However, depending on the business context, this can be a valid objective to forecast more accurately the series that have higher scales, since they may be really the objects of interest. Also, if the set of series under consideration have meaningful scales, making errors scale-free is perhaps not needed at all. This is the case with most of the real-world time series such as retail sales of certain products. However, the problem with scale-dependent measures is that, as soon as the scale of the series is changed (for example converting from one currency to another), the value of the error measures change (Tashman, 2000) . We may sometimes be even more interested in the final dollar value of the sales rather than the actual sales volume itself. In such a scenario, the errors need to be calculated in the respective scales of interest. Furthermore, if the underlying series/datasets contain no scale differences at all, the best option to compute errors is by using scale-dependent RMSE/MAE error measures which are robust against scaling in many practical time series scenarios. The errors computed likewise can be used in statistical tests for significance of the differences as described in Section 7 to get a better picture of the competitiveness of the used models.",

For example, if we say that MAE is 10 for a particular series, we have no idea whether it is a good or a bad accuracy. For a series with an average value of 1000, this amount of accuracy is presumably quite good, whereas for another series with an average value of 1, it is a very bad accuracy. If we want to obtain models that in general produce good forecasts for all the time series despite their scales, then scale-invariant measures are the better option. The underlying objective of making errors scale-free is that all the errors (coming from different time steps/series/datasets) contribute to comparable amounts of influence in the final overall error measure value, instead of some errors always dominating over others due to their scales. The error measures seen in the literature, have different forms of scaling; per-step, per-series or per-dataset. The particular scaling and therewith the error measures selected, depend on the underlying intentions of practitioners. In general, applications which intend to have comparability across differently scaled time steps of a single series may be more interested in per time step scales. Per series scaling holds for comparing among differently scaled series (with respect to forecastability or volume) within a dataset, but not necessarily for such differently scaled time steps within an individual series. On the other hand, global scales apply mostly for similar scaled time series within datasets, but have totally varying scales on different datasets, which we want to compare the models across. This is because, within a dataset, a global scaling does not perform a scaling per each series, but rather scaling all of them, due to simply dividing by a constant for the dataset, which still makes the errors scale-dependent in their relative differences. Therefore, if we are confident that the series within a single dataset are similar scaled, this type of scaling can be used to select models that perform well in general across different datasets with different scales, or to investigate how the performance of models differ across datasets by comparing. Log transformed errors also perform a scaling down of all the errors. However, log transformation is a monotonic transformation and therefore, unlike global scaling, log transformed errors are not quite suitable for comparison across datasets having different scales.",

Scale-dependent measures such as RMSE, MAE also avoid issues arising from the computation of the scale in scale-free measures (as further detailed in the following). Therefore, if comparison across different scaled series is a necessity, a more robust way of making errors scale-free is to compute RMSE/MAE values and consider the ranks of the involved models per series according to those measures. Ranking ignores the actual size of the errors, this can effectively avoid the errors being biased towards higher scaled series. However, due to the same reason, one method can perform marginally better than all the other methods in all the series except one where it is drastically worse than all the others. In such a scenario, a measure based on ranking would select that method as the best whereas in reality we would be more interested in a method that performs generally good on all the series. PB score too follows the same behaviour.",

Now, with global/pooled models which learn across many series, we have these scaling problems already at the model building phase, i.e. when normalising the input data. If the series have meaningful scales, and the final evaluation is expected to be performed on these original scales, it does not make sense to perform the modelling initially on pre-processed scale-free series. On the other hand, as is the practice in the ML community, most ML based models (apart from tree based models) are known to perform better with normalised data where all data points have similar scales. This makes the convergence of these models to optimal parameters much faster and accurate. Therefore, this poses a form of a contradiction between the model building and model evaluation phases for a global model. This can be addressed to a certain extent by using other techniques such as enforcing a partial scale dependence in the loss function used for model training or use the scale normalisation only for feeding inputs to the models and compute the losses on the original scale etc. As we deem the pre-processing of data to be outside the scope of our work, we focus in the following on the error measures and problems.

Evaluating the same forecasts with respect to many evaluation measures is a form of sanity checking to ensure that even under other measures (though not directly optimising for them), the forecasts still perform well. Furthermore, within a more practical context, forecasting and the respective accuracies of models alone are not sufficient, but rather how the produced forecasts affect the downstream decision making processes. In this sense, it can be argued that the final accuracy of the evaluated models need to be closely tied to business utility as seen by the downstream processes being optimised, such as energy costs, storage costs and trade-offs between them etc. This effectively makes the loss functions of models dependent upon each application specific requirement by having different constraints imposed. For example, with respect to short-term air quality prediction, it is more important to predict the peaks (extreme events) right, to detect potential health hazards. Similarly, in terms of wind power prediction, ramp forecasting (forecasting large and rapid variations in wind power) is of more importance, since that may help better plan for costs of extreme power integration into the grid and other power system operations. Hence, in both these scenarios probabilistic forecasting may be more interesting to understand how reliable the extreme forecasts would be.",

This is because on such series, the na\u00efve method will usually have bad performance, even when considering rolling origin to constitute the forecast horizon.

The opposite can happen too, due to downward trends. The same situation occurs with in-sample values based scaling such as sMAE, sMSE.

Due to structural breaks (anywhere in the series including in-sample, forecast horizon or the forecast origin), the mean of the series is not expected to hold constant throughout the whole series. For example, the same amount of e t in the horizons of two series, with same actuals and same forecasts from the model, can result in different overall errors when the values in the training region of the two series are different from each other, due to for example structural breaks in-sample. This scenario is depicted in Figure  18 , where the series A has a structural break in the training region, but has the same actual values as series B in the forecast horizon. The model too has produced the same forecasts for both series A and B, in the forecast horizon. This means that e t is the same for both series. However, due to scaling based on in-sample values, for series A, sMAE gives a slightly higher value than on series B. With OOS global scaling, the situation is similar to trends. On a series having non-stationarities such as a structural break, such measures are not used in the idea of scaling with respect to each time step or series, since the global estimator if the scale is a constant one. On the other hand, measures which compare against a benchmark are applicable as long as the used benchmark is comparable in accuracy to the model in the intended forecast horizon. This holds true for relative errors and measures (purely based on OOS errors), on series with structural breaks anywhere in the series. The evaluated model is expected to perform poorly on such a series when for example the structural break is in the horizon or the forecast origin. The same applies for the benchmark OOS as well. However, if the mean forecast is used as the benchmark instead of the na\u00efve method, in the particular case when there are structural breaks in the training region, the evaluated model may be quite good OOS, but the mean forecast both in-sample and OOS may be badly affected by the changepoint. This is because, the mean forecast depends on the whole history of the series, including both before and after the changepoint. On scaled errors too, potential structural breaks in the horizon or the forecast origin can become problematic. The in-sample na\u00efve will perform well whereas the OOS forecast from the proposed method may be completely different from the actuals. This situation is illustrated in Figure 19 where a changepoint existing at the forecast origin makes the training region different from the testing region. Hence, considering in-sample errors of the benchmark for the scaling factor in this case has resulted in a MASE value higher than 1, which means that the model is worse than the seasonal na\u00efve benchmark. However, OOS it is seen that the benchmark method has even a higher MAE than the model due to the structural break. Therefore, high or low value of this error measure is not necessarily equivalent to good or bad performance. It needs to be ensured that the scale computed in-sample with benchmark errors is a reasonable scale for the errors OOS. ",

Therefore, on such series, RMSE which minimises for the mean will be a better option to select models that predict non-zero values while MAE may select models that predict constant 0's, or are at least heavily biased towards zeros.

When the actual values are close to 0, the error distribution becomes heavily skewed with extremely large errors. But, these large errors do not mean that the model performs poorly; they are simply a result of low actual values of the series (Davydenko and Fildes, 2013) . Those large error values are produced from the error measure despite the forecasts from the model at those points. It may be the case that the model produces a very accurate forecast quite close to 0, but the division by the actual value results in a very high error. On the other hand, even with an inaccurate forecast at such a point, the final error would be equally very high. Due to this reason, measures such as MAPE are not competent in distinguishing good and bad forecasts at actual values of 0. When the actual value and the forecast are both 0 too (perfect prediction at 0 actual values), MAPE becomes undefined. Some software systems that deal with MAPE error values simply disregard the errors at 0 actuals when computing the overall error measure. But, this has teh problem that it means that the accuracy of forecasts for 0 actuals are not important, which depending on the application may be true or not. (Kolassa, 2017) . It also means that such a modified measure does not estimate the mean nor the median nor any other meaningful summary statistic of the distribution that was originally intended to be optimised for. Using MdAPE on intermittent series instead of MAPE also results in a slightly more robust error measure to 0 actual values. However, this also makes MdAPE less sensitive to errors at the 0 actuals, which are important and meaningful, and may overlook problems of the underlying model at such points (Davydenko and Fildes, 2013) .",

So the problem of undefined values arising from division by values close to 0 still exists in sMAPE. Furthermore, if the actual value is 0, regardless of the value of the forecast (unless equal to 0), the sMAPE value ends up as 200 (the maximal value) even though the difference between the actual and predicted values can be quite small. Therefore, in the case of intermittent series, if sMAPE is used as the evaluation measure, we effectively require the underlying forecasting technique to predict actual zeros, for example through a zero-inflated model, since the error measure does not capture good forecasts at such points, similar to MAPE. The msMAPE with its modified denominator, specifically addresses the issue of division by values close to 0 in sMAPE. It provides a very straightforward fix/adjustment for the issue of division by 0 values, but it has issues as discussed in Section 6.1.2. In the MAAPE measure, The arctan function is well defined for all real values. Thus, unlike p t , the base error in MAAPE approaches \u03c0/2 when division by 0 occurs. However, when both y t and\u0177 t are 0 (perfect prediction), MAAPE becomes undefined. Therefore, predicting 0's right in a series can break this measure similar to sMAPE and MAPE. On the other hand, for any forecast other than 0, at a time step of an actual 0, MAAPE produces its maximum value of \u03c0/2, despite how close the forecast is to 0. In this sense, MAAPE shows a similar behaviour to sMAPE and MAPE where for actual 0's, the error measure is not consistent.",

This is what measures such as WAPE try to achieve. The actual values of the series for the whole forecast horizon are summed up before the division. This greatly reduces the risk of dividing by 0 values in the original percentage error p t , where the division happens per each time step. WAPE is undefined only when the total of all the actual values corresponding to the forecast horizon are zero. However, that too is not that rare with a short forecasting horizon and very intermittent series. Nevertheless, due to this robustness, WAPE is generally more preferred in application scenarios than MAPE. However, due to using absolute errors, WAPE too has the problem that, on intermittent series it may select models predicting constant 0's. This can be circumvented by including squared errors e 2 t in the numerator as in the WRMSPE measure. The RTAE measure also tries to fix the problem of WAPE when having all 0's or close to 0's in the whole forecast horizon. As discussed in Section 6.1.2, this is done by using a fix similar to msMAPE which has its own issues. On the other hand, with percentage based measures that scale based on in-sample values, on short intermittent series, the scale can still be 0, even when computed by aggregating several values, which is rare but possible. Specifically with the sMAE measure, it has the same problem that due to computing absolute errors, an all 0's prediction can be selected as the best on an intermittent series. This is also the case with the ND measure. However, the NRMSE measure overcomes the problem due to squared errors. Apart from that, global scaling based measures are oftentimes good measures on intermittent series, since the global summary statistic computed for the scale is less susceptible to failures on a set of intermittent series.",

The same issue is encountered, if both the benchmark and the forecasting model produce 0 errors. The solution of winsorising errors proposed by Armstrong and Collopy (1992) in this context has the same issues as discussed for msMAPE in Section 6.1.2. Another solution proposed by Kolassa (2016) for this is to sum the benchmark errors over multiple time steps and then take the ratio. This idea follows the concept behind WAPE defined in Section 6.1.2 and is similar to the Relative Measures as discussed in Section 6.1.4. In this case, such undefined values can only occur if the benchmark error is zero for all the considered time steps, which is a very rare case. However, this too is likely with a very short forecast horizon on an intermittent series.",

Moreover, techniques such as Croston's method (see, e.g., Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018) which are specifically developed for intermittent series, forecast a demand rate (average expected demand in each period) as opposed to an exact demand for each time step, for the convenience of making inventory management decisions.

To be robust against outliers, a summary operator other than mean (such as median or another quantile) can be used. Geometric mean is also a generally robust option for summarising errors in the presence of outliers. Using the geometric mean has been recommended by Davydenko and Fildes (2013) especially since it takes into account all values even in the tails of the distribution to compute the final summary, as opposed to the median.

Even if a mean on the actual values over the horizon is computed for the scale, the impact from such extreme values can be large. The problem is even worse here than with MAPE, since that same scale is used for the errors of the whole horizon. Thus, the problems at a single time step in the forecast horizon, can affect the errors from the whole horizon. For example, if there exists at least one outlier with an extremely large value in the test region, the denominator becomes very large and totally diminishes the effects from all the other errors for that particular series. The opposite can happen too, where due to very low valued outliers, even small errors from the forecasts of the series can have a large impact in the final error. Effects from such outliers can be mitigated by excluding them in the computation of the scaling factor. With respect to measures such as sMAE or sMSE, anomalous time steps/short periods of time in the series can affect the scale significantly and consequently lessen or increase the impact from such errors in the horizon unnecessarily for that particular series. However, similar to WAPE, this can be avoided by ignoring the outlier time steps from the series in the scale computation. On the other hand, when the scale is computed globally by considering all the series in the dataset, effects from such outliers in particular points of the series are mostly mitigated.",

Nevertheless, when computing the geometric mean, it needs to be ensured that 0 errors for both the benchmark as well as the evaluated forecasting technique are excluded. Also, MRAE is more robust with outliers than RMRSE, due to considering absolute errors in the former. However, if using the fixed origin na\u00efve method as the benchmark for relative errors, its value in the forecast horizon can get affected by outliers in the last part of the training region of the series. This effectively results in large benchmark errors in the forecast horizon. This scenario is illustrated in Figure 21 , where except for the outlier around the forecast origin in series A, both series A and B are equivalent in values. The model in series A is robust to outliers and thus, despite the outlier in series A, the model produces identical forecasts for both series A and B. On the other hand, the OOS na\u00efve forecast on series A is completely affected by this outlier. Due to this reason, the MRAE for the model on series A is much smaller than in series B, although the model demonstrates the same discrepancy from the actuals in the forecast horizon on both the series. This difference of MRAE is merely due to the susceptibility of the na\u00efve forecast to the outlier and not due to any misbehaviour of the model on series B. With Relative Measures too, the same factors as with relative errors hold on outlier series. In between the two scaled errors MASE and RMSSE, MASE is preferred to be robust over RMSSE on outliers. Measures based on a transformation such as logarithm are good options to de-emphasise effects from errors at extremely large outlier points in the series.

The general principal behind all these tests is hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis stands for non-significance of difference in the results, and the alternative hypothesis stands for their significance. The null hypothesis is then rejected based on the value of a certain test statistic. The Diebold-Mariano test (Diebold and Mariano, 2002) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann and Whitney, 1947) are both designed for comparing only between two competing forecasts, not necessarily methods or models. However, the Diebold-Mariano test is designed specifically for time series and parametric, meaning that it has the assumption of normality of the data whereas the Wilcoxon test is a generic non-parametric test based on the ranks of the methods. Due to considering ranks of methods for each series separately, the error measures used do not necessarily have to be scale-free. The Giacomini-White test (Giacomini and White, 2006) again is based on the comparison of two forecasts, with the potential to assess the conditional predictive ability (CPA), a concept that refers to conditioning the choice of a potential future state of the economy, an important concept for marco economic forecasting of a small number of series. A continuation in this line of research is work by Li et al. (2022) that focuses on conditional superior predictive ability, in regards to a benchmark method and time series with general serial dependence. It should be noted that many of the mentioned comparison tests are per-se designed for comparing two forecasts, and a multiple testing of more than two requires a correction for multiple hypothesis testing, such as, e.g., a Bonferroni correction.",

Hence, the Friedman test is usually followed by a post-hoc test, when the null hypothesis which states that \"there are no significant differences between the methods\", is rejected. There are different types of post-hoc tests, for example, the Hochberg procedure (Hochberg, 1988) , the Holm process (Holm, 1979) , the Bonferroni-Dunn procedure (Dunn, 1961) , the Nemenyi method (Nemenyi, 1963) , the Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) method (practically equivalent to the Nemenyi method) or the Multiple Comparisons with the Mean (ANOM) method (Halperin et al., 1955) , and others. In general, the ANOM test holds less value in practice since it is more useful to find which methods are not significantly different from the best, than from some averagely performing method overall. The Nemenyi method works by defining confidence bounds, in terms of a Critical Distance (CD) around the mean ranks of the methods to identify which methods have overlapping confidence bounds and which do not. This method also has the added advantage that it allows to identify significant differences between two different groups of methods. As Dem\u0161ar (2006) suggests, if all the comparisons are to be performed against one control method as opposed to each method against each other, procedures such as Bonferroni-Dunn and Hochberg's are better over the Nemenyi test. Once, the quantitative results for the significance of the differences are obtained using any of the aforementioned methods, they can be visualised using CD diagrams (Dem\u0161ar, 2006) . They are illustrated differently for the different post-hoc tests. In general, in these diagrams, a horizontal axis reports the average ranks of all the methods, and groups of methods that are not significantly different from each other are connected using black bars. This is illustrated in Figure 23 , an example CD diagram.",

More importantly, the amount of data included heavily impacts the results of the significance tests. For example, with a very high number of series, the CD Figure 23 : An example of a CD diagram to visualise the significance of the differences between a number of competing methods. The best three methods A, B and C are not significantly different from each other. On the other hand, methods D, E and F are significantly worse than those three methods. Again, the amount of data has not been enough to check whether method E is significantly better than method D or worse than method F. is usually very low, producing significant results for even small differences between models. This does not indicate a problem with the procedure, rather it means that the results are more reliable, that even the slightest differences between models encountered for such a large amount of data are statistically highly significant. On the other hand, it also depends on the number and the relative performance of the set of models included in the comparison. For example, having more and more poorly performing methods in the group may tend towards making the CD larger, thus making other intermediate methods have no significant difference from the best. In essence, with respect to statistical testing for significance of differences, it is important to include a reasonable amount of data as well as a reasonable number of models with sufficient diversity to avoid spurious conclusions regarding statistical significance.",

In other major fields such as regression, classification, there exist established techniques that are the standard best practices. On the contrary, in the domain of forecasting, evaluation remains a much more complex task. The numerous research that has been conducted in this space over the years has contributed to many new ideas and concepts. The general trend has been to propose new methodologies to address pitfalls associated with the previously introduced. Nevertheless, for example with the forecast evaluation measures, to the best of our knowledge, all the introduced measures thus far, can break under given certain characteristics/non-stationarities of the time series. Due to the self-supervised nature of the forecasting problem, data leakage dangers need to be especially kept in mind. Furthermore, general ML practitioners and Data Scientists new to the field of forecasting are often not aware of these issues. The huge collection of forecast evaluation techniques that different practitioners use with various intentions (which are not explicitly stated), adds up to further confusion. All of this is a consequence of the lack of established best practices and guidelines for the different steps of the forecast evaluation process. Therefore, to support the ML community in this aspect, in this article we provide a compilation of common pitfalls and best practice guidelines related to forecast evaluation including data partitioning, calculating error measures etc. The key set of guidelines that we have developed are as follows.",

It is our objective that this effort supports better and correct forecast evaluation practices within the ML community. The adoption of correct principles in this domain will certainly contribute towards developing even further superior ML based systems for forecasting. As a potential avenue for further work, it would be useful to design combination based evaluation measures for forecasting, similar to the Huber loss for model training, which is a combination of the MAE and the RMSE. These types of measures can be quite robust, combining the strengths of both measures while minimising the potential disadvantages associated with the individual measures.",
