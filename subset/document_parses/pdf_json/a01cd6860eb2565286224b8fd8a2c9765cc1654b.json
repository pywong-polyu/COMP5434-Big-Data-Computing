Escherichia coli is one of the most important prokaryotic model organisms.

Some scholars selected 288 different PWMs to conduct a systematic study on 599 sigma70 promoters. e study found that the sensitivity reached 86%, while the accuracy rate was only 53%. Some scholars have predicted 469 Escherichia coli promoter sequences and their positions based on predicted transcription units and using the Markov model (MM). e accuracy rate is more than 70%. e neural network method (NN) has also been used many times to predict the promoter of Escherichia coli. Recently, some scholars have used NNPP2.2 software to combine the distance from TSS to the translation initiation site (TIS) to improve the prediction accuracy of the Escherichia coli promoter [2] . Some scholars used the support vector machine (SVM) to predict 669 Escherichia coli sigma70 promoters and obtained high prediction accuracy. Some scholars have proposed a prokaryotic promoter identification method based on feature screening, and this method has also achieved satisfactory prediction results. We once proposed a position association scoring matrix (PCSM) algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of promoters. Recently, some scholars have obtained higher recognition accuracy by combining the diversity increment with the secondary discriminant analysis (IDQD) method.",

Second, the promoter sequence is divided into different windows according to the sequence characteristics, and the discrete increment index (ID) is used to measure the information content of the sequence in each window.

But in fact, there is no experiment to prove which part of the sequence does not contain a promoter [5] . erefore, according to the known transcription unit structure of Escherichia coli and the known promoter or coding region location, try to avoid regions where promoters may appear to extract negative data. e nonpromoter sequence selected in this study comes from two regions: coding region sequence and noncoding region sequence. Since the promoter drives its downstream genes, it is generally located at the head of the coding region. However, because the Escherichia coli genome is small, 89% are coding regions, so some promoters will exist at the end of the previous gene. erefore, the nonpromoter of the coding region is selected in the middle part of the longer gene.

We first considered the interaction between RNA polymerase and DNA sequence and constructed a position correlation scoring function. In fact, this scoring function can roughly measure the free energy of interaction between RNA polymerase and DNA sequence. Second, the discrete index is used to describe the sequence composition of different windows of the promoter. e discrete index is another reflection form of information entropy, so the discrete increment describes the increase of sequence information. Both have strict physics meaning, but they belong to different physics concepts, which can be regarded as orthogonal in mathematics. In this way, we got the promoter description method under multiple feature scales and then used the modified Markov discriminant to realize the promoter prediction of Escherichia coli.",
