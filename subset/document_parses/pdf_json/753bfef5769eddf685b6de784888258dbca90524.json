A collection and analysis of studies related to the association between COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) transmission and meteorological factors, such as humidity, is vital and indispensable for disease prevention and control. A comprehensive literature search using various databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, was systematically performed to identify eligible studies from Dec 2019 to Feb 1, 2021. We also established six criteria to screen the literature to obtain high-quality literature with consistent research purposes. This systematic review included a total of 62 publications. The study period ranged from 1 to 8 months, with 6 papers considering incubation, and the lag effect of climate factors on COVID-19 activity being taken into account in 22 studies. After quality assessment, no study was found to have a high risk of bias, 30 studies were scored as having moderate risks of bias, and 32 studies were classified as having low risks of bias. The certainty of evidence was also graded as being low. When considering the existing scientific evidence, higher temperatures may slow the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, during the course of the epidemic, these climate variables alone could not account for most of the variability. Therefore, countries should focus more on health policies while also taking into account the influence of weather.",

            "text": "The current COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, which can result in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and has affected more than 103 million people globally, including 206 countries, and has resulted in over 2 million deaths worldwide as of January 31, 2021 . The new pandemic has become one of the worst public health crises, arousing considerable concern throughout the world. The new virus is mainly transmitted when people are in close contact, often via small droplets that are produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking, which exposes the virus to the external environment. Usually, instead of remaining in the air for a long period of time, droplets are peculiarly prone to falling to the ground or surfaces (Srivastava 2021) . Its mechanism of rapid transmission and virological characteristics have not been fully explored and understood, but we know that, historically, many viruses have possessed different stabilities in different environments and that some infectious diseases have changed with the weather. For example, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was observed to be more stable under low temperature or low humidity conditions and could still be recovered after 48 h in the laboratory (van Doremalen et al. 2013) . Historically, human-to-human transmissions of coronavirus and positive viscous infectious diseases have been mostly reported in subtropical monsoon climates or in winter and spring festivals in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas Flavivirus infectious diseases have been mostly detected in tropical regions, as well as in hot and rainy summers and autumns (Wang et al. 2020b) . Additionally, the transmission of rotavirus has been shown to peak in December or January in the southwestern USA, but it has also been shown to peak in April and May in the Northeast (Mo 2020) . At present, some scholars have found that COVID-19 is sensitive to high temperature and humidity conditions in the laboratory. For example, Casanova et al. have found that there was greater survival at low temperatures and low relative humidity for SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions (Casanova et al. 2010) . In cell cultures, the new coronavirus was observed to be highly stable at 4\u00b0C. Moreover, its survival was found to be related to the concentration of the virus, and the high concentration of the virus could survive for 7 days at 22.5\u00b0C, whereas the virus only remained completely alive for 1 day at 37\u00b0C (Cui et al. 2021 ). This in vitro study showed that SARS-CoV-2 obtained from a COVID-19 patient could be rapidly inactivated via irradiation with a deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) of 280 \u00b1 5 nm wavelength (Inagaki et al. 2020) . These results suggest that the epidemic of COVID-19 may be associated with meteorological variables, such as ultraviolet light and temperature.",

Although the effects of climate variables on COVID-19 activity varied among different country populations, time units, and analytical methods, there were also similar results in the included studies, and especially most of the literature showed that higher temperatures may have largely influenced the spread of coronavirus and suppressed the pandemic. Among the included studies, fifty-eight studies explored the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 transmission, but only one study investigated the heat index, which was found to be positively correlated with the daily basic reproductive number (R 0 ), growth rate, and doubling time (Adnan et al. 2021) . Additionally, another study adopted the mean equivalent temperature and found it to be a noninfluential factor on COVID-19 activity (Jamshidi et al. 2020) . In thirty-seven studies that analyzed relative humidity, fourteen studies did not observe any significant correlations, which was a result that we could not ignore. In addition, another paper included the specific humidity and indicated the existence of a low positive correlation between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and specific humidity. Among twentyeight studies that analyzed wind speed, only two studies included wind direction, with one study showing that wind direction affected the number of COVID-19 cases (based on wind rose analysis), and the other study indicating that wind direction and wind speed produced minimal effects on the number of confirmed cases in 37.9% and 27.5% of the provinces, respectively, in China.

He et al. considered city level and public health measures as being controlling factors in the linear regression . Moreover, Zhang et al. included a lockdown variable to explain government intervention in local and cross-regional COVID-19 transmission . Panel data models with fixed effects were used to identify the links between daily mean temperature, human (Fu et al. 2021 ). However, only four studies identified potential confounding factors and conducted strategies to address the stated confounding factors, such as incorporations into the models and inclusions of dew point, cloud cover, precipitation, relative humidity, air pressure, or wind speed for the same period. The hypothesized associations between climatic variables and COVID-19 may change or not be maintained when a range of potential confounding variables are taken into account. It is strange that many studies regarded public opinion, gene mutation, social isolation, universal masking, and other factors as being confounding factors, but this systematic review does not agree with this perception, and we believe that only those factors meeting the definition of confounders are confounding factors (Valente et al. 2017 ). Due to the confinement and reduction of socioeconomic activities caused by the pandemic, the air quality in Victoria, Mexico, has improved. Moreover, temperature was moderately to very strongly negatively correlated with all of the air pollution variables, and PM 10 and PM 2.5 possessed significant correlations with the cases (Tello-Leal and Mac\u00edas-Hern\u00e1ndez 2020). Hence, we speculated that air quality factors may be confounding factors. Geographic factors, such as elevation, are highly associated with the weather type and can indirectly affect air pressure . Furthermore, the sunlight UV radiation dose varies with latitude and season (Tang et al. 2021 ), but no statistically significant association was found between any geographic characteristic and the R 0 in India (Kulkarni et al. 2021) . Therefore, the question as to whether latitude and longitude are confounding factors requires further study.",

Fan et al. performed a multicollinearity test to verify the degree to which weather variables were related to each other and found that multicollinearity was not a primary issue (Fan et al. 2021 ). Instead of using average daily temperature, Byass adopted the averages of maximum and minimum daily temperatures as a single measure of temperature to avoid collinearity between maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation when constructing a multivariable regression model (Byass 2020) . To solve the problem that temperature and UV index were highly correlated, two separate models were used to fit for the temperature and the UV index, respectively, and all of the other variables were kept identical (Islam et al. 2021) . Some studies were concerned about the relationships between meteorological factors and provided the correlation coefficients. For example, Tello-Leal et al. demonstrated the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix for main variables by using a dataset of the last 4 weeks of the partial lockdown (Tello-Leal and Mac\u00edas-Hern\u00e1ndez 2020). Moreover, Rendana et al. provided the Spearman correlation coefficients between wind speed and other meteorological factors and found that wind speed was positively associated with rainfall and temperature, as well as the fact that the correlation may be influenced by seasonal characteristics (Rendana 2020; Thangariyal et al. 2020 ).",

Malki et al. ranked feature importance through a random forest feature selector algorithm and found that temperature and hours of sunlight were important features for infected cases of COVID-19 cases, and climate factors were more important than demographics, such as population, age, and urban percentage, when inspecting mortality (Malki et al. 2020 ). Kulkarni et al. estimated the proportional reduction in error by using an established approach to quantify the relative contribution of each covariate with the timedependent R 0 and found that the contributions of air temperature and wind speed to dampening the R 0 estimate were 3-4 times weaker than that in the countrywide lockdown phases 2-4 (Kulkarni et al. 2021 ). Hence, governments should take necessary human mobility restrictions and precautionary measures and regard prevention and control of the epidemic as regular.",

In addition, we have provided reference information for global epidemic control and proposed new breakthrough directions for future research. However, we only searched three databases, which could result in biases. The identification of confounding variables, the control of collinearity problems, and the consideration of influential factors were also important limitations of this systematic review. Moreover, there was no consideration of detailed information of cases such as age, weight, personal health status, and other factors. The relatively longer study periods could avoid the bias caused by various ecological factors over time, and more proper processing methods should be explored. Lastly, days of lagging effects and incubation periods need to be distinguished, especially if we want to consider both factors. More investigation is required to address the stated limitations.",

In addition, largescale multicenter studies may be able to avoid many biases and obtain more concrete results. The optimization of existing models and the addition of prediction models or spatialtemporal models at a more specific and proper level are also good choices. Another essential consideration for future research is vaccine popularization and patient personal information when exploring the correlation between climate factors and the transmission of COVID-19.",

It is certain that weather factors, especially temperature, humidity, wind speed, and ultraviolet light, could play an important role in the epidemic, but the contribution of meteorological factors is relatively small compared to factors like lockdown, social interaction, herd immunity, migration patterns, population density, personal hygiene, defense mechanisms, obedience of individuals to policies, and socio-economic level. Therefore, countries should focus more on health policies and vaccines while taking into account the influence of weather on outbreaks.",
