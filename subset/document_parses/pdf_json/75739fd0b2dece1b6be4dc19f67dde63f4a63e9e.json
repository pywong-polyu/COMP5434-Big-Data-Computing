Researchers worldwide are working together and facing many challenges to bring out the proper vaccines to prevent this infectious virus. Therefore, in this study, a system has been designed which will be adequate to stop the outbreak of COVID-19 by spreading awareness of the COVID-19 infected patient situated area. The model has been formulated for Location base COVID-19 patient identification using mobile crowdsourcing. In this system, the government will update the information about inflected COVID-19 patients. It will notify other users in the vulnerable area to stay at 6 feet or 1.8-meter distance to remain safe. We utilized the Haversine formula and circle formula to generate the unsafe area. Ten thousand valid information has been collected to support the results of this research. The algorithm is tested for 10 test cases every time, and the datasets are increased by 1000. The run time of that algorithm is growing linearly. Thus, we can say that the proposed algorithm can run in polynomial time. The algorithm's correctness is also being tested where it is found that the proposed algorithm is correct and efficient. We also implement the system, and the application is evaluated by taking feedback from users. Thus, people can use our system to keep themselves in a safe area and decrease COVID patients' rate.",

This paper's main motive is to locate COVID patients by tracing their contact who are walking outside without maintaining their quarantine and immediately aware nearby people who are walking nearby that COVID patient. This study includes four participants, i.e., user, health service provider, telecommunication service provider, and government. As the telecom company has an extensive network, they can identify any contact by using GPS. They will send the location data to the government, marking the place as safe or unsafe. This framework can efficiently identify the infected people, reducing the amount of death ratio in the future as the people will get the notification of their nearby patients. The utilized algorithm has been justified by its effectiveness and correctness of the algorithm. Also, the app user has a chance to provide valuable feedback regarding app performance.",

Paper [22] outlined a systemic review of mobile apps using the contact tracing model from different electronic databases like google scholar, PubMed, Google, and others. The findings confer that from 18 May 2020 to 31 May 2020, only 15 apps developed for contract tracing for covid-19. For these reasons, this study focused on creating a crowdsource-based new contact tracing system concerning users and patients' security and privacy issues. The main objectives of this study are defined below: \uf0b7 To build a contact tracing framework for detecting COVID infected patients and notify nearby users from the government end. \uf0b7 To use mobile crowdsourcing to collect COVID patients' information and locate them by using a smartphone sensor. \uf0b7 To evaluate the system scalability by taking feedback from the users. Corona Tracer BD [28] is the only corona tracing application available in Bangladesh, and it also includes Bluetooth connectivity. Hence, this new application will not require a Bluetooth connection. The application is not limited to trace only COVID patients but also traces the nearby person of COVID cases for sending awareness notification by the government. Therefore, it is clear that this app will be a positive addition for developing countries like Bangladesh for enhancing the COVID-19 situation by reducing COVID infection.",

The second -third -fourth stage is iterative. We will finalize our proposed algorithm based on the efficiency and correctness of the algorithm. If our algorithm is efficient and correct, we will move to the next stage. In stage 5, we will develop an android application and send it to users to test our application. Based on the user feedback, we will analyze whether the application performs well or not. This fifth -sixth -seventh stage is also an iterative process. If the user feedback is below the threshold value, then we will continuously improve our application. Fig. 2 briefly explains our proposed system. The Government will update the information of the COVID infected patients and notify other users to stay at 6 feet or 1.8 meters distant to remain safe. We can see that the red-marked phone user is the infected user. So, the Government will mark the unsafe area making a circle where the center is the infected user. COVID might infect anyone inside the ring, so the government sends a notification to them to quickly move to the outside of that circle, denoted as the safe area. ",

Let, plat and plon is the latitude and longitude of the infected patient that the TSP has shared. To calculate the radius of our unsafe area, we first need the earth's radius, which is 6371 km. Then, we find another safe latitude point at a distance of 1.6m from the patient. In this algorithm, the Haversine formula [20] is used to detect the patient's distance and safe point. Using this formula, we will get the distance measurement of the unsafe area. There might be some noise while calculating the distance. We need to address those noise to get the accurate distance for both safe and unsafe area. Thus, we add noise n with the length to find the radius of our unsafe area. After that, using the circle formula, we find our desired hazardous site. The government will notify everyone who is inside or near the dangerous area.",

The dataset is uniformly divided into ten test cases, and each test case is merged with the previous test cases.

One of the significant reasons for the virus spread was close contact with the infected patient. For this reason, we implemented an application to trace the infected people and notify others to remain safe. Several applications have already been implemented to trace contact in different countries. However, people are still unwilling to use the tracing applications for several reasons like user-friendliness, privacy, etc. Thus, we propose an easy-to-use, privacy-aware application to detect COVID patients using mobile crowdsourcing.",

One of the prime Bluetooth-based attacks is Bluejacking [26] and Bluesnarfing [27] . These attacks can cause intrusions and can access the files stored in the system. In Bangladesh, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one corona tracing application named Corona Tracer BD [28] , which also needs Bluetooth connectivity to detect COVID safe distance. As our proposed system does not connect to Bluetooth to trace contacts, our system is not vulnerable to any Bluetooth-based attack. Thus, no sensitive data is shared with any other users.",

All the user's feedback was collected from the student at the university level with an age-limited to 18-22 years. This crowdsourced-based contact tracking system worked efficiently by eradicating previous limitations such as connectivity, security, complexity, and performance issues. We examined the utilized algorithm and the application interface to maximize the overall performance and make a user-friendly application.

The leading cause of this problem is that the infected people do not maintain their quarantine properly and walk outside without any concern.

Therefore, to stop the spread of this virus, this paper proposed a crowdsourcedbased contact tracing framework. By utilizing the Haversine and circle formula, the unsafe area has been calculated. The algorithm has been tested for several test cases and datasets to validate its efficiency in polynomial time. Once the government identified the marked area, they will notify people staying in that significant zone. User ratings also verify the application scalability, security, and effectiveness.",
