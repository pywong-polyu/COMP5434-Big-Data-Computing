            "text": "Aims: Deficits in motor inhibitory control and working memory have been hypothesized to be both a cause and consequence of heavy alcohol use. Adolescence is a critical developmental stage for inhibitory control and working memory, and it is also a stage when individuals are most likely to initiate alcohol use. This study aimed to examine whether inhibitory control and working memory would predict alcohol use and involvement in a group of UK adolescents. Methods: We recruited 220 (N = 178, female) adolescents, aged between 16 and 18, from eight higher education settings in the Merseyside region of the UK. Alcohol use was examined using the Timeline Follow-Back and involvement (and related problems) using the Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale. A reward-based inhibitory control task (Go/No-Go) was used to examine the inhibition and reward sensitivity, and a self-ordered pointing task was used to measure working memory. Results: Multiple regression demonstrated that neither inhibitory control (b = 0.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): \u22120.21, 0.24)) nor working memory (b = \u22120.12 (95% CI: \u22120.30, 0.07)) were significant predictors of alcohol use (units consumed). Inhibitory control (b = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.12, 1.09), specifically, in the no reward condition and school deprivation (b = 0.67 (95% CI: 0.06, 1.28) significantly predicted alcohol-related problems. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated limited evidence that deficits in specific mechanisms of executive functioning (i.e. motor inhibition and working memory) were associated with alcoholrelated problems in UK adolescents. This study adds to an increasing body of literature suggesting weak or non-existent links between inhibitory control, working memory and alcohol use.",

Eight percent of 11year-olds report consuming alcohol, which rises to 69% by age 15 (Hawkins, 2012) . Alcohol consumption during adolescence is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits (Zeigler et al., 2005) , short-term physical harm and risky behaviours (Boden et al., 2011) . Furthemore, earlier onset of alcohol use is associated with increased risk of developing a substance use disorder in later life (Hingson and Zha, 2009) . Encouragingly, recent work suggests that alcohol consumption is on the decline in youth drinkers in the UK (Oldham et al., 2019) , with similar findings from Europe and North America (Norstrom and Svensson, 2014; Raninen et al., 2014; Looze et al., 2015) ; however, the prevalence of adolescent drinking is still a concern, given the associations with a range of negative health outcomes (Zeigler et al., 2005) .",

Broadly speaking, impulsivity can be viewed as the opposite of a general cognitive ability, with the two constructs overlapping both theoretically and in measurement instruments (Bickel et al., 2012) . Both constructs have been previously implicated as both the cause and consequence of excessive alcohol consumption (Coskunpinar et al., 2013) . Key components of both constructs are inhibitory control and working memory (Miyake et al., 2000; Bickel et al., 2012) . Inhibitory control is the ability to control or adjust one's behaviour in response to internal or external factors Diamond, 2013) , and it is multifaceted, encompassing a variety of conscious and subconscious behaviours, such as memory, attention and motor movements (Diamond, 2013) . Computerized tasks have been developed to objectively assess motor inhibitory control, such as stop signal tasks (SSTs) and Go/No-Go, in which a dominant motor response is established and participants are required to inhibit this response on a minority of trials Diamond, 2013) . Luna et al. (2004) suggest that basic-level response inhibition, voluntary initiation and suppression of behaviours are present in early childhood and they develop further during adolescence.",

Heightened reward sensitivity has been operationalized as increased impulsive decision-making and decreased inhibitory control to rewards (Peeters et al., 2017) . Findings suggest that reward sensitivity can promote adolescent alcohol use, with reactivity to rewarding cues able to predict current (van Hemel-Ruiter et al., 2013) and future alcohol use (van Hemel-Ruiter et al., 2015) . Extrinsic motivation (through explicit rewards) can facilitate inhibitory control in both healthy and heavy drinking samples (Chung et al., 2011; Schevernels et al., 2014; Wilbertz et al., 2014; Schevernels et al., 2015) and adolescent samples (Kohls et al., 2009b; Winter and Sheridan, 2014; Demurie et al., 2016) .

Elevated levels of impulsivity and motor disinhibition can pre-date alcohol involvement (and related problems) acting as a potential risk factor for heavy drinking and dependence following experimentation (Dawe et al., 2004; Ersche et al., 2012; Whelan et al., 2014) in adult samples. Some researches suggest the relationship between alcohol use and impaired executive functions to be weak or non-existent (MacKillop et al., 2007; Balodis et al., 2009; Peeters et al., 2014; Caswell et al., 2016) . It is possible that individual and methodological differences across studies account for discrepant findings. For example, inconsistencies may be the result of the measure used (Smith et al., 2014; Fernandez-Artamendi et al., 2018) . Deficits in inhibitory control are suggested to be dose-dependent, with deficits appearing to be smaller in heavy non-dependent drinkers compared to dependent drinkers (Smith et al., 2014) , particularly, in females (Nederkoorn et al., 2009; Smith and Mattick, 2013; Smith et al., 2015) .",

Heavy drinking episodes are often triggered by alcohol-related cues (e.g. sight of alcohol) causing transient impairments of motor inhibitory control (Gauggel et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2010) , increasing craving and alcohol-seeking behaviours (Christiansen et al., 2017) . Evidence points to motor inhibitory control mediating the relationship between alcohol-cue exposure and subsequent alcohol consumption (Field and Jones, 2017) . To our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of alcohol-specific impairments in inhibitory control or working memory in adolescence. It is possible that that any association between executive functions and alcohol use (or involvement) is better explained by exposure to alcohol-related cues (or alcohol context) than by non-alcohol-related cues due to their potentially compromising effects. Indeed, 'hot' executive functions (those linked to emotional responding and reward sensitivity) are better linked to risky behaviours in adolescence (Prencipe et al., 2011) . However, it is also possible that due to a shorter drinking history, adolescents may be less sensitive to exposure to alcoholrelated cues.",

Go and No-Go stimuli were presented on screen for up to 2000 ms. On Go trials participants were shown images of soft drinks whereby they had to press the space bar as quickly as possible, while No-Go cues were images of alcohol drinks where they had to refrain from pressing the space bar. Between each trial was an inter-trial interval of 1000 ms. Average Go reaction time (RT) and commission errors were calculated for both reward and no reward conditions. Before completing the task, participants were given a brief on the instructions, with 20 practice trials which could be repeated if necessary.",

Following the selection of an image, a new page is displayed with the previous images, and all images were automatically re-arranged into different positions. Participants were asked to select an image, while avoiding clicking the same image in a block and avoid clicking the same position in the array.

Motor inhibitory control performance, in no reward conditions, was associated with alcoholrelated problems. Specifically, as motor inhibitory control became poorer, alcohol-related problems increased. These findings provide limited support for theoretical models or empirical data which suggest motor inhibitory control and working memory are associated with alcohol involvement (Field and Jones, 2017; Carbia et al., 2018; Mahedy et al., 2018) . The lack of a consistent association across different studies may be due to the precision of the measure of inhibitory control administered and the samples used (e.g. lighter vs. heavier drinkers).",

However, there is evidence that reward can impair inhibition (Kohls et al., 2009a; Padmanabhan et al., 2011; Demurie et al., 2016; Miyasaka and Nomura, 2019) , and it is possible that prompting reward on Go trials led to faster RTs (which we observed in comparison to non-rewarded trials), which in turn, increased inhibition errors due to a speed-accuracy tradeoff (Leotti and Wager, 2010) . Alternatively, Pessoa (2009) suggests that a deleterious effect of reward on inhibitory control is the result of a (finite) resource allocation to maximize the chance of reward, causing other cognitive systems to suffer. The effect of reward should be examined with different reward types (e.g. hypothetical or actual, financial or non-financial), as evidence suggests reward salience changes as age develops (Miyasaka and Nomura, 2019) . As such, the current reward may not have been sufficiently salient to the participants.",

Our sampling was limited to one geographical area in the UK, characterized by greater-than-average deprivation. Future studies should attempt to recruit from multiple geographical locations to increase the representativeness of these findings. Second, a 2-week TLFB may not have been sufficiently long enough to capture alcohol consumption in adolescents, as access to alcohol in these samples may be varied (Jones-Webb et al., 1997) . Future research should attempt to replicate these findings using measures of alcohol use over longer time periods (Buu et al., 2014) . In relation to this, self-reported consumption may be prone to memory biases and under-reporting (Livingston and Callinan, 2015) . Third, due to testing constraints, we were unable to assess other factors which might be related to both executive functioning and alcohol use, such as impulsive personality traits and mental health. Fourth, we used an unbalanced Go/No-Go design to assess the inhibitory control. Future research should use a counter-balanced Go/No-Go design (in which the contingency for responding/inhibiting to neutral cues is reversed) to disentangle any attentional bias towards alcohol-related cues. Similarly, we combined reward sensitivity and inhibitory control within the Go/No-Go task, which is both a strength and limitation, as it provides a more realistic outcome given the interdependency of these processes but limits direct conclusions for either in isolation. Finally, we originally aimed to conduct follow-up assessments for each participant, however, these were unable to take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic and so we are limited to cross-sectional associations. Examination of prospective associations throughout adolescence may demonstrate different results (e.g. Fernie et al., 2013) .",

However, inhibitory control is sensitive to a number of inputs, including reward and motivation, and in order to make clearer predictions about behaviour, the interactions between inhibitory control and external/internal inputs should be modelled.
