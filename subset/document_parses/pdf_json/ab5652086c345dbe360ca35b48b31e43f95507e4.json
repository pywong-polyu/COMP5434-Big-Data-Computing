It is caused by a small RNA virus (PRRSV), which targets almost exclusively pig monocytes or macrophages. In the present study, five SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries derived from 0 hour mock-infected and 6, 12, 16 and 24 hours PRRSVinfected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) produced a total 643,255 sequenced tags with 91,807 unique tags. Differentially expressed (DE) tags were then detected using the Bayesian framework followed by gene/mRNA assignment, arbitrary selection and manual annotation, which determined 699 DE genes for reactome analysis. The DAVID, KEGG and REACTOME databases assigned 573 of the DE genes into six biological systems, 60 functional categories and 504 pathways. The six systems are: cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems and human diseases as defined by KEGG with modification. Self-organizing map (SOM) analysis further grouped these 699 DE genes into ten clusters, reflecting their expression trends along these five time points. Based on the number one functional category in each system, cell growth and death, transcription processes, signal transductions, energy metabolism, immune system and infectious diseases formed the major reactomes of PAMs responding to PRRSV infection. Our investigation also focused on dominant pathways that had at least 20 DE genes identified, multi-pathway genes that were involved in 10 or more pathways and exclusively-expressed genes that were included in one system. Overall, our present study reported a large set of DE genes, compiled a comprehensive coverage of pathways, and revealed systembased reactomes of PAMs infected with PRRSV.

Since then, PRRS has devastated the pig industries of many countries and has become the most economically important disease in pigs worldwide. A recent study estimated that PRRS costs the pork industry $664 million per year in the United States of America (http://www.pork.org/News). The disease is caused by a small RNA virus (PRRSV) classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, and genus Arterivirus. PRRSV causes severe reproductive failure of the sow, including third-trimester abortions, early farrowing with stillborns, mummies, neonatal death and weak piglets, agalactia and mastitis, and prolonged anoestrus and delayed return to estrus post-weaning. Respiratory disease is the major clinical sign in neonatal pigs and is characterized by fever, interstitial pneumonia, eyelid edema, periocular edema, blue discoloration of the ears and shaking [3, 4] . The mortality in neonatal pigs infected with PRRSV can reach 100%. In growing/finishing pigs, subclinical infection is much more common. Some PRRSV-infected boars demonstrate a loss of libido, lethargy, lowered sperm volume and decreased fertility.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 278, "end": 280, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1153, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1156, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "PRRSV has remarkable genetic variation with two distinct genetic and antigenic groups: Type 1 (European) and Type 2 (North American), which only share 60% nucleotide identity [5] . In 2006, previously unparalleled large-scale outbreaks of highlypathogenic PRRS, also named ''Blue Ear'' or ''high fever'' disease, occurred in China. It spread to more than 10 provinces (autonomous cities or regions) and affected over 2 million pigs with about 400,000 fatal cases [6] . Best estimates suggest that at least 50 million pigs were affected [7] . Since then, highlypathogenic PRRS outbreaks were also reported in 2007 and 2008 in other Asian countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines [8] . These data clearly indicate that PRRSV is able to mutate, thus causing challenges in effective vaccine development. For example, while modified live-attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines against PRRSV have been available for many years, none of them can prevent respiratory infection, transmission, or pig-to-pig transmission of virus. In particular, modifiedlive vaccines are generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains, while efficacy of inactivated vaccines in the field is more limited and restricted to homologous strains [9] . In addition, PRRSV has developed diverse mechanisms to evade porcine antiviral immune responses [10] . Once the virus infects pig tissues, it has several mechanisms to evade the pig's immune system, causing a several week delay in protective antibody production [11] [12] [13] .

The entry of PRRSV into porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) is proposed to include four steps [16] . First, the PRRSV virion attaches to heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans on the macrophage surface. Second, the virus then forms a more stable binding with the sialoadhesin receptor via sialic acid residues associated with M/GP 5 glycoprotein complexes present in the viral envelope. Third, following attachment to sialoadhesin, the virus-receptor complex is endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles. Once endocytosed, viral genome release is dependent on endosomal acidification. There appears to be involvement of CD163 with viral genome release that is possible through interactions with the viral glycoproteins, GP2 and GP4 and that is dependent upon a function CD-163 scavenger receptor cysteine rich domain 5 being present. In addition, several proteases have been implicated in this final step of PRRSV entry into macrophages. Once the genome is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell, virus transcriptional and translational events required for the formation of new virions are initiated.

Our transcriptome profiling represents the largest known set of DE genes of PAMs challenged with PRRSV. The list of DE genes found in our present investigation was extensive, but many were unique as we found that only 8 of 108 (7.4%), 50 of 215 (23%) and 47 of 294 (16%) known coding genes previously reported [19] [20] [21] were also DE in PRRSV-infected PAMs in our study. Genini and colleagues [19] performed an in vitro study using PAMs obtained from six piglets and challenged with the Lelystad PRRSV strain. The European Lelystad strain of PRRSV has biological similarities but distinct serological properties from the North American VR-2332 isolate [22] . Gene expression was investigated using Affymetrix microarrays, but with very limited annotation available at that time. They detected a total of 1,409 differentially expressed transcripts based on analysis of variance, and found two, five, 25, 16 and 100 transcripts that differed from controls by a minimum of 1.5-fold at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h post-infection, respectively. In addition to three uninfected negative controls, Xiao et al. [20] challenged six conventionally-reared, healthy 6-week-old, crossbred weaned pigs (Landrace6Yorkshire) with the classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a. Lung tissues were collected from the control group, three pigs at 96 h (N96) and three pigs at 168 h (N168) post infection and mRNA was extracted. Transcriptome profiling was performed using a Solexa/ Illumina next generation sequencing method. Although the authors claimed that there were 5,430 DE genes between all time points (N96/C, N168/C, N168/N96) during infection, they only assigned 215 DE genes to pathways. Using Affymetrix microarrays, Zhou and co-workers [21] reported 294 functionally known genes that were differentially expressed in PAMs derived from three uninfected and three infected 5-week-old Tongcheng pigs at 5 days post infection. The infected groups were challenged with PRRSV-WUH3 by intramuscular inoculation. Here, we performed an in vitro study on PAMs challenged with PRRSV strain VR-2332 and carried out the transcriptome analysis using the SAGE technology. Collectively, these investigations examined responses to infections with different PRRSV strains using either in vitro or in vivo approaches and time courses ranged from 0 to 168 hours. In addition, two different types of tissues, PAMs or lung tissue, were collected for transcriptome profiling using either microarray or tag-based sequencing.

The DAVID Bioinformatics database is owned by the NIH. The team developed a unique single linkage method by which .20 gene identifier types and .40 functional annotation categories from dozens of heterogeneous public databases have been comprehensively integrated in the DAVID Knowledgebase [24] .

These pathway categories with the most DE genes clearly confirmed the basic characteristics of PAMs in pigs responding to PRRSV infection reported by other researchers. For example, Costers and co-workers [25] found that PRRSV stimulates antiapoptotic pathways in PAMs early in infection and the PRRSVinfected macrophages die by apoptosis late in infection. Gudmundsdottir and Risatti [26] investigated the effect of PRRSV infection on activation of 25 immunomodulatory cellular genes in PAMs at 24 and 48h post-infection and found a regulatory role of PRRSV ORF1A on PAM gene expression. During virus infection, PRRSV modulates the transcription and translation of the host cell to make them survive and propagate [27] . PRRSV infection also suppresses gene expression. Using two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling approach, Lu and colleagues [28] just recently revealed that signal transduction is one of the differentially expressed proteome components in PAMs infected with PRRSV. Research has shown that viruses and other pathogens usually slow down the host cell's energy production in order to enhance infection [29, 30] . Resistance response is an expensive activity, which would consume a large amount of energy. Appropriate energy management is important to restrict pathogen propagation or to repair the cells [31] . Innate immunity is critical to the host for defense against various pathogens. PRRSV infection under certain circumstances fails to elicit some components of the innate response [32] . Adaptive immune response is also important to kill viruses. Adaptive immunity depends on antigen presentation, where the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecule binds antigen to trigger an appropriate adaptive immune response and restrict pathogen growth [33] . We are the first to report DE genes that are common between PRRSV infection and 22 human infectious diseases.

Our data showed the signal transduction genes (NFKB1, NFKB2, JUN, JUNB and FOS) that trigger immune and inflammatory responses were significantly decreased. As a result, the proinflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1A, IL-1B and TNF) and chemokine genes (CCL23 and CCL3L1) were down-regulated. The receptors of cytokines and chemokines (IL1RN and CCRL1) were also down-regulated. The combined effects may allow PRRSV to avoid an effective immune response. In addition, complement system activation seemed to be blocked during PRRSV infection. C1QB, C3, C1QC, and FCN2, activators of the lectin pathway of the complement system, were down-regulated [34] . The Heat shock proteins (HSPs) genes (HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSP90B1, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA5, HSPA6, HSPA8, HSPB1 and HSPH1) were negatively regulated during PRRSV infection. Heat stress proteins interact with viral proteins and enhance development of innate and adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens [35] ; therefore, the down-regulation of HSPs in PRRSV-infected PAMs may have resulted in a weakened innate immune response. In addition, a recent study has identified that HSPA5 closely associates with PRRSV nsp2 and as such may be involved in PRRSV replication complexes [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 974, "end": 978, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1297, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1570, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 278, "text": "Figure 4C", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The collection of MHC II genes (SLA-DMB, SLA-DOA, SLA-DQA1, SLA-DQA2, SLA-DQB1, SLA-DRA, and SLA-DRB1) and cell surface molecules (CD74 and CD83) that help MHC II bind antigen were all down-regulated. PRRSV inhibits cell death or apoptosis, which allows a prolonged infection [37] . Negative regulation of apoptosis or cell death genes (IER3, CFLAR, YWHAZ, PIM2, ANXA4, HMOX1and BAG3) were also downregulated. CD163 is a PRRSV receptor that takes part in the internalization and uncoating of the virus. Down-regulation of CD163 could reduce PRRSV replication [38] . On the other hand, only 130 DE genes were commonly up-regulated at all four infected time stages. In particular, the up-regulated genes are involved in regulation of apoptosis and cell death (MAEA, BNIP3, IDO1, GPX1, EI24, and TIAL1) and oxygen metabolism (ACE, VEGFA, BNIP3 and EGLN2) ( Figure 4B ). Superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2) involved in the ubiquitin -proteasome pathway were significantly up-regulated, and the genes that encode proteasome subunits such as PSMB1, PSMB2 and PSME2 were also increased. Cyclooxygenase genes (COX1 and COX2) which participate in virus replication and the regulation of inflammatory response following viruses infection [39] were up-regulated at four time points post-infection.

Interestingly, at 6 h post-infection, most of the affected genes were down-regulated, while many genes were up-regulated at 24 h post infection. At 6 h post infection, the energy metabolism related genes (ATP5G2, COX17, COX5B, GSTP1, NDUFAB1 and NDUFS2) were suppressed. Transcriptional and protein synthesis genes (H1FX and OBFC2B) were also down-regulated. The antiviral gene BST2, which encodes the protein tetherin could directly restrict various viruses; however, BST2 abundance was reduced by PRRSV infection [40, 41] . In addition, PRRSV infection of PAMs decreased the viral replication regulator ANAPC11 to control virus replication. Consistent with a previous report [42] , genes in the DUSP family (DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP5 and DUSP6), which regulate MAPK signaling, were down-regulated at four time points post-infection. At 24 h post infection, when the viral replication is exponential, an increasing amount of protein is needed to assemble whole virions. Consistent with this protein need, PRRSV up-regulated expression of several ribosomal protein genes (RPL15, RPL29, RPL34, RPL36A, RPL41, RPL9, RPLP0, RPLP1, RPS13, RPS16, RPS18, RPS19, RPS27L and RPS7) to make translation more productive. Selected antiviral genes (IFI6, IFIT3 and IFITM3) were also upregulated, indicating that PAMs were attempting to control the viral infection. S100A9, another member of the S100 family that is involved in induction of the inflammatory response common to many pathogen infections, was also significantly up-regulated. This gene and family was also found to be in the top ten upregulated genes in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes of pigs infected with highly pathogenic PRRSV rJXwn06 versus control at 14 days post infection [43] .

During PRRSV infection, PRRSV modulates the transcription and translation of the host cell to enable propagation and survival of the virus [27] . PRRSV infection of PAMS resulted in suppressed expression of IL1a, IL1b and TNF-a, which are important proinflammatory cytokines known to elicit innate immunity to restrict virus replication. Normally, virus infection may enhance IL-1a, IL-1b and TNF-a expression that consequently inhibits virus replication [45] . Lack of early TNF expression may be a method that PRRSV utilizes to evade aspects of the innate host immune response. Therefore, PRRSV evades the early lines of defense by effectively blocking the expression of important innate/inflammatory genes. The abundances of IL1, IL6 and TNF were 10-100 times less in PRRSV single inoculated pigs than PRRSV-LPS inoculated pigs [46] . Similar results were observed in PAMs during PRRSV infection [47] . Our data showed that PRRSV infection restricts expression of these genes from 6 h to 24 h post infection. The complement pathway supports phagocytosis through opsonization and subsequent elimination of pathogens [48] . Down-regulated C3 and other complement pathway genes may weaken antiviral ability of phagocytic cells such as PAMs. Similar results were observed in PAMs during HP-PRRSV infection in vivo [49] . However, Xiao et al. showed that the complement system was activated in lung tissue during PRRSV infection, which may have caused severe lung damage [50, 51] . In the present study, the IFN-stimulated genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, ISG15, OAS1, and IFI6) were dramatically increased at 16 h and 24 h post infection, which should trigger powerful antiviral functions. This represents a positive signal for a host cell responding to PRRSV infection. Previous studies have shown that very low or negligible levels of IFN-a are produced upon PRRSV infection in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and PRRSV permissive monkey kidney cells (MARC-145) in vitro [52, 53] . IFN-a production in the lungs of pigs acutely infected with PRRSV was either almost undetectable or 100-to 200-fold lower than that induced by porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) [54, 55] . PRRSV has also been found to suppress IFN-a production by transmissible gastroenteritis corona virus (TGEV), a known inducer of IFNs in infected alveolar macrophages [52] . At the same time, externally provided IFN-a or IFN-b have been able to reduce viral replication in cultured alveolar macrophages [52, 56] . PRRSV is thought to suppress type I IFN expression and block its signaling by interfering with STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation [57] . The virus was also found to inhibit the dsRNA-mediated upregulation of IFN-b gene transcription [53] . A microarray analysis of PAMs infected with Lelystad virus (European type PRRSV) showed no significant change in the IFN-a from the control at 12 h post-infection [19] . IRF3, which plays an important role in activating type I interferon was up-regulated at all infected time stages. However, we did not detect differential expression of type I IFN over the course of infection. It is possible that type I IFN might have been induced before 6 h, which was our first PAM collection time. It has been shown the PRRSV can trigger the activation of IRF-3 as well as induce IFN production at 24 h post infection but the activities are much lower than those triggered by Poly(I:C) and PRRSV nsp1 antagonizes IFN production through the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways and down-regulates the protein level of IRF-3 [58] . Pre-treatment of PAMs with LPS downregulated expression of CD163, a PRRSV receptor involved in PRRSV uncoating, and restricted PRRSV replication [38, 59] . In the present study, CD163 was significantly decreased after PRRSV infection, which indicates that viral evasion methods in PAMs were actively induced.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 963, "end": 967, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1035, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1254, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1449, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1605, "text": "[50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1609, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2107, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2108, "end": 2111, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2300, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2304, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2477, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2613, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2617, "text": "56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2749, "end": 2753, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2856, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3022, "end": 3026, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3658, "end": 3662, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3814, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3815, "end": 3818, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our current study revealed the largest known set of 699 DE genes in PAMs challenged with PRRSV, which are involved in six biological systems, 60 functional categories and 504 pathways.

In particular, PRRSV infection dramatically minimized pathway functions involving the actin filament based processes, anti-apoptosis, positive regulation of cell communication, protein folding, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, signaling by MAPK, NGF and GPCR, GPCR ligand binding, positive regulation of signal transduction, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, positive regulation of developmental processes, response to unfolded protein, developmental biology, axon guidance, positive regulation of immune responses, response to organic substances, response to hormone stimulus and response to abiotic stimulus in PAMs. However, PRRSV invasion maximized pathway functions related to membrane organization, lysosome, gene expression, nonsense-mediated decay, translation, translation elongation, translation initiation, ribosome, translation termination, SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, transmembrane transport of small molecules, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, the citric acid cycle and respiratory electron transport, respiratory electron transport, ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling, and heat production by uncoupling proteins, oxidation reduction and oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism of proteins, hexose metabolic processes, glucose metabolic processes and vesicle docking during exocytosis in PAMs. Overall, PRRSV took control of PAMs in the course of a 24 hour infection, but the host started to fight back using its autophagy mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Animal Disease Center-USDA-Agricultural Research Service.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethics Statement"}, {"text": "The experiments were conducted as previously described [60, 61] .

Aliquots of PAMs were then frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen separately for all three pigs. After establishing PAMs in culture, cells were infected with PRRSV strain VR-2332. To achieve a near synchronous infection, flasks containing adherent PAMs were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 in chilled media and incubated at 4uC for 1 hour to allow for virus binding, but not entry into the cell. Pre-warmed media was added and the cells placed at 37uC, 5% CO 2 until collected for RNA isolation. Total cellular RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell samples were collected from each PRRSV-infected PAM flask at 0, 6, 12, 16 or 24 hours after infection. Total cellular RNA from mock-infected PAMs was collected at 0 and 24 hours. Equimolar amounts of total RNA from the PAMs of each pig at each time point were then pooled to make SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries using NlaIII as the anchoring enzyme and BsmFI as the tagging enzyme [63] .
