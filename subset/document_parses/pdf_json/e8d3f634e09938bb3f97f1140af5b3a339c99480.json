Public health programs, such as the Baby-Friendly Initiative, have helped increase the national breastfeeding initiation rate to 90%. However, initiation rates in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) continue to rank the lowest in the country at 70%, with a 6-month exclusivity rate of 16%. This commentary will discuss the influence of geographical location, societal norms, and accessibility to health care services on breastfeeding in rural and remote NL communities. While the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself does not impact the mother's ability to breastfeed, the indirect impacts of COVID-19 on health care services, social isolation, and economic burden challenge breastfeeding initiation and continuation. Priority solutions will draw on capacity building by emphasizing relationships within the community to deliver innovative and appropriate support programs. Continued education with health practitioners and further research into breastfeeding barriers in rural communities is critical moving forward.",

Literature supports a dose-response relationship between breastfeeding and infant mortality, whereby infants partially or not breastfed have a significant 6-fold increase in mortality compared with those exclusively breastfed (Sankar et al., 2015) . Programs such as the Baby-Friendly Initiative have helped improve Canadian breastfeeding rates, with approximately 90% of mothers breastfeeding at birth and 57% of infants exclusively breastfeeding for 6 months (Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC] , 2019). However, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) rank lowest in the country, with a 70% breastfeeding initiation rate and a 16% exclusivity rate at 6 months (Perinatal Program Newfoundland Labrador [PPNL], 2014; PHAC, 2019) . Nationally, geographical area of residence does not present a significant difference in breastfeeding statistics; however, limited studies understanding barriers to breastfeeding in rural contexts exist (Lukeman et al., 2019; PHAC, 2019) . In contrast with urban communities, NL's unique geography presents a widely rural and dispersed population having strong traditional roots and reliance on community supports (Bonia et al., 2013; Roberton et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to breastfeeding rates through increased social isolation, health resource diversion, and heightened maternal stress (Lebel et al., 2020; Roberton et al., 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . This commentary will emphasize the need to ensure breastfeeding rates do not decline in NL as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These beliefs have also resulted in a perception of inconvenience, as women express the need to seek privacy to feed their infant (Bonia et al., 2013) . Baby-Friendly NL initiated a poster campaign, distributing breastfeeding images in public spaces across NL to normalize breastfeeding in society. Surveys conducted in two rural community shopping centres in NL revealed that the campaign provided significant improvement (p < 0.05) in perceived acceptability of public breastfeeding in specific settings among those who had seen the posters.

To ensure timely breastfeeding initiation, the Canadian Pediatric Society, PHAC, and WHO recommend mothers and newborns not be separated at birth, even in COVID-19-positive cases, and emphasize hospital policies' importance in supporting the practice (Breastfeeding Committee for Canada, 2020). However, the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic can affect breastfeeding rates (Roberton et al., 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . Increased stress and social isolation during the pandemic may contribute to breastfeeding cessation when challenges are faced, especially when routine clinical and peer supports are not in place (Lebel et al., 2020) .

These experiences reflect the importance of accessible support in navigating breastfeeding challenges. Social isolation from peers and group settings, as experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, decreases conversations around breastfeeding and opportunities to normalize the practice (WHO, 2020).

Researchers have predicted that a 5% reduction in health care providers' availability, service accessibility, and resource allocation for maternal and newborn health during the pandemic response can equate to an approximately 8-10% increase in maternal and infant mortality (Roberton et al., 2020; Yoshikawa et al., 2020) . Many rural and remote communities have limited numbers of health care providers. While breastfeeding support is a fraction of the perinatal services provided, these conservative statistics underline the impact of resource diversion away from perinatal health. Conversely, the mothers facing breastfeeding challenges may be less willing to seek health providers' assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic (Roberton et al., 2020) .

Families affected by lay-offs and income loss are subject to food insecurity, impacting those who have decided to formula feed. Furthermore, infant malnutrition risk will increase as families face the financial burden of formula feeding and rural regions experience limited formula inventory from a potentially depleted supply chain (Breastfeeding Committee for Canada, 2020; Roberton et al., 2020) .",

Given that decisions for infant feeding often occur in the prenatal period, frequent, informative conversations around breastfeeding before childbirth can positively influence decision-making (PHAC, 2019). WHO (2018) recommends that breastfeeding counselling occur a minimum of six times during the pre-and post-natal period, ideally through face-toface conversations. In navigating care delivery during pandemic restrictions, interventions must be innovative yet appropriate. While online platforms create an opportunity for improved health support services, they also have the potential to further exacerbate inequities in rural and remote communities that lack high-speed internet connectivity. Furthermore, personal privacy concerns arise with internet-based video communication to provide real-time breastfeeding assistance and education. Roberton et al. (2020) advocate for routine public health services when possible during the global pandemic. The isolation of rural communities provides an advantage in its ability to control and trace rates of COVID-19. When permitted by public health officials, small-sized breastfeeding support groups should be encouraged.",
