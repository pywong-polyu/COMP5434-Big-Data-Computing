            "text": "Motivation: Long-range RNA-RNA interactions (LRIs) play an important role in viral replication, however, only a few of these interactions are known and only for a small number of viral species. Up to now, it has been impossible to screen a full viral genome for LRIs experimentally or in silico. Most known LRIs are cross-reacting structures (pseudoknots) undetectable by most bioinformatical tools. Results: We present LRIscan, a tool for the LRI prediction in full viral genomes based on a multiple genome alignment. We confirmed 14 out of 16 experimentally known and evolutionary conserved LRIs in genome alignments of HCV, Tombusviruses, Flaviviruses and HIV-1. We provide several promising new interactions, which include compensatory mutations and are highly conserved in all considered viral sequences. Furthermore, we provide reactivity plots highlighting the hot spots of predicted LRIs. Availability and Implementation: Source code and binaries of LRIscan freely available for download at",

            "text": "Long-range RNA-RNA interactions (LRIs) have been marginally reported in various positive strand RNA viruses like Tombusvirus (8 in Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus (CIRV) and Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus (TBSV)), Hepacivirus [5 in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)], Coronavirus (1 in Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV)), Flavivirus (3 in Dengue Virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV)), Luteovirus (2 in Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV)), Apthovirus (2 in Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV)), Pestivirus (1 in Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV)) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (5 in HIV-1) (Abbink and Berkhout, 2003; Andersen et al., 2004; Beerens and Kjems, 2010; Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Ooms et al., 2007) . According to their definition, a long-range interaction spans distances between a few hundred and several thousands of nucleotides (>26 kb in TGEV). LRIs are often located in loop regions or internal bulges of local RNA structures (known as cis-acting regulatory elements) and therefore build pseudoknot-like structures. Various programs have been developed for general RNA-RNA interaction prediction, which can be classified into five groups (Kato et al., 2010; Seemann et al., 2011) : The first group neglects intramolecular base-pairs, based on the hybrids minimum free energy (MFE). Members of this group are RNAduplex and RNAplex (Lorenz et al., 2011; Tafer and Hofacker, 2008) or RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004) . The second category includes RNAcofold (Bernhart et al., 2006) and PairFold (Andronescu et al., 2005) . These tools concatenate two interacting RNA sequences and calculate the MFE of the joint RNA sequences. The third group considers intramolecular and intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in separated steps, however, only one binding site is predicted. Members of this group are IntaRNA (Busch et al., 2008) or RNAup (M\u00fc ckstein et al., 2006) . The fourth group considers more complex RNA-RNA interactions and allows also more than one binding site. This group includes tools like RactIP (Kato et al., 2010) , inteRNA (Alkan et al., 2006) or inRNAs (Salari et al., 2010) . The final group contains e.g. PETcofold (Seemann et al., 2011) , RNAaliduplex (Lorenz et al., 2011) , IRBIS (Pervouchine, 2014) , ripalign (Li et al., 2011) and simulfold (Meyer and Mikl os, 2007) . These tools consider not only a pair of single sequences, like the tools mentioned earlier, they use multiple sequence alignments as input. With this comparative method, it is possible to reduce the false-positive rate by incorporating evolutionary conserved information. All of these programs have different properties, unsuitable for viral genomes. For example, RNAaliduplex is unable to predict pseudoknots and neglects intramolecular RNA foldings. PETcofold considers both, intra-and intermolecular interactions as well as pseudo-knots, but returns per default only a single secondary structure, which makes the detection of multiple functional binding sites impossible. Ripalign's running time makes the program not applicable to viral sequences and IRBIS is only applicable for predictions of RNA interactions related to RNA splice sites. Up to now, we are aware of a single program that is designed for LRI prediction called CovaRNA (Bindewald and Shapiro, 2013) . This tool detects long-range nucleotide covariation from multiple sequence alignments of eukaryotic genomes using an index-based algorithm to find clusters of covarying base-pairs. The extended function CovStat determines the statistical significance of observed covariation cluster. CovaRNA has very strict filter criteria and is therefore very conservative in predicting LRIs. For short genomes, such as viral genomes, this leads to almost no predicted interactions.",

The UTRs and the core region show the highest amount of possible LRIs, in agreement with the known highly structured regions for all HCV subtypes (Fricke et al., 2015) . Consistent with regions of high reactivity (superior interacting regions), it has been shown that the 5 0 UTR includes three LRIs (Beguiristain et al., 2005; Filbin and Kieft, 2011; Honda et al., 1999; Romero-L opez and Berzal-Herranz, 2009, 2012) .

We missed SLII-SLIV because of the unfavorable seed MFE of only \u00c07 kcal/mol (default threshold \u00c010 kcal/mol). The LRI SLIIId-5BSL3.2 did not pass our conservative P-value threshold but is part of the LRIscan output (LRI 2d).

Although Flaviviruses and Hepacivirus are both assigned to the family Flaviviridae, the LRI distribution is very different. In Flaviviruses, we found some clearly separated peaks with an accumulation of LRIs, located at the 3 0 end of gene M and in the center of the NS3 and NS5 gene (Fig. 3A) . Different from the HCV alignment, we did not find an accumulation of LRIs in the 5 0 and 3 0 UTR. This effect could be explained by different sequence conservations of the UTRs. In HCV, the pairwise identity of the UTRs is > 95%, whereas the UTR pairwise identity of the Flaviviruses is < 50%. The Flavivirus alignment consists of only six sequences, including only the mosquito/vertebrate Flaviviruses. In Flavivirus, three experimentally verified LRIs are known: 5 0 -3 0 -UAR, DAR and 5 0 -3 0 -CS (Alvarez et al., 2005; Corver et al., 2003; Friebe and Harris, 2010; Khromykh et al., 2001; You et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2008) . All known interactions are in close proximity and can build a genome circularization, essential for the viral replication. The strongest interaction (CS) was ranked at fourth position (Fig. 3B) . It was not possible to identify the 5 0 -3 0 -UAR and DAR, because the seed region does not appear to be conserved in the highly variable 5 0 UTR. However, we found several new promising LRIs (Fig. 3C ) in the considered Flaviviruses. All depicted interactions are ranked among the first 75 hits and show a high amount of compensatory mutations (up to four types of base-pairs) and being conserved in all sequences.",

Most of the LRIs in Tombusvirus are located in the p92 region (Fig. 5A ). This is in line with the already known interactions, where four out of eight known LRIs start in the p92 region (Cimino et al., 2011; Lin and White, 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . But also the intergenic regions between p41/p22 and the 3 0 end of the p92 coding regions show high reactivity (Fig. 5A ). These areas harbor the known interacting regions of the AS1/RS1, DE/CE, sg1/SLB, AS2/RS2, sg2/SLB (Fabian and White, 2004; Lin and White, 2004; Wu et al., 2009) . In contrast, the p41 region contains only a few predicted LRIs. This is due to the very variable sequence of this gene, which encodes the coat protein of the Tombusviruses. In addition to the mentioned five, three more LRIs are known from experimental data for Tombusviruses: SL3-SLB White, 2004, 2006; Nicholson and White, 2008) , PRTE-DRTE (Cimino et al., 2011) and UL-DL (Wu et al., 2009) . We detected six of the eight known LRIs (Fig. 5B ). AS2-RS2 was ranked very low due to a very short seed of 5 bp, a low P-value and a poly-G stretch. The missing SL3-SLB and DE-CE have been only described for one species and are also manually not discoverable in other species. Both interactions are located in variable regions with low conserved RNA sequences. Here, we present three novel LRIs (Fig. 5C ). The LRI 5g with strong compensatory mutations in 6 of 6 base-pairs and up to four types is conserved in all sequences. The LRIs 5h and 5i are conserved in all sequences and have a very high rank as well as compensatory base-pairs with up to three types of base-pairs mutated at both interaction sites. The introduced LRIs are interesting candidates for further wet lab studies.",

Most of the non-detected true positive LRIs are specific and experimentally verified only for single isolates. We investigated their conservation throughout the individuals of the alignment manually, resulting in isolate-specific LRIs. The sensitivity is independent on the sequence number and alignment identity ( Table 1 ). The mean specificity of 0.64 depicts a rather high number of false positives. A more stringent P-value would remove a large fraction of false positives, however, results also in a loss of true positive LRIs, see Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6. In practice, known LRIs have very small P-values (high ranks) and/or high compensatory scores and/or can be extended in length. The user selects the LRIs based on all metrics and on the regions of interests. A minimal P-value threshold including almost all experimental verified LRIs can be found at 0.05.",

The huge amount of theoretically possible interactions makes it impossible to verify all possible interactions by wet lab experiments. LRIscan offers the opportunity to predict possible LRIs under certain criteria and reduces dramatically the number of candidates for wet lab studies. As shown in part A of Figures 2, 3 , 5, and 6 also well studied viruses provide a huge list of highly ranked LRIs, which could be involved in viral translation and transcription mechanisms. Further wet lab studies, which verify the functionality of these interactions, could improve our understanding of the viral replication. ",
