Elevated cardiac biomarkers (hs-cTnT P-value < 0.001, NT-proBNP P-value = 0.001) and impaired left ventricular function (P-value = 0.011) were significantly associated with mortality, while other biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein) and clinical scores (SOFA) did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors. An optimal cut-off value to predict increased risk for 30-day all-cause mortality was 16.5 pg/mL for hs-cTnT (OR 8.5, 95% CI: 2.9, 25.0) and 415.5 pg/ml for NT-proBNP (OR 5.1, 95% CI: 1.8, 14.7).",

The additive value of routine transthoracic echocardiography is disputable and should only be considered if it is likely to impact therapeutic management.",

In case of myocardial infarction, this elevation occurs in combination with clinical features of ischemia, e.g., electrocardiographic changes, ischemic symptoms or imaging of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormalities (3) . Myocardial injury is common in COVID- 19 . The presence of values above the upper reference limit (URL) for high sensitive troponin (hs-cTnT) in COVID-19 patients varies widely, ranging from 20% in cohorts of hospitalized patients to more than 50% in critically ill patients (4) (5) (6) (7) . Ischemic or non-ischemic causes can mediate myocardial injury. Ischemic cardiac damage can be subdivided in type 1 and type 2 ischemia. The underlying pathophysiology of type 1 ischemia in COVID-19 is not fully understood. On one hand, the inflammatory response due to a COVID-19 infection may lead to plaque instability by activating inflammatory cells and release of inflammatory mediators, causing oxidative stress. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection is associated with endothelialitis and a prothrombotic state (8) (9) (10) (11) . Type 2 ischemia can be attributed to several factors such as hypoxemia, vasopressor use and suboptimal fluid balance, leading to a demand-supply inequity of oxygen (10) . Non-ischemic injury may find its origin in various mechanisms such as myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome, arrythmias, pulmonary embolism, and septic shock (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .",

The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was estimated with eyeball-method (normal, midrange and reduced) because of two reasons. First, acquisition of good quality images is often hard to obtain in critically ill patients and therefore more sophisticated methods (e.g., Simpson biplane, speckle tracing) to estimate the LVEF are not always feasible. Second, visually estimated ejection fraction has already shown to be extremely effective, rapid and consistent with quantitative echocardiographic assessment and is therefore a feasible method in critically ill patients (29) .

A total sample of 100 critically ill COVID-19 patients was finally included within 48 h of ICU admission. Included patients originated from emergency departments of surrounding hospitals (n = 34), our own emergency department (n = 44) or the pneumology ward (n = 22). A flow diagram to illustrate the patients' selection can be found in Figure 1 . Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Median age was 63.5 years, and the population was predominantly male (66%). None of the included patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.7 kg/m\u00b2. Following comorbidities were recorded upon admission: arterial hypertension (42%), diabetes mellitus (28%), sleep apnea (6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma (8%), coronary artery disease (17%), peripheral artery disease (6%), hypercholesterolemia (40%) and kidney disease upon admission (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min in 20% of patients). Chronic medication consisted of statins (37%), antidiabetic drugs (metformin 24%, SGLT2 inhibitors 2%, others 15%), antihypertensive drugs (ACE-inhibitors 28%, beta blockers 40%, others 25%) and antithrombotic/anticoagulant drugs (aspirin 20%, P2Y12 inhibitors 4%, NOAC/VKA 12%). During admission on ICU patients received additional treatment with dexamethasone (74%), remdesivir (12%), hydroxychloroquine (11%) and convalescent plasma (10%). During admission 54% of patients required vasopressors, 60% of patients were mechanically ventilated and 7% of patients were supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. On admission the median total SOFA-score was 3.0, with a respiratory SOFA-score of 2.0. The median P/F-ratio on admission was 96.3 mmHg. The median length of stay in ICU was 10 days. Within the first 30 days after inclusion 21 patients died (21%).

The level of these biomarkers was significantly higher in non-survivors ( Table 2 ). Figure 2 shows a ROC-curve for all 5 biomarkers with their respective area under the curve (AUC).

One patient had a severely reduced LVEF of 25%, which was pre-existing due to a non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Sixteen patients (18.0%) had a mildly reduced LVEF. Of these, four patients (25%) were known with coronary artery disease and a preexisting mildly reduced ejection fraction. For the other portion of patients there was no history of coronary artery disease and no previous echocardiography available. However, during admission none of the patients had evidence for acute ischemic signs on a continuous 3-lead ECG and daily 12-lead ECG. LVEF was significantly lower in those who ultimately died ( Table 2) . Levels of hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were elevated in, respectively, 38.9 and 34.7% of patients with normal LVEF. Right ventricular function, evaluated by TAPSE, was normal (\u226514 mm) in 94.8% of our cohort. After dichotomization between normal and abnormal TAPSE (\u2265 vs. <14 mm), patients with an abnormal RV function had higher mortality but this increase was not significant. There was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors concerning diastolic function. The presence of moderate to severe valvular regurgitation (aortic, mitral, and tricuspid) or pericardial effusion did not differ significantly between the two groups.

            "text": "This prospective study in critically ill COVID-19 patients has six important findings: (I) elevated levels of hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP upon admission are common and were found in, respectively, 47 and 39% of patients, (II) Elevated cardiac biomarkers are not necessarily linked to ventricular dysfunction as around 40% of patients with normal ejection fraction had either elevated levels of hs-cTnT and/or NT-proBNP, (III) Elevated levels of hs-cTnT, and to a lesser extent, NT-proBNP were associated with mortality, (IV) Serum levels of frequently used biomarkers (C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin) and other clinical parameters of disease-severity (total SOFA, respiratory SOFA and P/F ratio) were not predictive for 30-day all-cause mortality, (V) Decreased LV function was associated with worse prognosis, whereas diastolic dysfunction and impaired RV function were not, (VI) cardiac ultrasound was not possible for various reasons in as much as 11% of this cohort of critical COVID-19 patients. Whether cardiac biomarkers should be systematically measured as part of the workup for every hospitalized COVID-19 patient remains subject of debate. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommend against their routine use, while awaiting more evidence, as they warn for unnecessary diagnostic investigations, risk exposure and medical overuse (16, 28) . Another reason to not currently recommend the routine use of cardiac biomarkers in prognostication is the belief that these markers would only be of limited incremental prognostic value to other markers of disease-severity (31) . Recent research showed for example that higher D-dimer levels on admission to ICU seem to be independently associated with higher risk of death in critical COVID-19 (32) . This, however, contrasts with the findings in our study and previous research. In an early report of 191 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, the univariable odds ratio for mortality when hs-cTnT was above the 99th percentile upper reference limit was 80.1 (95% CI, 10.3-620.4; P < 0.0001) regardless of underlying cardiovascular disease. This was higher than for all other biomarkers or scores tested, including D-dimer, ferritin and SOFA-score (33) . Another study by Manocha et al. showed that hs-cTnT was the only independent predictor of mortality among the same five biomarkers (i.e., CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT), whereas Shi et al. found statistical significance for both hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP (34, 35) . Our results are in line with these findings and support the statement of Sandoval et al. that the use of cardiac biomarkers for prognostic purposes may help in risk-stratification (36) . We furthermore agree that this should not necessarily lead to unnecessary diagnostic testing when it is accompanied by clear education about the goals and implications of potentially elevated biomarkers (36) . We observed a reduced left and right ventricular function in, respectively 17 and 5.2% of our patients. Previous largescale research found similar results concerning reduced left ventricular function (20%), whereas right ventricular function was reduced in about 30% (23) . Based on our data, reduced left ventricular systolic function was associated with mortality. However, right ventricular function, assessed with TAPSE, which only estimates longitudinal right ventricular function, was not. Due to the low number of patients with reduced right ventricular contractility one should interpret this finding with caution. In previous research, left-and right ventricular function, analyzed with strain measurements, were both correlated with poor outcome (23, 26, 37) . Diastolic dysfunction, based upon E/A and E/e \u2032 measurement, was not associated with higher odds for 30-day all-cause mortality. A prospective study of Szekely et al. showed similar results for E/A, though elevated E/e' in their cohort was associated with a higher hazard ratio for death. However, this result just narrowly met statistical significance (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.2) (22) . Overall, comparison of echocardiographic findings in COVID-19 subjects is difficult given the large heterogeneity in study populations and measurement approaches (37) .",
