This study aimed to examine whether self-reported gambling has increased during the pandemic, and to examine potential correlates of such a change. This general population survey study in Sweden collected self-report data from 2016 web survey members (51 percent men, nine percent moderate-risk/problem gamblers). Correlates of increased gambling and increased gambling specifically due to COVID-19-related cancellation of sports were calculated. Four percent reported an overall gambling increase during the pandemic. The proportion of individuals reporting an increase, compared to individuals reporting a decrease, was markedly higher for online casinos (0.62), online horse betting (0.76) and online lotteries (0.73), and lower for sports betting (0.11). Overall, gambling increases were independently associated with gambling problems and increased alcohol consumption. In the sub-group, where there was an increase in specific gambling types in response to cancelled sports betting events, rates of gambling problems were high. In conclusion, only a minority report increased gambling in response to the pandemic, but this group has markedly higher gambling problems and changes in alcohol consumption, and may represent a sub-group with a particularly high vulnerability. This calls for preventive action in people with higher gambling risks in response to the pandemic.",

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has had a broad and deep impact on people's lives globally, and in addition to the physical harm from the pandemic, it is believed to have a high degree of impact on the mental health of the population [1, 2] . Among the potential consequences of the pandemic and its impact on everyday life, it has been suggested that addictive behaviors may be enhanced [3] ; this may, for example, include a risk of increased problematic online gaming [4] . Based on the impact described above from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that gambling behavior could also be altered because of the pandemic [5] . Gambling is a well-established potentially addictive behavior, and gambling disorder is a diagnostic entity along with alcohol and drug use disorders in the modern psychiatric diagnostic framework [6] , and problem gambling, with or without the diagnostic level, is reported to affect around one percent to around five percent of the world-wide population [7] . While the current situation is obviously one that has never been seen before, previous larger national financial crises have been described to affect gambling behavior. After the deep financial crisis in Greece, starting in 2008, it was said that having started gambling during the financial crisis was a risk factor of later developing gambling problems [8] . Findings from the financial crisis of Iceland, starting with the bank crash in 2008, demonstrate that a crisis may increase specific types of gambling behavior. While it could be seen that lottery gambling may increase during financial hardship [9, 10] , it was not clearly demonstrated that the financial crisis had an impact on problem gambling rates in the population [10] . Previous findings also describe a mixed picture; lottery gambling may not be sensitive to income decreases during recession, while casino gambling tends to diminish in difficult times [11] .",

Over and above the financial crisis and uncertainty around the economic future, the present crisis leads to dramatic changes in the amount of time spent at home, and likely increases time spent online [4] . Likewise, the gambling market has been dramatically altered in only a few weeks, as major sports events worldwide have been cancelled or postponed. The decrease in opportunities for sports-related gambling may theoretically either decrease gambling in sports bettors, or increase some gamblers' involvement in other gambling types which they may or may not otherwise use. The fear of sports bettors transferring to potentially more hazardous gambling has been described by policy makers in the present setting, pointing particularly towards online casinos [12] as a potentially more hazardous gambling opportunity [13] . The overall concerns about an altered gambling behavior during the crisis have led several governments to take action through different measures, such as a limitation on gambling advertisements in Spain [14] , deposit limits in Belgium [15] , and a total ban in Latvia [16] .",

Moreover, policy decisions currently taken by different governments are diverse and need to be accompanied by systematic research data. Market data report, for instance, a substantial increase in horse race betting in the present setting [17] , although it is difficult to derive this from how it affects the general population's actual gambling behavior, and whether this affects particular sub-groups more than others. For this reason, the present study, a general population web survey, was carried out in midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. The study aimed to address how self-reported gambling behavior may have changed overall and for specific gambling types, and how potential changes in gambling may be associated with specific risk factors or with lifestyle changes such as increased time at home or increased alcohol consumption. Given the dramatic decrease in sports-related gambling, it specifically aimed to address how other gambling types may have changed in response to this.",

            "text": "The present general population-based survey study was carried out in Sweden in response to the potential influence on gambling-related behaviors from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past decade, gambling in Sweden has moved towards a higher degree of online gambling and problem gambling in treatment-seeking patients and is primarily reported to occur online, with online casino gambling being the most common type of problematic gambling reported [18] . In recent years, gambling advertising has expanded considerably, and gambling advertising is strongly predominated by online-based gambling and most commonly online casino gambling. Besides online casino gambling, sports betting is commonly exposed in gambling advertisements [19] and reported by treatment-seeking patients, primarily in men [18] . In the general population, around 60 percent reported gambling in the past year, and among gamblers, lotteries (75 percent), chance-based number games (50 percent), horse racing (38 percent), and sports betting (21 percent) are the most common gambling types, whereas bingo (11 percent), casino gambling (5 percent) and poker (4 percent) are less frequent in the whole population. Among gamblers, 48 percent reported gambling in gambling shops, 29 percent on mobile telephones, 19 percent on computers, and nine percent on a tablet; in contrast, only 4 percent reported gambling on horse race tracks and 1 percent reported gambling in a physical casino. In particular, gambling on a mobile telephone has increased clearly in recent years [20] . Past-year problem gambling has been reported to be comparable to or towards the higher end of problem gambling rates reported in other European settings, with problem gambling (measured with thee PGSI, Problem Gambling Severity Index) reported to be around 0.3 percent, and SOGS-R (South Oaks Gambling Screen-revised) past-year problem and pathological gambling at a total of 2.2 percent of the population [7] . From previously being an officially monopoly-based system with many unlicensed overseas online gambling companies [13, 19] , since 1 January 2019, the Swedish gambling market includes a large number of licensed and thereby regulated gambling operators. Furthermore, in line with previous experience of self-exclusion from gambling [21] , this system also includes a novel national self-exclusion service (called Spelpaus), which covers all licensed gambling operators (such that a person who chooses to self-exclude can do so from all operators through one national governmental authority).",

As a symptom of the same development, gambling was reported to attract international operators in surprisingly low-tier training games [23] .

The questionnaire also collected dichotomous data on whether a respondent had or had not gambled on each specific gambling platform during the past year (online casino, land-based casino, online horse betting, land-based horse betting, online sports betting, land-based sports betting in betting shops, online poker, land-based electronic gambling machines, and online bingo). Thereafter, the questionnaire opened a section starting with brief wording on the specific situation that COVID-19 leads to, such as changes in working life or everyday activities, with questions about changes in the individual's behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic (\"since these changes in Sweden started\"); whether she/he, during this period, had spent more or less time at home (much more, slightly more, unchanged or less time at home); and had consumed more or less alcohol (more alcohol than prior to the pandemic, less alcohol than during the pandemic, unchanged, or \"don't drink at all, neither now nor before\"). Thereafter, the corresponding question was asked for gambling, and it was specified that gambling refers to gambling for money and that this may include gambling on sports, casino, bingo, card games, or lotteries, either online or on land-based platforms. Options included \"gamble more during COVID-19 than before\", \"gamble less during COVID-19 than before\", \"no, completely unchanged\", and \"I don't gamble, neither now nor before\". Later detailed questions were asked in the same way but for each type of gambling: online casino; online sports betting; land-based sports betting (in betting shops); online horse gambling; land-based horse gambling; online lotteries; land-based lotteries; and land-based electronic gambling machines, respectively. Furthermore, questions were asked about total gambling losses from the past 30 days, and thereafter total gambling losses during a \"typical 30-day period\", specifying that losses refer to money actually lost (in order to clearly separate the wording from gambling deposits). Another gambling-related question that was asked was whether the respondent had ever self-excluded from gambling through the national self-exclusion system (Spelpaus; \"yes\", \"no\", or \"prefer not to say\").",

Psychological distress was measured using the Kessler-6 (K-6) scale (Furukawa et al., 2003 [28] ), with six questions addressing depressive and anxiety-related symptoms during a time frame of the past six months, with options ranging from \"not at all\" to \"all the time\", also including a \"cannot answer/prefer not to say\" response.

In 54 cases where at least one of the six K-6 items were missing (\"cannot answer/prefer not to say\"), from 24 of these, it could be concluded from the available answers whether or not an individual reached the cut-off of 5 for the available responses, or whether they had a total score of 0 from five responses, thus making the full score below 5 regardless of the hypothetical value of the single missing response. The remaining 30 cases, where the level above/below the cut-off could not be established, were excluded from this calculation. In addition to the reporting of moderate psychological distress, for descriptive purposes, distribution of full Kessler-6 scores were also reported. (1) Kessler-6, total score 2 4 (1-8)",

For measured increases in each of the gambling types, due to a more limited number of respondents reporting the outcome and for a direct comparison across gambling types, logistic regressions were carried out including the items male gender (vs female/prefer not to say), age groups, whether or not a respondent had spent more time at home, and the level of problem gambling severity (no risk, low risk, moderate risk, or problem gambling). For the question addressing how gambling had changed in response to the cancellation of sports events, where more than one answer could be chosen, each possible response was analyzed with respect to univariate associations and logistic regression, all including the same four variables as potential correlates, chosen in order to keep the number of correlates limited to a few key variables given the low number reporting each outcome (age, gender, time at home, and gambling severity). The final analyses only included individuals who had opted for another response to the overall gambling question than the option \"I don't gamble, neither now nor before\", in order to calculate statistical correlates of change only among individuals with a possible gambling involvement. The remaining analyses were mainly descriptive, and included descriptive percentages as well as the description of the ratio between the number of respondents reporting a gambling increase and the number reporting a decrease (including for each gambling type and for alcohol consumption as a comparison).

Another important finding was that the minority of respondents reporting an increase of other gambling in response to the rapid shortfall of sports events, had very high rates of gambling problems. One overall impression is that while the pandemic does not demonstrate changes in the population as a whole, for a sub-group of individuals with high vulnerability, increased gambling may be a real problem and may need to be targeted with interventions.",

In the present study, it is not possible to conclude how the changes (increases and decreases) in gambling behavior correspond to natural fluctuations regularly happening in the general population. However, importantly, the group reporting increased gambling behaviors differed from other respondents; consequently, across different analyses and measures in the study, increased gambling was independently and clearly associated with the problem of gambling severity. Among those reporting increased gambling, more than half of respondents were moderate-risk or problem gamblers, and a history of self-exclusion was reported by a surprisingly high 28-percent proportion of that group.",

While some sports gambling still may occur even during the most extensive COVID-19-related restraints, such as games in leagues that very rarely appear in the media or unexpected betting on training or low-tier soccer games [14, 23] , within the minority who reported increasing \"other sports betting\", more than four out of five were categorized as moderate-risk or problem gamblers. Likewise, a switch to online casinos was reported by a group where around nine out of ten were moderate-risk or problem gamblers. For the group reporting a switch to horse betting, the percentage with gambling problems was smaller, but nevertheless, around half were at least moderate-risk gamblers. Thus, this leads to a possible conclusion that when the world of sports is nearly entirely cancelled, those who still seek other gambling involvement may be a group that are important to address with preventive measures.",

Except for online sports betting, which is likely decrease due to the rapid cancellation of most sports events worldwide, online gambling platforms generally represented a higher proportion of the reported increase in gambling compared to those reporting a decrease. Although these self-reported figures must be interpreted with caution, they lend some support to the notion that replacing one gambling type with another during the pandemic may be of greater relevance for some platforms than for others. Clearly, land-based horse betting may not serve as a viable option for a large majority of sports bettors when sport is cancelled, whereas online casinos and online lotteries, as well as online horse betting, are easily accessible alternative options. Online gambling in general may be associated with a higher risk of addictive behavior and harm [30, 31] . Moreover, in literature describing reasons for gambling specifically online, rather than in land-based venues, online gamblers have cited a wide range of reasons for doing so; the increased availability and the comfort of using online gambling services are factors which remain unchanged or have even increased during the pandemic. Likewise, a significant minority of online gamblers cite boredom and other motivators reflecting a negative feedback pattern [29] , and it cannot be excluded that such triggers for online gambling account for part of the increase in some gambling types here.",

Thus, if the emotional consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are assumed to influence gambling habits, which is beyond the scope of the present study to conclude, this would be in line with a possible increase in online casino gambling. However, this would rather be the opposite to the findings regarding horse betting. It can be assumed that different mechanisms may come into play for individuals changing their gambling habits in response to the pandemic; the sub-group that reported increasing gambling may reflect an effect of social isolation or emotional concerns, or may reflect the decrease in sports-related betting during COVID-19-related constraints, with horse bettors likely to represent more of the latter.",

Traditionally, males are more likely than females to develop gambling problems in the general population [33, 34] , and so far, the male predominance appears to translate into the clinical setting [18, 31, 35] . However, with time, gambling has been described to become more and more acceptable in women, such that gender differences could potentially start to decrease [36, 37] . Possibly as a part of this process, and possibly due to a transfer of land-based gambling into the online setting and therefore away from its traditional arenas, female problem gambling has increased in the present setting in recent years; in a recent public health authority survey, an increase in problem gambling was seen mainly in women [38] . Likewise, in the present setting, recent data demonstrate that the female-to-male ratio may be high in the sub-group of people who have a significant online gambling involvement [13] . Based on this, it would be possible to assume that a risk situation which would theoretically increase online gambling would increase the proportion of women. Meanwhile, particular gender effects could be assumed during the COVID-19 crisis due to the decreased sports betting market, where many participants are known to be men [18, [39] [40] [41] .

The possible link between alcohol consumption and gambling has received considerable research attention. However, whether or not a concurrent alcohol consumption increases the risk of gambling has been studied with somewhat mixed results, and all results that has been provided so far are not necessarily applicable to a setting with a high prevalence of online gambling. In land-based casino gamblers, alcohol consumption has not convincingly been shown to increase concurrent gambling [43] , and in US past-year gamblers, it has been suggested that the positive link between alcohol use and gambling may not be clear in subclinical drinkers, but is clearer among patients with an alcohol use disorder [44] . In a recent study into online sports bettors in Australia, alcohol use and drug use were associated with placing larger bets [45] . Thus, based on the latter finding, it cannot be excluded that the association between alcohol increases and gambling increases in the present study is based on a direct effect of drinking patterns-or possibly an association in the opposite direction, such that increased gambling could increase alcohol consumption. The direction and causality of this association cannot be established. In addition, the association between spending more time at home and increased gambling was weaker than for alcohol, which remained the only significant correlate aside from gambling severity. Thus, it is also possible that the alcohol variable here represents a proxy of a lifestyle change in general, representing both increased drinking, spending more time at home, and possibly other behaviors.",

While this is hitherto inconclusive, what supports an effect from being at home and changing everyday routines is that some gambling types have a different increase/decrease than others; the increase/decrease ratio for online horse betting was higher than for land-based horse betting, and higher for online lotteries than for land-based lotteries, and generally, increase/decrease ratios for land-based gambling types were low. These changes likely reflect changes in the community from COVID-19-related constraints; occasions for land-based activities are overall more limited than those happening online.

First, it is-to the best of the author's knowledge-the first study examining the short-term changes in gambling patterns during the COVID-19 crisis, and therefore already provides data during the ongoing crisis that can advise stakeholders and provide a base for further research. However, obvious limitations of the study relate to the fact that the study is an anonymous web survey, with limitations relating to an inability to ask many questions and to collect more in-depth data. Moreover, the temporality between different variables cannot be established in the present kind of survey-based cross-sectional data collection; most importantly, regarding the association between higher gambling severity (PGSI data) and increases in gambling patterns, it cannot be established whether the endorsement of PGSI items is due to the current COVID-19-related increases specifically, or whether a pre-existing PGSI-measured gambling problem subsequently predicted such a response to the pandemic. Likewise, in the present paper, data on past-year use of each type of gambling was included for descriptive purposes, but were not entered into the logistic regression analyses, the latter in order to reduce the number of correlates used, and because of the uncertainty of whether the reporting of one gambling type would represent the baseline gambling pattern or the new, recent gambling pattern. Thus, further research may need to have a longitudinal study design, and may expand the possibilities to study the pre-and post-prevalence of specific gambling types. The present study results rely on self-reported data, which is a strength to the extent that it addresses a more complete picture than one that can be derived from the technical deposit data of each separate gambling operator, but includes an obvious limitation with respect to the detailed measure of what is perceived by an individual to be an increase, a decrease, or a lack of change. Likewise, the estimation of monthly gambling losses was based on self-reported information and the conclusions from the pre-post-comparison are therefore limited, although a substantial percentage of respondents actually endorsed a higher level of loss during the past 30-day period than in a typical 30-day period. Here, objective data such as consumer credit data or bank account data would have been of significant value. Furthermore, the limited format of the present survey limited the amount of variables assessed; for example, immigrant background, a variable known to have an influence on gambling and problem gambling [24, 46] , was not assessed, presenting another limitation to the present work.",

Related to this, we can conclude that problem and/or moderate-risk gambling was markedly higher than what has been reported in general population studies from the same setting [47] . Thus, it is very likely that a web survey addressing gambling-related issues may attract a sample of respondents with a higher involvement in-or interest in-gambling, which also has been seen in previous studies from our group using a similar methodology and in samples recruited in the same way [24] [25] [26] .",

Although the number of individuals reporting a gambling increase was smaller than the number reporting a decrease, and although the large majority reported no change, it can be concluded that increasing overall gambling, and specific gambling types during the COVID-19 crisis, is clearly associated with having a higher degree of gambling problems. Likewise, although a majority did not report an altered gambling behavior from the substantial changes to the world of sports, those who did report such an increase presented very high rates of gambling problems. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, those tending to increase gambling may have particular treatment needs, and given the potential vulnerability in that group, there is reason to take action in order to prevent crisis-related increases in gambling. The link between alcohol and gambling is particularly important to address and to prevent during the crisis.",
