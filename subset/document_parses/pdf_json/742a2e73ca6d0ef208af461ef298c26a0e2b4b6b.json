This task is not trivial; however, research into new ways of effectively supporting awareness and engagement, especially in view of digitalization trends, is still missing. In this study, we investigate the ability of augmented reality (AR) technology to improve awareness of CE practices and to engage citizens, inclusively, in the CE approach. Specifically, we report on the development of a novel AR engagement tool and present the results of two studies undertaken using this tool to assess the reliability and validity of this engagement practice. The first study focuses on the citizens of a municipality in Greece, and the second focuses on the general public outside the municipality boundaries. Attributes related to user engagement, such as novelty, aesthetics, perceived usability, endurability, focused attention, self-efficacy, perceived learning, and interest in the topic, were assessed, as were factors affecting these attributes related to the participants' knowledge of CE principles and exposure to similar technologies. The two studies indicate that the AR engagement tool increased social inclusion and community cohesion and was able to successfully bring CE principles and benefits to the public's attention. Higher engagement levels were observed in participants who had limited exposure to the concept of CE prior to using the AR tool, and its use was found to improve their confidence and interest in CE. This study aspires to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the use of mobile AR and to support further evidence-based development of digital tools for public awareness and engagement.",

Towards this goal, a transition to a circular economy (CE) model is needed. Such a transition needs to be supported by behavioral, social, and cultural changes, as well as new partnerships between governments and citizens, private and public sectors. Citizen engagement can only be fostered in the context of productive dialogues that reflect the needs of a municipality [3] and where citizens are able to weigh a variety of ideas and build a shared understanding of potential choices as well as emerging opportunities and threats [4] . Such a means draw citizens into a social process, sharing knowledge and generating ideas, hence directly countering exclusion and isolation, provided that the citizen groups are inclusive (i.e., not biased by gender, social differences, or other heterogeneities). In this regard, the need for using a common language to explain and communicate global issues and thereby involve citizens across scales, backgrounds, and identity boundaries is being acknowledged [5] .",

Various Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools, including websites, mobile solutions, social media, and platforms, have been proposed to improve the understanding of public matters and engage citizens in a great variety of topics [4] . Nevertheless, despite these efforts, such initiatives often fail since they are not inclusive [4, 6] or they are designed for a specific target group (such as expert users and stakeholders), or they tackle appropriately either young or senior audiences. Their content is often limited, not engaging enough, and the engagement tools appear restrictive in terms of portability, usability, and accessibility; or they do not comply with a specific framework or measures [4, 6] . A large-scale web-based citizen participatory approach has been demonstrated by Stern et al. [8] . The authors revealed a significant bias of the web-based public participation processes regarding participants of different age groups and educational levels. The public participation processes appeared exclusive at the educational level, as they only reached 14.3% of the participants without higher education. Significant differences were also observed in the age of the participants, as the most significant percentage demonstrating engagement was between 29 and 39 years of age. Finally, the female population engaging in the web-based participatory approach was twice the size of the male one [8] .",

[9] provided a systematic review in 32 case studies to study public participation in urban water governance. The authors explored crowdsourcing and platformbased solutions, as well as social media, open-source software, blogs, and virtual learning platforms, and reported improvements in effectiveness and efficiency in urban water governance [9] . All engagement efforts demonstrated the essential components of an engagement tool to communicate, educate, and change the behavior of citizens towards environmental issues, but further investigation in terms of inclusivity or other attributes was not performed [9] . Church [6] demonstrated the usefulness of methodologies encouraging participation from marginalized groups. An effective ICT solution should emphasize the inclusivity of the citizens, where past experiences, lack of knowledge, and cultural context do not limit involvement. Sections of the community that have not participated in the past and might not seem fertile ground for recruitment should be reached. An impactful engagement process is built upon diversity and equality. All members of a community need to participate in representing different viewpoints and interests, and it should be clear that everyone respectfully participates on an equal basis. The work of the community group needs to be open, transparent, and consistent. At the same time, the engagement process should create opportunities for learning and use or applying that knowledge further at a non-restrictive timeframe and pace [4] . It is, therefore, apparent that engagement tools should be inclusive, accessible, and transparent and support learning and long-run well-being to engage all citizens with their heterogeneities.",

Using an AR application to foster engagement, we exposed a municipality's citizens to digital content related to a CE approach. A web survey was utilized to recruit the citizens and collect the required data. We recruited 127 citizens of a municipality in Greece to investigate which attributes and factors affect their engagement and self-efficacy. Concurrently, we collected data from a second sample (of 101 participants) outside this municipality to investigate the validity of our questions and extract preliminary results to an extent more significant than that of one municipality. This paper presents the results of this study and tries to draw some conclusions in the primary research hypothesis that the use of AR can prove a valuable tool for a mental shift towards CE approaches at a citizen level in an inclusive, accessible, and educative manner.",

User engagement with a technological resource is not just about how a single interaction unfolds but about how and why people develop a relationship with technology and integrate it into their lives. Within this context, the quality of the user experience drives the positive aspects of the interaction, particularly the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology [23] . In human-computer interactions, engagement describes the combination of the user's expectations and motivation, the purpose and functionality of the designed system, and the environment where the interaction occurs. Such experiences address the users' need for being stimulated, perfect their skills and knowledge, and finally help them grow. Thus, user engagement is conceptually a holistic framework for understanding user and system variables' integration and how they combine to push the boundaries of user experience from merely perfunctory to pleasurable and memorable [24] . Therefore, engagement builds upon the foundation of a usable system that is effective, efficient, and satisfactory.",

Then, the participants' attention marks the period of sustained engagement, and interest is maintained in the interaction either by presenting feedback or novel information and features on the interface.

Novelty has been found to improve enjoyment, which is a crucial factor in influencing engagement [28] . Perceived usability refers to a user's ability to perform tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience. It also predicts users' lasting impressions of the experience and their willingness to engage with the application at another point in time [28] . Poor usability is a barrier to engagement and, therefore, is often connected to the ease of use and measures the ease users can experience while trying to complete the desired task with a product [24] . The aesthetics and novelty of AR appear to influence usability, which offers a significant value to the overall engagement. Felt involvement describes how much fun users have during the interaction and how drawn they are during their experience. If the usability of a system does not prevent the users from enjoying themselves, then the felt involvement is high, according to O'Brien and Toms [24] . Endurability describes the desire to redo an activity that has been fun or recommend it to others [24] . Endurability should sum up how rewarding, successful, and worthwhile the interaction with the AR app is. It also corroborates the influence of user and system variables on overall perceptions of experience.",

The UES has been proposed and validated to assess user engagement, guide digital media design, or evaluate user experience with computer-mediated systems. The suitability of UES in various domains has been demonstrated, and the developed UES survey is suitable to assess a great range of goals, ranging from engagement to tasks that allow the user to pass their time to an indepth understanding of current issues [34] . In the present study, we further adopted the proposed scale to assess user engagement in the AR tool developed to educate and engage in CE matters. To develop the engagement tool, we take advantage of AR's capabilities, such as object manipulation, outdoor localization, vivid digital content, a virtual assistant, and other gamification and educational features, to positively affect citizen engagement related to CE and foster an inclusive and accessible learning environment.",

Values of the parameter from 0.7 to 0.9 were considered \"respectable\" to \"very good,\" and values above 0.9 were considered \"excellent\" [43] . Table 2 , shows the alpha values for all the engagement attributes.",

The fitness of the questionnaire's internal structure was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis, employing SPSS AMOS 26.

These factors included the CE literacy, tech-savviness, and demographics of the 127 participants from the citizens of the municipality of Karditsa. Starting with the participants' exposure to technologies, such as smartphones, AR features, mobile games, cameras, and search engines, we established that more than 90% of the participants use a smartphone, perform web searches, and use their smartphone to take photos. Therefore, only exposure to AR and mobile games should determine how techsavviness affects engagement attributes. As for the CE literacy, the variation in all assessed factors allowed us to proceed with the correlation analysis. Figure 4 (a and b) demonstrates how all engagement attributes are affected by tech-savviness and CE literacy. Figure 5 goes into more details and demonstrates how individual factors affect each engagement attribute separately. The factors have been summarized in two main categories; CE literacy and tech-savviness (the individual factors are shown in the legend of the figure) . Increase in the CE literacy of the end-user of the tool results in a reduction in the overall engagement assessed by all attributes. On the other hand, the more tech-savvy is the participant, the highest the engagement. Users exposed to AR understood the usability of the AR app 25% more, compared to users who were seeing AR technology for the first time. Overall, exposure to AR is a factor affecting most engagement attributes from 10 to 25% as seen in the graphs of the second column in Fig. 5 . Such a finding contributes to the perception that tech-savviness expressed by the exposure to mobile games and AR may affect citizen engagement via this tool (Figs. 6, 7, 8) .",

We collected most answers from the capitals of Greece, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Even though the response rate was low, we proceeded by investigating the most determining factors of the overall engagement from the previous analysis, the CE literacy and tech-savviness. Similar trends are observed regarding the CE literacy in both surveys and validated our initial results. CE-proficient participants scored lower in all engagement attributes. Figure 9a is showing how CE literacy before exposure to AR is affecting all engagement attributes both from the survey distributed to the citizens of Karditsa and globally. On the contrary, tech-savviness did not follow the same trend in the global sample as in the municipality one. Figure 9b demonstrates the effect of the tech-savviness of the participants on the engagement attributes and enhanced tech-savviness appears to compromise engagement. The absence of participants above the age of 45 in the global survey may have affected the outcome. ",

The tech-savviness is assessed by the exposure of the participants to AR technology. All factors assessed before exposure to the AR engagement tool (mean agree or disagree statements \u00b1 SD, p < 0.001). The overall engagement is the result of all attributes assessed via the web survey (self-efficacy, perceived learning, interest in CE, focused attention, novelty, aesthetics, endurability, and perceived usability) self-efficacy and perceived learning in the same topic. The results are higher for users who do not have higher education, agreeing with Billinghurst and Duenser [17] who demonstrated that AR might enhance the traditional learning models as interactivity seems central to content engagement. Similarly, Makransky et al. [52] reported that end-users with lower literacy levels on a specific topic benefit more from immersive techniques, especially when combined with traditional learning establishments. Thus, compared to other citizen engagement initiatives based on web-based platforms that demonstrated a significant increase in participation among citizens of higher education, the AR engagement tool is more inclusive towards the population with a lower education level [8] .",
