The test distribution we propose is a linear combination of \u03c7 2 distributions, with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies algorithm at high precision. As an application, we propose a test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two genome-wide association studies at the level of genes. The test can be extended to detect gene-wise causal links. We illustrate this method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between severity of Covid-19, taking of class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), Vitamin D (25OHD) and Calcium concentrations. In particular, our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to TH 1 versus TH 2 immune reaction, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting severity of Covid-19.",

This is of particular relevance in the aggregation to gene and pathway effect sizes. In this context, a pathway is understood as a functional set of genes and the SNP effect sizes in the gene regions are aggregated to a single effect. If not corrected for LD, the resulting gene and pathway scores may reflect the level of importance for the phenotype inaccurately. For this reason, techniques and tools have been developed to correct for LD in the aggregation process, like for example PASCAL [3] and MAGMA [4] . These tools mainly differ in how they map SNP effect sizes to genes, how the LD structure is accounted for, and details of the numerical procedure to estimate significance.",

In particular, such a shared genetic component hints at that the same functional pathology may contribute to several diseases, cf., [6] . At the gene level, usually a gene is considered to be relevant for two different traits if the gene carries a significant SNP effect size in both traits. However, this may not be a good criterion under all circumstances. Protein coding genes often contain several independent LD blocks. Therefore, two traits may associate with genetic variation in two or more functionally different blocks of SNPs within the same gene, which may independently be significant. Hence, even though the two traits share the same significant gene, they may not share the same functional genetic mechanism. In order to call pleiotropy of a gene, one should therefore move beyond comparing single variants, and take all SNPs in the gene region into account.",

In this Ansatz, the effect sizes are considered as random variables and thereby naturally define a notation of heritability and (linear) genetic correlation. In partic-ular, this leads to a simple and computational efficient method to calculate the correlation coefficient via regression. However, stratifying LD score regression onto the level of genes is in general difficult. Mainly because SNPs in the same genomic region are often in high LD, as already mentioned above. Hence, the variables entering the linear correlation may be highly dependent, and this has to be corrected for. Similarly, the standard errors and p-values are estimated via resampling (jackknife). But this demands independent samples, which is not the case for strong LD.",

This gives us a simple, but systematic definition of co-significance of a gene for two traits, i.e., if the SNP-wise cross-moment is significant. For a single overlapping SNP this reduces to testing against the product-normal distribution, and hence corresponds to a multiplicative meta-analysis, rather than an additive one like Fisher's. Though our Ansatz does not intrinsically disentangle genetic and potential additional joint residual contributions, it nevertheless has utility in uncovering genes of relevance to more than one trait, as we will illustrate with an explicit example of current high interest in this work.",

This allows one to take systematically into account not only isolated significant SNPs for calling a gene co-significant for two traits, but all common SNPs in the gene region. The assumption we have to make is that there is an underlying joint normal distribution, and the dependency pattern of the SNPs is known (for instance, the pattern can be approximated from a reference population). Furthermore, we assume that the study populations of the two traits do not have overlapping samples and that both populations can be approximated by an identical reference panel.",

Most readers are probably familiar with the \u03c7 2 distribution reviewed in section II. The role played in this work by the \u03c7 2 is essential, as all the other distributions we consider can be expressed as a linear combination of \u03c7 2 distributions. This holds in particular for the product-normal distribution, as we will see in section III, as well as for the Variance-Gamma distribution discussed in appendix B. The core sections of this paper constitute IV, in which we explain how we can perform a significance test of independence under the conditions described above, and section V, in which we derive a way to calculate the cumulative distribution function of a particular ratio distribution of relevance for a causality test. Simulated examples are discussed in section VI, followed by an application to real GWAS data in section VII. As illustrative example, we will use the developed technique to find computational predictions for shared genetic links between severity of Covid-19, class M05B medication taking, and Vitamin D and Calcium concentrations. In particular, we detect a potential role for severity of Covid-19 played by chemokine receptor genes linked to T H 1 versus T H 2 immune reaction, and a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression. Several other genes related to Covid-19, discussed before elsewhere in the literature, are replicated. In addition we uncover hints for a potential protective and/or therapeutic pathway related to taking of specific immune related medications (H03A, L04 and M01A).",

Therefore, with the cdf for R derived in section V, we can test for a significant deviation from the null expectation of no relation. Note that in general R is not invariant under interchange of response and explanatory variable, and may be used under certain conditions to make inference about the causal direction, cf., multi-instrument Mendelian randomization, in particular [21] . The main idea can be readily sketched. Note first that the ratio test tries to detect genes that are maximal (anti)-coherent over the SNP effects between two GWAS, but at the same time carry minimal variance in one of the GWAS, as is clear from (18) . The purpose of this, at first sight somewhat non-intuitive, statistical test becomes more clear if one thinks in terms of one GWAS trait as being the exposure and the other as outcome. If the ratio tested gene does carry minimal SNP variance only over the outcome, but on the same time SNP coherence between the exposure and outcome, the causal direction from exposure to outcome is implied, if the exposure is confirmed to be associated to the gene via p V obtainable from (14) , and confounding factors can be excluded.

While such a cutoff ensures that no SNPs with p-values above 0.05 in one GWAS can become co-significant due to very high significance (i.e. p-value below 10 \u221216 ) in the other GWAS, applying such a hard cutoff point hampers distinguishing differences in co-significances.",

However, also false negatives may occur: In the proposed novel approach using (15) , several independent weak signals may combine to a stronger signal, if the directions of association are consistent over the gene window. Such signals are invisible in the simple approach of comparing aggregated gene p-values. That this is not only hypothetical may be seen at hand of figure 13 (bottom plot), there a gene p-value scatter plot is shown for severe Covid-19 against Calcium concentration. Remarkably, the detailed approach using individual SNP information marks genes to be of interest which are away from the gene-wise significant curve, and ignores other genes which are closer.",

The ratio test Manhattan plot is shown in figure 14 . In particular, besides the genes KLC1 and AL139300.1, the gene ZFYVE21 (p R = 3.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) stands out. Under the Covid-19 GWAS (outcome) the gene carries a p-value of p V = 0.99 while under the Vitamin D GWAS (exposure) a p-value of p V = 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . This implies a causal flow from genetic predisposition for Vitamin D concentration to severity of Covid-19. We confirmed that Calcium concentration is not a potential confounder for ZFYVE21 (p V = 0.26). The D-test shows that the gene is in the right tail and hence is associated with high Vitamin D concentration. A possible explanation of the hit may go as follows. ZFYVE21 regulates microtubule-induced PTK2/FAK1 dephosphorylation, which is important for integrin beta-1/ITGB1 cell surface expression. It has been discussed before in the literature that integrins in host cells may play the role of alternative receptors to ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 [45, 46] . Hence, it is tempting to speculate that genetic predisposition for Vitamin D concentration may also influence expression of the integrin receptors, and thereby the outcome of Covid-19 via an increased risk of cellular infection.",

Further investigations at hand of related GWAS phenotypes revealed genetic links to Vitamin D and Calcium concentrations, with Covid-19 cross implicated genes related to differentation between type 1 and type 2 immune response. A possible explanation of this emerging link being that patients taking class M05B medication usually suffer under Osteoporosis. Vitamin D stimulates the absorption of Calcium and therefore is related to bone mineral density [51] .

However, what is new, to the best of our knowledge, is the expression in terms of the difference distribution in equation (B2).
