The study is aimed at establishing the prediction model of infection in patients with lung cancer during chemotherapy by an artificial neural network (ANN). Based on the data of historical cases in our hospital, the variables were screened, and the prediction model was established. A logistic regression (LR) model was used to screen the data. The indexes with statistical significance were selected, and the LR model and back propagation neural network model were established. A total of 80 cases of advanced lung cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy were predicted, and the prediction performance of different model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). It was found that age \u2267 60 years, length of stay \u2267 14 d, surgery history, combined chemotherapy, myelosuppression, diabetes, and hormone application were risk factors of infection in lung cancer patients during chemotherapy. The area under the ROC curve of the LR model for prediction lung infection was 0:729 \u00b1 0:084, which was less than that of the ANN model (0:897 \u00b1 0:045). The results concluded that the neural network model is better than the LR model in predicting lung infection of lung cancer patients during chemotherapy.",

Patients with advanced lung cancer who have multiple systemic metastases are less likely to receive palliative chemotherapy, because there is no indication for targeted therapy after gene detection. Palliative chemotherapy is also the use of traditional chemotherapy drugs, but the purpose is not to treat cancer but to reduce the clinical symptoms of lung cancer patients. Palliative chemotherapy can prolong the life of patients and help them recover their daily life. Therefore, the drug dose of palliative chemotherapy will be lower than that of general chemotherapy [4] [5] [6] .",

The influence degree was high to low: myelosuppression, length of stay, age, diabetes, combined chemotherapy, surgery history, and hormone application. Taking the above seven independent variables as input elements and pulmonary infection as output elements, a three-layer feedforward artificial BP neural network (ANN) model is directly constructed. In the input layer, there were 7 neural nodes; in the hidden layer, there were 7 changeable nodes (hyperbolic tangent transfer function); in the output layer, pulmonary infection occurred during chemotherapy (softmax transfer function). The transfer function of hidden layer was Tansig, the transfer function of output layer was Purelin, the target error is 0.01, the learning rate is 0.1, and LM optimization algorithm is used for network training.",

Nosocomial infection not only affects treatment and rehabilitation, prolongs hospital stay, and increases medical costs but also significantly affects prognosis and even endangers life. Most of them were elderly patients with age-related organ dysfunction, low immunity, high inci-dence of multiple diseases, and being easy to complicate with all kinds of hospital infection. The incidence of nosocomial infection was 19.0% (76/40), which was similar to that reported in a domestic literature. Further analysis showed that age \u2267 60 years, length of stay \u2267 14 d, surgery history, combined chemotherapy, myelosuppression, diabetes, and hormone application were risk factors of infection in lung cancer patients during chemotherapy [20] . This study attempts to establish a specific mathematical model by using the risk factors of infection during chemotherapy, evaluating and predicting the possible infection of elderly patients with lung cancer, and evaluating and exploring a new method to predict individual disease. LR is simple and easy to use. It is the most commonly used method to predict the disease status with precise classification. However, it requires that the data meet certain conditions; that is, the dependent variable is a classification variable, the independent variables are independent of each other, and there is no obvious collinearity and interaction, so it is difficult to predict the infection of individual patients effectively. ANN has no requirements for the distribution and type of variables. It is good at dealing with nonlinear, fuzzy, and noisy data. It provides a new way to solve complex medical problems and has been paid more and more attention by medical workers in disease prediction. Relevant research shows that the BP neural network is much better than the traditional Cox regression and LR model for data fitting [21] [22] [23] . ",

The larger the area under the curve, the greater the accuracy of the diagnostic test. The results showed that the area under the ROC curve of the LR prediction model was 0:729 \u00b1 0:084. The area under the ROC curve of the BP neural network was 0:897 \u00b1 0:045, which indicated that the ANN prediction model had better prediction and discrimination performance than the LR prediction model.
