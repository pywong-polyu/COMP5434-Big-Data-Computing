On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 1 It is anticipated that COVID-19 will occur in most communities and populations across the world due to the current widespread community transmission in most countries, including Nigeria. 2 Limited data are available on COVID-19 in pregnancy, but the studies published to date do not show an increased risk of severe disease in pregnancy 3, 4 or substantial risk to newborns. 3, 5 Congenital infection with COVID-19 has not been found, and the virus has not been detected in expelled products of conception. 4 However, the impact on healthcare services in settings with under-resourced health systems, such as Nigeria, is likely to be substantial in the coming months, and maternity services still need to be prioritized as an essential core health service. According to the WHO, \"All pregnant women have the right to a positive childbirth experience whether or not they have a confirmed COVID-19 infection\" (WHO 2020). 6 The healthcare system should ensure the provision of safe and quality care to pregnant women during labor and childbirth, and at the same time, maternity care providers (including obstetricians, midwives, and all other healthcare workers providing maternal and newborn care) are essential healthcare workers and must be protected and prioritized to continue providing care to childbearing women and their babies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maternity care providers have the right to full access to all personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitation, and a safe and respectful working environment. 7 Maintaining a healthy workforce will ensure ongoing quality care for women and their newborns; without healthy maternity care providers there will be limited care for women and newborns.",
