This study's objective was to devise a method to measure the prevalence of improper mask use and no mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14-20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The total number of visited public areas was 382 where mask use behavior of 2,080 visitors and 1,510 staff were observed. The average prevalence of mask use among observed visitors was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 48% of the public areas, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed and in 17% at least one unmasked visitor was observed. The average prevalence of proper mask use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade PLOS ONE Data Availability Statement: We have uploaded a de-identified dataset that can be used to replicate type, and geographical area. Observing unmasked and improperly masked visitors was more common in small (less than 1500 square feet) public areas than larger ones, specifically in food and grocery stores as compared to other retail stores. Also, the majority of the observed unmasked persons were male and middle-aged.",

Therefore, as COVID-19 became a widespread pandemic in 2020, countries, states, and local municipalities began requiring facial coverings. Many governors within the United States implemented executive orders requiring masks within public indoor areas throughout 2020 [9] . The state of Kentucky mandated public masking on July 9 th , 2020, and in March 2021 renewed the executive order until at least July 2021 [10, 11] .",

While the importance of mask-wearing is emphasized, understanding mask-wearing behavior and practices in the community can inform public health policies. However, common methods of measuring mask-wearing yield significant inaccuracies, particularly surveys based on self-report [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] as they result in attenuation bias. When non-interventional observations of mask use replace self-reporting, non-representative sub-populations (e.g., university students and clinic population) have been studied [19] [20] [21] . Observational studies that do not focus on a specific sub-population or improper masking are scarce [22] . A study conducted in Wisconsin, USA, in summer 2020 approximated a 6% improper mask-wearing rate before the state's store mask mandate and suggested it decreased to 3% with a store mandate [23] .",

Ten was selected as the maximum number of observed visitors or staff in a PA for two reasons. First, the practice surveys, conducted by three authors, showed that working with a multiple of 10 (e.g., 10 or 20) was more straightforward for a surveyor and less prone to error. Second, to select a multiple of 10, practice surveys that targeted the observation of 10 and 20 visitors or staff (maximum totals of 20 and 40 visitors and staff, respectively) were conducted. The results showed that keeping track of 40 (versus 20) people and recalling several pieces of information (total count, the number of unmasked, the number of incorrectly masked, and perceived sex and age of the unmasked and incorrectly masked) was challenging.",

Although previous research reports similar findings [32] , why this occurs remains unknown. One explanation could be the way individuals follow perceived social norms [33] . Perhaps individuals more intentionally follow a norm in areas with more people; there is a greater expectation to follow a pre-set norm, such as wearing a mask correctly in larger rather than smaller public areas. Others suggest that health behaviors are more specifically connected to one's appraised threat such that the lower the appraised threat, the less likely the individual will adhere to protective behaviors [34, 35] . In other words, if one assesses a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 in a smaller establishment due to the location's smaller capacity, then they are less motivated to completely adhere to those protective behaviors [34] . Future studies examining mask-wearing behavior should include data points about individual behavior beliefs, protective beliefs, beliefs about infectious diseases, and misinformation beliefs [36] .",

The mean prevalence of unmasked persons varied from 0% to 8% in visitors and 3% to 16% in staff. Geographical variation in mask use was strongly correlated with income such that the districts with highest prevalence of unmasked and improperly masked individuals were among the most economically disadvantaged districts of the city. For example, the highest visitor improperly masked prevalence (20%) and the highest staff unmasked prevalence (16%) were recorded in the city's poorest district, the North West district, where the median family income was $22,848 in 2018. Conversely, the lowest visitor unmasked and improperly masked prevalence (0% and 10%, respectively) and the lowest staff unmasked prevalence (5%) were recorded in the richest district of the city, East & North East where the median family income was $91,141 in 2018 (S2 Table in S1 File). Populations with low-income often face greater challenges obtaining resources to practice healthy behaviors and often face complex social contexts [37, 38] . The financial means to purchase or make an appropriately fitted mask may be an obstacle in lower income communities. Researchers have reported a higher prevalence of high-risk health behaviors among communities with lowincome [39] . In other words, although smoking and physical inactivity differ from mask-wearing, the communities facing the greatest health challenges for systemic reasons are also struggling with masking. Further, researchers currently suggest that case and mortality rates are elevated for populations with complex health challenges, in areas health disparities already exist, and potentially for populations with low-income [40] .",

Finding a high prevalence of incorrect mask use among males coincides with previous research findings. A number of studies report that females are more likely than males to wear masks or wear masks appropriately [22, 23, 41] . One study suggests a connection between masculinity and mask-wearing behaviors [37] and other research suggests that the tendency to appropriately wear a mask is connected to one's caregiving responsibilities [42] . Masking-wearing as a public health practice may evolve as the utilization of seatbelts did beginning in the mid-1900s in the United States. If so, identifying the history of successful and unsuccessful public health practice campaigns will further public marketing for masking. For example, researchers have reported that young men are the most unlikely to follow seatbelt regulations [43] [44] [45] , and others have suggested that seatbelt use is connected with one's perceived risk [46] . Even other public health prevention tools, such as condom use, has been connected with one's tendency to take risk or engage in impulsive behaviors [47] . This evidence suggests mask-wearing behaviors may face similar challenges.",

One survey identified the political and polarizing nature of mask-wearing among United States counties [50] . Louisville is an urban area within a predominately rural state with midwestern and southern history. Mask-wearing behaviors may differ between rural and urban settings as well [23] . Louisville voted for democratic representatives in the House of Representatives eight out of the past ten election cycles [51] . In 2018, Kentucky elected a democratic governor after 4 years with a republican governor [52] which speaks to the dynamic political and cultural context of the state. Thus, a wider sampling of Kentucky as a whole would provide a more representative snapshot of these behaviors and attend to the geographical and political variation in the state. Further, the evidence from international responses' also highlights how political dynamics and governmental policies impact a population's response to pandemic health recommendations [53] . Even more localized leadership, beyond a national or state level, can influence a community's response [53] .",

Approximately half of the error could be attributed to the sample selection mechanism that resulted in a median representativeness error of 1.95%. The rest could be attributed to the implementation challenges. For example, some of the selected PAs were either non-operational or could not be visited by surveyors.

In other words, the study introduced observer bias as a product of misjudging visitors' and staff's sex and age due to limited facial visibility. As a result, sex and age could have been misclassified to some degree.

Despite mask mandates in place, we observed a small proportion of visitors (4%) and staff (8%) that did not wear a facial mask or wore them incorrectly (14% of visitors and 13% of staff).
