SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-II) as described above. ACE-II receptors are found in lungs, heart, intestine, and kidneys. ACE-II presence is upregulated in patients on ACE-I and ARB therapy and in diabetics. 49 Therefore, it has been postulated that these medications may predispose to increased infectivity. There has also been a question of whether ARBs in particular may even be protective from SARS-CoV-2. 50 The pathology of the virus and the role ACE-I and ARB medications play in pathogenesis is not fully understood at this time. Therefore, it is recommended that patients, both those who are ill and those who are healthy who use these medications should be continued on them unless there is a reason to discontinue them (hypotension, acute kidney injury, abnormal electrolytes, etc). Stopping them could in fact lead to more harm in high-risk patients. 51, 52 Bottom Line",

Antibiotics should be used for standard indications, and the use of antivirals and steroids should be avoided.
