            "text": "Cooperation is vital for the survival of a swarm 1 . Large scale cooperation allows murmuring starlings to outmaneuver preying falcons 2 , shoaling sardines to outsmart sea lions 3 , and homosapiens to outlive their Pleistocene peers 4 . On the micron-scale, bacterial colonies show excellent resilience thanks to the individuals' ability to cooperate even when densely packed, mitigating their internal flow pattern to mix nutrients, fence the immune system, and resist antibiotics [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Production of an artificial swarm on the micro-scale faces a serious challengewhile an individual bacterium has an evolutionaryforged internal machinery to produce propulsion, until now, artificial micro-swimmers relied on the precise chemical composition of their environment to directly fuel their drive [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . When crowded, artificial micro-swimmers compete locally for a finite fuel supply, quenching each other's activity at their greatest propensity for cooperation. Here we introduce an artificial micro-swimmer that consumes no chemical fuel and is driven solely by light. We couple a light absorbing particle to a fluid droplet, forming a colloidal chimera that transforms light energy into propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive allows them to operate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective repulsive interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above a critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that displays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense swimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles. We derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying the role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration of the micro-swimmers.",

When exposed to light, dimers commence a persistent swimming motion; when light is turned off, the dimers revert to random Brownian motion (see Fig.1b,c) . As a light source, we used a wide beam (diameter d = 310 \u00b5m) infrared (wavelength \u03bb = 1064 nm) laser (see section 1.3 in Supplementary In- * matanbz@gmail.com a b c h\u00ec d\u00e8fg Figure 1 : The light driven fuel-free micro-swimmers display distinct behaviours at different densities. a a single micro-swimmer is composed of a light absorbing particle (dark sphere), and a fluid droplet (white sphere). Individual swimmers transition from diffusive dynamics when light is off (b) to more ballistic when light is turned on (c) ( formation for details). Typical experiments were performed in deionized water, yet swimmers are also active in saline phosphate buffer (PBS), or when exposed to a visible, noncoherent, light sources (see Methods for experimental setup and sample preparation). We find drastically different collective dynamics of the active particles when their area fraction, \u03c6 A , is increased, transitioning from quickly dispersing when dilute (\u03c6 A < 0.14, Fig.1b Fig.1d-f, Fig.3a , and Supplementary Videos 1 and 4) . This high degree of autonomy has been observed in living bacteria 9-14 , but was not reported in previously studied systems of artificial micro-swimmers fuelled by either external ionic currents 15, 16 , consumption of micelles 20 , hydrolysis of hydrogen peroxide 23 , or critical de-mixing of their surrounding buffer 17 . Instead, those systems exhibit interrupted internal dynamics, with the crowded phase being frozen, and sometimes crystalline.",

The increased effective area fraction may surpass the critical concentration, \u03c6 * , and trigger the crowding dynamics. The extent of this effect however depends on the spatial arrangement of the passive particles. When randomly dispersed each passive particle occupies much more room as it carries a corona of excluded area. When the passive particles are packed in a lattice (as in Figs.4d,e) , their excluded areas overlap and they effectively occupy a smaller area. Therefore we expect the effective area fraction of the active particles to reduce when the passive particles are hexago-nally packed (HP), \u03c6 P,rand A > \u03c6 P,HP A .

Once the active particles complete the corralling task, they disperse, as the area gained by the overlapping excluded areas makes them sub-critical. A similar equilibrium process is the depletion interaction 27, 40 , where the diffusion of many small particles (depletants) can drive fewer, larger particles to crystallize. There is one important distinction: even in the absence of passive particles, active particles have an intrinsic critical clustering concentration because of their activity. Our analysis shows qualitatively similar results to previous theoretical work on mixed active/passive populations 35, 36, 41, 42 , but may prove more general as it relies on a generic geometrical argument.",

            "text": "In this work we have introduced a synthetic route and a driving strategy for a new family of micro-swimmers that are propelled solely by light -a colloidal chimera of a light absorbing particle bound to a fluid droplet. An individual swimmer's propulsion mechanism is quantitatively captured by a thermo-capillary drive. The swimmers remain active at high area fractions, \u03c6 A > 0.5, and can be used as an experimentally tuneable model system to study a host of phenomena in dense active matter such as 2D turbulence in a compressible fluid, previously seen in bacterial colonies 9-13 . We found that at low concentrations swimmers tend to quickly disperse, but above a critical concentration form a long lived dense phase. We identify a depletion-like interaction where the excluded volume of passive particles in random or close packed configurations can change \u03c6 * of the active particles resulting in passive particle crystallization. As the mechanism is geometric, it may be applicable generally from living organisms to robotic swarms. As our optically powered Marangoni swimmers are largely agnostic to their precise chemical environment, we were able to graft DNA on their surface. Micro-swimmers augmented by DNA nanotechnology 43,44 can prove useful in the self-assembly of active tissue, mimicking biofilms, in the making of future, functional active matter. Hybrid dimers were synthesized by binding a 3 \u00b5m light absorbing particle (M280 BANGS LAB) to a fluid oil particle (see list in section 1) using the previously introduced Mix-And-Match strategy 24 . Briefly, fluid droplets were made through membrane emulsification where oil with 0.1% v/v SPAN80 (SIGMA) is pressurized through a porous membrane forming a stable oil in water emulsion (stable for months at room temperature). Typical particle size was 3 \u00b5m. M280 particle and fluid droplets are stoichiometrically mixed, destabilized, quenched, and purified using density gradient step centrifugation. Dimers were found to be stable for months when stored in a refrigerator at 4 o C. Samples were prepared for imaging by loading a suspension to a pre-treated glass capillary (channel height 0.10 mm, width 2.00 mm Vitrotubes W5010-050), that were plasma cleaned (SPI supplies Plasma Prep II), and passivated through vapour deposition of hexamethyldisilazane (SIGMA). Loaded capillaries were placed on a clean microscope glass slide, and sealed on their ends with UV curable resine (LOON OUTDOORS UV CLEAR FLY FINISH).",

A commercial light emitting diode (\u03bb = 505 nm THORLABS) with a diffuser (ground glass N-BK7 600 grit, THORLABS), a condenser and an iris, to achieve K\u00f6hler illumination. Scattered light was picked up by the microscope objective (HCX PL APO 40x NA = 0.85, LEICA), and a tube lens (B&H), and detected by a digital camera (DCC1545M, IMAGING SOURCE) and acquired using commercial video recording software (IC CAP-TURE, IMAGING SOURCE). A heating beam was introduced on a separate optical path (see Fig.7 in Supplementary Information). A 1064 nm laser beam (YLR-10-1064-LP, IPG Photonics) was passed through a zero order half plate (WPH05M-1064 Thorlabs) and contracted using a custom Galilean telescope to achieve a \u223c 300 \u00b5m beam (see Supplementary Information) . The laser beam was introduced into the sample using a polarizing beam splitter (PBS CM1-PBS253 THORLABS) and its intensity at the sample was controlled by a combination of the electronic laser head controller and by adjusting the half-plate, and was measured using an optical power meter (PM100D power meter, with S175C sensor, THORLABS). In order to eliminate laser intensity before the camera, stained glasses (FGS900S, THORLABS) were stacked after the objective. For the thermo-capillary swimmers presented, the temperature gradient is given by the temperature profile around the hotter light absorbing particle when it is exposed to radiation \u2207T = \u2212 P0 4\u03c0\u03bawR 2\u00ear , where P 0 is the heating power at the particle, and R the distance from its center, along the radial direction\u00ea r . The power absorbed by the particle is given by P 0 = \u03c3J, where J is the flux and \u03c3 the particle's absorption cross section (see section 1.3 for measurement of \u03c3). As on the length scale of the swimmers, heat transport is dominated by high thermal diffusivity, the temperature profile is assumed to move with the swimmer. Since the droplet is intimately bound to the particle, we approximate the temperature gradient to be constant with its value at the center of the droplet, allowing us to use Eq.1. To quantitatively verify that indeed this is the correct swimming mechanism, we directly measured the thermo-capillary coefficient, \u03b2 (see section 1.2), and use literature data for the thermal conductivies and viscosities of the different swimmers species (see Table 1 ). The swimmer's proximity to the wall, \u03b4 \u2248 0.2 nm (estimated from its gravitational height), leads to enhanced drag, estimated to increase by a factor of 8 15 log D 2\u03b4 for a sphere moving along a solid wall in Stokes flow 32 .",

Swimmer videos were preprocessed using ImageJ 49 , and the subsequent particle motion tracked and analyzed using Trackpy package on Python 50 . Fig.2a in the main text shows the Brownian (\u221d \u2206t 1 ) to ballistic (\u221d \u2206t 2 ) transition for increased flux. Swimming speed was independently measured by imposing their orientation using a custom built vector magnet made of 3 Helmholtz pairs, generating a constant homogenous magnetic field (\u223c 1mT) in the imaging plane. In the presence of a magnetic field, the swimmer maintains a fixed direction (see Fig.2d ), allowing extraction of the swimmers speed, v, by measuring displacement over time, which is found to be linear with flux (as shown in Fig.2b) and is expected by the model (Eq.1). Note that the swimming direction is not necessarily along the magnetic field as the dimmer orientation is decoupled from the magnetic dipole (for example see Fig.2d ). We find that the reorientation time of the swimmer is then \u03c4 \u2248 15 s, corresponding to a persistence length of up to 70 \u00b5m with a Peclet number P e \u2248 200 using the definition found in the literature 8 . As our microscope imaging is done from the top, with the laser introduced from the bottom (see Fig.7 ), swimmers are subjected to radiation pressure and swim on the ceiling of the capillary, explaining the small deviation from linearity at low fluxes in Fig.2b . We did however perform similar experiment on an inverted version of our apparatus (that is inverted imaging and laser introduced from above), finding similar swimmers dynamics.",
