            "text": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the leading causes of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis in human on consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked seafood. This study was aimed at isolating and characterizing the pathogenic and pandemic V. parahaemolyticus from oysters (n = 90) in coastal parts of West Bengal, India; their antibiotic resistance and potential for involvement in the food chain. During bacteriological culture, typical V. parahaemolyticus colony was recovered in 88.9% samples followed by presumptive identification in 71 (78.9%) samples by characteristic biochemical (K/A) test. All the presumptive isolates (n = 71) were confirmed by species specific Vp-toxR PCR assay. Of these, 10 (14.08%) were tdh + and none for the trh. Further, 5 (50%) of these tdh + isolates were found to carry the pandemic potential gene in PGS-PCR assay; however, none in GS-PCR. Majority (80%) of these pathogenic (tdh + ) isolates belonged to pandemic serovars (OUT: KUT; OUT: K24; O1: KUT; O1:K25; O10: KUT) and only 20% to non-pandemic serovars (OUT: K15; O9:K17). All the isolates (100%) exhibited resistance to cefpodoxime followed by ampicillin and cefotaxime (90%), ceftizoxime (60%), tetracycline (50%), ceftriaxone (40%), ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (10% each). Overall, the study findings suggested that 11.1% (10/90) of commonly marketed oysters in this area were harbouring pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. Moreover, 5.5% (5/90) of the oyster population were harbouring pandemic strains of this pathogen. Besides, the pathogenic isolates from oysters were exhibiting a considerable genetic relatedness (53 to 70%) to human clinical isolates in PFGE analysis that relates to a substantial public health risk. Further, their multidrug resistance added gravity to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a globally growing public health threat and this is a critical area of concern especially during the treatment of foodborne gastroenteritis.",

            "text": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a halophile of the genus Vibrio, has emerged globally as one of the leading enteric pathogens associated in food poisoning (toxin-infection), diarrhoea and gastroenteritis resulting from the consumption of raw or under cooked seafood (Nair et al. 2007; Nelapati et al. 2012; Letchumanan et al. 2014 ). Since early 1996, association of this organism in diarrhoeal cases has witnessed a dramatic increase in the incidence due to emergence and dominance of its unique and highly virulent pandemic O3:K6 serovar (Okuda et al. 1997; Matsumoto et al. 2000; Nair et al. 2007 ) which is responsible for 50 to 80% of enteric outbreaks in India (Nair et al. 2007; Chowdhury et al. 2013) . Still, it is one of the most predominant foodborne pathogens in countries where raw and semi cooked seafood are consumed (Nair et al. 2007 ). Thermostable direct haemolysin (TDH) and TDH-related haemolysin (TRH) are recognized to be the key virulence determinants of this pathogen and most of the clinical isolates produce either or both of these haemolysins (Tada et al. 1992; Letchumanan et al. 2014) . The burgeoning human population invited the growing demand of more food where the aquatic resource including seafood has been considered as a supplementary source of dietary protein. This trend allows the entry of a large number of foodborne pathogens including V. parahaemolyticus in food chain (Austin 2010) resulting the ingestion of contaminated raw or improperly cooked saline water fishes and shellfishes (Nelapati et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "In Indian context, most of the studies on this pathogen are mainly concerned with cases of clinical diarrhoea (Chowdhury et al. 2013; Pazhani et al. 2014 ) and very limited studies have been documented on occurrence of this pathogen in saline water fishes and shellfishes (Deepanjali et al. 2005; Anjay et al. 2014; Guin et al. 2019; Narayana et al. 2020) . In our past studies, the occurrence of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in crab and shrimp from coastal Odisha and West Bengal (Parthasarathy et al. 2016 ) and from fish and aquatic environments (Guin et al. 2019) were explored. However, the magnitude of occurrence of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in oyster in West Bengal, India is still remained unexplored. It is a growing issue in respect of increasing incidence of V. parahaemolyticus in clinical diarrhoea and gastroenteritis in global context particularly in developing countries including India where marine food source is adopted considerably as a staple alternate dietary protein source (Nair et al. 2007 ). Further, the recent appearance and dissemination of multiple antibiotic resistance documented among V. parahaemolyticus (Li et al. 2014; Letchumanan et al. 2015; Elmahdi et al. 2016; Ahmed et al. 2018; Narayana et al. 2020 ) is surely the most remarkable evolution and increasing concern. This draws attention to design the present study to understand the incidence of pathogenic and pandemic V. parahaemolyticus in oysters in coastal part of West Bengal, India as well as to know their potential for transmission to human via food chain by identifying their genetic relatedness with human isolates by PFGE. Also attempted for their antibiotic resistance status in respect to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the globally growing issue. Primarily, the generated data will be supportive to highlight the presence of this pathogen in oyster and to generate awareness to the consumers in this region and finally help the seafood industry to strive better by adopting the microbiological food safety measures as well as to facilitate to earn foreign exchange.",

            "text": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a significant foodborne pathogen and causes gastroenteritis through ingestion of contaminated raw or improperly cooked seafoods (Nair et al. 2007) . West Bengal, the eastern coastal state of India, is an important center to harvest marine fish and shellfishes. The present study findings revealed that a considerable population (11.1%; 10/90) of oyster in this area were harbouring major virulence gene (tdh + ) and have been posing a potential source of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. The present data was little higher than the earlier published works in Indian settings where tdh + was noted in 6.1% and 2.35% isolates in South West coastal region of India (Deepanjali et al. 2005; Narayanan et al. 2020) . This variation in frequency may be explained to differences in factors for geographical zones. Moreover, smaller sample size in this study may project for comparatively higher incidence. The observed data were also in support with the findings of previous studies (Hara-Kudo et al. 2003) where tdh + V. parahaemolyticus was recovered in average of 11% of oyster in Japan. The finding of trh, suggesting the rare possession of trh in population of V. parahaemolyticus from oyster in this area. Further, majority (80%) of the pathogenic (tdh + ) isolates belonged to the recognized pandemic serovars (OUT:KUT; OUT:K24; O1:KUT; O1:K25; O10:KUT) that are frequently reported in food borne outbreaks and gastroenteritis in different countries and only two isolates (20%) were of non-pandemic serovars (OUT:K15; O9:K17). Occurrence of pandemic serovars in oyster samples support the trend of prevalence of pandemic serovars in fish and aquatic environments in this area (Han et al. 2017; Guin et al. 2019 ) and placed the oysters as a potential source of this pathogen for causing food borne problems in the event of taking improperly cooked oysters and its products. Screening of the pathogenic (tdh + ) isolates (n = 10) for their pandemic potential revealed that in PGS-PCR assay, 50% (5/10) isolates were found to harbor the gene of pandemic potential; however, none in GS-PCR. On total sample basis, such pandemic isolates were distributed in 5.5% (10/90) of the oyster samples. The findings reflect the potential of oyster in this area for dissemination of pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus and the suitability of PGS-PCR for detecting pandemic strains in samples of saline water origin. The observed results were in concurrence to the findings of previous work by Okura et al. 2004 who concluded that the PGS-PCR assay may be used as a valuable molecular tool not only for detection of pandemic V. parahaemolyticus strains but also for the direct identification of this pathogen polluting the food and environmental samples. The present study findings also supported the observation of Narayanan et al. 2020 who recorded that 14 of 29 (tdh) + strains were positive in PGS-PCR whereas none in GS-PCR assay. The observed findings indicated that the oyster in this area as a potential source of pathogenic and pandemic V. parahaemolyticus as well as reflected the grade of public health hazard with consumption of improperly cooked oysters. The study reveals the existence of multidrug resistant V. parahaemolyticus in oysters and it was in accord to the findings of earlier published study conducted in Indian settings (Narayanan et al. 2020) . The antibiotic cefpodoxime is found to be totally resistant by the isolates. During last few years, frequent use of this antibiotic in treatment of clinical cases including diarrhoea may be the probable cause to acquire such degree of resistance by this pathogen. It was observed that 90% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin which is widely used in aquaculture production systems and the data was supported the earlier studies of Letchumanan et al. (2015) ; Elmahdi et al. (2016) . The findings anticipate the aberrant use of first-generation antibiotics including ampicillin for such growing resistance. Lower resistance was observed against the antibiotics viz. chloramphenicol, gentamicin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin and trimethoprim which is in accord to the earlier study (Letchumanan et al. 2015) . This could be attributed to infrequent use of these antibiotics in clinical cases as well as in aquaculture system. Interestingly, 90% of the isolates were found to be intermediately resistant to ciprofloxacin followed by 20 to 40% to ceftazidime, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, levofloxacin, tetracycline and ceftizoxime. It highlighted the trend of growing resistance of this pathogen against a group of antibiotics commonly used in clinical management in Indian context and the magnitude of public health burden in terms of medical cost and antibiotic resistance hazards in very near future.",

Further studies with wider sampling in this aspect may be more supportive to generalize the findings.",
