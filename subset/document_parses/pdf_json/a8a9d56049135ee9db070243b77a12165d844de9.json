Here, we present the essential components of the HSV-1, focusing on stunning symmetries on the capsid. However, little is known about how the symmetries are involved dynamically in the self-assembly process. We suggest small angle X-ray scattering as a suitable method to capture the dynamics of self-assembly. Furthermore, our understanding of the viruses can be expanded by using an integrative approach that combines heterogeneous types of data, thus promoting new diagnostic tools and a cure for viral infections.",

Interestingly, the capsids have icosahedral shape with diverse symmetries and are optimized for the delivery and protection of genetic materials [15] . The HSV-1 infection is generally categorized as having four stages: (1) invasion toward a target host cell, (2) replication of viral genes, (3) self-assembly of new HSV-1 components, and (4) release of the HSV-1 during lysis of the host cell [16] . Individual HSV-1 virions are assembled within diverse regions of the host cell. For example, the capsid is assembled in the nucleus, along with viral DNA packaging [16] [17] [18] [19] .

The three resulting forms of capsids (A-, B-, and C-capsids) correspond to empty capsids, The proteins enter the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex and begin to assemble into procapsids. c A spherical procapsid is completely assembled. d The scaffold proteins are expelled, and viral dsDNA is packaged into the procapsid via the portal. CVSCs assemble around the pentons, transforming the procapsid into a complete C-capsid scaffold-containing capsids, and DNA-containing capsids, respectively [22, 39] .

The pre-VP22a scaffold protein is known to bind with capsomeres and portals, acting as an architectural frame [17, 19, 42, 43] . Inside the nucleus, the portal recruits capsomeres as an initial setup point for the self-assembly of capsomeres into the procapsid [15, 16, 22, 44] . The resulting procapsid is a complete spherical shell of 161 capsomeres and an \"open\" portal ( Fig. 3) and is mechanically supported by the inner-scaffold proteins of pre-VP22a [17, 19, 42, 43] .

Adapted by permission from Nature Springer [9] During DNA packaging, pre-VP22a (inner-scaffold protein) is completely removed, coupled with the injection of the viral DNA through the portal [40] (Fig. 3) . The expulsion of the scaffold protein is reported to be potentially linked to a reduction of local pH inside the procapsid, due to negative charges of viral DNA [42, 46] . Twelve symmetric \u03b2-hairpins play an interesting role in regulating the entry of viral DNA into the procapsid. The \u03b2-hairpins are symmetrically localized around the entrance of the portal. Initially, the \u03b2-hairpins repel each other due to their strong positive surface charges, thereby creating a hole for the entry of the viral DNA (open portal, Fig. 3a) . Furthermore, the viral DNA is attracted to the portal entrance by electrostatic forces between the \u03b2-hairpins (positive charge) and the DNA (negative charge). Thus, the positive charges of the \u03b2-hairpins initiate the injection of the viral DNA into the inside of the procapsid.",

As detailed in a recent review from Khaykelson and Raviv [50] , SAXS is an excellent tool to follow the formation of these capsids due to the technique's high spatial and temporal resolution. The formation and melting of empty and loaded capsids of various viruses as a function of temperature, salt concentration, pH and other triggers have been successfully followed with SAXS.\"",

A new generation of the HSV-1 is self-assembled inside the host cell in a highly systematic manner and has four distinct layers: the envelope, tegument, capsid, and DNA. In this review, we described the self-assembly process of the HSV-1 capsid, mainly focusing on its symmetrical aspects. Stunning symmetries at multiple levels are shown in the capsid, but little is known about their dynamic roles in the life cycle of the HSV-1.",

So far, numerous experimental techniques have been applied to study many viruses. Among these techniques, SAXS provides valuable information on the physiological condition that underlies the self-assembly of the individual capsid components. Most importantly, the main technical innovation has been achieved by integrating into one comprehensive picture the structure, dynamics, and function of large biological macromolecular complexes. Through the integrative approach, we can accurately characterize the individual capsid components and their selfassembly processes, thus providing critical insight into the development of new diagnostic tools and the cure for viral infections of primary worldwide concern (e.g., HSV-1, COVID-19, HIV, Zika, and Dengue).",
