As the pandemic evolves, informed policy-making and strategic resource allocation relies on accurate forecasts. To predict the spread of the virus within US counties, we curated an array of county-level demographic and COVID-19-relevant health risk factors. In combination with the county-level case and death numbers curated by John Hopkins university, we developed a forecasting model using deep learning (DL). We implemented an autoencoder-based Seq2Seq model with gated recurrent units (GRUs) in the deep recurrent layers. We trained the model to predict future incident cases, deaths and the reproductive number, R. For most counties, it makes accurate predictions of new incident cases, deaths and R values, up to 30 days in the future. Our framework can also be used to predict other targets that are useful indices for policymaking, for example hospitalization or the occupancy of intensive care units. Our DL framework is publicly available on GitHub and can be adapted for other indices of the COVID-19 spread. We hope that our forecasts and model can help local governments in the continued ght against COVID-19.",

A variety of methodologies have been used to forecast the spread of COVID-19. Most have used traditional epidemiological models such as the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR), or Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) models. These models use ordinary differential equations and rely on assumptions such as the transmission characteristics of the virus. Machine learning and deep learning methods have also been used. They provide a complementary, data-driven approach that does not rely on epidemiological assumptions. The most important prerequisite for deep learning models is access to a large amount of data from which to learn. While deep learning models were limited by the availability of the data in the early months, the long-stretch of the pandemic worldwide has, unfortunately, provided ample data for more accurate modeling and longer-term forecast.",

The changes were based on \"baseline\" values reported from January -February 2020. We computed a single daily mobility score by averaging the percentage changes from ve categories (retail & recreation, grocery & pharmacy, parks, transit, workplaces) and the negative values of residential changes. All six categories showed highly signi cant correlations and are also signi cantly correlated with the mean daily mobility score. The daily mean mobility scores were missing in 24% of the days, for which we used the mean daily mobility scores of the previous scores. Mobility scores prior to February 15, 2020 were considered to be baseline, therefore set to 0%.",

Our Seq2Seq model (shown in Fig. 1 ), uses Gated Recurrent Units [GRUs, 5] in the RNN layers. The model is consisting of three parts: an encoder, an encoding vector (generated from the input sequence), and a decoder [4, 6 ]. Our Seq2Seq model takes 'm' days data as input and predicts COVID-19 cases for 'n' future days. The encoder generates a comprehensive aggregated representation of the input 'm' days of the sequence. Our encoder implementation is a stack of 'm' GRU units, where each unit accepts input features (i.e., COVID-19 daily cases, mobility and deaths, etc.) from a single day of the input sequence, aggregate the information, and propagates the aggregated information forward via hidden state h i to the next GRU unit in the sequence. The nal hidden state produced from the encoder represents the encoding of the entire input sequence. This vector aims to encapsulate the information for all input elements in order to help the decoder make accurate predictions. The generated encoding is provided as the initial hidden state input of the decoder. That means, h m+1 =s 1 in the Fig. 1 . The decoder predicts the output sequence taking 'Encoding of the input sequence' as input. It is a stack of 'n' GRU units where each unit (jth unit) predicts an output/prediction of COVID-19 cases (for the jth future day). Each GRU unit accepts a hidden state from the previous unit and produces an output as well as its own hidden state.",

Short input sequences, on the other hand, may not provide enough information for learning patterns and making accurate forecasts. To determine the optimum input sequences, we used HyperOpt to search the above hyperparameter spaces for three input sequence sizes: 60, 90 and 120 days of input data (cases, deaths, Google mobility, and R values). The model predicted outcomes for each day over the next 30 days. The optimum input sequence length was determined as the one that resulted in models with the lowest validation losses. Model training and forecast evaluation From the 3242 counties (or county-equivalents) in the US states and territories, 2780 had data on the input features we selected for modelling. We randomly split these counties into training (n = 1983, 71.3%), validation (n = 398, 14.3%) and test sets (n = 399, 14.4%). We used the training and validation sets for the hyperparameter search and for learning the model weights and biases. As Supplementary Fig. 1 shows, the input sequences were generated from the whole series of data on a N-day sliding window letting N be the best length of input days. For each county, day 1 was determined as the rst day when the rst case was reported in the county. Models were trained on stacks of input sequences with the xed optimum length N to predict the next 30 days of outcomes.",

Figure 3b plots the overall median AREs for each team over the four weeks ahead forecast. Table 1 lists additional evaluation metrics including both median RE and median ARE. The Wilcoxon ranksum test was used to compare our model's ARE with other models' ARE (see Table 1 ). Table 2 shows the ICC (2,1) between the predicated and actual cases for each models' forecast. Overall, these results showed that while all models were able to produce accurate forecasts that were in signi cant agreements with the actual observed values, there are still large prediction uncertainties in many counties, evidenced by the large RE and ARE medians (deviation from 0). The prediction uncertainties increase as the forecast interval increases (Fig. 3b) . Table 2 Interclass correlation coe cients (ICC(2,1)) between the predicated and actual cases for all models. Uncertainty in forecasting models is common as had been observed in in uenza epidemic and other serious outbreaks such as the Ebola, and Zika viruses [9] [10] [11] [12] . Many complex and unknown features contribute to virus spread, disease severity and mortality. It is also common to have many irregularities and unforeseen discrepancies in the reporting process and database curation, which adds additional noise to the data and poses challenges for accurate forecasting. While the factors that contributed to our forecast errors and uncertainties remain to be clari ed, including other local parameters, such as hospitalization and ICU saturation rates, and data from local nursing homes, may help to improve forecast accuracy for incident deaths. However, these data are not readily available for many counties. The COVID-19 pandemic continues in the US and throughout the world with substantial uncertainty in the next months due to the appearances of new strains and the logistics of vaccinating entire populations. Having data about these variables at the county level could improve forecasts in the future.",

However, case reporting is not uniform across entities. In the US, much of the information about cases is collected and collated at the level of the county or large municipalities, which then report to a state department of health, and which in turn report to national repositories. One entity may put a strong emphasis on testing individuals who present with symptoms, whereas another may have implemented a widespread asymptomatic surveillance policy. How and which cases are identi ed can be dramatically affected by such policy differences and testing strategies, which were largely in uenced by non-objective policy decisions and human interpretation during the course of the pandemic. In short, our machine learning model, as well as most other forecasting models of COVID-19, only learns to predict the reported cases (or deaths and other indices), which were likely biased with non-objective in uences that were not uniform across reporting entities.",
