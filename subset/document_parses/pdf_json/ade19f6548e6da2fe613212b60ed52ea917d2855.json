The main sources of air pollution in China were the coal consumption for living and production and the main pollutants were particulate matters and sulfur dioxide Hu et al. 2017 Hu et al. , 2015 Jing et al. 2016 ). Particulate pollution, as a representative of air pollution, has become one of the major problems limiting the sustainable development of urban and regional economy and posing adverse effect on human health since 2000 and the average annual concentration of inhalable particulate matter exceeded the national second-class standard in two-thirds of cities in China Gao et al. 2018) .With the popularity of the cars in Chinese families, the gasoline consumption has increased rapidly in recent years, and the pollution problems such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone have become increasingly noticeable. The sources of air pollution were complex and such man-made sources as industrial boilers and kilns, coal-fired power plants, industrial processes, dust, vehicle emissions, volatile sources, residents' living, agricultural sources were usually involved. The source analysis of the pollutants in the air has been one basic technology for the control of regional air pollution and it required the comprehensive application of multidisciplinary and multiple models (Cheng et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2018; Hu et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2020; Tian et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2017) .",

In the COVID-19 closure, several sources of the air pollution almost all stopped working, including gasoline burning vehicles, dust producing building sites, coal-fired factories, etc. The COVID-19 in China was quickly and effectively controlled.

All the units of the pollutants were \u00b5g/m 3 . Four periods were identified on the abscissa with different colors of lines. The pre-closure period was from December 19, 2019 to January 28, 2020, the closure period was from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020, the gradual resumption period was from February 22, 2020 to March 31, 2020 and the whole April was the post-closure period. In each figure, the 1-hour average concentrations of the corresponding pollutant at the nine intervals were listed. Of the five pollutants, the 1-hour average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 had no regular temporal distribution, while the other three pollutants changed with time in a day. The concentrations of the nitrogen dioxide turned lower from 2:00p.m. to 6:00p.m and higher both from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m and from 8:00p.m. to 10:00p.m. The distribution of the 1-hour average concentrations of the ozone was opposite to those of the nitrogen dioxide, which gradually increased from 6 a.m., peaked at about 4-6 p.m., and then gradually decreased. The distributions were consistent with many research conclusions (Girgzdiene et al. 2002; Lu et al. 2010; Mao et al. 2003; Notario et al. 2012) . The concentrations of the two pollutants fluctuated at diverse intervals. From the figure we can see that the concentrations of the ozone were mainly related to the light intensity and air temperature. When the concentrations of the ozone were low from night to morning, the concentrations of the nitrogen dioxide gradually increased, but when the concentrations of the ozone were high in the afternoon, the concentrations of the nitrogen dioxide decreased. Besides, the 1-hour average concentrations of the nitrogen dioxide were mainly affected by the flow of motor vehicles. The peak time of the commuting was 8:00-10:00a.m and 6:00-8:00p.m., and the concentrations of 1-hour-NO2 turned higher in the two intervals (Fig. 2) . The distribution of 1-hour average concentrations of the sulfur dioxide was similar with that of the ozone, it increased from 6 a.m., peaked at about 12a.m-2p.m., and then gradually decreased.
