            "text": "A high proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia require invasive mechanical ventilation for refractory hypoxaemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 1 Myocardial ischaemia/ injury and drug-induced electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (including repolarization disorders, arrhythmias, QT-interval prolongation) have been observed in up to three-quarters of these high-risk patients. [2] [3] [4] Consequently, reliable ECG monitoring is absolutely essential in this setting. This is particularly true for the QT interval, whose prolongation, frequently observed in COVID-19 patients, exposes them to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. 3, 4 However, it can be difficult to properly monitor the ECG of patients treated with prone positioning, a procedure widely adopted to improve outcomes and indicated for at least 16 h per day in case of moderate-to-severe ARDS. 5, 6 Although the general recommendations for ECG monitoring in ICU 7 apply to ARDS, the electrodes cannot be positioned where they are usually placed (i.e. on the torso) in the prone position, because it would lead to both pressure skin lesions and artefacts. The prone position imposes the placement of the frontal plane electrodes dorsally and the removal of the precordial electrodes (except, perhaps, lead V6 that might be kept in its usual position). Of note, precordial derivations are recommended to measure QT interval. 7 Unfortunately, due to the paucity of data regarding the reliability of ECGs recorded in the prone position, there is no guideline on how to monitor/interpret ECG data in ARDS patients in this position.",

Consecutive, intubated, and mechanically ventilated patients with COVID 19-associated ARDS, whose ECG was continuously monitored using a five-electrode monitoring system (Intellivue MX800, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) and for whom prone positioning was indicated, were included. The limb electrodes were placed according to the Mason-Likar configuration (Figure 1 ), as recommended. 7 Seven-lead ECGs (frontal plane leads and V6) were recorded with both a reference electrocardiograph (Cardiosoft, GE medical system, CT, USA) and with the bedside monitor (used for continuous ECG monitoring) just before and 5 min after positioning the patient in the prone position ( Figure 1 ). This short interval was chosen to minimize the delayed changes induced by prone positioning on both the lungs and the heart (e.g. recruitment of collapsed lung, improvement of ventilation/perfusion mismatch, decrease in right ventricle afterload) which could alter the ECG. In the prone position, ECGs were also recorded with frontal plane electrodes translated to the back; whenever possible the V6 electrode was left in place ( Figure 1 ). All ECGs were reviewed by both an intensivist physician and a cardiologist. Assessment of heart rate, QRS axis, RR, PR, and QRS intervals was based on an automated analysis of the ECG. Rhythm, QT intervals, ST segment deviation, Q wave, T wave, and U wave were assessed manually.",

More importantly, this derivation is recommended to properly assess the QT interval. 7 COVID-19 patients are at risk of prolonged QT intervals, even in the absence of antiviral drugs known to increase QT interval. 3, 4 In our survey, only one-third of the ICUs routinely monitored QT interval. Inadequate ECG monitoring in the prone position may lead to undetected QT-interval prolongation, which increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias. As cardiac arrest in the prone position is particularly difficult to manage, QT monitoring in these patients should be standardized and should include the systematic use of V6.",

            "text": "Shortening of QRS duration in the prone position is an interesting observation that has been previously reported in healthy participants. 8 An explanation could be that prone positioning induces a decrease in ventricular volume (due to the compression of the heart) that might decrease intraventricular conduction times. The reduction in ventricular volume during the prone position in patients with COVID-19 ARDS has been recently suggested using trans-oesophageal echocardiography. 10 The increase of PR duration in the prone position could be due to right atrial enlargement. These changes were not explained by a change in heart axis. Indeed, contrary to data in healthy subjects, 8 QRS axis was similar in the supine and prone positions, suggesting that the heart did not switch forward, probably because high positive end-expiratory pressure prevented this phenomenon.",

Since the clinical part of the study was conducted in a single centre, included a limited number of patients and a low proportion of female, the generalizability of these results might be limited. Therefore, larger and multicentric studies would be necessary to confirm our results. Another limitation is that we did not assess whether adequate ECG monitoring that includes V6 in the prone position would improve the detection of arrhythmias, ischaemia, and/or QT-interval prolongation. Future investigations are needed to answer this important question. It would be also interesting to evaluate whether change in QRS duration with position would be used as a non-invasive parameter of the effects of the prone position on heart volume.",
