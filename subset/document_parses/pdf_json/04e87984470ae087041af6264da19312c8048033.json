This measurement is based on the k-means clustering method and identifies proper samples for calculating the mean outbreak size and the outbreak probability. Then we systematically study the impact of different temporal correlations on high risk outbreaks over the original and differently shuffled counterparts of each network. We observe that, on the one hand, in the coinfection process, randomization of the sequence of the events increases the mean outbreak size of high risk cases. On the other hand, these correlations dont have a consistent effect on the independent infection dynamics, and can either decrease or increase this mean. While randomization of the daily pattern correlations has no significant effect on the size of outbreak in either of the coinfection or independent spreading cases. We also observer that an increase in the mean outbreak size doesn't always coincide with an increase in the outbreak probability; therefore we argue that merely considering the mean outbreak size of all realizations may lead us into misestimating the outbreak risks. Our results suggest that some sort of randomizing contacts in organization level of schools, events or hospitals might help to suppress the spreading dynamics while the risk of an outbreak is high.",

Mathematical models are well known methods, used in order to achieve better understanding and prediction of this phenomena [2, 19] . Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model [20] is one of the most basic and common models for describing and predicting the epidemics of the contagious diseases. This model and its variations have been developed to model patterns of spreading dynamics in different scenarios. For instance, some models discuss how considering contact networks of the host population can alter dynamics, e.g. epidemic threshold [7, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Some other works improved models by considering temporality of the contacts [22, 31, 36] and some studies focus on impact of some temporal correlations on spreading dynamics [17, 33] . Moreover, some models consider the case of coinfective diseases: when getting infected by one disease, alters the chance of getting infected by another one. They studied cooperative or competitive spreading dynamics in the mean field approximations and on complex networks with different topologies [4-6, 11, 12, 30, 32, 34, 35, 40] .",

To address * Corresponding author: fakhteh.ghanbarnejad@gmail.com these issues, we run the independent and coupled SIR model on three empirical temporal networks and their randomized counterparts. Our proposed measurement is based on the k-means clustering [1] and determines which samples to pick up and average in order to detect the impact of different correlations on outbreak size and probability of the outbreak, theses samples represent the high risk outbreaks.",

The three parameters r, p and q are our control parameters. Since the number of control parameters are relatively high, we set a specific value for r, for each temporal network, considering the frequency and distribution of its contacts, see Fig. 4 and Table I . As it is noted in [33] we notice the inactivity periods within each activity histogram. To examine the effects of each network's dynamics, we need to consider a recovery rate, low enough, which enables the infection to survive during the inactivity period. On the other hand, considering a very low recovery rate will decrease the speed of the spreading dynamic. It has been reported that in cases in which, the speed of the dynamic on the network (spreading) and the speed of the dynamic of the temporal network have a large difference, the effect of the spreading over the temporal will be the same as on its weighted aggregated counterpart [8] . Therefore, to capture the temporal effects, we consider the length of the valleys as an indicator of the suitable recovery rate, please see Fig. 4 . by considering the time-scale of valley's for both hospital and conference network which is approximately the size of 1000 steps(each step is 20 seconds), we assign r = 0.001. In the case of primary school the size of the valley is of the order of 5000 time steps (each step is 20 seconds) so we assign r = 0.0002. We also consider two cases for q, called cooperative and independent spreading as indicated in [33] . In the former situation, we set q = 1 so the probability of acquiring a second disease would be higher than the first one (the range of values for p are drastically lower than 1). And in the latter, we set q = p, so the spreading would be totally independent. The simulations run until the dynamics reach the stationary states, i.e. all of the agents will be in one of the blue or green states of Fig. 2 , while a temporal-periodical boundary condition is applied to the contact network. Our initial condition is set to a single randomly chosen FIG. 2. Different states in the SIR-SIR model [5] and the probabilities of switching between states.

However, as shown in [4] and [33] due to the branching effect of the coinfection dynamics, average won't be a good indicator of suchh epidemic behaviors. Moreover, this may not be specific to the situation of coinfection and due to finite size effect one can observe branches with somewhat similar results. The histograms in Fig. 3 , left panel and also in the supplementary material, show at least two branches, one formed around the 0 value (which may be cut out in our presentations) and the other, i.e. outbreak branch, formed around a higher value. This outbreak branch represents the high risk outbreak instances. Therefore instead of averaging the whole distribution, we only average over the outbreak branch, namely mean out break size (ab), and also look at another order parameter, namely outbreak probability (P ab ): the probability for a realization to land on the outbreak branch. In simple terms the first parameter indicates the pervasiveness of an outbreak, and the second implies how likely it is that an outbreak would occur. These parameters are mathematically defined in equations 1 and 2, where \u03c1 ab is the fraction of doubly infected agents, \u03c0(\u03c1 ab (p * )) is the distribution of \u03c1 ab for a specific p * value of the control parameter and integration over outbreak branch (OB), accounting for high risk outbreaks.",

It means that cooperation does not affect the process. Similarly, also in this scenario, dynamics lands on the lower branch. 3-Both diseases gaining a considerable growth. This type of dynamics ends up on the upper branch in Fig. 3 , left and middle panels. Now to address the issue of distinguishing the outbreak branch from the lower branch, we look at not only the ab infected ones, but also the a (or b as the dynamics is symmetrical) infected ones. Fig. 3 , right panel depicts these scenarios in 3 clusters: blue, green and red respectively. k-means clustering method provides us a systematic measure to classify these cases and find the red cluster, right panel, as counterpart of the upper branch in the left and middle panels. k-means clustering is a method of partitioning data into a specific number of clusters so that data points within the same cluster will have less distance from each other, compared to data points of other clusters.

This may be due to the fact that in the empirical networks with an underlying spatio-temporal structure, there exist a localized behavior, meaning that individuals will interact with the same group of people instead of exploring new people, therefore they keep the disease in close neighborhood during short periods of time. Additionally spatio-temporal structures will raise transitive relations, so the individual will have stronger clustering compared to randomized networks. For example, if an individual \"Sina\" is interacting with another individual \"Fakhteh\", and \"Fakhteh\" is interacting with \"Reza\", then the probability that \"Sina\" and \"Reza\" interact with each other in a short period of time, is higher than the average probability of interaction between two individuals, this is due to both spatio-temporal fea- tures of the network and the social relations among individuals. By destroying the event-event correlations the individuals will have a higher chance to interact with more people during a short period, therefore it leads to an increase in the size of a possible outbreak. Due to the stronger clustering in original networks, the pathogens can be trapped in an spatio-temporal structure. Since D family shuffling methods randomize these clusters, the trapping probability get reduced and two diseases can interact more often. Thus if they could meet, the fraction of doubly infected people would increase.",

Holme and Liljeros have performed a type of shuffling named Interevent Interval Neutralized (IIN) method, which sets a uniform time distribution to the activity of each edge, within its original first (birth) and last (death) appearance. By considering the average number of infected individuals during SIR spreading, they concluded that inter-event time distributions don't have a significant effect on the spreading, while the time of birth and death of a link are important. One should note that, SOU shuffling keeps the order of the events and redistributes the time intervals between all events while IIN method [15] redistributes the time intervals between the events of the same type. This means that IIN may lead to reordering of the events in small time durations; but these methods are of the same nature since they both keep the order of appearance of the edges and the activity clock [18] between birth and dead of a link intact, but they destroy the interevent time distributions.",

In another word, neighboring effects caused by the existence of smaller communities in temporal networks, decrease the chance of two diseases interacting with each other, so lack of interaction between two diseases for proper time can impact stronger the coinfection dynamics compared to the independent dynamics.",

The values for cross entropy with the original network for our shuffled networks can be seen in Fig. 6 . We observe that generally the dynamics have the closest behavior on the SOU shuffled networks in comparison to the original networks. Since the SOU shuffling keeps the order of events intact, we can conclude that for such dynamics the sequence of events has the most significant effect on the results.

The dynamics were SIR type and simulated on three different temporal empirical networks, as well as their several shuffled counterparts. Each of the shuffling methods preserved some temporal correlations and randomized others. For instance, we introduced SOU shuffling which keeps the ordering of the events intact while randomizing the frequency of the events. We argued that in order to see the impact of any temporal correlation we need to investigate properly two order parameters: the probability of outbreak (P ab ) and the outbreak size (ab) as macroscopic observables. Moreover, since in so many cases a simple ensemble averaging may lead to misinterpretation, therefore, we introduced a systematic measurement to identify the proper samples which represent the high risk outbreaks, for calculating these two order parameters. This measurement is based on the k-means clustering method. Furthermore, we introduced another alternative method, namely KullbackLeibler divergence which calculates the difference between distributions of ab for shuffled and original networks. While k-means clustering identifies the proper samples and then takes an average over them, KullbackLeibler divergence computes the discrepancy between two histogram cell by cell and then takes an average; We showed that both measurements, agree on which shuffling has dominant impact on which network.",

In the coinfection process, randomization of the sequence of the events makes the outbreak more pervasive, i.e. ab decreases. On the other hand, these correlations don't have a consistent effect on the independent infection dynamics, and can either decrease or increase the outbreak size. This point indicates that the ordering of the events and spatio-temporal features have a greater effect on coinfection. In both independent infection and coinfection, daily patterns have no significant effect on the outbreak size, but they can change the probability of outbreaks for various networks. The last but not the least, in order to understand the impact of temporal correlations on spreading phenomena, not only the proper order parameter and proper averaging matters, but also the dependency on the range of the control parameter matters.",
