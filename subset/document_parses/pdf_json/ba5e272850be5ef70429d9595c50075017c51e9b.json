Since 2007, the Spanish National Immunization Program includes HPV vaccination, and currently it only targets 12-year-old girls. The objective of our study is to assess differences in the knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine acceptability according to different factors, and to identify the role of different sources of information. A cross-sectional, multicenter survey research was carried out in twenty-four pediatric offices in Spain, and included parents of children aged 9 to 14 years old. 1,405 valid survey-responses were considered for the analysis. Parental awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine, as well as vaccine acceptability, are still strongly associated with child gender (girls) and age (12-14 years old). HPV knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptability are related to parental gender, HPV vaccination status and having at least one daughter. Parents who consulted a healthcare source to obtain further information about HPV had greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge and acceptability. HPV and HPV vaccine awareness and acceptability are strongly associated with child gender and age, which correlates with the current immunization program.",

            "text": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections: it is estimated that between 75% and 80% of sexually active individuals will come into contact with the virus. 1 Although most infections are cleared by the immune system within a few months, about 5%-10% of them may persist. 2 The persistence of HPV infection can cause diseases such as genital warts, precancerous lesions, and certain cancers such as cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile and head and neck cancers. 3 The prevention of HPV infections through vaccination is the most promising and efficacious strategy against such a common sexually transmitted infection. 2 Currently, there are three vaccines available in Spain: the tetravalent and the bivalent vaccine that are available since 2007, and the nonavalent vaccine that is available since 2017. 4 In Spain, the National Immunization Program (NIP) commenced in 2007 and currently targets only 12-year-old girls. According to the latest data available, the average vaccination coverage rate in girls in 2019 was 79.0% for the 2-dose schedule. 5 However, since 2018, the Spanish Association of Pediatricians (AEP) recommends HPV vaccination for boys and girls at the age of 12 years, although vaccination for boys is not funded yet. 6 Over these years, the Spanish studies that evaluated knowledge of HPV, vaccine acceptability and drivers of HPV vaccination had focused exclusively on female or adult populations and were performed in specific regions across Spain, not being representative of the entire country. [7] [8] [9] Therefore, in 2019-2020, we conducted the KAPPAS study: Knowledge and Acceptability of Papillomavirus Vaccines in Parents of Adolescents in Spain. It is the first national, cross-sectional, multicenter survey research to assess HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability among the parents of adolescents in Spain. 10 Recruitment and analysis performed in this study, offer an innovative approach to obtain relevant insights about current HPV vaccination knowledge and acceptability that will be also useful for a future implementation for a gender-neutral vaccination program in the country.",

            "text": "Recommendations on HPV vaccination are widespread across the WHO (World Health Organization) European Region, and the number of countries that have introduced gender-neutral vaccination (GNV) programs, targeting girls and boys, has increased in recent years. 11 A recent targeted literature review highlights that 28% of WHO European countries were providing fully-or partially funded HPV vaccination programs for both genders, girls and boys, by 2018-2019. 9 In those countries where HPV GNV programs have been implemented, vaccine coverage rates reach similar percentages among boys and girls. 12 The factors associated with HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability in adolescents and their parents in countries where HPV vaccine is licensed had been studied in the literature. [13] [14] [15] According to a previous systematic literature review that examined seventy non-interventional studies conducted in 16 European countries, the main factors associated with HPV knowledge were female gender, higher education and higher-income group. 13 The factors associated with HPV vaccine acceptability were female gender and younger age of the responding parents, female gender of the child, having received previous vaccinations during the childhood and previous confidence in vaccine efficacy. 13 In addition, other publications found significant correlations between an increased acceptability of HPV vaccine and the improvement of awareness and knowledge of HPV infection and vaccination. 16 Despite all the previous studies, vaccination coverage rates are still suboptimal, and a deeper understanding of factors influencing parental HPV vaccination knowledge and acceptability is critical to ensure the successful implementation of HPV vaccination programs. [17] [18] [19] [20] Moreover, vaccine misinformation and infodemia are increasing threats during the SARS-CoV2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. 21, 22 The WHO recently published a guide on misinformation management which also underscores the importance of promoting informed health decisions based on accurate and scientific information. 23 Information sources are a critical factor to overcome these threats and few studies have assessing their impact among parents of adolescents for HPV vaccination. 24, 25 The results of the primary objective of the KAPPAS, assessing HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability in general, are subject of a separate publication and have been already presented elsewhere. 8 Here, we address the results of the secondary objectives of the KAPPAS study, focused on assessing the factors influencing HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability in parents of adolescent children.",

HPV vaccine awareness is greater among parents with children who match the profile currently funded by the NIP. In line with our findings, previous research showed that the acceptability of HPV vaccination among the male population was diminished by a lack of awareness and knowledge and a general perception of lower benefits of HPV vaccination for males. 26 Furthermore, an association was found between HPV knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptability and parent gender, which was higher among mothers than fathers. These results are in line with the findings of Mortensen et al., 2015, who described that one of the main variables related to HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability is parent gender. 27 Nevertheless, it is important to mention that the percentage of fathers who answered the KAPPAS survey was 13.81%, which constitutes a small sample size.",

The association between health literacy skills and vaccine acceptability has been shown to be uneven when general measures are used, and also depends on population characteristics and the type of vaccine in question. Vaccine literacy has been constructed upon the same idea of health literacy, although very few specific measuring tools have been developed hitherto. More of these instruments need to be validated and used extensively with the ultimate aim of assessing vaccine literacy skills and defining interventions geared toward improving them. 35 With regard to HPV-related information, and in line with the findings reported in the literature, 36 our results showed that the degree of knowledge of HPV and the acceptability of the HPV vaccine tended to increase slightly as the number of sources consulted increased.",

Facilitating HCP-initiated discussions and providing clear information about HPV vaccines is key to increasing vaccine acceptability among boys as well. 26 Johnson et al. reported that providing a recommendation for vaccination was the strongest predictor of vaccination in both genders. 37 The Internet also plays a very important role in conveying information about HPV and HPV vaccine. It was one of the most common sources of information and was associated with greater knowledge, although this did not translate into higher HPV vaccine acceptability. These findings were similar to those reported by McRee et al. 38 These results highlight the importance of the specific online sources consulted, since Moran et al. emphasized that anti-vaccine websites contain a considerable amount of misinformation. 33 In this regard, targeted, balanced and high-quality information should be provided to the relevant population through the appropriate channels that help to improve the acceptability of HPV vaccination and to achieve the goal of eliminating HPV-related diseases.",

Currently, there is solid evidence about the role of HPV in other diseases besides cervical cancer: genital warts, precancerous lesions and anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers 39 Implementing GNV programs seeks not only to protect the male population from the burden of HPV, but also to contribute to extend herd protection to unvaccinated women and also mitigate the impact of an unexpected potential reduction in coverage. 40 Therefore, HPV vaccination in both genders would contribute to the resilience of the vaccination programs, which is key to reach the elimination of HPVrelated diseases. 39, 40 In addition, training HCPs and improving the quality of the information available on the Internet or alternative channels are key to increasing HPV vaccine uptake.",

Firstly, parent-reported information is subjective and may be affected by social desirability, inaccuracy or mistakes. In addition, multiple testing can lead to spurious relationships showing statistically significant results. Nevertheless, the high consistency of results among bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis is a proof of its robustness. It also should be remembered that individual healthcare professional attitudes may influence parents' perceptions in terms of knowledge of HPV and acceptability of HPV vaccine. In addition, some predictor factors of HPV vaccine knowledge and acceptability could be missing in the survey. However, this risk is very limited, due to the performance of a previous systematic literature review that was used for the development of the survey. In addition, some factors like income level of families, can be extrapolated by the answers provided to other questions such as employment status and level of studies.",

Our study highlights the role of HCPs as a source of information, meaning that parents who had learnt about the HPV vaccine when consulting a healthcare source had greater HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge and acceptability, thereby helping to achieve and maintain high coverage rates and to reach the elimination of HPV-related diseases.",
