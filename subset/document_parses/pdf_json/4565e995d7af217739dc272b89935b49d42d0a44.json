These approaches work by bringing multi-sectoral stakeholders together to develop a collective understanding of the system, and then to identify places where they can leverage change across the system.

Evaluating such approaches is difficult and new methods are warranted.",

The REM outputs from our example were created over several iterations, with data collected every 3-4 months, to build a picture of activities and impacts that have continued or ceased. Workshops took place both in person and online. An inductive content analysis was undertaken to describe and quantify the patterns within the REM outputs.

Systems approaches require the input and expertise from stakeholders working across various sectors and the community, to develop a shared understanding about the complexity of a problem and the surrounding context, and in turn, disrupt the system to change how it functions [12, 13] . These approaches often work in unpredictable ways, where cause-and-effect cannot always be disentangled, and where unintended consequences -positive and negative -frequently arise [8, 14] . They are somewhat impossible for stakeholders to control, and instead, proponents are encouraged to be agile; working with the system and adapting their approach accordingly -what Donella Meadows refers to as \"dancing with systems\" [15] . However, whilst the implementation of systems approaches has gained traction, the methods and mechanisms to study them are limited [5, 6, 8, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Egan and colleagues [5, 16, 17] summarised the methods which have been applied previously that take a systems perspective, identifying six: 1) applying systems thinking to qualitative inquiry; 2) systems mapping to understand the factors which may influence an outcome and / or an intervention; 3) network analysis to determine the relationships between people involved in the system; 4) systems dynamics modelling to examine how the system may respond over time to the hypothetical introduction of a intervention; 5) agent based modelling which simulate the response of a group of agents to the introduction of an intervention; and 6) uncategorised 'systems friendly' approaches. Similarly, the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) have provided guidance on how to evaluate complex interventions [1, [21] [22] [23] [24] , and how to evaluate complex interventions within complex social systems [1, 3, 21] . The methods proposed in these MRC documents are largely akin to those of the SPHR guidance. On the whole, these methods focus on either the relationships between stakeholders in a system, or the prospective modelling of how the system works or may respond to a hypothetical intervention. Whilst these guidelines offer a useful starting point for planning how to evaluate an intervention using a systems perspective, both documents (SPHR and MRC) call for new and innovative evaluation approaches [1, 5, 16, 17, 21] .",

Unlike traditional evaluation designs that orientate themselves around studying attribution (e.g., Randomised Controlled Trials), REM is concerned with the study of contribution; how may an intervention, action or policy contribute towards changing an outcome or a system? It takes the form of a participatory qualitative impact evaluation, involving stakeholders who are engaged in, or are affected by, the intervention (e.g., delivery staff, commissioners, intervention designers etc.\u2026). Stakeholders take part in a series of workshops to visualise the impacts of the intervention, and how these impacts may go beyond those which the intervention was designed to achieve [25] . For example, Fig. 1 demonstrates that a simple intervention such as cycling proficiency training may lead to impacts that go beyond increasing an individual's confidence in their ability to cycle. These wider outcomes can demonstrate the additional value of an intervention. It can also highlight how an intervention may adapt in response to the system that it is situated within (or the context within the system), which often leads to unintended consequences, both positive and negative.",

In their book, \"A Field Guide to Ripple Effects Mapping\", Chazdon et al. [25] explain its underlying principles and present several approaches to applying REM (Table 1) . REM is underpinned by four key principles, first, that it draws upon the concept of appreciative inquiry [29] , second, that it takes a participatory approach, third, that it uses interactive group interviewing and reflection, and fourth, that it uses mind mapping to visualise the impacts. Given the increasing focus being placed on complex adaptive systems and systems approaches, in this paper we explain how REM has been adapted to help evaluate a systems approach to physical activity in Gloucestershire (a large county in South-West England). Based on our experience of using the method, we believe that REM will be useful in helping researchers and practitioners to explore the nonlinear, unpredictable and dynamic aspects of systems approaches, whilst accounting for the emergent and adaptive nature of the complex system in which they are positioned.",

Through the impact pathway, we can see that these stakeholders met with local politicians to secure funding for the course, which in turn led to a course being co-designed by the stakeholder group. This cycling course was promoted locally, predominantly via word of mouth within the community, and was subsequently fully subscribed. A local school offered their outdoor playground as a space to deliver the course. This course was deemed successful by the stakeholders as it demonstrated a local demand for cycling amongst women in the community. Further courses were organised and conversations were held with a national cycling charity, local community organisations, and cycling coaches to create a sustainable delivery model for future cycle training courses.

We identified that over 30 organisations were either involved in or affected by the project during the evaluation period, and almost 250 women were known to have participated in one or more of the initiatives being delivered. We grouped the mechanisms leading to impact into three themes: a) the role of the steering group; b) the role of Active Gloucestershire; and c) enabling factors which contributed to the observed impacts. Lastly, we identified three themes when estimating the timelines around impact, the time taken to: a) plan and deliver discrete initiatives; b) engage stakeholders; and c) change local infrastructure. Analysis of the most-and least-significant impacts could also be presented here (in the WCM evaluation, we did not systematically record this information as it was viewed as a reflective activity rather than an evaluative one).

It has also been a beneficial tool to understand some of the mechanisms -and chains of events -that might explain why an intervention produces the impact(s) that it does. Moreover, in light of the interdependency between many complex issues -e.g., obesity, undernutrition and climate change [11] -REM provides an opportunity to identify double or triple duty actions; that is, where a single action impacts upon more than one issue simultaneously [1, 11] .

These adaptations included the: 1) addition of a temporal dimension through a timeline; 2) identification of impact pathways; 3) emphasis on follow up workshops; 4) ability to deliver REM online; and 5) viewing REM as a prospective as well as a retrospective method. The latter is particularly noteworthy. The REM workshops, as described, encouraged participants to map out the activities and impacts that they anticipated will occur in the coming months. These anticipated activities and impacts can then be revisited in future REM workshops. This is important for two reasons. First, it enables evaluators and involved parties to examine the alignment between the intended impact pathways and the actual manifest impact pathways. When working within complex systems, interventions cause the system to change and adapt, often in unpredictable ways. Other contextual factors may also cause the system to adapt (e.g., wider policy implementation, changes in local and national governments, infectious disease outbreaks etc..). The REM output can be used to illustrate changes to the system, and therefore help to explain how and why the trajectory of the intervention differed from that which was planned. Second, the prospective mapping further embeds appreciative inquiry into the method. In the method described by Chazdon et al. [25] , REM is predominantly viewed as a means of discovering what has occurred within a programme. Our prospective mapping encouraged participants to envision the future of the intervention and its associated impacts -aligned with the dreaming phase of appreciative inquiry [29] . This is particularly important when implementing a systems approach as it enables stakeholders, who may represent different sectors of the system, to clarify and align their thinking around the intervention. Doing so may help to create momentum towards the desired future state [25] .",

Similarly, when intervening in a complex system in ways that does not always lead to tangible change, REM is able to demonstrate softer impacts such as mindset shifts in organisational leaders, the setting up of infrastructure to support a systems approach, or the development of a stakeholder network [34] .

We used the REM outputs in the interviews to gather their perspectives on the aspect of the intervention that they had been involved in or affected by.

Second, mapping all the ripple effects of a systems approach is unlikely to be feasible. It should not be the intention of the method to try and capture all associated activities and impacts, but rather to capture a range of impacts to demonstrate a balanced view of the work being undertaken or fall within pre-defined boundaries of the evaluation. Last, from our experience, REM seemed to work better for projects that are openended and highly adaptable rather than rigidly and / or prescriptively defined (i.e., transactional projects). Whilst we did see some value in applying the method to transactional projects, and indeed some of these projects do adapt due to contextual factors, REM was more valuable for evaluating the aspects of WCM that evolved over time, often born out of conversations and relationships between stakeholders. Systematic evaluation of REM as a method, which would gather the perspectives of participants from various stakeholder groups, is warranted in the future to better understand its strengths and limitations.",

We therefore invite other researchers, practitioners and policymakers to use REM and to continuously evolve the method to enhance its application and practical utility. ",
