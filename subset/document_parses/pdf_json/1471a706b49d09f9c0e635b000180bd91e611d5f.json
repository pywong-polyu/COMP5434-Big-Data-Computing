            "text": "Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel humaninfecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from nextgeneration sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homologybased algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotideresolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All methods presented here are implemented as easyto-install packages not only enabling analysis of NGS datasets without requiring any deep learning skills, but also allowing advanced users to easily train and explain new models for genomics.",

            "text": "Within a globally interconnected and densely populated world, pathogens can spread more easily than they ever had before. As the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses have shown, the risks posed even by these previously known agents remain unpredictable and their expansion hard to control (1) . What is more, it is almost certain that more unknown pathogen species and strains are yet to be discovered, given their constant, extremely fast-paced evolution and unexplored biodiversity, as well as increasing human exposure (2, 3) . Some of those novel pathogens may cause epidemics (similar to the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks in 2002 and 2012) or even pandemics (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 and the 'swine flu' H1N1/09 strain). Many have more than one host or vector, which makes assessing and predicting the risks even more difficult. For example, Ebola has its natural reservoir most likely in fruit bats (4) , but causes deadly epidemics in both humans and chimpanzees. As the state-of-the art approach for the open-view detection of pathogens is genome sequencing (5, 6) , it is crucial to develop automated pipelines for characterizing the infectious potential of currently unidentifiable sequences. In practice, clinical samples are dominated by host reads and contaminants, with often less than a hundred reads of the pathogenic virus (7) . Metagenomic assembly is challenging, especially in time-critical applications. This creates a need for read-based approaches complementing or substituting assembly where needed.",

A selection of composition-based and alignment-based approaches has been presented in an extensive review by Edwards et al. (13) . Prediction of eukariotic host tropism (including humans) based on known protein sequences was shown for the influenza A virus (14) . Support-vector machines based on word2vec representations were shown to outperform homology searches with BLAST and HMMs in the same task, but lost their advantage when applied to nucleic acid sequences directly (15) . Two recent studies employ k-mer based, k-NN classifiers (16) , and deep learning (17) to predict host range for a small set of three well-studied species directly from viral sequences. While those approaches are limited to those particular species and do not scale to viral host-range prediction in general, the Host Taxon Predictor (HTP) (18) uses logistic regression and supports vector machines to predict if a novel virus infects bacteria, plants, vertebrates or arthropods. Yet, the authors argue that it is not possible to use HTP in a read-based manner; it requires long sequences of at least 3000 nucleotides. This is incompatible with modern metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflows, where the DNA reads obtained are at least 10-20 times shorter. Another study used gradient boosting machines to predict reservoir hosts and transmission via arthropod vectors for known human-infecting viruses (19) .",

Convolutional filters can be visualized by forwardpassing multiple sequences through the network and extracting the most-activating subsequences (25) to create a position weight matrix (PWM) that can be visualized as a sequence logo (36, 37) . Direct optimization of input sequences is problematic, as it results in generating a dense matrix even though the input sequences are one-hot encoded (38, 39) . This problem can be alleviated with Integrated Gradients (40, 41) or DeepLIFT, which propagates activation differences relative to a selected reference back to the input, reducing the computational overhead of obtaining accurate gradients (42) . If the bias terms are zero and a reference of all-zeros is used, the method is analogous to Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (43) . DeepLIFT is an additive feature attribution method, and may used to approximate Shapley values if the input features are independent (44) . TF-MoDISco (45) uses DeepLIFT to discover consolidated, biologically meaningful DNA motifs (transcription factor binding sites).",

We show that defining the negative (nonhuman) class is nontrivial and compare different ways of constructing the training set. Strikingly, a model trained to distinguish between viruses infecting humans and viruses infecting other chordates (a phylum of animals including vertebrates) generalizes well to evolutionarily distant nonhuman hosts, including even bacteria. This suggests that the host-related signal is strong and the learned decision boundary separates human viruses from other DNA sequences surprisingly well.",

(20) , we filtered out viroids and satellites, which are classified as subviral agents and not bona fide viruses (50, 51) . Note that even though they require helper viruses for replication, this step did not affect ubiquitous adeno-associated viruses and large virophages, which are well established within the viral taxonomy in the families Parvoviridae and Lavidaviridae, respectively. Humaninfecting viruses were extracted by searching for records containing 'Homo sapiens' in the 'host name' field. Note that VHDB contains information about multiple possible hosts for a given virus where appropriate.

This offers an open-view approach covering a wider part of the sequence space, but may lead to misclassification of potentially dangerous mammalian or avian viruses. As they are often involved in clinically relevant host-switching events, a stricter approach must also be considered. In this case, the negative class comprises only viruses infecting Chordata (a group containing vertebrates and closely related taxa). Two intermediate approaches consider all eukaryotic viruses (including plant and fungi viruses) or only animal-infecting viruses.

If a given viral isolate clusters with a known group of isolates, it is considered to be the same virus; if it does not, it may be assigned a distinct name and considered novel (55) . This is separate from its putative taxonomical assignment. Assigning a novel virus to a novel or a previously established species is performed pursuing a wider set of criteria, and the criteria for delineating distinct species differ between viral families (50, 51, 55, 56) . In most cases, species are perceived as human constructs rather than biological entities and host range often is explicitly one of the defining features (55, 57) , rendering reasoning based on cross-species homology searches inherently difficult.",

At the same time, redundancy below this level (i.e. multiple instances of the same virus) must be eliminated from the dataset to ensure reliability of the trained classifier. VHDB tackles this problem by collecting and annotating reference genomes--each virus in the database is a separate entity with its own ID in NCBI Taxonomy. This virus-level approach was previously used by Zhang et al. (20) .

To assess our approach in this stricter setup, we re-divided the VHDB dataset into training, validation and test sets ensuring that all viruses of a given species were assigned to only one of those subsets. This effectively models a 'novel species' scenario while also reflecting within-species phenotype diversity. We recreated the species-wide versions of the 'All' and 'Chordata' datasets by assigning 80%, 10% and 10% of the species to the training, validation and test datasets, respectively.

We ran predictions on contigs without any size filtering with both k-NN and BLAST (Table 2) . We present performance mea- sures for both individual contigs and whole genome predictions based on contig-wise majority vote.

Classifying novel viral species when restricted to Chordata-infecting viruses is too challenging for practical purposes (Supplementary Table S3 ). Read-wise predictions are not much better than random guesses for both Table 4 . Classification performance, novel species. Top: paired reads (see Table 1 ). BLAST yields predictions for only 64.3% of the pairs. Bottom: whole available genomes or contigs -negative class is the majority class (see Table 2 ). BAcc. -balanced accuracy (equal to accuracy for the balanced paired-read dataset), Rec. -recall, Spec. -specificity. BLAST (reads) and our networks use read-wise majority vote or output averaging to aggregate predictions over all reads from a genome. BLAST (genome) uses contigwise majority vote. BLAST (contigs) represents performance on individual contigs treated as separate entities. Note that low precision is heavily affected by class imbalance BLAST and CNNs. Low precision of BLAST shows that it often recovers wrong labels even when it does find a match--sequence similarity is not a reliable predictor of the infectious potential in this setting. Even if a whole genome is available, overall accuracy is low. This looks very differently in the fully open view scenario ( Table 4 ). The CNN trained on the species-wise division of the 'All' dataset (CNN SP-All ) outperforms BLAST by a wide margin in the read-wise setting. Strikingly, CNN SP-All predictions based on a single read pair achieve higher accuracy than BLAST predictions using whole genomes, mainly due to their significantly higher recall. What is more, pooling predictions from all the reads originating from a given genome does not improve overall CNN SP-All accuracy any further. As CNN SP-All does not reliably outperform its Chordata-trained analog on the 'Chordata' dataset (CNN SP-Cho , Supplementary Table S3), we suspect that its relatively high accuracy on the 'All' dataset is caused by its high sensitivity while maintaining good specificity on non-Chordata viruses. However, classification accuracy is still noticeably lower than for the virus-level classification scenario. The virus-level models are not optimized for entirely novel species, effectively treating them as out-of-distribution samples. This suggests that they might overfit to (potentially new) viruses of known species. Therefore, all predictions for novel agents, whether based on machine learning or sequence homology, must be handled with caution.",

Therefore, an overwhelming majority of its maximum activations are in fact padding artifacts. On the other hand, regions of unambiguous nucleotide sequences result in high positive contributions, since they correspond to a lack of filter activation, where an activation is present for the all-N reference. In fact, for over 99.9% of the reads, positive contributions occur at every single position. We suspect that the filter works as an 'ambiguity detector'. Since Ns are modeled as all-zero vectors in the one-hot encoding scheme used here, the network represents 'meaningful' (i.e. unambiguous) regions of the input as a missing activation of the filter. This is supported by the fact that the filter lacks any further preference for the specific nonzero nucleotide type. Since sequence logos presented here ignore ambiguous (i.e. noninformative) nucleotides, their ICs for this filter are near-zero, preventing meaningful visualization. On the other hand, this ambiguity seems to play a role in the final classification decision, as contribution distributions are well-separated for both classes (Supplementary Figure S2) . We speculate that this could be caused by lower quality of the nonpathogen reference genomes, but understanding how exactly this information is used would require further investigation, including feature interactions at all layers of the network. Importantly, only the contribution analysis reveals the relevance of the filter beyond simple activation and nucleotide over-representation. The choice of the reference input is crucial.",

All nucleotides of the filters with the second-highest ( Figure 1A ) and the lowest ( Figure 1B ) score have relatively strong contributions in accordance with the filters' own contributions. However, we observe that some nucleotides consistently appear in the activating subsequences, but the sign of their contributions is opposite to the filter's (low-IC nucleotides of a different color, Figure 1C ). Those 'countercontributions' may arise if a nucleotide with a negative weight forms a frequent motif with others with positive weights strong enough to activate the filter. We comment on this fact in 'Nucleotide contribution logos' section. Some filters seem to learn gapped motifs resembling a codon structure ( Figure 1C ). We extracted this filter from the original DeePaC network predicting bacterial pathogenicity (24) where the counter-contributions are common, but we find similar filters in our networks as well ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). We scanned a genome of S. aureus subsp. aureus 21200 (RefSeq assembly accession: GCF 000221825.1) with this filter and discovered that the learned motif is indeed significantly enriched in coding sequences (Fisher exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, q < 10 \u221215 ). It is also enriched in a number of specific genes. The one with the most hits (sraP, q < 10 \u221215 ) is a serine-rich adhesin involved in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and mediating binding to human platelets (65) . The filter seems to detect serine and glycine repeats in this particular gene (Supplementary Figure S5 ), but a broader, cross-species, multi-gene analysis would be required to fully understand its activation patterns.

            "text": "We ran a similar analysis of S. aureus using the builtin DeePaC models (24) and our interpretation workflow. While a viral genome contains usually only a handful of genes, by compiling a ranking of 870 annotated genes of the analyzed S. aureus strain we could test if the high-ranking regions are indeed associated with pathogenicity (Supplementary Table S4 ). Indeed, out of three top-ranking genes with known biological names and Gene Ontology terms, sarR and sspB, are directly engaged in virulence, while hupB regulates expression of virulence-involved genes in many pathogens (66) . In contrast to the viral models, both negative and positive contributions are present (Supplementary Figure S6 ), and the model's output for the all-N reference is slightly above the decision threshold (0.58). Even though the network architecture of the viral and the bacterial model are the same, the latter learns a 'two-sided' view of the data. We assume this must be a feature of the dataset itself. Figure 2B presents a GWPA plot for the whole genome of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, successfully predicted to infect humans, even though the data were collected at least 5 months before its emergence. Interestingly, its mean infectious potential (0.57 as scored by CNN All ) is relatively close to the decision threshold, while its closest known relative, a bat-infecting SARSr-CoV RaTG13, is actually falsely classified as a human virus with a slightly lower mean infectious potential (0.55). What is more, the gene encoding the spike protein, which plays a significant role in host entry (67), has a mean score slightly above the threshold for SARS-CoV-2 (0.52) and below the threshold for RaTG13 (0.49). As shown in the GWPA plots of both viruses (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S4) , regions that the network has learned to associate with the infectious phenotype are distributed nonuniformly and tend to cluster together. This suggests that low-confidence mean prediction for those viruses is not a result of random guessing, but genuine ambiguity present in the data--and the misclassifica- tion of RaTG13 could be indicative of a general zoonotic potential of SARS-related coronaviruses. In the Figure 2B , we highlighted the score peaks aligning the spike protein gene (S), as well as the E and N genes, which were scored the highest (apart from an unconfirmed ORF10 of just 38aa downstream of N) by the CNN and the LSTM, respectively. Correlation between the CNN and LSTM outputs is significant, but species-dependent and moderate (0.28 for Ebola, 0.48 for SARS-CoV-2), which suggests they capture complementary signals. Figure 2C shows the nucleotide-level contributions in a small peak within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, crucial for recognizing the host cell. The domain location was predicted with CD-search (68) using the default parameters. The maximum score of this peak is noticeably higher for SARS-CoV-2 (0.87) than for its analog in RaTG13 (0.67). Figure 3 presents the RBD in the structural context of the whole S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB, (69)), as well as in complex with a SARS-neutralizing antibody CR3022 (PDB ID: 6W41, (70)). The high score peak roughly corresponds to one of the regions associated with reduced expression of the RBD (71), located in the core-RBD subdomain. It covers over 71% of the CR3022 epitope, as well as the neighboring site of the N343 glycan. The latter is present in the epitope of another core-RBD targeting antibody, S309 (72) . All the per-residue average contributions in the region are positive (Supplementary Figure S7) , even in the regions of lower pathogenicity score, in accordance with the results presented in Figure 2C .",

This holds also for novel viruses not present in the training set. Generalization of virus-level Chordata models to other host groups is a sign of a strong, 'human' signal. We suspect our classifiers detect the positive class treating all other regions of the sequence space as 'negative' by default, exhibiting traits of a one-class classifier even without being explicitly trained to do so. We find further support for this hypothesis: the networks learn many more 'positive' than 'negative' filters and regions of near-zero nucleotide contributions (including the null reference sample) result in negative predictions. As this effect does not occur for bacteria, we expect it do be task-and data dependent. While we ignore the simulated quality information here, investigating the role of sequencing noise will be an interesting follow-up study. Although the data setup is crucial in general, the modeling step is also important, as shown by our comparison to the baseline k-NN model. The RC-nets are relatively simple, but they are invariant to reverse-complementarity and perform better than random forests, na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and standard NN architectures in another NGS task (24) .",

On a real human virome sample, where a main source of negative class reads is most likely contamination (54), our method filters out nonhuman viruses with high specificity. In this scenario, the BLAST-derived ground-truth labels were mined using the complete database (as opposed to just a training set). In all cases, our results are only as good as the training data used; high quality labels and sequences are needed to develop trustworthy models. Ideally, sources of error should be investigated with an in-depth analysis of a model's performance on multiple genomes covering a wide selection of taxonomic units. This is especially important as the method assumes no mechanistic link between an input sequence and the phenotype of interest, and the input sequence constitutes only a small fraction of the target genome without a wider biological context. Still, it is possible to predict a label even from those small, local fragments. A similar effect was also observed for image classification with CNNs (73) . Virulence arises as a complex interplay between the host and the virus, so the predictions reflect only an estimated potential of the infectious phenotype. This mirrors the caveats of bacterial pathogenic potential prediction (24) , including the considerations of balancing computational cost, reliability of error estimates, size and composition of the reference database. Even though deep learning outperforms the standard homology-based methods, it is still an open question whether it captures 'functional' signals, or just a more flexible sequence similarity function. By the very nature of machine learning and sequence comparison in general, we expect similar viruses to yield similar predictions; in principle this could be used to asses a risk of a host-switching event. The interpretability suite presented here aims at shedding some light on this question, but more research is needed.",

O'Brien and Nelson (77) suggested that while the intended purpose of pathogenicity potential prediction is to mitigate biosecurity threats, it could actually enable designing new pathogens to cause maximal harm. The importance of this concern is difficult to overstate and it must be addressed. If an ML-guided, genome-wide phenotype optimization tool existed, it would indeed be a classical dual-use technology not unlike more established computeraided design approaches for synthetic biology--potentially dangerous, but offering tremendous benefits (e.g. in agriculture, medicine or manufacturing) as well. However, the models presented here do not allow biologically sensible optimization of target sequences. For example, we find meaningless, low-complexity sequences of mononucleotide repeats corresponding to global maxima (infectious potential of 1.0). These artifacts highlight the fact that only some Figure 2C are located in the core-RBD subdomain. (D) RBD in complex with a SARS-neutralizing antibody CR3022 (green). The red region covers over 71% of the CR3022 epitope, but spans also to the neighboring fragments, including the site of the N343 glycan (carbohydrate in red stick representation).

The red region is centered on two exposed \u2423-helices surrounding the core \u2424-sheet (lower score, white). generally undefined regions of the theoretically possible sequence space are biologically relevant. What is more, we operate on short sequences constituting minuscule fractions of the whole genome with all its complexity. Although successful deep learning approaches for both protein (78) (79) (80) and regulatory sequence design (81-84) do exist, moving from read-based classification to genome-wide phenotype optimization would require considerable research effort, if possible at all.

It seems that the assumption of nucleotide independence--which is crucial for treating DeepLIFT as a method of estimating Shap-ley values for input nucleotides (44)--does not hold in full. Indeed, k-mer distribution profiles are frequently used features for modeling DNA sequences (as shown also by the dimer-shuffling method of generating reference sequences proposed by Shrikumar et al.

We see information content and DeepLIFT's contribution values as two complementary channels that can be jointly visualized for better interpretability and explainability of CNNs in genomics. Filter enrichment analysis enables even deeper insight in the inner workings of the networks. We generate activation data for hundreds to thousands of species, genes and filters.

            "text": "Mapping predictions back to a target genome can be used both as a way of investigating a given model's performance and as a method of genome analysis. GWPA plots of wellannotated genomes highlight the sequences with erroneous and correct phenotype predictions at both genome and gene level, and nucleotide-resolution contribution maps help track those regions down to individual amino acids. On the other hand, once a trusted model is developed, it can be used on newly emerging pathogens, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus briefly analyzed in this work. Therefore, we see GPWA applications in both probing the behavior of artificial neural networks in pathogen genomics and finding regions of interest in weakly annotated genomes. What is more, the approach could be easily co-opted to genome-wide activation analyses of any arbitrary, intermediate neuron. The methods presented here may also be applied to other biological problems, and extending them to other hosts and pathogen groups, multi-class classification or gene identification is possible. However, experimental work and traditional sequence analysis are required to truly understand the biology behind host adaptation and distinguish true hits from false positives.",

For convolutional filters, we jointly visualize nucleotide contributions and information content. Finally, we use GWPA plots to gain insights into the models' behavior and analyze a recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus. The approach presented here is implemented as a python package (see Data Availability) and a command line tool easily installable with Bioconda (85).",
