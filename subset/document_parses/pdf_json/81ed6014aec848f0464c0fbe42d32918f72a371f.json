However, the current demand has exceeded the supply chain and, consequently, shortage of essential medical materials, such as surgical masks. Due to these alarming limitations, it is crucial to develop effective means of disinfection, reusing, and thereby applying antimicrobial shielding protection to the clinical supplies. Purpose: Therefore, in this work, we developed a novel, economical, and straightforward approach to promote antimicrobial activity to surgical masks by impregnating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Methods: Our strategy consisted of fabricating a new alcohol disinfectant formulation combining special surfactants and AgNPs, which is demonstrated to be extensively effective against a broad number of microbial surrogates of SARS-CoV-2. Results: The present nano-formula reported a superior microbial reduction of 99.999% against a wide number of microorganisms. Furthermore, the enveloped H5N1 virus was wholly inactivated after 15 min of disinfection. Far more attractive, the current method for reusing surgical masks did not show outcomes of detrimental amendments, suggesting that the protocol does not alter the filtration effectiveness. Conclusion: The nano-disinfectant provides a valuable strategy for effective decontamination, reuse, and even antimicrobial promotion to surgical masks for frontline clinical personnel.",

            "text": "A critical impact factor raised by the COVID-19 outbreak has been the international dwindled supply chain of protective masks and respirators, 10 which are fundamental to guard healthcare personal and the community. Moreover, the traditional manufacturer design of medical surgical masks is limited to a single use, which strongly influences the items reduced availability. Therefore, a contemporary challenge is an imperative mean to develop efficient decontamination and antimicrobial protocols that can be universally accessible. Several decontamination processes have been applied to reuse surgical masks and respirators, including UV germicidal irradiation, ethylene oxide, dry and steam sterilization in the autoclave, and ionized hydrogen peroxide. [10] [11] [12] However, it is important to highlight that those strategies are expensive; some require high-trained personnel, could result in detrimental effects to the masks and are not universally available in hospital installations as well for the social community. Consequently, an exemplary method is one that is simultaneously rigorous enough to afford maximal decontamination and yet provides antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, the textiles of the masks must be effectively decontaminated, incorporating human-safe antimicrobial agents, in order to avoid persistent microorganisms (eg, spore-forming bacteria) on the masks. 10 Nanotechnology has offered a substantial platform to design high surface-to -volume ratio configured materials capable of being finetuned for surface textiles, to achieve an optimal antimicrobial effectiveness. Moreover, nanotechnology could play a pivotal role in fighting against nosocomial microbial infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 and its surrogates. For example, AgNPs have been well documented to takedown different viruses by collapsing the envelopment integrity and disaggregation of the viral content, 13 a hallmarking advantage of AgNPs. Far more critical, metal-loaded nanocomposites into healthcare personnel polymeric equipment (eg, mouth masks) could effectively attenuate the viral viability and the prolonged SARS-CoV-2persistence. 14 Furthermore, AgNPs have shown important applications in developing broad-spectrum antibacterial coatings, 15 anticancer strategies, 16 and biosensor systems. 17 Thus, an important and innovating option for the shielding of surgical mask fibers with advanced antimicrobial promotion is incorporating AgNPs functionalized in a high-efficient disinfectant solution.",

However, the authors reported that the AgNPs were present as a coating instead of an impregnation process, which can result in a detrimental skin cytotoxicity. 18 Considering the abovestated information, we rely on a promising strategy to formulate a broad-spectrum disinfectant, incorporated with antiviral-off metallic nanoparticles capable of bringing unique antimicrobial properties to the mask textile fibers with only an easy, accessible, and fast application. Therefore, we developed an alcohol-based disinfectant containing quaternary ammonium compounds and surfactants, as an exceptional platform for impregnating and retaining AgNPs in the surgical mask fibers. This work aims to synthesize high-dispersed spherical 5-13 nm AgNPs by electrochemical dissolution of pure silver to formulate a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial disinfectant. The nano-developed disinfectant was designed to uniformly coat hydrophobic surgical masks with AgNPs, promoting antimicrobial activity, as well as viral inactivation efficacy for healthcare protection. Our strategy further allows incorporating AgNPs to medicalgrade textiles fibers of the surgical masks protecting against microbial penetration and adhesion. The present research has contributed as a novel, cost-effective, and accessible approach for the disinfection of medical textile mask materials to overcome the current limited supply chain that we are facing by the COVID-19.

The interplanar distances were measured using the Image J software (1.48v, NIH, USA), taking the scale bar as a measure reference from the crystal lattices detected by HR-TEM.

            "text": "The current outbreak-associated with the COVID-19 is demanding novel strategies which generate solutions to assess the shortage of surgical masks and even different medical textile materials. 2 Our main objective was to develop a broad-spectrum disinfectant with high antimicrobial AgNPs for surgical masks shielding, which could be accessible and easy to use for our medical staff and the population. Thus, we synthesized AgNPs using a simple electrochemical etching method. Initially, the AgNPs presented a spherical-like morphology, that were highly monodispersed ( Figures 1A and S1) , as expected. 19 The HR-TEM characterization suggested that sphere NPs ( Figure 1B ) presented a detailed interplanar space of 2.33 \u00c5 ( Figure 1C) . Thus, suggesting the (111) crystallographic plane strongly referred to that of Ag\u00b0 species are composing the AgNPs. 30 This interesting observation matches to those observed in our SAED analysis ( Figure 1D ) and agrees with previous reports of AgNPs. 30, 31 Moreover, according to the TEM results, the size distribution of the AgNPs is 13.2\u00b14 nm showing a narrow size curve, as indicated in Figure 1E . Furthermore, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of AgNPs was 405 nm ( Figure 1F ), further following a narrow peak-valley behavior advising a monodispersity distribution 31 and part of the metallic state of Ag\u00b0 species, 20 in accordance to Figure 1E and D. The DLS proposed that the AgNPs in solution showed a small diameter of 3.5 nm with a stable ZP of \u2212112.2 mV. The present results point toward that the electrolysis technique designed for AgNPs fabrication initially involves the dissolution of the Ag rod by losing electrons to form Ag + , thus far, acting as a sacrificial anode. 20 Then, Ag + species could be reduced on the cathode, generating zero-valent Ag\u00b0 and by van der Waals forces, the Ag\u00b0 can nucleate and grow to AgNPs. 19 In order to control the nucleation process, we included PVP in the synthetic protocol. The asymmetric chemical structure of the pyrrolidone group allows an excellent dispersant ability to control the nucleation of AgNPs 32 and protects of extensive NPs agglomeration. A critical issue for promoting antimicrobial effectiveness to clinical surgical masks is in an accurate, controlled, and dispersed deposition of AgNPs. Thus, we applied FE-SEM on the experimental masks, discovering a well-homogenized AgNPs distribution with slight conglomeration of AgNPs ( Figure 2A) . Interestingly, the as-observed agglomeration zones may promote a better integration of the fibers with Ag 0 species (as suggested by SAED), which inversely can be translated in increased antimicrobial action (as discussed later). Moreover, the high-zoom presented in Figure 2B and C showed consistent outcomes of AgNPs coating over the broad surfaces of the fibers, and a dispersed deposition of smaller AgNPs as illustrated in Figure 2D (see insets) . Interestingly, a nanoagglomeration phenomenon could be detected because of the drying effect applied to the coated fiber. Importantly, it has been wide documented that the stability of colloidal metallic nanoparticles (eg, AgNPs) are primarily dependent of the solvent suspension, the ionic strength, the pH, and the type of capping agent. 33 Those factors can provide steric and/or electrostatic repulsion, DovePress which substantially influence in preventing AgNPs agglomeration. However, when AgNPs are submitted to drying processes, most of the above-mentioned physicochemical parameters are avoided; therefore, AgNPs could not effort the required dispersing repulsive charges. Thus consequently, AgNPs become extremely susceptible to agglomeration and deposition. 34 In a previous study, I. Os\u00f3rio et al deposited AgNPs on cotton fibers, thus resulting in AgNPs deposition being dependent on the concentration. 35 However, the electrostatic energy provided by the fiber surfaces could increase the aggregation rate by declining the electrostatic energy barrier to conduct AgNPs aggregations. 33, 36 Therefore, our results suggested that the AgNPs distribution over the surgical mask were of 21.6\u00b16 nm. It is important to highlight that our present study showed an efficient impregnation of AgNPs among the surface fibers, without the formation of a thick NPs coating that could raise detrimental alterations to the textile fibers. On the other hand, the EDX analysis illustrated the presence of silver element (26.72 \u00b19.42%) over the textile fibers ( Figure 2E ), far more supporting the presence of AgNPs. Our results are in accordance with Hiragond et al, which suggested the deposition of 9-14 nm AgNPs on the textile surgical mask surface. 37 The authors indicated an elemental Ag concentration of 12.93% by EDX, almost half of those observed here. This interesting behavior can be explained by considering two essential strategies: 1) AgNPs developed by chemical reduction vs our electrochemical AgNPs and 2) the coating of as-prepared AgNPs versus those formerly impregnated in our disinfectant containing surfactants. Surgical mask fibers are intended to be hydrophobic, thus, surfactants are special chemical compounds that can act as a platform to reduce the surface tension between a liquid and a solid surface. 38 Therefore, the application of triton X-100, LAE, and BC (quaternary ammonium base) will serve as a cornerstone for efficient impregnation and dispersion of AgNPs into the fibers, 39, 40 without developing a cracking coating, as compared to those previously reported. 37 On the other hand, the electrochemical synthetic pathway results in the formation of mainly Ag\u00b0 ( Figure 1D ), enabling efficient incorporation of Ag\u00b0/Ag + . Consequently, the related protocol could exacerbate the formation of a rougher, thicker, and non-homogenous Ag layer that could detriments the mask properties. On the other hand, the XRD analysis of the AgNPs Figure 3 Figure 1D ), and previous works. 41 As represented in Figure 4 , we did not detect significant chemical shifting after incorporating the AgNPs with the surfactants at different BC concentrations. However, the FT-IR illustrated that the impregnation process does not alter the chemical configuration of the mask textiles, as we only identify some variable intensities. Interestingly, a decreased peak behavior was detected in the region of 1300-1100 cm \u22121 , suggesting a reduced C-O stretching bonding by the increment in the BC and better incorporation of the Ag 0 species. Moreover, the heightened concentration of BC correlates to the aromatic C-C vibration detected in the region of 1600 cm \u22121 , proposing that the quaternary ammonium has been incorporated. Similarly, the AgNPs did not show any significant chemical shifting, only highlighting the absence of the -OH in the region of 3500-3200 cm \u22121 . Far more attractive, the classical C-H stretching in the region of 3000-2800 cm-1 were almost similar between the different treatments. Taking together the FT-IR and FE-SEM analyses, we can hypothesize that the structural properties of the textile masks are not degraded after disinfectant incorporation. 42 Far more attractive, Fisher et al studied the filtration effectiveness of N95 respirators decontaminated in several cycles of 70% ethanol immersions. 43 The results indicated that 70% ethanol disinfection did not significantly alter the filtration efficiency of the respirator. Thus, affording, a significant disinfection rate of SARS-CoV-2 for the ethanol solution. The front-line shreds of evidence provided by Liao et al showed that surgical mask fibers disinfected using extremely high temperatures under different humidity conditions do not compromise the filtration efficiency. 44 The authors discovered that almost 20 cycles of 100\u00b0C for 5 min were not enough to alter the pressure drop of the textile fibers. 44 Moreover, in a previous study Cui et al proposed that transparent nanofiber membranes of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium lignosulfonate could adequately filtrate particle matter of 2.5, even after 10 cycles of circulation filtration. 45 Far more important, we applied WCA over a 0.2% BC-impregnated mask and a control non-treated mask ( Figure S2 ). The results advocated that the impregnation process does not promote a significant water uptake behavior, as the droplets' morphologies were similar ( Figure S2A ). On the other hand, the quantitative analysis did not indicate significant differences, further supporting a relevant hydrophobicity performance after the impregnation process ( Figure S2B ), thus in accordance to previous works. 22, 23 Hence, we suggest that the filtration capability by our decontamination process is not negatively compromised, as we did not detect morphological, chemical and wetting alterations. However, we recommend a future evaluation of aerosol filtration performance after several disinfecting cycles and mechanical test integrities.",

            "text": "The current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has shown an impressive survival capability under different environmental conditions and surface materials. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can present a long half-life capability on common stainless steel and plastic surfaces. 46 Furthermore, Chan et al suggested that SARS-CoV-2 conserve stable viability for 3-5 days under dry conditions, and as far as 7 days in solution conditions (20-25 \u00b0C) . 47 Additionally, this research group described that SARS-CoV-2 could stay active for up to 14 days at 4 \u00b0 C, which indicates the prolonged viral capability to spread by contact with contaminated surfaces. Despite the noteworthy survival ability of this pathogen, it has been described that can be inactivated and eliminated using several disinfectants, such as those based on alcohol formulas. 48 Therefore, we designed a new disinfectant based on 45% ethanol solution with protein destabilizing surfactants, superoxidized water, triclosan and fortified with AgNPs, for surgical mask disinfection and shielding. Applying the recovery media technique proposed by Dey and Engley, 26 we detected that the BC. And, 0.2% formula completely eradicated the growing ability of Gram (+), and (\u2212) bacteria ( Figure 5 ). Moreover, this trend was also detected for C. albicans, an opportunistic yeast capable to develop nosocomial infections. 21 Interestingly, the commercially acceptable disinfectant products showed similar outcome of disinfection; however, they diverge from AgNPs. It is important to highlight that the applied recovery media strategy essentially counteract the inhibitory action of the above selected chemicals, thus allowing the direct interaction with AgNPs (data not shown). Indicating that our new designed disinfectant is capable to eliminate an important number of microorganism associated with COVID-19 related secondary infections. 3, 4 A cornerstone for disinfectant effectiveness consists in a comprehensive reduction viability of 99.999% for up to 30 s. On this basis, we applied the microbial challenge test for 0.2% BC formulation, resulting in 99.999% reduction for the evaluated microorganisms.",

            "text": "In order to analyze the competing antimicrobial action between the disinfectants, we used the agar diffusion test ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, the Gram (\u2212) bacterial models showed among comparable outcomes of antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the Gram (+) model indicated a similar behavior as those of Gram (\u2212), which suggested remarked checkpoints of dose-dependent manner, as advocated by the increasing BC concentrations. However, in the E. coli and C. albicans models, we observed a superior action for our disinfectant even than those of the Lysol product ( Figure 6 ). Taking together the results presented in Figures 5 and 6 , we can highlight that these used microorganisms can be considered as effective surrogates of SARS-CoV-2. Bacteria, and of particular interest fungi, present a more complex structural International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress physiology, which turned them less susceptible to chemical microbicidal processes than enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. 10 On the other hand, a featured trend of antimicrobial action was detected for the striking broadspectrum generated by the AgNPs-impregnated surgical mask textiles ( Figure 7) . As allocated for the textiles, the microbial models were extensively sensitive to direct contact evaluation. Concomitantly, the fungi organism presented an outstanding antifungal action, further compared to inferior complex bacterial models. Our results are in accordance with a previous work of antibacterial surgical mask developed with AgNPs and TiO 2 NPs. 18 The authors synthesized the metallic NPs using a top-down pulverization approach, which were coated using a textile rolling machine. Moreover, Hiragond et al used colloidal AgNPs by chemical reduction and generated a thick silver coating on surgical mask fibers. 37 The coating resulted in a promoted antibacterial action against S. aureus and E. coli. However, the application of those coating strategies could lead to an obliteration of the AgNPs, due to a most direct contact with the human skin and bulk delivery of silver. 18, 49 Similarly, a detrimental mask integrity, thus decreasing the filtration efficiency. Hence, a current trend is selecting an impregnation strategy that may improve the incorporation of the AgNPs into the textiles, 49 resulting in an improved antimicrobial and viraloff action due to the slow and continuous release of silver, as observed here. Importantly, our novel strategy supported a distributed incorporation of AgNPs among the textile fibers, which may strongly decrease the AgNPs leakage into the dermal contacting tissue. 50 Interestingly, AshaRani et al suggested that starch-coated AgNPs (6-20 nm) could induce alterations in the morphology, viability, metabolic activity, and reactive oxygen specifies activation in human fibroblasts. 51 However, the authors indicated that its required concentrations higher than 50 \u00b5g/mL and direct contact periods longer than 48h to reduce almost 20% of the ATP activity. 51 Furthermore, a previous study of commercially available spherical 20 nm AgNPs (\u2248 7 ppm) proposing 80% reduction in the L929 mouse fibroblasts metabolic activity after 24h of continuous contact. 52 On the other hand, it has been documented that AgNPs could exacerbate a given ecological impact, principally when infused into soil and water systems. 53 Nonetheless, despite the controversial effect of AgNPs on microbiota and plant systems, studies have indicated that long-lasting AgNPs regimens are mainly linked to overcoming toxic and imbalanced ecosystem impairments. 54 Therefore, it is substantial to highlight that the AgNPs concentration used for the impregnation formulation is several folds lower than those previously reported of harmful effects. Further proposing that our formulation is DovePress ecofriendly and the level of AgNPs used is tolerable for mammalian cells. Hence, supporting that the impregnation process could decrease the AgNPs leakage could provide a future alternative for recycling surgical masks, reducing the environmental pollution.",

Moreover, a countering side-effect that is facing the healthcare staff has been the shortage in the supply chain regarding the minimal protective equipment.

Our nano-disinfectant application resulted in a firm and controlled impregnation of AgNPs without illustrating fiber alterations, suggesting conserved filtration effectiveness. Far more attractive, our results communicate an extensive antimicrobial activity against secondary associated COVID-19 bacterial infections and C. albicans, a problematic nosocomial opportunistic yeast. Moreover, the antiviral efficiency of our nano-disinfectant showed effective viral inactivation outcomes against H5N1, a pandemic enveloped surrogate of SARS-CoV-2. A significant step forward was the effective antimicrobial action of the impregnated fibers, suggesting a substantial shielding by the AgNPs impregnation. Given the importance of engineering the personnel protective equipment, the present work brings an affordable, effective, and integrated approach for improving the reuse of surgical masks.

Next, the mixture was inoculated with 0.1 mL of each working microbial culture in separate and incubated at 37\u00b0 C for 48 h. Afterwards, each culture tube was carefully shacked for 15s, 0.1 mL of each culture mixture was plated on to a fresh D/E agar (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) plate. Each microbial evaluation was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48h. After incubation, the recovered organism was counted and expressed as log 10 of CFU/mL.",
