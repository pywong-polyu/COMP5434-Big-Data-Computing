The ability of a drug to access the anterior parts of the eye is negligible after systemic administration. Effective drug delivery to the eye is a major challenge due to the presence of protective mechanisms and physiological barriers that result in low ocular availability after topical application. The main purpose of this work was the improvement of the corneal and conjunctival permeation of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin, a wide spectrum antibiotic used for the most common eye infection, using a self-dissolving polymeric film. Films were prepared by the solvent casting technique, using polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft co-polymer (Soluplus), polyvynyl alcohol, and propylene glycol. Films were homogeneous in drug content and thickness, as demonstrated by adapting the Swiss Roll technique followed by microscopy observation. These films proved in vitro to control the release of the Ciprofloxacin. Ex vivo permeability studies using Franz diffusion cells and porcine cornea and sclera showed an effective permeability of the drug without inducing irritation of the tissues. Films swelled in contact with artificial tears forming an in situ gel over 20 min, which will improve drug contact and reduce the need of multiple dosing.",

The application of a drop of a liquid or semisolid formulation is not an efficient way of administration to the eye. In situ forming gels have been suggested as an alternative to improve drug contact to the eye, reduce blurred vision, and decrease the tear production compared with ointments [8] . Another problem of traditional dosage forms is that coordination of patient nonblinking and application of the formulation while pressing the container may also be difficult for elderly patients, children, or persons affected of certain disabilities, what leads to a large imprecision in the dose administered [9, 10] .",

Hence, we developed and characterized self-dissolvable CPX films to improve drug contact with the cornea and to achieve a sustained release of the drug, while the film is slowly dissolved by the tears. Their dissolvability is an additional advantage, as they do not need to be removed after drug release. This new ocular film would use the solubility enhancement ability of Soluplus micelles, together with the prolonged contact time with the cornea and user-friendliness of a dry film. This novel formulation is inspired in the work of Alopaeous et al., who designed Soluplus-based films for buccal delivery of furosemide. The authors postulated that Soluplus present in the film will disperse and form micelles after application on a wet surface [13] . In the low volume of the tears, the Soluplus concentration is expected to be above the critical micellar concentration. A slow hydration and disintegration of the film is desirable to improve the drug permanence onto the cornea. Here, the micelles containing the drug in a soluble form can produce a concentration gradient over the cornea ensuring passive diffusion over the barrier. The film suffers a transformation from a dry, solid, and stable formulation into an advanced ocular delivery system after contact with the tears [13] .",

Film 1 was prepared with Soluplus/PVA/PG in 3.3:6.6:2 (% w/v), and Film 2, with the proportions 5:10:3 (% w/v). Both films were prepared with CPXb and CPXs forms. Films were labelled as: Film 1b, Film 1s, Film 2b, and Film 2s, corresponding b to CPXb and s to CPXs. The composition of the CPX-loaded films is summarized in Table 1 . The four films were transparent and homogeneously whitish, probably due to the presence of the Soluplus micelles, as a concentration dependent whitening of water with the addition of the polymer was observed. However, this whitening should not interfere with vision, as the films are intended to be inserted onto the sclera, and not used as contact lenses. The films also presented a smooth surface, good organoleptic properties, and the desired flexibility, manually evaluated by stretching. The thinner the films, the more comfortable they will be for the patient, although these films are intended to dissolve within < 30 min, forming a gel. Thickness was homogeneous all over the films and ranged between 39.41 \u00b1 0.60 and 28.54 \u00b1 0.56 \u03bcm, as it is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1 . To measure the thickness of the films, we adapted the swiss roll technique, originally developed to prepare tissues for paraffin or methacrylate embedding for histological analyses, followed by optical microscopy and combined with the thickness measuring tool AxioVision Software Rel 4.8 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany). We had no access to an electronic device to measure thickness, and the manual equipment available at our laboratories was insufficiently accurate for these films. Up to our knowledge, there is no previous use of the swiss roll technique to evaluate polymeric films, but according to our experience, this technique is able to accurately evaluate the thickness of our films all over their surface in the same sample. The results obtained here agree to previous studies of the research group, as the thickness was homogeneous all over the films, showing no significant differences [36] . However, as it happened in the drug content experiments, there was a slight, not significant, trend to obtain thinner parts of the films on the petri-dish outer ring compared to the centre. Therefore, according to our experience, the technique used here is more suitable to obtain homogeneous films. Even though previous results of our research group used the Petri-dish as mold producing even surfaced films, the tailor-mold fitted on an anti-adherent surface could improve the peel off process and thickness homogeneity. Additionally, the new technique would avoid the 24h shaking process to homogeneously distribute the gel onto the Petri dish surface, significantly reducing the production process duration [37] .",

However, one of the main challenges in film formation by a casting process is to assure content uniformity in the formulation. Agglomeration or sedimentation of solid particles or the presence of air bubbles on the surface are often observed due to the drying process.

Wu et al. developed mucoadhesive buccal CPX-films for periodontitis, using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium alginate as polymers, showing good drug loading (94.50 \u00b1 0.04 to 99.69 \u00b1 0.21%), but the authors did not measure drug distribution [41] . Salguero et al. developed hybrid composite films based on layered double hydroxide and hyaluronan to deliver CPX for the prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic infections in wounds. The authors also reported that the solvent-casting process produced a quite homogeneous film, with CV% values ranging between 6.6 and 7.3% in all cases. Moreover, the CPX content they found was similar for all the films prepared [42] . Garcia et al. developed dendronized chitosan films loaded with CPX for wound dressing. Their films showed excellent CPX content uniformity with very low CV%, indicating that the casting solvent method employed was also successful [43] . All these approaches were also consistent with our findings, demonstrating that the technique employed is adequate and effective.",

Recent studies confirmed the potential role of nanogels and in situ forming gels in prolonging precorneal residence time and thus improved ocular drug availability [44, 45] . These films adjusted easily to the corneal surface, and they shortly turned into a gel, as they swelled after hydration by the tear fluid, until their complete dissolution (see Fig. 2 and Table 3 ). In both cases, for Film 1 and 2, prepared without CPX, a wetting process occurs first, in which the swelling index increases, followed by a second erosion process where it decreases. No differences are observed between films during wetting, although the erosion process is significantly slower for Film 2. In our approach, Film 2 dissolves completely in the PBS medium later than Film 1 what was expected due to the higher polymer concentration. A video clip presenting the swelling and erosion of a methylene blue-coloured film (type 1) is also attached to this manuscript.",

The authors concluded that the swelling behaviour of both films was dependent on the medium [42] . They also observed that in all cases, the films did not preserve their form and changed to a gel-like structure at the end of the assay. In our case, we decided to maintain the phosphate buffer saline as representative of the physiological medium. The only study we could find where the combination PVP/Soluplus was used did not report swelling studies, although their reported moisture uptake [35] . The moisture uptake study was conducted at a quite high relative humidity of 75%, which was < 2% (w/w), indicating good mechanical stability of the film upon storage. These findings are very positive for our film also, as our data show a strong evidence of films dissolution, which is dependent of the water volume. During storage, we expect the films not to degrade, due to the small amounts of environmental water and the possibility to seal the dosage forms with the appropriate conditioning materials. After application of the film onto the eye, the dissolution rate of the film is expected to be slow, due to the small amounts of tears covering the eye-surface. This fact is confirmed in our case through the experiment shown in the video clip 2. Here, we applied a blue-coloured film onto the eye surface and added a drop of artificial tear every 120-150 s. We can observe that the film transforms completely into a gel and the cornea and sclera start colouring blue while the film dissolves (see Fig. 3 ).",

Sink conditions were maintained all over the release studies, so solubility limitations can be discarded from this difference in behaviour.

However, in this type of matrices, the swelling and polymer dissolution processes must be taken into account to fully understand the release mechanisms. The swelling process produces significant changes in the volume of the system, thus changing the drug concentration. Besides, the mobility of the molecules increases, increasing the drug and water diffusion coefficients. For poorly water-soluble drugs, the drug dissolution process must be taken into account as well, as dissolved and non-dissolved drug coexist within the matrix and it is assumed that drug dissolution within the matrix is fast compared with drug diffusion out of the matrix [49] . Diffusion of penetrants through polymers often does not follow the standard Fickian model, and the controlled drug release is due to the restricted mobility of small drug molecules dispersed or dissolved in the dense macromolecular matrix films [50] .",

The calculated parameters and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table 4 . The release exponent, n, is the slope value of log Qt/Q\u221e versus log time curve. When 0.5 < n < 1.0, diffusion and non-Fickian transport are implied, associated with the relaxation of polymer chains in the film matrix, due to swelling and erosion [51] . This parameter was in the range of 0.5 < n < 1.0 which suggests that the release of CPX from all formulations followed a non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. The ability of hydrophilic matrix systems to control the delivery of all types of drugs have been extensively investigated [52, 53] . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previously reported release assay with Soluplusbased films. Shama et al. prepared freeze-dried Soluplus/ PVA films for the oral delivery of spironolactone, an insoluble drug for the paediatric use. The authors performed a solubility test, because their aim was to enhance the drug solubility and, at the same time, prepare a solid dosage form convenient for the paediatric use, but not a release one [35] .",

Therefore, the release of drug from the formulations in this study is expected to be more prolonged in vivo than as shown by our data. This was demonstrated in the in vivo study carried out by Desai and colleagues. In their study, they obtained differences between the in vivo and in vitro release conditions because of the dissolution volume used to obtain sink conditions. In their in vitro study, the formulation was placed in 2 mL of dissolution media, whereas in the animal study, the formulation was exposed to just 7-10 \u03bcL of the tear volume in the ocular cavity. A markedly high release of drug was observed in vitro release conditions, whereas a twofold slower release was observed in vivo [56] . Therefore, the release of CPX from self-dissolvable thin ocular films in this study is also expected to be more prolonged during the in vivo studies, where the tear volume and turnover rate is significantly lower.",

This means that the thermodynamic activity in the donor compartment of the cells containing the films is lower than in the case of the eye-drops. Due to the presence of the solubility enhancer Soluplus, the CPX concentration is far away from the solubility saturation. The permeability of CPX saturated films could be of interest in further studies, to evaluate the ability of Soluplus to enhance ocular availability, due to the increase in drug concentration in the donor and/or its interactions with the ocular barriers.

The effectiveness of a topical antimicrobial agent in the treatment of microbial keratitis is in part dependent on the physicochemical properties of the antimicrobial solution and the structure of the cornea. The concentration of the agent within the cornea is used as a measure of these properties [60] . Therefore, CPX was extracted using the HPLC-mobile phase as solvent. A previous mass balance test and blank extraction test were performed to assure 100 \u00b1 10% drug recovery and no interferences with the HPLC-method [61] . Figure 5 represent the amount extracted from cornea and sclera tissues, respectively. The presented data are in agreement with the results found in the permeability experiments. CPX was also remaining in the donor compartments (\u00b1 10%), meaning that the films were able to control drug release beyond the permeability assays period and confirming their ability to reduce dosing. Significantly higher amounts of drug were recovered in both cornea and sclera when the films contained CPX in molecular form compared with those that contained it in salt form. This is due to the fact that the non-ionized forms of drugs have better permeability and retention capacity in the tissues than the ionized forms. Besides, Film 1, due to its lower drug release control, showed a more immediate disposition of higher amounts of drug that logically determines the final amount of drug found after 6 h. The differences observed between the different formulations in the cornea are not so evident in the sclera, probably because the thickness of the tissue is much lower, and therefore, the ability to retain the drug is also smaller. In addition, the structure of the sclera, that facilitates permeability to the posterior parts of the eye, may also contribute to the decreased capacity for drug retention in the tissue [62] . Even though, significant differences can still be observed in CPX retention in the sclera between Film 1b and the rest of the formulations. Balguri et al. studied the ocular disposition of CPX from topical, PEGylated nanostructured lipid carriers in vitro and in vivo. Their in vivo permeability results were consistent with the in vitro observations. CPX accumulation in the different tissues was only assayed in vivo. All the formulations tested and the control solution showed the same trend; the accumulation in sclera was always much lower compared with the cornea [63] .",

In the case of Staphylococcus aureus, the films were effective even though the commercial control disc inhibition halos presented an insufficient diameter to consider the microorganism as sensitive, according to the established standards (Table 6) . Enterococcus faecalis presented a double inhibition halo (see Fig. 7e and f), so the inner mark was used for the subsequent calculations and considerations. This microorganism type was only sensitive for the Film 1b, while the Film 1s showed an intermediate efficacy, since the halo radius was larger than the standard resistance. In general, the highest areas of inhibition were produced by the formulations with the lowest concentration of polymers (Figs. 6 and 7) , probably since after their gradual wetting throughout the study, the release occurs more quickly. During the diffusion studies on agar plates, the wetting of the films was much more moderate, and consequently, the release process did not occur in the same way.

            "text": "The efficacy of CPX formulations has been widely reported in the literature, but we considered the importance of antimicrobial resistance to classic antibiotics, especially after the application of anti-COVID-19 measures worldwide, which can easily raise antimicrobial resistances, due to the continuous use of antiseptic agents. Several formulations increased ocular CPX antimicrobial activity, when compared with the eye drops. For example, its encapsulation in cubosomes, which form a bicontinuous lipid bilayer, with a high structural similarity with the microbial cell membranes, enable membrane fusion and allow drug transfer into microbial cells [64] . A copolymer composed of pullulan and polycaprolactone (PCL) was also used to synthesize CPXloaded core-shell nanospheres, which were incorporated into HEMA-based contact lenses. Their bactericidal activity was tested using liquid cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which effectively inhibited the proliferation of the bacteria [65] .",
