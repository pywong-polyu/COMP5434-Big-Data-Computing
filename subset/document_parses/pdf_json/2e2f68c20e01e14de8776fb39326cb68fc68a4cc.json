This study's prime target is to develop relationships between the variation in the doubling time of the number of cases of COVID-19 virus and various socio-economic factors responsible for them. These frameworks focus on the relationships instead of relational data, so here in graph structures, we have generated different patterns of doubling rates and drawn the inferences.",

Countries, where the virus spread started earlier, had less time to prepare themselves, and they were in initial stages, the doubling time suffered. A sudden dip in doubling time is due to a large gathering of people or not effective lockdown; thus, people's attitude contributes to an essential role in affecting the doubling time.",

Thus, in the long term, these countries may observe a slight increase in the doubling rates and show an exploding number of cases [7] [8] [9] [10] .The measures taken by the governing bodies are also an essential factor in coronavirus's behaviour in countries.

This increase can be attributed to the government's vigorous measures to reallocate a vast chunk of its healthcare system to respond to the outbreak's centre and build new facilities specifically for the patients. The government also made testing free of charge even if the results were negative. It took quick actions to alert the public about infection symptoms and isolate confirmed cases and track their closer contacts to find the origins of infection clusters. On Day 70, China updated its data with new 14,108 cases which can be seen as a sharp dip in the graph. Being the epicentre, China has the most knowledge and experience in dealing with the virus, which also acts as an essential factor in the doubling time's steady rise.

The doubling time of various countries is vastly affected by the preventive measures taken, top leadership role with lockdown implementation and attitude of its citizens. Countries such as Brazil where the lockdown has still not been enacted, the cases have risen steadily. Higher testing rates helped identify the hosts of the virus; thus, countries with mass testing have higher doubling time. The doubling time graph can also help countries where doubling time is low address the fact that increased medical staff and healthcare facilities are needed, including extra testing centres and PPE kits in countries with high cases. In terms of doubling rates, the worst affected countries are the developing countries due to their weak healthcare system covering an overpopulated expanse. If the conditions are not controlled, this may pose a severe threat to the country. The country with a weak economy suffered more due to underfunded health system and economic migration (causing the virus to spread to more regions). Unemployment recession and unstable jobs also cause incapable individuals to disobey the lockdown to meet their daily needs to survive. The concerned government plays the most crucial role. Thus, the need is for early and rapid actions for all the governments to control the virus's outreach. Therefore, countries such as China that acted quickly to contain virus spread did not have an explosion of cases, whereas Iran and Brazil lack acting swiftly. Countries such as Brazil where the political assemblies did not take necessary actions and ignored the importance of lockdown and social norms suffered heavily. The strategy of contact tracing and aggressive testing is not easier to replicate in countries with large populations, thus usually countries with high population density will show lower doubling rates (China being the outlier).",

The test positivity rate of countries such as Brazil and the United Kingdom is high, which shows that several other people suffer from the virus that is not getting tested. Thus, inadequate information may be available for a large extent of areas. Some governments' failure to provide transparent, up-to-date information about the spread of disease poses a barrier to precise results. There are specific patterns or sequence where the length of the path is unknown upfront, so it is hard to express with absolute certainty the outcome of the growth in the doubling time of the number of coronavirus positive cases. Analysis of COVID-19 pandemic requires multilayered parameters, here we have chosen an elementary model that could include the fundamental aspects of the dissimilarities in the doubling rate of cases of COVID-19 only. Another factor for possible bias is that the data used does not cover all the periods and countries from when the first case was recorded, thus making it tough to study homogenously about the outcomes.",

The datasets can be used in conjunction with other systems such as analytics cloud or machine learning. These data sets' patterns give insights on what further measures can be taken by the governing bodies to combat the deadly virus. The possibility of horizontal scalability is there such that no matter what amount of data is there, one can add more resources to the infrastructure and carry out further analysis. The COVID-19 outbreak reveals the significance of rapid actions and strategies in terms of containing the diseases to prevent any further pandemics. The lessons of this study can be learning for others and in dealing with multiple cases of outbreaks. The evolution of healthcare systems, scientific research and medical institutions with strong government support over the past years are important factors that could prove significant in containing any future diseases that may get spread on a global scale.",

There is also a component that may share the same denominator is the necessity for requisite healthcare systems and medical staff. Still, the shortage of this component does not certainly mean that taking necessary steps would be ineffective. Transmission of COVID-19 to humans by zoonosis reveals that the global community must be observant concerning similar pandemics in future. From what we have observed and from the inference that we have drawn, we can say that government response to the pandemic plays a vital role in affecting the virus's doubling time. Mass testing can help identify hosts of the virus and prevent the virus from spreading to other regions. Countries, where the virus spread early, had less time to be prepared and thus in initial stages, the doubling time suffered and vice versa. The people's attitude towards the government and the lockdown also alters the rate at which the doubling time increases. Thus countries such as Germany and South Korea did far better than the United States of America and Iran. The healthcare system and the economic conditions also affect the doubling time, where countries such as Peru and Brazil are immensely affected. The developing countries are the worst hit due to overpopulation and underfunded healthcare system and must take strictest measures to contain the virus spread.",
