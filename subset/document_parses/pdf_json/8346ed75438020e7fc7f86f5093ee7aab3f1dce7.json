On 22 January 2021, Aon plc released a statistical report, \"Weather, Climate & Catastrophe Insight 2020 Annual Report\". According to the report, the global direct economic losses and damages from natural disasters in 2020 were estimated at USD268 billion. Although much lower than the peak loss years of 2011 (USD557 billion) and 2017 (USD485 billion), it was above the average (USD244 billion) and median (USD246 billion) of the 21st century. Meanwhile, approximately 8100 people lost their lives due to natural catastrophe events in 2020 [3] . These economic losses and fatalities stemmed from multi-hazard disasters, including seasonal floods, hurricane Laura, cyclone Amphan, etc. Moreover, at the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 swept across the world and became the deadliest pandemic on the planet since the 1918 influenza pandemic. The World Health Organization estimated that more than 10% of the world's population may have been infected with the new coronavirus [3] . Despite the scientific and technological developments, it is still not possible to accurately predict and prevent the occurrence of some disasters [4] .",

In addition, publications such as proceedings paper, review, book review, abstract, editorial material, letter, and news, etc., were not considered in this review. Due to length limitations, conference papers from annual meetings lack important information needed to systematize (such as statistical and methodological crucial information, concrete analysis procedures), and the methods are often introduced into journal articles [36, 37] . Moreover, other types of publications are almost not involved in research hotspots or research frontiers of significance due to the publication length or lack of key information.",

The primary aim was to analyze emerging trends and predict future directions in a knowledge domain [39] . The analysis for the literature was based on keyword statistics. As the core vocabulary and phrase of an article, keywords are a highly concise summary of the article's theme. Keywords in an article can provide relevant information, such as research object, method, and research hotspots. Therefore, according to the above determined literatures, the time threshold was set on CiteSpace from January 2001 to January 2021, and one year was selected as the time slice. To remove redundant information and to ensure the clarity of the view, data from the top 50 levels of most frequently occurring nodes in each time slice were screened, and the combination strategy for pruning contained \"Pathfinder\" and \"Pruning sliced networks\". After completing the above configuration, the \"Author Keywords (DE)\" and \"Keyword\" were selected successfully as the term source and node type, respectively.",

References are tightly connected within the same clusters, but loosely connected among different clusters. In the object analysis function panel of CiteSpace, the node type \"Keyword\" was selected successively as the clustering basis, and CiteSpace's automatic clustering function was used to draw the scientific knowledge map. The size, the number of members in each cluster, is an essential prerequisite for cluster selection. Larger clusters with over 10 members tend to more representative than small clusters, which are likely to be grouped by the citation of a small number of publications. Moreover, the quality of a cluster is also reflected in terms of its silhouette value, namely, an indicator of its homogeneity or consistency. The silhouette score of a cluster tends to be close to 1, indicating that it is highly homogeneous. Table 5 lists eight major clusters considering the above conditions. The cluster label automatically selected by the log-likelihood ratio test method (LLR) mainly reflects a unique aspect of a cluster, and this method demonstrated by Professor Chaomei Chen is the best strategy for automatic cluster labeling [43] . Additionally, keywords with a frequency of not less than 5 were selected as the main keywords, which represent the research hotpots of each cluster. In Table 5 , these eight important clusters represent hotspot topics of urban disaster resilience research. Cluster #0 reflects the research topic \"disaster risk reduction\". Clusters #1, #2, and #4 focus on the research of resilience, including resilience assessment research and specific disaster resilience research. Clusters #3, #5, and #6 display the study of specific disasters, such as climate change, tsunami, and earthquake, etc. The last #7 keyword cluster presents the combination research topic \"vulnerability\". Thus, the four hotspot topics could be summarized as disaster risk reduction, specific disaster resilience research, resilience assessment, and combination research.",

Resilience assessment is an important aspect in urban disaster resilience studies, which has been gradually attracting research attention in recent years. For instance, a novel risk assessment method for evaluating disaster resilience capacity of hillslope communities in debris flow and landslide was established using logistic regression analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology [77] , and further, the appropriated parameters for the assessment were explored in the subsequent work [78] . Moreover, a qualitative case-based research method was used in studying success factors for enhancing urban community disaster resilience [33] . A climate-related community disaster resilience assessment framework was established, and three dimensions (the physical dimension, social dimension, and economic dimension) were included [79] . In the context of earthquake hazards, a community resilience assessment index was developed, which contained social resilience, economic resilience, institutional resilience, and physical resilience [69] .",

Four articles from top-ranked journals are included in this category, among which three are related to sustainability and one with vulnerability. The concepts of resilience and sustainability are extremely relevant in the sense that the consequences of natural disasters influence the social, environmental, and economic burden of cities. The urban infrastructure systems are widely acknowledged to be a lifeline of the urban system and play a vital role in urban resilience and sustainability. The combination of sustainability and resilience was considered in the areas of risk reduction and sustainable development for urban infrastructures, such as water distribution systems [80] , built environments, and critical infrastructures [81] . Moreover, research regarding contemporary urban planning and design and the provision of energy to building structures during earthquakes was also conducted for urban risk reduction and sustainable development [65] . As for vulnerability, in the 1990s, scholars found that after disasters, the discussion on \"vulnerability\" was not sufficient to describe a system facing risk events, while the ability of the system to recover rapidly showed high importance. Then, \"resilience\" was gradually utilized in disaster research [49] . For instance, strengthening local food systems will reduce the vulnerability of the community following extreme weather events and strengthen the resilience of large chain supermarkets [82] . ",

The goal of urban resilience is to shape a \"culture of resilience\" to mitigating damage and loss from disasters to the maximum degree [83] . Urban risk management in Africa was discussed, and the rise of resilience paradigms in urban development offered useful ways for risk-sensitive urban development [98] . The extent that community resilience mitigates climate-related damage was evaluated by a composite index in Fiji based on survey data [99] . The urban sectors were denoted that have better disaster governance for determining community resilience than rural sectors in three aspects, which are the responsibility of multiple levels of governments, the resource supply availability after disasters, and the politics of disaster [100, 101] . The disaster entrepreneurship is the private sector and takes advantage of business opportunities and serves community stakeholders to create value during or after a disaster [102] . A local community-driven bottom-top approach to mitigate risk and disseminate appropriate disaster risk information was proposed to promote community-based resilience [96, 103] . A conceptual model of a coupled human-landscape system in Swiss Alpine communities was developed to assess risk and community resilience, which is a theoretical innovation in developing disaster risk management plans for communities [104] . In practice, the disaster resilience practices in residential communities were identified, and the stakeholder views on disaster resilience practices of residential communities were analyzed [105] . Additionally, seven recommendations for enhancing the integration of natural hazard science into disaster risk reduction were set out, which can better contribute to the planning and development of sustainable and resilient communities [106] .",

The community skill requirements for enhancing disaster resilience were considered to relate to building environment professionals and five disaster resilience dimensions, which include society, economy, technology, environment, and institutions [107] . Several resilience enhancement strategies, including innovative models and methods, have been proposed. For example, a novel methodology based on a resilience metric called the Climatic Hazard Resilience Indicators for Localities (CHRIL) was established, using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis with a participatory geographic information system approach, which can encourage stakeholder participation and communication between planners in shaping metropolitan land-use policies [108] . A comprehensive approach, combining empirical experience, simulative methods, and engineering, was proposed, which could determine the quantities needed for urban areas' resilience and risk assessments and further help create more resilient cities [109] . The Community Disaster Resilience Scorecard self-testing was recognized as a useful method for improving community disaster resilience. Self-testing revealed that cross-community cooperation, better communication, and maximizing opportunities to compare plans are necessary for strengthening disaster resilience [110] . Sustainable flood memory, lay knowledge, and the development of community resilience from the theoretical and practical perspective were explored in relation to future flood risk [111] . Moreover, virtual communities of practice (VCoPs) were adopted for improving organization resilience, and a Delphi study was conducted to evaluate the contribution [112] .",

Various resilience assessment research was conducted and covered multiple aspects of resilience. For instance, using a questionnaire survey and a subjective assessment method, a flood resilience indicator system was established to measure community resilience in the Khyber Pukhthunkhwa province of Pakistan [134] . Similarly, a set of indicators in terms of social, economic, human, institutional, and environmental aspects were constructed to measure community disaster resilience and were applied to 229 local municipalities in Korea [135] . For coastal communities, a framework that innovatively disaggregates hurricane community resilience to the individual level and quantifies resilience for the individual residential buildings was proposed [136] . Moreover, for the coastal areas of China, the main driving factors of overall community resilience were identified, including a robust and developed economic system, effective education, training programs, and adequate investment [137] . The resilience inference measurement (RIM) model was used for assessing the community resilience to drought hazards of all 503 counties, and the results showed that the social, economic, agriculture, and health sectors were identified as the main resilience indicators [138] .",

A vulnerability-resilience indicator multi-criteria analysis was used to show the variability and contribution rate of the water-related risks [145] . The Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) was applied to assess the vulnerability-resilience of at-risk communities at Kelud Volcano [143] . In practice, the Vulnerability to Resilience (V2R) program implemented in Bangladesh showed that sustainable livelihoods had been well connected with disaster risk reduction [146] .

This framework defined strategic goals and initiative actions of disaster risk reduction from 2005 to 2015. Moreover, the programme \"Making Cities Resilient: My city is getting ready!\" was launched by the UN-Habitat in May 2010 to address urban risk and resilience and local risk governance. The campaign was assured through two documents related to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction issued in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The programme created a broad platform and alliance for dialogue and developed some basic tools for resilient capacity development and implementation. The programme will continue beyond 2020 with the recommendations of participants and partners. Moreover, the programme \"100 Resilient Cities\" was created by the 100 resilient cities in 2013 and focused on natural disasters and human disasters. The Medellin Collaboration for Urban Resilience was launched in 2014, which gathered the most prominent actors committed to building resilience globally, including UNISDR, Rockefeller Foundation, The World Bank Group, 100 Resilient Cities, etc. In addition, the Global Alliance for Urban Crises was established in May 2016. The leaders and members of the alliance have the resources and capacities to mitigate risk impacts on vulnerable conditions. Except for the projects launched by various international alliances and non-governmental organizations, some cosmopolitan cities, such as New York, London, Chicago, Rotterdam, and Tokyo, etc., have also joined the ranks of the development plan for enhancing urban resilience. Specifically, the 2015 plan for New York City, \"One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City (OneNYC)\" was originally released in 2007 and again in 2011 under the name \"PlaNYC\". This plan presented a grand vision of building a growing, prosperous, fair and equitable, sustainable, and resilient city. Additionally, Tokyo is located in the volcanic earthquake zone around the Pacific Ocean, and natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis occur frequently. In December 2014, the strategic report, \"Creating the Future: The Long-Term Vision for Tokyo\", was released by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The purpose of the report is to build into a world-class metropolis. In addition, the London Plan was launched by the UK government in March 2015, which aimed at building to be a top global city by 2036.",

The central focus of the initiative is to ensure that all new development is fully risk-informed, including climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, early warning, cities, and urban development, etc. Moreover, the Post-Disaster Housing project was proposed by the UN-Habitat, and the aim is to improve the quality of reconstructed houses. This project focus on the disasters such as floods, earthquakes, etc. and the restorative capacity of the urban system. Similar contents, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, are also focused on by the 100 Resilient Cities, which was created by the Rockefeller Foundation in 2013.

The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 determined a more comprehensive system for the planning, implementation, and assessment of disaster risk reduction activities. In 2015, a global disaster prevention and mitigation goal with specific projects and deadlines was firstly proposed in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.

In order to reduce the negative impacts of disasters and provide a foundation for sustainable development, the importance of building urban disaster resilience is increasingly realized. This paper gives a systematic review and analysis of the literature on urban disaster resilience. The review is based on keyword statistics and includes two steps. Firstly, the statistics for the basic research information were conducted from three aspects, which are the publication years, journals, and keywords. Accordingly, the annual distribution and research hotspots of the publications were obtained. Then, the second step was about the deeper analysis of urban disaster resilience research from three phases and four categories. Specifically, combined with the keyword statistical analysis results and clustering results, the main content was classified into four hotspot topics: (1) disaster risk reduction, (2) specific disaster resilience research, (3) resilience assessment, and (4) combination research. The review for the articles was conducted from these four categories. The results show that the first two categories are the major research categories, while the second and fourth categories show a high growth rate of published articles. The categories with high growth rates could be directions for future research on urban disaster resilience. The review maps a full picture of existing urban disaster resilience research.",

Specifically, the category disaster risk reduction presents the characteristics of the whole life cycle of disasters. From a temporal perspective, this feature corresponds to the concept of resilience, and it aims to reduce risk and improve resilience from all stages of a disaster. Additionally, resilience studies and practices for specific disasters can be helpful for urban resilience enhancement, with a focus on frequent occurrence disasters, such as earthquakes and climate-related disasters, etc. Resilience assessment research mainly presents a wide variety of indicators, which is conducive to putting forward targeted recommendations for resilience enhancement. Meanwhile, numerous novel assessment methods (such as framework and model, etc.) can also provide some guidance for the practices of improving urban resilience. The combination research includes two important concepts, namely, vulnerability and sustainability. Studies on vulnerability are not sufficient to reflect the whole life cycle of disasters, and the term resilience plays a compensatory role in urban disaster research. Moreover, urban resilience research also promotes urban sustainable development.
