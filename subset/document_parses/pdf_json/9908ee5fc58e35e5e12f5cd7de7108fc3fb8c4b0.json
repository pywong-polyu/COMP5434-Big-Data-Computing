The widespread online misinformation has been shown to affect users' beliefs and is connected to social impact such as polarization. In this work, we focus on misinformation's impact on specific user behavior and aim to understand whether general Twitter users changed their behavior after being exposed to misinformation. We compare the before and after behavior of exposed users to determine whether the frequency of the tweets they posted, or the sentiment of their tweets underwent any significant change. Our results indicate that users overall exhibited statistically significant changes in behavior across some of these metrics. Through language distance analysis, we show that exposed users were already different from baseline users before the exposure. We also study the characteristics of two specific user groups, multi-exposure and extreme change groups, which were potentially highly impacted. Finally, we study if the changes in the behavior of the users after exposure to misinformation tweets vary based on the number of their followers or the number of followers of the tweet authors, and find that their behavioral changes are all similar.",

However, prior work has focused more on the misinformation's general social effect, and very little work has been done to examine what and how specific user behavior is affected. We argue that it is crucial to study the details of specific behavioral changes after being exposed to misinformation. It can help us understand the process of how users succumb to misinformation and get affected negatively by exposure to misinformation. It can also help us identify specific user groups who are more likely to be vulnerable to misinformation and potentially even be radicalized. Some previous work studied the impact of COVID related misinformation on users' vaccine intent [15] , but they only focus on this specific type of misinformation. Limited work has focused on misinformation with broader topics and users' individual behavioral change.",

To identify whether there were significant changes in the tweeting behavior before and after exposure to misinformation, we selected objective behavioral metrics such as mean tweet count, mean sentiment score of tweets, and language usage distance.

Data Collection 1) Collecting Misinformation Tweets and the Exposed Users' Tweets: The goal of this research is to understand behavioral changes of Twitter users after being exposed to misinformation tweets. Therefore, the first step is to identify the tweets that have misinformation content. As there is no \"gold-standard\" misinformation detection model, we resorted to the expert fact-checked news source from PolitiFact as our \"seed\" to find the corresponding tweets. Since PolitiFact does not work on tweets, we crawled all the fact-checked Facebook text-only and viral image posts which are labelled as \"pants on fire\", \"false\" or \"mostly false\" from May 18, 2013 until Jan 31, 2021 (most of them are during 2018 to 2021). We crawled Facebook posts as it is also a social network platform and posts have a high probability of showing up on Twitter. Although PolitiFact also debunks politicians' and celebrities' claims, it turned out to be harder to directly search for them on Twitter. Figure 1 is an example of a fact-checked Facebook post on PolitiFact. For each debunked news post, we used the provided summary as the search term to search for the corresponding tweets on Twitter. To avoid unrelated results, we disregarded the posts whose summary was less than seven words. From the search response, we extracted the top-five tweets ranked by reply count. We removed the tweets that originated from fact-checking organizations, or that included any keyword regarding its veracity, e.g. \"conspiracy theory\", \"debunk\", and \"fake news\". We crawled 1,119 debunked news posts from PolitiFact and we found 442 of them on Twitter. From the search results, we were able to collect 529 tweets with misinformation content. Figure 2 shows an example of a tweet that we studied. After collecting all the tweets , we did a thorough verification to make sure our dataset only contained tweets with misinformed content. We manually removed all the tweets which were not misinformation and the users who replied to them, resulting in 399 tweets. For each of the collected tweets, we identified all the users who replied to it, which resulted in 25,619 users. Since the Fig. 2 : A sample tweet containing the misinformation before and after analysis was performed on the users who replied to the tweets, and each user replied at a different time, the \"zero\" time for each user refers to the time of the user's first reply to the tweet. This method allows us to aggregate before and after behavior across different users who were exposed to misinformation tweets at different times. For each user, we collected all of their tweets starting at six months before their respective zero time and until six months after their respective zero time. A period of 30 days was used in place of a calendar month.",

Both groups were used as the baselines for the short-term analysis (24 hours) and one of them was used for the long-term analysis (6 months). For the first baseline group, we used the target group to understand the behavioral change when the same users were exposed to tweets without misinformation. To construct this baseline, we randomly collected 5 replies (exposures) to other tweets for each user and collected tweets before and after the exposure within the short term (24 hours). The analyses on this baseline show the average behavior of the 5 exposures. We selected 5 exposures because we were not able to confirm if other exposures were to true news tweets, so we averaged multiple exposures to eliminate it. This baseline is only used for the short-term analysis because there is a high possibility of overlapping periods for different exposures when looking at longer term behavior and it may interfere with the analysis.",

Because it is difficult to find related tweets without misinformation, we searched the tweets that only contained true news. To achieve this, we extracted the entity from each misinformation tweet's text content using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) tool of Stanford CoreNLP [32] . Then, we collected all the recent tweets from known true news sources [33] and excluded some questionable ones in recent years (e.g. The Guardian) and did the same entity extraction process. For each entity from misinformation tweets, we chose a tweet with the same entity from the true-information tweet group with similar reply count. Due to the limitation of our crawling tools, only 3,200 most recent tweets could be fetched for each source, thus not all misinformation tweets could be matched. For the remaining unmatched misinformation tweets, we used their entities as the search term to search for related tweets. To ensure the tweet's veracity, we only considered tweets posted by verified accounts and gave priority to the known true news sources. We then selected tweets whose reply count was close to entity-matched misinformation tweets. Finally, we performed the same user scraping process as before to get users' tweets from 6 months before until 6 months after the exposure, and then removed potential bots. Table I shows the actual number of users we considered for the analysis. There are far fewer users in baseline 2 group for the long-term analysis because many of the tweets collected from reliable sources were very recent ones and the exposed users did not have 6-months worth of activities after exposure.",

Our analysis reveals that users' tweet count significantly increases after exposure in both short and long-term. We do not find significant change in users' sentiment score. Through language distance analysis, we find that different user groups (target group and baseline group) are already different before their respective exposure. We also find that users who are exposed to more than one misinformation tweet have weaker changes than those who are only exposed to one, and find these multi-exposure users are already at a high-activity level before exposure. For users who have extreme behavioral changes, we find that their tweet count increases and sentiment score changes do not align. The short-term and long-term change do not align either. Another finding is that popular exposed users and less-popular users both increased their tweeting frequency, and this finding also holds for the users that are exposed to misinformation tweets authored by high-follower count users and low-follower count users, while the users exposed to lowfollower-count-authored tweets generally post more tweets.",

These interactions can be a good and important source to study users' attitude and preference after the exposure. As it takes different efforts to reply, retweet and favorite a tweet, a future direction is to expand the \"exposure\" to retweets and favorites, and compare the differences of the behavior change of users with different types of exposure. Third, the baseline 1 was generated by averaging 5 other exposures because we didn't know if other exposed tweets are misinformation, which might cause the effect of \"flattening\" the behavioural changes.",

When collecting data from Politifact, we didn't differentiate the authenticity levels labelled by the experts (pants on fire, false, mostly false). A future direction on this can be studying if users' behavior change differently after exposure to misinformation with different authenticity level. Furthermore, as it has been shown that there are also different strategies used by misinformation [41] , [42] , understanding the effectiveness of different strategies and authenticity is important and useful for fighting misinformation, so that specific mitigation methods can be designed and applied accordingly.",
