Wolbachia is an intracellular bacterium that can be stably inserted into Ae. aegypti 3 . wMel infected mosquitoes have been shown to have reduced ability to harbour and transmit different arboviruses, including dengue and chikungunya viruses [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Results of field trials in multiple countries have shown successful establishment of wMel in the local Aegypti population following a release period of several weeks or months [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In a cluster randomised controlled trial of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti deployments in Indonesia, wMel quickly reached greater than 90% penetration which was followed by a significant reduction in dengue incidence and dengue hospitalisations in intervention areas 9, 13 . wMel has also been shown to reduce both dengue and chikungunya incidence in Niteroi, Brazil 14 .",

All releases used this newly developed locally-matched insecticide resistant mosquito strain. Releases started in August 2017 and continued until the end of 2019. Release points were distributed regularly every 50m in five release zones. Around 100 wMel-infected mosquitoes were released each time. A network of 1,168 BG sentinel traps was used to monitor wMel introgression. The traps were regularly distributed throughout the release area with an average distance between two adjacent traps of 250m. A trap was set four weeks after the first release in the area and collection was conducted every other week from then on (N=36,894 trap collections). Up to ten Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (male and female) per collection were tested individually for wMel using qPCR. This gives an estimation of the global proportion of mosquitoes that were infected in a given trap at a given time.",

Two different exclusion criteria were designed. First, we excluded space-time units within which releases occurred, this resulted in the exclusion of 57% space-time units with a non-zero wMel value. The second, more exclusive criterion was to exclude from the analysis space-time units both for the month of the release and the subsequent month.

It has not previously been possible to quantify the protective effect of low-moderate wMel prevalence, because rapid establishment has generally been observed following wMel deployments in other settings 8, 9, 12 and arboviral case notification data is not commonly available at a high spatial resolution 14 . Here we report a dose-response relationship between wMel levels and relative reductions in dengue and chikungunya case incidence. A small but significant protective effect against dengue was seen even at very low local wMel prevalence (\u226410%) and where wMel was >60% the protective effect was 76% (95%CI 64-71%), which is comparable to results reported previously (using different methods) from the neighbouring municipality of Niteroi, and from Indonesia 9 .",

Underlying dengue and chikungunya incidence in the city is highly heterogeneous. We found that wMel introgression was lower in areas that annually see high disease incidence. There were also seasonal fluctuations in wMel introgression with lower levels observed in February to May, which represent the hottest periods of the year. High temperatures have been linked to lower wMel acquisition in laboratory studies 27 . The release program also made fewer releases during the summer months, which may contribute to this observed seasonal effect. The areas of the city with stubbornly high dengue and chikungunya incidence may have factors that also complicate the wMel release program, including large, heterogeneously distributed baseline mosquito populations, or are in areas that are hard to access, including favela communities. Ae. albopictus also circulates in Rio but has not been incriminated as being involved in dengue and chikungunya incidence 28 .

However, these large trials may not always be feasible, especially when resources are limited. Our study highlights how the systematic geocoding of cases provides a valuable resource to understand where incidence is concentrated that can also act as a reference point to evaluate the impact of spatially targeted interventions. However, we have shown that alongside detailed data, we need to use structured models to appropriately measure these datasets. For example, our finding that wMel introgression achieved in a location was correlated with the incidence of dengue and chikungunya in that same location in years prior to the intervention, highlighted the complexity of using observational case data to understand the impact of an intervention whose penetration is itself spatially and temporally uneven. It is only through spatiotemporally structured models that we can disentangle these different correlation structures to identify the underlying impact of the intervention.",
