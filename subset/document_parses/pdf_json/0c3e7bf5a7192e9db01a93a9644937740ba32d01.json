The WHO and governments keep disclosing epidemic information, but the disclosure is based on their own endowments, preferences, and perceptions, resulting in misleading information at least in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, such as \"Masks work? NO\" (quoted from Scott Atlas, the White House coronavirus task force member), \"This is a flu. This is like a flu\" (quoted from Donald Trump, the president of the US), and \"There is some immune system variation with Asian people\"(quoted form Taro Aso, the Deputy Prime Minister of Japan), etc. This information failed to alert the public but let their guards down instead. Then, the high mortality rate and emergency announcements subsequently incited widespread fear and exacerbated the epidemic situation. Theoretically, a systematic provision of timely and effective information from the government can mitigate the downsides [5] . However, in the real world, speed entails inaccuracy and cognitive uncertainty that keep government away from accomplishing such a tough mission [6] . Thus, in the early stage of an epidemic with strong externalities like COVID-19, the government's choice between timeliness and effectiveness of intervention strategies raises a theoretical challenge for the management of urgent public health crisis.",

            "text": "The key to successfully contain the spread of an unexpected disease like COVID-19 is to understand the complicated two-way interaction between the dynamics of disease and those of information (and the human behavior response to information) [7] . Information might either amplify or diminish the public's response to a risk event, depending on the transmission of risk information and public's reactions at the time it occurs [8] . At the micro-level, one's behavior depends on the epidemiological status of the disease, the individual's knowledge about it (information accessed), misinformation, and the individual's education and income level [9] . Along with the spread of disease in social life (physical level), information spreads in a virtual network, which brings the awareness of crisis for people [10] [11] [12] , leading them to take preventive measures to stay healthy [13, 14] . Therefore, the spread of disease facilitates the spread of information, which in turn inhibits the spread of disease [15, 16] . However, on the other hand, people usually get illogical, fail to discern falsity, and disregard the truth during information dissemination [17, 18] . Misleading information seems to have a natural disposition to resonate with public opinions, which causes spontaneous misrepresentation in transmission [19] . In addition, discussions on epidemic bring panic [20] and aggravate the harm of the epidemic [21] , which will be further exaggerated by social media [22] . Meanwhile, increasing uncertainty about the disease makes people feel loss of control and boost people's anxiety [23] , usually accompanied by psychological distress [24] . Therefore, information is critical to fighting against the COVID-19-crisis [25, 26] , and improper information management strategy may lead to systematic failure [27] .",

The minimal blocking implies a free and open information environment, which stimulates information to be widely diffused and induces more people to take selfprotective measures [31] , but \"rumors\" might also proliferate at the mean time [24] . Even if (under certain premises) some \"rumors\" are accurate [7, 32, 33] , it might still interrupt the prevention efforts to the epidemic. It is always believed that government should perform as a central node to disclose accurate and up-to-date information to the entire society, so as to keep the public away from untruthful information and prompt the public to make informed decisions about health protection [30, 34] . However, in the real world, governments do face time constraints and the trade-off between being accurate and being up-to-date in terms of information disclosing, which is not considered in classical information theory. Because a highly infectious disease caused by unknown viruses with great externality, such as COVID-19, spreads together with information of varying qualities (truthfulness, accuracy, etc.), it is highly probable that the disease has already contaminated the society before low-quality information is purged. In this case, the government has no way to disclose accurate information in time, resulting in the loss of public trust and raising the doubt of the public on the governing capacity of the government, which will accelerate epidemic outbreak [35] [36] [37] . Therefore, governments need to not only decide when to inject information into the network, but also whether to follow the tenet that governments do not and should not block information spreading at any circumstance [38] .",

These studies argued that, even if governments have the power to control information [45] , they should not do that because free spread of information is essential to welfare-maximizing [38] . This argument is based on two underlying assumptions: (1) publishers are completely competitive to reach an equilibrium of disclosing accurate information; (2) there is no time constraint. These two assumptions do not apply for COVID-19 because, in the age of Internet media, people are not incentive compatible to spread accurate information. Moreover, such highly externalized infectious diseases caused by unknown viruses might have already infected a considerable amount of people before low-quality information is purified, so the government should not simply adhere to the tenet of not blocking information when facing an unknown health crisis [38] . As a result, we will discuss the complexity and diversity in information blocking and broaden current information control theory.",

To better understand the failure in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, we here construct an information-behavior bi-layer model by adding a parallel layer of information transmission to the classical SI (Susceptible-Infected) model of infectious diseases. We intend to describe the effect of heterogeneous virtual information (at information layer) on heterogeneous nodes' behaviors (at physical layer) [46] . The government, as the key node in information network, can influence the entire network through information disclosing and blocking. Based on this, we assign values to key variables such as the medical awareness level of the virus and the public's health awareness level and then conduct computer simulation experiments under different scenarios. We reveal the pattern of government information intervention based on the simulation results. In addition, we only focus on the emergence stage of the infectious disease, during which the recovery from the infected status, such as self-healing and cure of the disease, is omitted [47] ; therefore, the base model is the SI model rather than the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovery) model.",

We introduce the non-dualism of information and the heterogeneity of nodes' behaviors into the epidemic model and conduct a simulation to reveal the information intervention dilemma faced by the government between information disclosing and blocking. We find that governments face a trade-off between speed and accuracy in information disclosing; and the optimal strategy is contingent on varying conditions in information blocking. The optimal combination of disclosing and blocking is highly sensitive to the government preference and its governance capacity. Governments that are only responsible for the outcome of intervention will focus unilaterally on the accuracy at the expense of speed; a risk-averse government that intends to minimize the maximum infection rate under uncertain scenarios will impose a more restrictive blocking; and the most restrictive blocking strategy might be the best for governments with lower capability and credibility.",

First, existing studies did not pay sufficient attention to the spread and evolution of rumors during a public crisis [48] [49] [50] , which is considered in our study. We expounded the impacts of information dissemination on epidemic evolution in scenarios with different levels of medical awareness of the virus, public health awareness, and government preferences and credibilities, which complements the research in this field. Second, most current studies regard information and disease transmissions as simultaneously happened and jointly induced by the physical movement of an agent [46] , while this is not the case during COVID-19 pandemic as the internet obviates the needs for physical contact in information transmissions [51] . Thus, in our paper, we separate the information and disease transmissions and investigate the impact of heterogeneous information on the individual behaviors and disease dynamics. Third, unlike previous research on government information interventions with known risk [5, [28] [29] [30] , ours are on government information interventions with unknown risk. The lack of prior knowledge on the Corona-SARS-2 is the most striking feature of the COVID-19 pandemic, which weakens the usefulness of government action and calls for a reassessment of government information intervention under a crisis environment with high uncertainty. To this end, this paper demonstrates a couple of intervention dilemmas faced by government, which complements the existing theories.",

Some people, once informed about the epidemic, wear a mask and practice social distance to not expose themselves to the virus-while others panicked, herded, and behaved irrationally because of bad news, exemplified by flocking to churches for psychological comfort [53] , to supermarkets for daily supplies [54] , and taking radical actions like repeated hospital visits [55] . Thus, in this paper, we group the population by susceptibleness to irrational behavior caused by information described by an exogenous parameter-individual threshold X I that distinguishes whether an individual is panic-prone or non panic-prone by comparing it with the amount of information the individual has. An above-threshold (under-threshold) information denotes a (non) panicprone individual. For a panic-prone node, we assume its probability of going to gathering spots instead of maintaining the original trajectory is 1 \u2212 x \u00b7,a , where x \u00b7,a is the amount of information it has. For a non panic-prone node, we assume that its probability of not moving is r \u00b7,N = x \u00b7,a . Thus, the behavioral routine is as follows (see Figure 1 for a simplified example): a node moves along with its path with a maximum radius d 1 , and the actual distance it moves obeys a uniform distribution in (0, d 1 ); this node will randomly choose one of the gathering spots if intending to go to one in this period; every individual node follows this routine, then we have an evolving geographical distribution M t of the population moving in period t. The uninfected will contact everyone within the maximum infection radius d 2 and there is a probability \u00b5 of being infected for each contact. Throughout the simulation analysis, we focus on the impact of three key parameters, the initial information ( ), individual threshold (X I ), and disclosing threshold (X D ), which are the most important quantities to measure the impact of government intervention on the coupled information-disease dynamics. The initial information is the source of all information, which denotes the medical awareness of the virus; the individual threshold is a parameter to distinguish the population by groups set above, the smaller it is, the higher the level of public health awareness. Disclosing the threshold, chosen by the government, measures its relative priority to speed and accuracy in information dissemination. One of the objectives of our experiment is to ascertain the optimal disclosing threshold. Government prioritizes speed more as its threshold is lower, \"0\" means that government discloses the information immediately upon receipt; \"1\" means that government only discloses completely accurate information.",

Specifically, the optimal disclosing threshold lies between both ends in about 84.09% of the cases, and their distributions vary in different external constraints. Figure 3a ,b show that (1) if the initial information is 1 or 0.8 and the individual threshold is in [0, 0.7], the optimal disclosing threshold has a 91.75% probability of being in the middle, and mostly (66.89%) falls within [0.6, 0.8]; (2) if the initial information is 0.6 and the individual threshold is in [0, 0.5], the government has a 93.00% probability of dealing with a trade-off (Figure 3c) , and the optimal disclosing threshold mostly (77.78%) falls in [0.4, 0.6]; (3) if the initial information is 0.4, the optimal disclosing threshold will almost certainly be greater than 0.4 (99.98%), but the distribution is too scattered to give a specific interval (Figure 3d ).

Blocking low-quality information not only increases the overall information of the whole population, but causes side effects under certain external conditions. Thus, not blocking can be an optimal strategy in some cases. In this section, we provide an in-depth analysis of the data and a mechanistic analysis. Figure 5b reveals in general the optimal blocking threshold negatively correlates with initial information: as initial information drops from 1 to 0.4, the probability of optimal blocking threshold taking 0 will be 52.07%, 27.27%, 1.65%, and 0%, respectively. Figure 5c shows a positive correlation between optimal blocking threshold and individual threshold. Governments block information mainly by suppressing less-accurate information, but which, once implemented, will slow down the overall information dissemination in the network anyway. Therefore, blocking can neither be too stringent nor too liberal, an optimal one usually lies in between.

A lower credibility will discount the effects of disclosing information or even annul it, which makes a total blocking optimal as shown in Figure 6c ,d. The bankruptcy of government credibility originates in two ways: (1) the government's past mediocre performance; (2) the public's inherent belief in \"small government\". Meanwhile, a similar experience in the past also affected government responses and effects, as we can see with the horrible painful memories of SARS inducing vigilance for COVID-19 in East Asia countries, while the U.S. and Europe were indifferent in the early stage of this pandemic.",

For instance, our discussion focuses mainly on the theoretical mechanisms behind the joint spreading process of information and epidemic, and the proposed intervention strategies have not yet been analyzed with the real-world data. One reason for the lack of empirical analysis is the complex set-up of the bi-layered network model. The information dissemination network and the physical-layer contact network are not precisely observable in the real world, which makes it challenging for acquiring sufficient data for model fitting. On the other hand, the observed infection and information dissemination process are often already intervened in by the government; therefore, it is hard to separate the net effect of government intervention from the expost spreading data. Then, it is technically difficult to quantify the key parameters of intervention. To this end, we believe more sophisticated empirical techniques have to be introduced for the implement data-oriented analysis of our model, such as the network reconstruction and the causal detection techniques, which forms a promising direction for future investigation.
