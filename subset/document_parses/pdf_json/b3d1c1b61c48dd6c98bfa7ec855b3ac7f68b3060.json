Doxycycline is widely reported to possess immunomodulatory activity through inhibition of various inflammatory pathways. Considering the broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity, protective effect of doxycycline was evaluated in clinically relevant murine polymicrobial sepsis model induced by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, sepsis is accompanied with infection and therefore ceftriaxone at sub-protective dose was combined to retard the bacterial growth. Three hours after CLP challenge, mice were administered vehicle, ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg subcutaneously) alone and in combination with immunomodulatory dose of doxycycline (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and survival were monitored for 5 days. Bacterial count in blood and peritoneal fluid along with cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1] and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in plasma and lung homogenate were measured at 18 h post-CLP. Plasma glutathione (GSH) was also determined. Doxycycline in presence of ceftriaxone improved survival of septic mice by significantly reducing the plasma and lung pro-inflammatory cytokines and MPO levels. It also increased plasma GSH levels. Doxycycline did not improve antibacterial effect of ceftriaxone in combination, suggesting that the protective effect of doxycycline was due to its immunomodulatory activity. Doxycycline in the presence of ceftriaxone demonstrated improved survival of septic mice by modulating the immune response.",

Despite of advanced treatment options, the mortality rate reported from acute lung injury is 30-50% [3] . Sepsis is a hyper-inflammatory condition manifested due to excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in response to exotoxin or endotoxin released by bacteria [4, 5] . Uncontrolled levels of these cytokines along with free oxygen species and MPO released by neutrophils have been linked to organ dysfunction and mortality in sepsis [6] [7] [8] . Neutrophils are also known to release matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 that in excess amount are reported to cause degradation of extracellular matrix of endothelial basement membrane, disrupt resident cells and instigate further inflammation [9, 10] .",

            "text": "The primary action for management of sepsis is to timely treat patients with effective antibiotics. Since sepsis is an inflammatory condition, therapies modulating host immunity are also under clinical investigation to manage the secondary complications associated with sepsis [11] . Tetracycline antibacterial agents such as minocycline and doxycycline have been widely reported to exhibit antiinflammatory action. As a result of this activity, tetracyclines have displayed clinical benefits in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, including gingivitis, periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, skin infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome [12] [13] [14] . Milano et al. and Agostino et al. had earlier reported survival benefit of doxycycline in LPS-induced sepsis in mice through significant reduction in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase [15, 16] . Sun et al. had demonstrated suppression of cytokines and chemokines production by doxycycline in LPSstimulated THP-1 cell lines via modulating the phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB, p38 and ERK1/2/MAPK pathways [17] . Few earlier studies have also demonstrated the beneficial effect of doxycycline on Influenza virus, allergen and bleomycin induced acute lung injury through inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 [9, 18] . Doxycycline in combination with ceftriaxone has been earlier reported to ameliorate neuroinflammation and survival of rats affected with pneumococcal meningitis [19] . Clinically doxycycline was found to reduce the serum levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever [20] .",

This is a first ever study undertaken to examine the survival benefit of doxycycline in combination with ceftriaxone in a CLP sepsis model. Although, doxycycline possesses antibacterial activity towards few strains of enteric bacteria, its bacteriostatic effect may not provide advantage in controlling the bacterial growth after CLP intervention.

Based on this finding, doxycycline dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg was selected for the subsequently performed CLP model. Doxycycline 50 and 100 mg/kg dose groups were initially studied for survival benefit in the CLP sepsis model where untreated CLP control group showed 100% mortality by 24 h.

Augmented levels of oxidative enzyme such as MPO and low levels of endogenous antioxidant such as GSH are also known as key contributors of tissue damage [28] . MPO is peroxidase enzyme abundantly expressed in neutrophils and released at the infection site following chemotaxis. It causes tissue damage by producing reactive oxygen species, promoting release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulating migration neutrophils to the site of infection [29] . Pia Villa et al. had earlier demonstrated that depletion of GSH in CLP-challenged mice inhibited migration of neutrophils into peritoneal fluid that largely favoured bacterial growth, promoted neutrophil infiltration into lung, all of which significantly contributed to higher mortality rate [30] .",

However, both the doses did not exhibit significant survival benefit prompting us to combine with subprotective dose of ceftriaxone. Though doxycycline is inhibitory (bacteriostatic) to enteric bacteria, it is devoid of bactericidal activity which might be the reason for lack of much needed infection control in acute CLP sepsis model. The doxycycline 50 mg/kg dose in combination with ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg dose demonstrated remarkable immunomodulatory activity. The standalone ceftriaxone did not provide significant survival benefit but there was a bacterial load reduction in surviving animals.

The combination group not only suppressed the plasma levels of cytokine, MPO and GSH but also had significant effect on the lung cytokine and MPO levels. These observations confirmed that infection control in conjunction with immunomodulatory effect is necessary for survival. Interestingly, the highest dose of doxycycline 100 mg/kg in combination with ceftriaxone did not result in dose dependant improved survival rather mortality rate was not different than that of CLP control group. This observation cannot be readily attributable to toxicity as LPS-treated or CLP-untreated mice tolerated this dose. Further investigation is required to understand this aspect of doxycycline. As we highlight the beneficial effect of doxycycline, it should be noted that our study employed only a single administration of doxycycline. Since the CLP model was very acute, studying the multiple doses was not feasible. Further, assessing the effect of doxycycline in later phase of sepsis was also not practicable.
