In anticipation of the projected surge of COVID-19 cases, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and city of Boston set up a plan to establish alternate care sites (e.g., field hospitals) 1 to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients requiring acute and subacute care. 2, 3 Local models based on data from Wuhan, China 4 projected an estimated 0.7% to 2.5% of the population of the state of Massachusetts to be infected, with a peak incidence estimated to occur between April 10 and April 20, 2020. This projection predicted the need for 2,500 to 7,500 acute care hospital beds, a number which would have exceeded the established bed capacity of the catchment area. 5, 6 A field hospital named \"Boston Hope\" was rapidly deployed within 2 weeks as a collaborative venture between the major city hospitals and federal and state government agencies to serve the emergent anticipated needs of the Greater Boston and eastern Massachusetts areas. 7 Boston Hope was initially set up to provide care for low-acuity patients and was equipped and staffed according to the level of a skilled nursing facility. The need to provide a solution for a large number of patients, as well as a predicted large number of COVID-positive undomiciled persons, led to the design of a 500-bed medical facility ( fig. 1 ) alongside a 500-bed shelter for those not requiring continuous medical care. Care units were designated as pods of forty patients each, staffed with one medical doctor (only in higher-level moderate acuity pods), two advanced practice providers, five registered nurses, five to 10 certified nurse assistants, three to six physical/occupational therapists, and a resource specialist/unit coordinator. In addition, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, social workers, mental health specialists, and case management workers shared coverage across the pods.

Delays in the paging activation process resulted in noticeable delays in the assembly of the rapid response team. During two simulation drills, the rapid response call was placed seconds after recognition of the emergency; however, the pagers were activated only after the patient's entrance to the negative pressure room several minutes later. Investigation of these events revealed that extensive time was lost in exchanging information between the caller and the operator, such as the patient's name, location, call-back number, and the read-back by the operator. The timely donning of personal protective equipment for a rapid response call was complicated by the need for the members of the rapid response team to locate their own reusable face-shield and N-95 respirator mask, which were placed on numbered shelves. This created a further delay in response. Difficulties were also seen when attempting to open automated external defibrillators, because it was not intuitive for most providers to lift an unmarked latch to open the box.

By creating a hybrid acute care-ICU, we were able to further expand the capabilities of this hospital to provide a unique service to our patient population and strained regional health systems. The process of establishing this service required continuous quality improvement and rapid cycle iterative change to provide streamlined safe and efficient care. The plausibility of establishing an acute service with rapid response capabilities, within a pressured time frame, has been reported by several major centers globally. 23, 24 However, these reports do not describe in detail which methods of improvement were used to address local, site-specific issues, which we believe are key learning points from our experience.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 891, "end": 893, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "the impact of Quality improvement Methodology"}, {"text": "recommendations Inherent risks are associated with the redesign, repurposing, or expansion of healthcare services, especially if these are done within a rapid timeframe. 25, 26 Therefore, a prospective approach to diagnosing workflow failures as well as a strategy for continuous detection, improvement, and simulation training are paramount in providing a safe and efficient care environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 174, "end": 176, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "the impact of Quality improvement Methodology"}, {"text": "Process mapping is a key principle in quality improvement to truly understand the sequence of actions within a workflow. 27 When combined with interdisciplinary on-site walkthroughs, the identification of risk or potential for failures within a process becomes apparent. 14 In our initial planning stages at Boston Hope, the use of these tools enabled the rapid and urgent acquisition of critical supplies and the creation of patient rescue protocols tailored to this unique environment.

The accumulated experience at Boston Hope may serve as a foundation for preparedness and training of anesthesia and other acute care providers. 28 limitations We delineated our single-center experience of rapid capacity expansion in the setting of a pandemic. It is likely that the logistic and safety considerations highlighted in our experience may have been influenced by local and regional factors and interventions and thus may not be completely extrapolated to other rapidly deployed systems developed for similar function.
