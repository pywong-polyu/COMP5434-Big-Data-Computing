These patients also develop lower antibody titers after vaccination. Therefore, factors associated with antibody titers and vaccine efficacy in HDP with breakthrough infection need to be investigated. Methods We measured anti-S1 antibody titers in HDP (n = 104) and controls (n = 35), evaluating the influence of background on HDP by multivariable regression analysis. We classified 26 HDP patients admitted with COVID-19 into the unvaccinated (n = 15) and breakthrough infection group (n = 11), performing between-group comparisons of laboratory findings and prognosis. Vaccinated COVID-19 patients were classified into HDP and non-HDP controls, and compared the relationship between antibody titer and severity, and the prognosis of breakthrough infection.",

The breakthrough infection group had significantly better laboratory findings (KL-6 and LDH), severity, and hospitalization period than the unvaccinated group even if antibody titers were lower than the known threshold for neutralization (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in prognosis between the HDP and non-HDP with breakthrough infection. Severity of COVID-19 tended to be higher with lower antibody titer in non-HDP, but not in HDP. Conclusion Vaccines improved the severity of COVID-19 and hospitalization period of breakthrough infection in HDP, although HDP, especially in elderly smokers had lower antibody titers than control. There was no significant association between antibody titer and severity in HDP.",

Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 than the general population (5-16 times higher) with a mortality rate of nearly 20% [2] . Currently, since there are few drugs to effectively treat COVID-19, and HD patients are at particularly higher risk, major nephrology societies have recommended priority vaccination for HD patients [3] . To assess humoral immune responses after vaccination, quantitative assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is widely used, because anti-spike IgG antibody titers strongly correlated with neutralization [4, 5] . Since HD patients have difficulty developing and maintaining sufficient humoral immunity from vaccination against influenza or hepatitis B, it is believed that HD patients may not develop and maintain sufficient humoral immunity from COVID-19 vaccination [6] . Therefore, it is important to investigate what kinds of factors affect the antibody titers in HD patients.",

As a result, only age and smoke were significantly independent factors associated with antibody titer. There was a non-significant negative correlation between age and antibody titer (A). Antibody titers were significantly lower in smoker than in non-smoker immune responses in HD patients [8] . Therefore, the low vaccine antibody titer of COVID-19 is likely to be caused by dysfunction of both innate and adaptive immunity in HD patients. Humoral and B-cell responses against the COVID-19 vaccine were markedly impaired in HD patients compared to controls. Additionally, although most antigen-specific B cells in the control group were identified in the plasmablast or post-switch memory B cells, they were identified among pre-switch and na\u00efve B cells in HD patients [10] . Among HD patients, characteristics of patients with particularly low antibody titers have been investigated. Older age, BMI under 30, low albumin level, and low intravenous iron dose were identified as factors affecting antibody titer by multivariable analysis [3] . In our study, only age and smoking history were significantly independent factors associated with antibody titer (Table 1 ).

            "text": "Smoking is associated with a dysfunctional immune system, and it was previously reported that antibody titers following influenza vaccination decline more rapidly in smokers [11] . It is assumed that decreased immune function due to old age and smoking habit led to low antibody titer. As high and repeated doses of hepatitis B vaccine are recommended for HD patients [12] , and the third dose of COVID-19 vaccine enhances humoral response, especially in those with lower antibody titers after the second dose [13] , a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should also be considered in HD patients, especially elderly smoking patients. Over 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported in the United States, and 10% of patients are hospitalized [14] . In the general population, the rate of severe complications or death among the vaccinated group was threefold lower than that of matched unvaccinated controls, and age is the most important factor affecting outcomes of breakthrough infection [15] . Furthermore, vaccinated HD patients had lower rates of infection and significantly higher survival rates than unvaccinated controls [16] . In the present study, the severity of COVID-19, and number of admission days were significantly lower in the breakthrough infection group than the unvaccinated group among HD patients ( Table 2 ). These results indicates that the vaccine prevented severe complication after breakthrough infection. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 worsen around 7-10 days from onset due to systemic hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled cytokine overproduction. To prevent this cytokine overproduction, the rapid reduction of viral load by the early antiviral response is most important [17] . Our study showed that, LDH level, which was not significantly different on admission day, was significantly lower in the breakthrough infection group at the maximum level during hospitalization. In addition, CRP and ferritin levels during hospitalization tended to be less exacerbated in the breakthrough infection group (Table 2, Fig. 3) , implying that the early antiviral response activated by the vaccine prevented the cytokine overproduction. However, it is possible that the differences in treatment affected on the difference in prognosis between the two groups. Since remdesivir has been reported to significantly better prognosis compared to favipiravir [18] , the low rate of remdesivir administration may have had negative impact on prognosis in unvaccinated group. In addition, among cases with moderate or higher, 6 out of 9 patients in the breakthrough infection group, while only 1 out of 15 patients in the unvaccinated group were administered Casirivimab/Imdevimab. Furthermore, 3 out of 7 patients with critical in the unvaccinated group did not receive TCZ and steroid pulse therapy (2 of 3 patients died). Even with the above possibilities, we still think that the vaccine prevented the severe complications of COVID-19. While developing antibodies through a vaccine is important, it is still unclear whether the antibody titer itself causes clinical differences. In vitro, anti-S1 antibody above 4160 AU/mL is the threshold corresponding to a 0.95 probability of obtaining a PRNT ID50 at a 1:250 dilution [19] . Further, higher antibody titers were associated with both a lower risk of breakthrough infection and lower viral RNA copy number [5] . However, there are no generally accepted clinical cutoff values for antibodies to protect against breakthrough infections or to prevent severe disease. All patients with breakthrough infection in HD patients and non-HD patients had antibody titers of less than 4160 AU/mL (Supplement Table 3 ). In these cases, there were no fatal cases regardless of antibody titers, except for one case in the non-HD group, suggesting that the vaccine could prevent severe disease to some extent. In addition, there was no significant difference in COVID-19 severity or and the hospitalization period between the HD and non-HD patients with breakthrough infection (Table 3) . Among patients with post-vaccine infection, some HD patients became severely to critically ill even with antibody levels of about 2000-4000 AU/mL. On the other hand, in non-HD patients, those who became severely to critically ill had antibody levels of less than 200 AU/mL. Therefore, we compared these two groups to investigate the difference in antibody titer and disease severity. Non-HD patients tended to have a higher severity of disease with lower antibody titers (Fig. 4A) . Of the four non-HD patients with higher severity, two had received only one dose of vaccine, and the other two had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and stage IV pancreatic cancer, respectively (Supplement Table 3 ). It is unclear whether the reason for the low antibody levels in these patients was due to the underlying disease, but these immunocompromised patients require sufficiently high antibody levels to prevent severe disease. On the other hand, in HD patients, there were cases of moderate or severe even with antibody titers around 4000 AU/mL (Fig. 4B ), suggesting that due Table 3 Clinical course of HD and non-HD patients with breakthrough infection to impaired immunity, much higher antibody titers were required for the prevention of onset and severity in HD patients. According to these results, a third vaccination should be considered for immunocompromised patients in the appropriate time. Important limitations of our study include the small number of patients with breakthrough infections. Additionally, we measured anti-S1 antibody titers to investigate the effect of the vaccine on humoral immunity, but have not been able to examine neutralization titers or cellular immunity. Further, although we only applied samples collected within 2 weeks before to 3 days after the onset of COVID-19, we could not unify the measurement time after the onset of COVID-19. The antibody titer did not rise within 3 days after onset in past report [20] and samples would be properly preserved within 2 weeks, The number of breakthrough infections is expected to increase; therefore, a study with a larger number of patients is required in the future.",

There was no significant association between antibody titer and severity in HD patients. Fig. 4 Association between severity and antibody titer in post-vaccine infection. To investigate the relationship between the antibody titer and the prognosis, we plotted the severity of COVID-19 on the X-axis and antibody titer on the Y-axis in patients admitted with COVID-19 after at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The severity tended to be higher with lower antibody titer in non-HD patients. However, in HD patients, there were two cases of moderate or severe even with antibody titers around 4000 AU/ mL, while all mild cases had antibody titers under 1000 AU/ mL. ",

To investigate the relationship between the antibody titer and the prognosis, we plotted the severity of COVID-19 on the X-axis and antibody titer on the Y-axis in patients admitted with COVID-19 after at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The severity tended to be higher with lower antibody titer in non-HD patients. However, in HD patients, there were two cases of moderate or severe even with antibody titers around 4000 AU/ mL, while all mild cases had antibody titers under 1000 AU/ mL. HD hemodialysis",
