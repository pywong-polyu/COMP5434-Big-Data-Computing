In other words, they look at identifying false claims and analyzing reactions to them on social media (Hossain et al., 2020; Alam et al., 2021; Weinzierl et al., 2021) . This approach, while definitely a necessary component in fighting the infodemic, does not provide policy makers and health-professionals with much needed information, characterizing the reasons and attitudes that underlie the health and well-being choices individuals make. * Equal contribution Our goal in this paper is to suggest a holistic analysis framework, providing multiple interconnected views of the opinions expressed in text. We specifically focus on a timely topic, attitudes explaining vaccination hesitancy. Figure 1 describes an example of our framework. Our analysis identifies the stance expressed in the post (anti-vaccination) and the reason for it (distrust of government). Given the ideologically polarized climate of social media discussion on this topic, we also aim to characterize the moral attitudes expressed in the text (oppression), and how different entities mentioned in it are perceived (\"Biden, Government\" are oppressing, \"citizens, us\" are oppressed). When constructing this framework we tackled three key challenges.",

While stance prediction is an established NLP task, constructing the space of possible arguments justifying stances on a given topic, and their identification in text, are still open challenges. We take a human-in-the-loop approach to both problems. We begin by defining a seed set of relevant arguments based on data-driven studies (Weinzierl et al., 2021; Sowa et al., 2021) , where each reason is defined by a single exemplar sentence. In a sequence of interactions, we use a pre-trained textual inference model to identify paraphrases in a large collection of Covid-19 vaccination tweets, and present a visualization of the results to humans. Humans then perform an error analysis, and either add more sentences to help characterize the existing reason better, or add and characterize additional reasons, based on examples retrieved from the large corpus. We explain this process in detail in Section 2.",

For example, studies show that the endorsement of the fairness and care moral foundations is correlated with trust in science. To account for fine-grained patterns, we adapt the recently proposed morality-frame formalism (Roy et al., 2021) that identifies moral roles associated with moral foundation expressions in text. These roles correspond to actor/target roles (similar to agent/patient) and positive or negative polarity, which should be understood in the context of a specific moral foundation. In Figure 1 \"Biden\" is the negative actor in the context of Oppression, making him the oppressor. We explain this formalism in Section 3.",

The combination of stance, reason and moral attitudes provides a powerful source of information, allowing us to capture the moral attitudes expressed in the context of different stances and their reasons. These connections can also be used to help build expectations about likely attitudes in the context of each stance. As a motivating example, consider the reason \"distrust in government\", which can be associated with the \"oppression\" moral foundation only when its actor is an entity related to government functions (rather than oppression from Covid-19 illness). We model these expectation as a probabilistic inference process (Pacheco and Goldwasser, 2021) , by incorporating consistency constraints over the judgements made by our model, and predicting the most likely analysis jointly, consisting of all analysis dimensions. The full model, described using a declarative modeling language, is provided in Section 5.",

While our analysis in this paper focuses on a specific issue, vaccination hesitancy, we believe that our analysis framework should be easily adaptable to new issues. Relying on human insight to characterize and operationalize stance and reason identification is one aspect, that characterizes issue-specific considerations. Moral Foundation Theory, by its definition, abstracts over specific debate topics, and offers a general account for human morality. However, from a practical perspective, models for predicting these highly abstract concepts are trained on data specific to a debate topic and might not generalize well. Instead of retraining the model from scratch, we hypothesize that given an initial model constructed using out-of-domain data, and a small amount of in-domain labeled data, we can obtain acceptable performance by modeling the interaction between reasons, stances and moral foundations. We study these settings, along with the fully supervised setting in Section 6.",

We build on previous health informatics studies that characterized the arguments made against the Covid-19 vaccine in social media (Wawrzuta et al., show_reasons() lists the current list of reasons (e.g. Government Distrust, Natural Immunity.) show_closest_tweets(reason, K) lists the K tweets closest to a given reason, based on their embedding similarity. wordcloud(reason) Renders a word cloud to visualize the arguments associated to a given reason, based on bigram and trigram TF-IDF features. show_assignments(threshold) Renders a bar plot showing the assignment of tweets to reasons, based on embedding similarity. An optional threshold can be used to limit assignments. tsne(threshold) Renders a visualization of the reason clusters in a 2D map. Threshold is optional. silhouette_score(threshold) Measures the overlapping degree between clusters. Threshold is optional. add_reason(reason, phrase) Adds a new reason with a phrase that characterizes it in natural language remove_reason(reason) Removes a given reason add_phrase(reason, phrase) Adds an additional phrase to an existing reason. ). In this work, researchers come up with a code-book of 12 main themes, frequently used as reasons to refuse or cast doubt on the vaccine. We propose an interactive, humans-in-the-loop protocol to learn representations for these 12 initial reasons, ground them in data, evaluate their quality, and refine them to better capture the discussion. To do this, we build a tool to explore repeating arguments and their reasons in the Covid-19 vaccine debate. The tool consists of an interactive Google Colab notebook equipped with a custom API to query current arguments, ground them in data, and visualize them. To initialize the system, we use the 12 reasons suggested by Wawrzuta et al. (2021) , and represent them using the one-sentence explanation provided. Our main goal is to ground these reasons in a set of approximately 85,000 unlabeled tweets about the Covid-19 vaccine (details in Section 4). To map tweets to reasons, we use the similarity between their SBERT embeddings (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). The interaction is centered around the operations outlined in Table 1 . Intuitively, the first six operations allow humans to diagnose how reasons map to text, and the last three allows them to act on the result of this diagnosis, by adding and removing reasons, and modifying the phrases characterizing each reason.",

Following these observations, there is a discussion phase in which the coders follow a thematic analysis approach (Braun and Clarke, 2012) to uncover the overarching themes that are not covered by the current set of reasons, as well as the argumentation patterns that the method fails to identify. Then, they are allowed to add and remove reasons, as well as explanatory phrases for them in natural language. Every time a reason or phrase is added or removed, all tweets are reassigned to their closest reasons. This process was done over two one-hour sessions. The coders were NLP and Computational Social Science researchers, two female and one male, between the ages of 25 and 40.",

For each moral foundation in a given tweet, we identify the \"entity doing good/bad\" (positive/negative actor) and \"entity benefiting/suffering\" (positive/negative target). For example, the statement \"We are suffering from the pandemic\" expresses harm as the moral foundation, where \"pandemic\" is a negative actor, and \"we\" is a negative target (i.e. the entity suffering from the actor's actions). There can be zero, one or multiple actors and targets in a given tweet. Entities can correspond to specific individuals or groups (e.g., I, democrats, people of a given demographic), organizations (e.g., political parties, CDC, FDA, companies), legislation or other political actions (e.g., demonstrations, petitions), disease or natural disasters (e.g., Covid, global warming), scientific or technological innovations (e.g., the vaccine, social media, the Internet), among others. We break down the task of predicting morality frames into four classification tasks. For each tweet, our goal is to predict whether it is making moral judgement or not, and identify its prominent moral foundation. For each entity mentioned in the tweet, we predict whether it is a target or a role, and whether it has positive or negative polarity.",

We found \u03b1 = 60.82 for moral foundations, and \u03b1 = 78.71 for stance. For roles, we calculated the character by character agreement between annotations. For example, if one annotator marked \"Dr Fauci\" as a target in a tweet, and another marked \"Fauci\", it was considered to be an agreement on the characters \"Fauci\" but disagreement on \"Dr\". Doing this, we found \u03b1 = 83.46. When removing characters marked by all three annotators as \"non-role\", the agreement dropped to \u03b1 = 67.15.",

Similarly, we defined a text span to be an entity mention E, having a moral role R and polarity P, in a tweet T, if it was annotated as such by at least two annotators. Our resulting dataset contains 891 (T,E,R,P) tuples. Statistics can be seen in Table 4 To evaluate the correlation between the different dimensions of analysis, we calculate the Pearson correlation matrices and present them in Figure 2 . We can interpret reasons as distributions over moral foundations and stances (and vice-versa). This analysis provides a useful way to explain each of these dimensions. For example, we see that care/harm is strongly correlated with reasons such as covid is real, the vaccine works, and natural immunity is ineffective. Other expected trends emerge, such as purity/degradation being highly correlated with vaccine against religion. To evaluate the modeling advantage of our opinion analysis framework, we look at the correlation between stance, moral foundations and topics extracted in an unsupervised fashion using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) . We find that the reasons extracted interactively have higher correlations with both vaccination stance and moral foundations. The LDA correlation matrices can be seen in Figure 3 . In Table 5 we show the top four reasons for fairness/cheating. We choose this moral foundation given that it is evenly split among stances and it is active for different reasons. We show the top two (E,R,P) tuples for each reason. We can appreciate that while this moral foundation is used by people on both sides, the reasons offered and entities used vary. On the anti-vax side, authority figures and vaccine trials are portrayed as negative actors, while women and children are portrayed as targets. On the pro-vax side, Covid and unvaccinated people are portrayed as negative actors, and the general public is portrayed as a target.",

In DRaiL, these weights are learned using neural networks with parameters \u03b8 r . The collection of rules represents the global decision, and the solution is obtained by running a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference procedure. Given that horn clauses can be expressed as linear inequalities corresponding to their disjunctive form, the MAP inference problem can be written as a linear program. DRaiL supports both locally and globally normalized structured prediction objectives. Throughout this paper, we used the locally normalized objective.

            "text": "Experimental settings In DRaiL, each rule r is associated with a neural architecture, which serves as a scoring function to obtain the rule weight w r . We use BERT-base-uncased (Devlin et al., 2018) for all classifiers. For the rules that model dependencies (Eqs. 3, 4, 5), we concatenate the CLS token with a one-hot vector of the symbols on the left hand side of the rule (i.e. role, sentiment, stance and reason), before passing it through a classifier. For rules that have the entity on the left-hand side (Eqs. 2, 3), we use both the tweet and the entity as an input to BERT, using the SEP token. We trained supervised models using local normalization in DRaiL, and leveraged distant supervision using protocol outlined in Algorithm 1. In all cases, we used a learning rate of 2e \u2212 5, a maximum sequence length of 100, and AdamW. In all experiments, we perform 5-fold cross-validation over the annotated dataset and report the micro-averaged results. Table 6 shows our general results for morality frames and vaccination stance. We evaluate our base classifiers and show the impact of modeling dependencies using DRaiL. The joint model results in a significant improvement for morality, moral foundation and vaccination stance. For entities, role and polarity remain stable. We also measure the impact of explicitly modeling reasons (Eq. 5) and present results in Table 7 . We show the performance for the initial reasons pro-posed by Wawrzuta et al. (2021) , which are all from the anti-vaccine perspective, and the impact of our two rounds of interaction, expanding and refining reasons (round 1) and augmenting argumentative patterns (round 2). We find that moral foundations improve from 60.07 to 62.27 and vaccination stance improves from 67.72 to 72.53 after interaction. Ablation study We show an ablation study in Table 8 . First, we can see how all dependencies contribute to the performance improvement, role-MF being the most impactful. We can also see that explicitly modeling morality constraints improves both the morality prediction and the moral foundation prediction, suggesting an advantage to breaking down this decision. We observe that the stance-polarity constraint does not have a significant impact, but does not hurt performance either, suggesting that our classifiers already capture this information. Lastly, we can see that the performance for roles and polarity remains stable, potentially because these classifiers have a strong starting point. Figure 4 we evaluate the impact of our indirect supervision protocol by slowly augmenting the amount of direct supervision available. We can see that by leveraging out of domain-data and dependencies, we can obtain a competitive model using just 25% of the annotated labels, and we can outperform the fully supervised classifiers using 50% of the annotations. Amri, 2020). In this paper, we take a different approach and look at the problem of identifying opinions surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine, and explicitly modeling the rationale and moral sentiment that motivates them. Some recent works also look at analyzing arguments about Covid and vaccine hesitancy more broadly. In most cases, they either take a traditional classification approach for predicting stances (Alliheibi et al., 2021; Lyu et al., 2021) , or use topic modeling techniques to uncover trends in word usage (Skeppstedt et al., 2018; Lyu et al., 2021; Sha et al., 2020; Zamani et al., 2020a) . In contrast, we propose a holistic framework that combines different methodological techniques, including humanin-the-loop mechanisms, classification with distant supervision, and deep relational learning to connect stance prediction, reason analysis and fine-grained entity moral sentiment analysis.",

We also use the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus (Hoover et al., 2020) , consisting of 35k tweets annotated for moral foundations. The topics across these two datasets span political issues (e.g. gun control, immigration) and events (e.g. Hurricane Sandy, Baltimore protests). Given that neither of these two datasets contain examples for the liberty/oppression moral foundation, we curate a small lexicon by looking for synonyms and antonyms of the words liberty and oppression. Then, we use this lexicon to annotate the con-gresstweets dataset \u2020 . We annotate a tweet as liberty/oppression if it contains at least four keywords, which results in around 2K tweets. The derived lexicon for liberty/oppression can be seen in Table 13 To learn to predict roles, we use the subset of Johnson and Goldwasser (2018) dataset annotated for roles by Roy et al. (2021) , which contains roughly 3K tweet-entity-role triplets. For polarity, we combine the Roy et al.
