We focused on the application of a stochastic approach in fitting the model parameters using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solver, to improve the reliability of predictions in the medium term (30 days). We analyzed the official data and the predicted evolution of the epidemic in the Italian regions, and we compared the results with the data and predictions of Spain and South Korea. We linked the model equations to the changes in people's mobility, with reference to Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. We discussed the effectiveness of policies taken by different regions and countries and how they have an impact on past and future infection scenarios. and infected individuals during an epidemic outbreak (especially quarantined people, who are not able to infect other people during their quarantine). The coefficients of the equations represent the ratios of variation over time of the different categories of individuals, that is, infected, dead, and recovered [4] . These coefficients have often been considered constant [5] . However, they are unable to take into account external influences, such as the actions containing the spread of the infection that may occur at different times during the development of the infection itself or the possible change in health conditions of infected individuals due to pharmacological development. The approach herein discussed introduces time-dependent model parameters. In particular, we assume the infection rate time-dependent, considering that the number of contacts between people, during the lockdown, decreases proportionally to the decrease of their overall mobility, calculated using a big data repository available from Google [6] .",

The main innovation we have introduced concerns the stochastic approach to solve the model and to assess the propagation of the uncertainties of the model solution. This approach is based on a metaheuristic method, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, belonging to the family of computational swarm intelligence [7] . In fact, citing the overview made by Parham (2012) [1], the analysis of temporally-forced non-linear epidemic models within stochastic frameworks has received little attention to date due to the complexity of the problem, despite representing the most realistic framework for capturing the behavior of many intrinsically or extrinsically forced infectious diseases. With respect to the standard deterministic approach in solving the SEIR model, the advantage of the PSO approach is that the adaptive exploration of the space domain of the solutions decreases the risk of being trapped into a local minimum and iteratively searches for the global minimum as the final solution. Moreover, the PSO method provides a set of model solutions as probable scenarios calculated by means of a-posteriori probability density distribution.",

The data are derived from the official repositories and are composed of infective and recovered individuals, and death cases. We test the approach on other situations such as Spain, which has shown many similarities with the virus diffusion in Italy, and South Korea, which instead represents a completely different scenario. We also explore the main drawbacks of the suggested method, mostly related to the uncertainty of the input data and the complexity in the inclusion into the model of all the external factors (population density and ages, previous diseases, efficiency of the public health system, etc.) which have impacts on the virus diffusion, the recovery rate, and the number of deceases.",

The SEIR model represents one of the most adopted mathematical models to characterize the epidemic dynamics and to predict possible contagion scenarios. The SEIR model can be useful to assess the effectiveness of various measures, such as lock-down, since the infectious disease outbreak. It is based on a series of dynamic ordinary differential equations that consider the amount of the population subject to contagion, the trend over time of individuals who recover after infection, and the individuals who unfortunately die [1] .",

The purpose, however, is to provide an easy-to-read and useful tool that can help the policymakers, responsible for strategic choices, in assessing the social and economic scenarios related to the development of the epidemic. We are conscious that it is a predictive model which, although based on a scientific approach, is conditioned by a series of intrinsic and endogenous factors that can affect its medium-term reliability. Nevertheless, we are also aware that any political decision potentially lacking any rational and critical evaluations of all the available data risks being based on mere sensations, often dictated by sentimental suggestions [2] . The generalized SEIR model is based on a system of differential equations, as discussed by Peng et al. (2020) [3] in the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China.

The infective (I) represents the infective population after the latent period. The recovered (R) are the people after healing, and they are generally not reintroduced into the susceptible category if it is supposed that they became immune to the disease. This aspect is strongly debated, as in some countries a second infection of recovered people has been recorded. At this stage of our study, we do not have enough data to include this effect on the model; this would require the introduction of another term in the previous system of equations, including another coefficient that takes into account the re-population of the susceptible compartment. In the classical SEIR model, the R category also comprehends the individuals who died of the disease.

It provides data about the reduction in the mobility of people over the recent few months. For each investigated region, we calculated the average mobility decrease over time, and we fitted the curve with a second-order polynomial trend line. Then, we constrained \u03b2 to be proportional to that specific trend line. In a preliminary test on a simple data set, we noticed how the introduction of this constraint allowed the model to obtain a better data fitting. Therefore, we applied this approach to the SEIR model to ensure good data fitting for all the regions and countries investigated. We noticed that the mobility data of South Korea did not show a significant decrease in people's mobility, because the Government adopted a different strong approach in lockdown policies compared to most European countries. Strict lockdowns were not imposed, but efforts were addressed to track the infection spread at the early stages, with tight controls and strict quarantine protocols for infected individuals. For the 30 days of model prediction, the time-dependent \u03b2 parameter had the same value of the last observed day (i.e., mid-April) since we did not have reliable predictions about future mobility. This means that the lockdown policies will continue, or the reopening of business will be made paying close attention to health protection procedures.",

The exposed (E) category is only a temporary category: its individuals pass into the infective (I) category after a latent time (1/\u03b3), on average. The infective category generates newly infected people over time, removing them from the susceptible category. The detected infected individuals are quarantined (Q) to avoid spread. Then, they evolve into recovered (R) or death (D) cases, according to various causes, like health care system effectiveness, age, co-morbidity of other diseases.

This optimization solver minimizes an objective function, which is set to decrease the misfit between observed data and calculated responses of Q, R, and D by varying the six parameters, i.e., the problem unknowns. The main advantages of the stochastic approach over the deterministic method to solve the SEIR model are briefly discussed. The adaptive exploration and exploitation of the search space of the model solutions avoids the risk of being trapped in some local-minima solutions and also enhances the independence from the initial assumption of the six parameters which could bias the final solution. The solution search-space is sampled by a set of 200 particles, representing the possible solutions, which are randomly initialized. The adaptive behavior and the convergence and stability of the final solution are ensured by using a PSO variant, the hierarchical PSO with time-varying acceleration coefficients (HPSO-TVAC) [17] . Convergence was achieved in 150 iterations. Each run of 150 iterations was repeated for 50 trials to test the variability of the solutions due to the random initialization of the parameters. Finally, the trial showing the minimum normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) was selected as the best solution. The solutions from the remaining trials were a-posteriori evaluated with their probability density distribution. The solutions within 5% of the minimum NRMSE were chosen as representative of other probable scenarios.",

This probably resulted from the regional testing policy that tested (and counted as confirmed) only patients with severe symptoms or at high risk.

Nevertheless, the different public health policies at the early stage of the epidemic phenomena also had an impact, and it seems that tailored capillary actions, as in the example of Veneto, obtained better results than applying only a regional lockdown. The difference in the approaches can be underlined by observing that many municipalities or provinces declared \"red zones\", where, due to high transmission of the infection, additional restrictive measures were introduced, compared to the rest of the regional territory. In the red zones, the different policies acted in response to local epidemiological situations. Instead, in Piedmont and Lombardy, no red zone was established, but restrictive individual distancing measures were regulated on a regional scale. According to the evidenced results of different policies, in the next phase of governmental policies, the reopening of business and activities should be tailored to the local situations, focusing on the organization and integration of all figures of the health system. In particular, the central government should require from the regions an effort to provide local epidemiological data in real-time, to lockdown only limited areas, while the reopening of regional-scale business can be eased.",

For the parameters obtained with stochastic approach, the best-solution is shown in bold, while in brackets the mean and the variance of the solutions within 5% of the minimum NRMSE in brackets. In Table 3 we compare the parameters among different regions, and between the stochastic and deterministic approach. Both approaches provided models that fitted the observed data with good accuracy, although the stochastic approach has, in general, a slightly lower NRMSE. The parameters calculated with PSO are reported with the best-solution value, mean, and variance. We can observe that \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 had a high variance due to the intrinsic variability due to the stochastic approach. Sometimes the best solution is not aligned with the mean value. \u03bb and \u03ba values, instead, are strictly gathered around the mean in almost all PSO solutions, hence the low variance. This is explained by considering that, since the number of parameters is higher than the available data series (Q, R, and D), the problem is underdetermined, so that the stochastic approach can find more than one series of parameters which fits the data within an acceptable misfit. Then, \u03bb and \u03ba do not show large variability among the most-probable scenarios because they govern the equations that correlate Q with R and D, that is the official data series. Therefore, the estimated \u03bb and \u03ba were always found in the same region of the search space of solutions. South Korea and Veneto show the highest recovery rates (\u03bb 1 ) with values around 0.05, followed by Spain (0.044). This confirms the reports which praise the Veneto model, because its administration had the capabilities of testing more quickly than other Italian regions, and the family doctors worked in a stronger synergy with the health structures. It also evidences a lower death rate (\u03ba 0 ), probably due to the better health system efficiency to treat patients, but also to the greater number of tests. In both data and policies, the Veneto region is more like South Korea than other parts of Italy. These aspects had an impact on the outbreak of the epidemic, as can be seen comparing Figures 4-6 : The Veneto region is more likely to reach the peak of active cases (Q) before the other regions.",

The main findings indicate that the deterministic approach is not appropriate to explore the possible solutions of the space-domain because the mathematical problem is underdetermined. We recommend fitting the data of this epidemic using a stochastic approach, such as the PSO method. Taking advantage of the PSO approach, we estimated different scenarios for a 30-day epidemic evolution. Every scenario refers to a different set of parameters estimated by the algorithm. The predicted scenarios are fairly similar and suggest that every Italian region will reach the peak of the epidemic by mid-May.

We can say that, if the \u03b2 parameter remains at current values, e.g., if the lockdown policies are maintained or, better, the reopening of business is done with particular attention to health safety procedures, the prediction of the trend of the recovered and deaths could be considered reliable, with the approximations and the uncertainties that the PSO model has pointed out. At the Italian level, despite the great dispersion in the prediction of the quarantined and recovered cases, the number of deaths will reach a number of around 33,000-35,000 cases at the end of May and the number of active cases will gradually decrease. This prediction cannot consider the impact of future decisions on social distancing.",

The Veneto region was one of the best examples in Italy about how integrated and synergic regional policies in social distance and the health system can tackle the epidemic, and its epidemiological scenario is now more optimistic than those of Lombardy and Piedmont. We stress that tailored actions provide much better epidemiological outcomes than wide lockdowns, keeping in mind also the example of South Korea.",

The analysis demonstrates that, because the Italian health care system is highly decentralized, different regions managed different policies, which highly influenced the evolution of the epidemic in its first months: the data and the model prediction well reflected the different approaches taken by Lombardy and Veneto, two regions with similar socio-economic tissue. The overall lesson that could be learned from this analysis goes beyond the mathematical modeling itself, and will require a wider evaluation on all the possible socio-economic and political factors, even if the data analysis of the Veneto situation could be used to revisit regional and central policies early on. If so, the regions are going to emulate the virtuous approach of Veneto, including more demanding requests to improve their diagnostic capacity that will weight on the central government.",
