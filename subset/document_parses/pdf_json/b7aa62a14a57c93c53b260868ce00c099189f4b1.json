A first step was a publication in French (Storrie and Blanc 2018) . Now this book examines the relationship between these two key social issues, as what Tom Storrie calls a single 'double problematic' (meaning the unification of two previously autonomous problematics). This problematic is ever more burning in today's world. It has become profoundly important for the wellbeing as well as the security of all peoples across the world. Far from witnessing the predicted 'death' of religion in a post-modern world, the authors observe the 'return' of religion to centre stage in recent decades.",

Religiosity is the subjective feeling of a personal dialogue with a supra human being.

The initial instruction received different interpretations: some co-authors put the emphasis on their family education, others on the role of peer groups when they were teenagers and/or young adults and others on the historical context in their respective countries. Tom Storrie was an educationist. He presents two events that played an important part in his conceptualisation of the relationship between citizenship and religion: one is positive, the end of the murderous religious war between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland; the other is negative, the Salman Rushdie Affair. In Northern Ireland, the 2007 Peace Treaty was the opportunity to create a government including the ex-enemies and was able to develop a fruitful cooperation. By the end of the 1980s, the Salman Rushdie Affair presents a good example of 'a single double problematic': how was an Iranian Ayatollah (both a religious and a political leader) able to condemn to death a British writer without any fair judgement, simply for being ironic and critical about Islam? Here, the religious fully absorbs the political, raising the issue of the links and the borders between citizenship and religion.",

However, as in George Orwell's Animal farm, 'some religions are more equal than others'! Secularism takes many forms and is ambiguous: a first form is against any religion, the truth coming from science and not from religion; an opposite form is tolerant towards every religion: it is a private matter and the best the state can do is to keep hands off and not to interfere. A new form of secularism recently emerged: tolerance with old established Christian religions but not with Islam, presumed culturally too different for being acceptable (Baub\u00e9rot 2012) .

The famous image of Karl Marx [1852] presenting the revolution as a mole is relevant here: 'we recognize our old friend, our old mole, who knows so well how to work underground, suddenly to appear: the revolution'. The mole makes a subterraneous destruction of the roots of the capitalist system before surfacing at an unexpected place and time. A revolution needs a long preparation and a longer follow-up. It is very true in the field of 'citizenship and religion': cultural changes have a long temporality. Using Orwell's words again, a 'New Speak' may emerge accompanied by cosmetic changes in practice. A radically new rhetoric may go along with a hidden conservatism. In a similar way, when modernity fails, traditional practices may re-appear. Examples coming from the religious field in Palestine, Algeria and the European Union are analysed here. Storrie shows how, at the beginning, the Protestant Reformation was emancipatory in England and Scotland: it introduced freedom of conscience and democracy. However, the institutionalisation of the Reform gave birth to a new theocratic power as rigid as the Catholic one. Improvements are always fragile and provisional. Storrie is critical of the culture of institutions (churches included): they develop a strong inertia and tend to resist change. He believes in the value of 'prophetic' actions by individual citizens, such as whistle-blowers, raising the issue of individual versus collective citizenship.",

Because of the historical influence of either Britain or France in the 'Middle East', Shafei shows how the concepts of citizenship and religion are mainly translations from French (also from English) into Arabic, but with religious connotations that alter their meaning.

As said earlier, Algerian women's movements disagree between political feminists claiming for equal rights and 'Islamic feminists' who claim a female-friendly interpretation of the Koran. However, a new Islamic women's group is emerging with unexpected claims: a few Algerian women advocate a return to a 'pure native Islam' expressed by women and against male domination, but sexist and conservative at the same time. Bouatta calls them 'Supermuslim women', using the psychoanalytical concept of 'Supermuslim' created in France by Fethi Benslama (2016) . For him, a 'Supermuslim' is mainly a young male leaving France in order to experience a full implementation of Islamic values, including fighting against the Syrian dictatorship as a form of solidarity with his Muslim brothers. Bouatta transplants this concept in Algeria to young females seeking a return to a pure original Islam. In doing so, she changes the original meaning of this concept: she emphasises the implementation of Islamic values and not the call to a 'holy war'. For her, 'Supermuslim women' are no real 'Islamic feminists': they reject the Islam practiced today in Algeria as no true Islam because many elements of pre-Islamic religions are still incorporated. 1 Their claim for 'Islamic purification' is rigorous, conservative and out of reach, but they try to impose it onto their families and friends and are sometimes successful. Adversely, many women are involved in the current protest movement emerging from civil society, called Hirak in Arabic. It fuels hopes for a better future, with more equality and justice between Algerian men and women. However, in May 2020, the military regime still resists to gender equality, many male opponents also, and 'Supermuslim' women as well; the future is uncertain.",

Since the French Revolution, the Republican pole considers the central state as responsible for the emancipation of all its citizens from any form of particularism. The distinction between a Republican and a Democratic pole is recent and takes into account the recognition of cultural diversity, which is an impossible challenge for the monolithic and centralist traditional Republican model. However, there is no significant difference between young Muslims and other young people on most issues.

She is in the paradoxical situation of teaching Islamic theology to future teachers of Islam in German state schools in a complex political context. On the one hand, the far right has an increasing influence and is strongly against the 'invasion' of 'Christian Germany' by Islam. On the other hand, in most L\u00e4nder (region-state), the Department of Education wants to introduce the teaching of Islam in state schools in order to reduce the influence of a traditionalist Islam taught (in Arabic or in Turkish) by imams paid by the Embassies of Saudi Arabia or Turkey. In Germany (also in France), an ongoing debate is about the content and meaning of religious education: is it a specific education for the believers of each religion or a global approach of religions for believers and non-believers as well? In the United Kingdom, religious education is for all, regardless of the religious or ideological background of the students (except for denominational schools, of course). Droeber believes a global approach towards religions is a long-term aim.
