            "text": "Objectives Being able to predict which patients with COVID-19 are going to deteriorate is important to help identify patients for clinical and research practice. Clinical prediction models play a critical role in this process, but current models are of limited value because they are typically restricted to baseline predictors and do not always use contemporary statistical methods. We sought to explore the benefits of incorporating dynamic changes in routinely measured biomarkers, non-linear effects and applying 'state-of-the-art' statistical methods in the development of a prognostic model to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Design The data were analysed from admissions with COVID-19 to three hospital sites. Exploratory data analysis included a graphical approach to partial correlations. Dynamic biomarkers were considered up to 5 days following admission rather than depending solely on baseline or single time-point data. Marked departures from linear effects of covariates were identified by employing smoothing splines within a generalised additive modelling framework. Setting 3 secondary and tertiary level centres in Greater Manchester, the UK. Participants 392 hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Results 392 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.73 using admission data alone to 0.75 when also considering results of baseline blood samples and to 0.83 when considering dynamic values of routinely collected markers. There was clear non-linearity in the association of age with patient outcome. Conclusions This study shows that clinical prediction models to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be improved by taking into account both non-linear effects in covariates such as age and dynamic changes in values of biomarkers.",

Initially, a logistic model for the all-cause mortality outcome using only clinical features at presentation was fitted initially. We then fitted separate logistic models for death for each day, using predictive variables identified from the partial correlation analysis described above. For each of the 5 days following hospital admission, we fitted a model based exclusively on data from subjects still alive at that day, with candidate predictors chosen out of the set of clinical variables and biomarker values collected until that day. This approach meant that for each of the first 5 days following admission, a sequence of day-specific mortality prediction models was available. We subsequently fitted each model within a generalised additive modelling framework involving smoothing splines to detect marked departures from linearity for continuous predictors and undertook data transformations (eg, log transformation of concentrations) as indicated. 8 A standard logistic version of the model was then fitted. We used the Akaike Information Criterion to choose between logistic models and assessed predictive performance using the area under a 10-fold, cross-validated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

            "text": "These results suggest that using dynamic data is better than using baseline initial presentation data to predict death in patients with COVID-19. Even with a local dataset of just 392 admissions with COVID-19, we were able to identify clear benefit from exploiting dynamic biomarker data and marked non-linearity in the effects of commonly used factors to predict outcomes. Our findings should be taken as indicative of the benefits of 'state-of-the-art' statistical methodology but also the necessary collaboration between statisticians and clinicians as this statistical methodology is not readily accessible to most researchers. Identification and validation of anything approaching a definitive predictive model would require substantially larger sample sizes. 2 Neither the non-linear effect of age after allowance for other factors nor the particular biomarkers identified within this dataset are surprising. Others have also observed associations of mortality with age, and clinical and biochemical markers of disease severity (eg, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio). [9] [10] [11] There have been few studies investigating dynamic changes in patient biomarkers for mortality prediction in COVID-19; one such study of 548 patients in China also demonstrated that the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in survivors and non-survivors became increasingly divergent throughout their hospital admission. 12 Chen et al derived their prognostic score from an analysis based on a Cox's regression model with their candidate predictive variables taken at baseline. They incorporated in their analysis the slope of a line fitted to the first and last measurements of each particular marker to model changes over time. Chen et al approach has Open access advantages and disadvantages. Their model captures duration information but does not allow choice of time horizon for prediction. Their predictions are arguably limited because they are not updated daily and depend on the assumption that marker evolution is linear and summarised by a straight line between initial and final values. A smaller study limited to patients with severe COVID-19 also revealed a progressive increase in neutrophil count and plasma interleukin-6 concentration in the decedents when compared with the survivors, but the authors did not perform any assessment of the predictive value associated with dynamic changes in these laboratory parameters. 13 Similarly, renal injury has also been shown to be common in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a worse outcome. 14 The reason for this is not clear. There is emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly harm the kidneys. The worsening urea/creatinine ratio observed in our data set may also reflect either the therapeutic effects of fluid restriction to treat severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or evidence of multi-organ dysfunction. 10 15 Regardless of the cause, the impact of the urea/creatinine level on death was not evident at presentation but became a significant predictor of death in our model over time. This observation illustrates the benefit of taking into account improvements and deterioration in daily blood test results as well as initial presentation factors when calculating the probability of death. Improving the accuracy of prediction models using this approach is likely to be successful in informing clinical decision-making, resource planning and communication with patients and relatives.",

We would have liked to consider other outcomes, including dynamic changes in clinical variables, as well as disease endpoints such as the incidence of ARDS and ICU (intensive care admission) admission. Dynamic clinical data were not included because it was less reliable to obtain compared with blood biomarker data, and a consistent diagnosis of ARDS, and dates of onset or admission to ICU were also not routinely available. Although we have undertaken internal cross-validation to ensure unbiased comparison of ROC curves, we have not considered calibration. We do not wish to make any claim for the value of our current models at each day based on the small sample size available to us locally. With only three hospital sites contributing during the first wave, and because of significant time/ resource pressures during the pandemic, we did not have sufficient data to construct definitive prediction models or to follow-up patients beyond 3 weeks. More sophisticated exploitation of biomarker trajectories through, for example, approaches based on randomeffects models of biomarker evolution or 'conditional on outcome' models of biomarker evolution, would also require more data and be expected to add further insights. [16] [17] [18] Clinical prediction models are important and can help in clinical decision-making, resource allocation and optimal selection of trial participants for investigational treatments. In the setting of an infectious disease pandemic-affecting all geographic and socioeconomic groups-using routinely available blood tests to inform prediction models has obvious advantages over less widely available, but perhaps more specific, biomarkers of disease severity. Until investigators incorporate such data in participant selection, it is unlikely that future trials will be able to accurately target those patients most likely to benefit from therapies such as immunomodulation. Overall benefits will be 'diluted' and potentially reversed by inclusion of participants who have nothing to gain and, ",
