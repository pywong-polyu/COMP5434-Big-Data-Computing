However, there were still no pharmaceutical treatment or vaccine available. Preventive measures were currently focused on contact tracing, quarantine and social distancing. According to the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 post-pandemic period, professor Kissler projected that prolong or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022 (Kissler et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 might be existed for a long term and without effective vaccine, and these unfavourable conditions may lead to new challenges for health care workers. Today, little evidence exists on the influencing factors associated with nurses' work engagement during COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to explore the working status and potential influencing factors of work engagement on front-line nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Our study may help prepare the workengaged nurses rapidly respond to the ongoing epidemic.",

The rate of nurse turnover remained high since the first outbreak of SARS epidemic (Shiao et al., 2007) . After COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers were challenged by working in a new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and insufficient PPE, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions and managing relationships in this stressful situation (Liu et al., 2020) . In addition, the perceived stress and excessive workloads in nursing staff may directly affect their work engagement and quality of care provided to patients with COVID-19.",

The nurses would either have a sense of selfvalue during mental demand, mediating high-level engagement. A good performance and low frustration had been proved to be the positive factors associated with work engagement by various studies(Tr\u00e9panier et al., 2015;Van Wingerden & Van der Stoep, 2018). A good performance referred to perceived success in accomplishing the task, while frustration was known as discouraged feelings that one felt while completing the task. So lower the nurses' frustration level and increase their performance in COVID-19 epidemic were the key points to enhance their work engagement, which could give implica-tions for nurse managers in other countries. Measures should focus on enhancing the self-confidence to effectively handle COVID-19 nursing tasks, such as COVID-19-related training, recommending guidelines of self-protection, inspiring nurses learned from dedication leaders and creating a collaborative work atmosphere among nurse staff (Van Bogaert et al., 2013). The above interventions had been done in the investigated hospital, such resulting in high work engagement for nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in this study.Although the COVID-19 pandemic was more and more serious, front-line nurses' work engagement was not decreased but increased, which attributed to self-dedication of nursing profession, particularly for married nurses, rescued staff and those from cabin ward.To ensure the steady of nurses' work engagement during COVID-19 epidemic, managers should recognise the dedication of front-line nurses and pay more attention to infection control and physical discomfort caused by PPE. For countries that lack PPE, it is suggested to guarantee material supply of PPE in priority. Furthermore, we call for attention to materials supply for front-line nurses by the country and government. Some measures such as receiving donation of PPE from the outside, encouraging large production of PPE and providing PPE for front-line nurses in the first place could be taken.",
