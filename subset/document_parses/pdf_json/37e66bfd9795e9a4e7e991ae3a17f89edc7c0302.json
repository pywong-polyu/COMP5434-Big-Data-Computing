            "text": "Introduction SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that has caused a global pandemic. Health workers (HWs) are major players in the fight against this infection and are occupationally exposed to the virus in the course of their work. In this context, this study presents surveillance data on 1714 workers in a hospital center in the south of France for the period from March 17 to April 20, 2020. Materials and methods Symptomatic HWs, contact cases and those with high anxiety were tested. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was performed by RT-PCR after nasopharyngeal sampling. Results During this period, 30.4% of hospital staff received 3028 nasal swabs. Of these, 8.0% were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 positive HWs, 24.3% were asymptomatic. Among COVID unit and non COVID unit, the positive HWs for SARS-CoV-2 were, respectively, 5.8% and 8.2% (p = 0.2). HWs over 50 years of age were less likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 (3.8%) than other younger HWs (9.1%) (p < 0.001). No serious cases of COVID-19 were reported in our population during this period. Discussion Our study suggests that HWs who tested positive for COVID-19 are often asymptomatic. Therefore, PPE is pivotal to prevent HWs to patients and HWs to HWs transmission during workshifts. Contact tracing and screening is essential to limit the spread of the virus within the hospital. On the other hand, HWs working in COVID-19 units are not more often infected probably because they have a higher risk awareness than other HWs.",

Week HWs may have been infected by patients (Chang et al. 2020) , although transmission of the virus from patients to HWs is not so frequent even without masks (Canova et al. 2020; Cheng et al. 2020; Ghinai et al. 2020; Ng et al. 2020) . The risk factors for contamination of HWs by patients were clinical examination and exposure during the administration of nebulization therapy to the patient (Heinzerling et al. 2020) . HWs detected as SARS-CoV-2 carriers were mostly working in non-CoVID units; like our study, three studies Porru et al. 2020; Gagneux-Brunon et al. 2020 ) did not found an increased risk of infection in the most exposed HWs probably because they are more aware of the hazards and risks associated with SARS-CoV-2, wear PPE more strictly, and are better informed and trained. Indeed, a more systematic use of PPE has been shown in the COVID-19 units (Jin et al. 2020) . The main protective measures were the wearing of surgical masks by all workers and patients and regular hand washing. In case of contact with a positive or suspected positive patient, the protective equipment to be worn was FFP2 masks, gowns and disposable gloves.",
