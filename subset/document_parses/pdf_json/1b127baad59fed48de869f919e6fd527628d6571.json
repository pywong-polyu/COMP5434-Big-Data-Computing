            "text": "Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) are small rodents belonging to the family Muridae and widely inhabit typical steppes and desert grasslands across northern China. Yet, few viruses in wild M. unguiculatus have been reported. Using meta-transcriptomic sequencing we identified two novel RNA viruses: an astrovirus, denoted Gerbil astrovirus (GeAstV), and a paramyxovirus -Gerbil paramyxovirus (GePV) in Mongolian gerbils captured during October-November 2018 from one of the plagus zones in Shaanxi Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of ORF1a, RdRp and ORF2 revealed that GeAstV clustered with rodent-and porcine-associated astroviruses, sharing the highest amino acid identity of 75.07% with a pig astrovirus in RdRp, while sharing 42.14% and 35.94% amino acid identity with a rodent astrovirus in the deduced ORF1a and ORF2 proteins, respectively, exhibiting apparent recombination and potential cross-species transmission events. For the newly discovered GePV, evolutionary analysis demonstrated that it was closely related to Tailam virus and Beilong virus, and shared 61%-77% identity in the L protein with the seven members of the genus Jeilongvirus. Notably, GeAstV was detected only in lung samples while GePV was positive only in kidney samples. In sum, we demonstrate the presence of two novel gerbil RNA viruses, expanding our understanding of viral diversity in wild Mongolian gerbils.",

            "text": "Rodents, representing the highest genetic diversity of mammal species, have been implicated as the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses including arenaviruses, hantaviruses, and Lassa viruses (Charrel & De Lamballerie, 2010; Guo et al., 2013) . Rodent-associated viruses may cause severe disease in humans once crossing host barriers, despite causing little or no disease in their natural hosts. Mongolian gerbils (M. unguiculatus) are small rodents (family Muridae) widely distributed in typical steppes and desert grasslands in northern China (Liu et al., 2007) . Domesticated Mongolian gerbils are extremely sensitive to several viruses including hantaviruses, and serve as excellent animal models for a wide range of infectious diseases (Bleich et al., 2012) . However, little is known about the natural viral diversity in wild Mongolian gerbils, with only one hepacivirus (Gerbil hepacivirus) reported recently (An et al., 2022) . Using a metatranscriptomics approach, we report two novel RNA virusesdenoted Gerbil astrovirus and Gerbil paramyxovirus -that were discovered from Mongolian gerbils collected from a plague focus in Shaanxi Province, China. This study was approved of the Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences. All institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.",

They were divided into four groups (denoted DB01, DB02, DB03, and DB04), with each group containing ten individual gerbils. Tissue samples of kidney, lung, liver, and brain were collected immediately following humane euthanasia with ether. The same tissues of each group were pooled together and a total of 15 libraries were prepared, including four kidney, four lung, four brain, and three liver libraries (Supplementary Table S1 ). These samples were first homogenized with grinding beads and then subjected to total RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Takara Biomedical Technology, China). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed using the MGIEasy rRNA Depletion Kit (MGI Tech Co., China), with RNA sequencing libraries then constructed using the MGIEasy mRNA library Prep Kit (MGI Tech Co., China). Finally, 100 bp paired-end sequencing of the RNA libraries was performed on the BGISEQ-500RS sequencing platform (BGI, China) ).",

Assembled sequence contigs were annotated using both Blastn search against the nucleotide (nt) database and Diamond Blastx against the nonredundant (nr) protein database available from GenBank (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST), with e-value thresholds of 1\u00d710 -10 and 1\u00d710 -4 , respectively. The sequencing reads were mapped onto the predicted virusassociated contigs using Bowtie2 (v2.4.1) to evaluate the viral abundance and coverage. Virus abundance was estimated as Reads per Million (RPM, mapped viral reads/total library reads*one million). The coiled-coils and transmembrane helices were predicted using COILS (version 2.1) (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/NPSA/npsa_lupas.html) and TMHMM server (v.2.0) (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service. php?TMHMM-2.0), respectively.",

A conserved ribosomal frameshift signal (AAAAAAC) was present near the 3' end of ORF1a, and a highly conserved sequence (UUUGGAGGGGUGGACCAAA) was located just before the start codon of ORF2 as observed in other AstVs (Bouzalas et al., 2016) .

            "text": "The full-length genome of GePV was 20 068 nucleotides in length and comprised eight genes in the order (3'-5'): nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein and proteins V and C (P/V/C), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), small hydrophobic protein (SH), transmembrane protein (TM), glycoprotein (G), and RNA polymerase (L) ( Figure 1F ). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete L protein of GePV and other representative members of Paramyxoviridae revealed that GePV fell within the genus Jeilongvirus, clustering with Tailam virus and Beilong virus ( Figure 1E ). Comparative analysis of the genome organizations of GePV and nine members from the same cluster showed that GePV and five Jeilongviruses contained eight predicted genes while Mount Mabu Lophuromys virus 1 (MMLV-1) and 2 (MMLV-2), Feline paramyxovirus (FePV), and Ruloma virus might not possess the SH gene ( Figure 1F ). With the exception of the feline paramyxovirus identified in cat, the remaining eight viruses were all detected in rodents. Regarding the N, G and L proteins, GePV shared the highest similarity (59.56%, 61.29%, and 77.04%, respectively) with Tailam virus, while it had the highest identity (82.35% and 28.57%, respectively) to Beilong virus in the M and TM proteins, and shared the highest similarity (56.35% and 73.13%, respectively) with rodent paramyxovirus in the P and F proteins (Supplementary Figure  S2B) . Collectively, GePV might represent a novel species within the genus Jeilongvirus, and most closely related to Tailam virus and Beilong virus.",

The characteristic amino acid motifs are highlighted with red arrows. B-D: Maximum likelihood phylogenies of GeAstV and representative members of the genus Mamastrovirus were inferred based on the amino acid alignments of ORF1a (B), RdRp (C), and ORF2 (D). The two gerbil astrovirus sequences are highlighted in red with red solid circles. The greyshaded regions show the sequences with phylogenetic incongruence and the rodent associated astrovirus. E: Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the L protein of gerbil paramyxovirus and the representative members of the Paramyxoviridae, including those from the genera Ferlavirus, Aquaparamyxovirus, Respirovirus, Henipavirus, Narmovirus, Salemvirus, Morbillivirus, and Jeilongvirus. The rodent associated viruses are highlighted with a grey background. F: The genome of GePV and nine paramyxoviruses from the genus Jeilongvirus: Beilong virus (BeiPV), Tailam virus (TlmPV), Rodent paramyxovirus (RoPV), Pohorje myodes paramyxovirus 1 (PMPV-1), Jun jeilongvirus (JPV), Mount Mabu Lophuromys virus 1 (MMLV-1) and 2 (MMLV-2), Feline paramyxovirus(FePV), and Ruloma virus. Read abundance of the genome of GePV are shown on the top, followed by open reading frames (ORFs) colored according to their putative functions. The numbers to the right of each virus indicate the length of the virus genome. The genomes are drawn to a unified length scale shown at the bottom. Homologous gene regions are connected by dotted lines. B-E: The trees were midpoint rooted for clarity. Bootstrap values of >70% are shown for key nodes.",
