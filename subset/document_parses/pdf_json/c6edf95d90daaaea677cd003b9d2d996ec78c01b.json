            "text": "Globally there is an urgency to develop effective, low-cost therapeutic interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 . We previously generated the stable and ultrapotent homotrimeric Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody 21 (PiN-21). Using Syrian hamsters that model moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, we demonstrate the high efficacy of PiN-21 to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal delivery of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg protects infected animals from weight loss and substantially reduces viral burdens in both lower and upper airways compared to control. Aerosol delivery of PiN-21 facilitates deposition throughout the respiratory tract and dose minimization to 0.2 mg/kg. Inhalation treatment quickly reverses animals' weight loss post-infection and decreases lung viral titers by 6 logs leading to drastically mitigated lung pathology and prevents viral pneumonia. Combined with the marked stability and low production cost, this novel therapy may provide a convenient and cost-effective option to mitigate the ongoing pandemic.",

            "text": "By January 2021, a year after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported (1), close to 100 million people have been infected by this highly transmissible virus resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition to vaccines, there is an unparalleled quest to develop innovative and cost-effective therapeutics to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (2, 3) . Early treatment using high-titer convalescent plasma (CP) may reduce the risk of severe disease in seniors (4) , although CP is limited by supply. Potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), predominantly isolated from COVID-19 patients for recombinant productions, have been developed for passive immunotherapy (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . In vivo evaluations of mAbs in animal models of COVID-19 disease such as murine, hamster, and nonhuman primates (NHPs), have provided critical insights into efficacy and the mechanisms by which they alter the course of infection (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . While mAb therapy lifts hopes to treat mild symptom onset in patients, they nevertheless require exceedingly high administration doses-typically several grams for intravenous (i.v.) injection (25, 26) . The requirement of high doses for efficient neutralization may reflect SARS-CoV-2 virulence, pathogenesis, and the notoriously low efficiency of i.v. delivering these relatively large biomolecules across the plasma-lung barrier to treat pulmonary infections (27) . Moreover, the associated high costs and challenges in bulk manufacturing may further limit the broad clinical use of mAbs worldwide (2) .",

Highly selected Nbs and the multivalent forms obtain high neutralization potency comparable to, or even better (per-mass) than, some of the most successful SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs. In particular, an ultrapotent homotrimeric construct, Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody 21 (PiN-21), efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at below 0.1 ng/ml in vitro (28) . Compared to mAbs, Nbs are substantially cheaper to produce. Moreover, affinity-matured, ultrapotent Nbs are characterized by high solubility and stability that facilitate drug scaling, storage, and transportation, all of which are critical in response to pandemics. The excellent physicochemical properties and small sizes of Nbs raise an exciting possibility of efficient pulmonary delivery by aerosolization with characteristics of rapid onset of action, high local drug concentration/bioavailability, and improved patient compliance (needle-free) that may benefit a large population of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (27) (28) (29) 32) . However, despite the promise, no successful in vivo studies have been reported to date. The inferior pharmacokinetics of monomeric Nbs due to their small size (~15 kDa) and a lack of Fc-mediated immune effectors' function, which is often required to augment the in vivo neutralizing activities of mAbs (33) (34) (35) , drive potential concerns for Nb-based therapy. It remains unknown if the high in vitro neutralization potency of SARS-CoV-2 Nbs can be translated into in vivo therapeutic benefits.",

Shortly after infection, Nb was delivered intranasally (IN) at an average dose of 0.6 mg/kg (Fig 1A) . Animals were monitored daily for weight change and clinical signs of disease. Half of the animals were euthanized 5 days post-infection (d.p.i.) and the remaining were euthanized 10 d.p.i. Virus titers in lung samples from the euthanized animals were measured by plaque assay. Nasal washes and throat swabs were collected at 2 and 4 d.p.i. to determine viral loads in the upper respiratory tract. Consistent with published studies (36, 37) , IT inoculation of hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a robust infection, rapid weight loss in all animals up to 16% at 7 d.p.i. and resulting recovery and reversal of weight loss by 10 d.p.i. before recovery. However, concurrent IN delivery of PiN-21 eliminated any significant weight loss in the infected animals (Fig 1B) . This dramatic protection was accompanied by a reduction of viral titer in the lungs, with an average decrease of 4 order of magnitude in the lung tissue, respectively, compared to control on 5 d.p.i. (Fig 1C) . Consistently, a 3-log reduction of the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) by reverse transcriptase (RT)-qPCR was evident on 5 and 10 d.p.i. (Fig S1A-B) .

Furthermore, five out of six PiN-21 treated animals remained protected from detectable infection 4 d.p.i. The results were further supported by a drastic decrease of gRNA in the URT (Fig S1C-D) . Together, this demonstrates that the high in vitro neutralization potency of PiN-21 can be translated into therapeutic benefits in vivo independent of Fc-mediated immune responses.

Therefore, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of PiN-21 since it was highly effective when co-administered. To explore the second route of infection, hamsters were inoculated IN with 3 x 10 4 p.f.u. of SARS-CoV-2. PiN-21 or a control Nb (0.6 mg/kg) was IN-delivered to animals 6 hours post-infection (h.p.i.). Animal weights were monitored daily, throat swabs and nasal washes were collected, before euthanized on 6 d.p.i. (Fig S2A) . Similar to the IT route, IN-infection of hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in precipitous weight losses in the control animals. Encouragingly, intranasal treatment using PiN-21 significantly reduced weight loss throughout the assessment period (Fig S2B) , paralleling the results of clinical mAbs in the same model albeit using substantially higher doses. Less than 100-fold reduction in virus titers were found in nasal washes and throat swabs on 2 and 4 d.p.i. (Fig S2C-D) . Moreover, infectivity was undetectable in lung tissues 6 d.p.i., indicating that the virus has been predominantly cleared. Analysis of early time points will be needed to better understand virus suppression by Nb treatment.",

Animals were sacrificed 8 and 24 hours post-administration to assess Nb distribution and activities when recovered from various respiratory compartments and sera (Fig 2A) . Consistent with the result using the portable nebulizer, we found the inhalation dose of PiN-21 was approximately two times PiN-21 Alb (at 8 h, 41.0 \u00b5g or 0.24 mg/kg for PiN-21 v.s. 23.7 \u00b5g or 0.13 mg/kg for PiN-21 Alb ) (Table S1) while neutralization activity as assessed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50 ) of SARS-CoV-2 remained essentially unchanged after aerosolization of both Nb constructs (Fig 2B) .",

As expected, within the airways the neutralizing activities were predominantly associated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, followed by tracheal aspirate, larynx wash, and nasal wash samples (Fig  2C-D) . Compared to 8-hour post-inhalation, we found that the amounts and activities of Nbs in BAL, but not in sera, were substantially lower 24-hour post-inhalation, possibly indicating more rapid clearance. In addition, Nb conjugation to serum albumin did not seem to impact the activities in the airways, whilst stability was enhanced in the serum. These data underscore the requirement of an ultra-low dose of the ultrapotent PiN-21 construct to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vivo efficiently. Finally, PiN-21 was preferentially selected for further evaluation owing to the high stability and resistance to aerosolization, which are likely critical for clinical applications.",

Animals were monitored for weight loss, throat swabs and nasal washes were collected daily. Animals were euthanized (3 d.p.i.) and lungs and trachea were collected for virological, histopathology, and immunohistochemical analysis (Fig 3A) . Notably, pulmonary delivery of PiN-21 aerosols, despite only a minute amount, led to a remarkable reverse of weight loss in the treated animals. The average weight gain was 2% in PiN-21 versus 5% loss in the control on 3 d.p.i. (Fig 3B) . The weight loss in the control group was highly reproducible when compared with the above experiments. Critically, aerosolization treatment diminished infectious viruses in lung tissue by 6 orders of magnitude (Fig 3C) . The treatment also substantially decreased virus gRNA in the lungs (Fig S4C) . Moreover, we observed a substantial reduction of viral titers in nasal washes and throat swabs (Fig S4A-B) .

Cumulative scores encompassed pathologic features of airways, blood vessels, and alveoli/pulmonary interstitium. PiN-21 aerosolization protected most animals (5/6) from severe COVID-related histopathologic disease reflected by decreased ordinal scores (P < 0.0001) when compared to Nb treated controls (Fig 3D, Table S4 ). Histopathologic findings in the control group resembled previous reports of SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in Syrian hamsters (40, 41) . Pulmonary disease observed in the PiN-21 treated animals was very mild (Fig 3E, Fig S5) being characterized by the absence of severe necrotizing bronchiolitis in the majority of animals (5/6), a pathological finding ubiquitously observed in all control animals. Furthermore, the single PiN-21 treated animal with necrotizing bronchiolitis had localized disease, compared to the multifocal and bilateral distribution observed in most Nb controls (4/6). Bronchiolitis was also affiliated with less severe bronchial hyperplasia and hypertrophy and absence of syncytial cells when compared to Nb controls. The predominant histologic finding in PiN-21 treated animals was minimal-to-mild perivascular and peribronchial mononuclear inflammation consisting of macrophages and lymphocytes. Furthermore, aside from the one animal already mentioned, the PiN-21 group had considerably less interstitial inflammation with decreased vascular permeability, as indicated by the absence of perivascular and intra-alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin exudation (Fig S5) .",

In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that PiN-21 aerosolization given during early disease course is highly effective in decreasing SARS-CoV-2 entry, subsequent replication in permissive epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract and this, in turn, has a major impact on viral shedding. The result is the prevention of disease, including decreased cytopathic effect on permissive epithelial cells, retention of ACE2 expression on permissive bronchioles, and decreased recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of replication.",

Moreover, infection-induced weight loss correlates with pulmonary virus titer (Pearson r = -0.7) (Fig S6) and this clinical sign may be used to indicate the onset of infections (13) .

A combination of extremely low deposit doses will minimize potential adverse effects.

It may also benefit high-risk groups, such as seniors, immunocompromised individuals, and infants, in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Finally, as prevalent circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged to evade clinical antibodies and wane vaccine-elicited serologic responses (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) , this proof-of-concept study will shed light on the use of stable, multi-epitope and multivalent Nb constructs, in combination with PiN-21, as a novel aerosol cocktail to effectively block virus mutational escape (28) .

Hamsters were loaded into metal exposure cages and transported via mobile transfer cart to the Aerobiology suite in the RBL. There they were transferred into a class III biological safety cabinet and placed inside a rodent whole-body exposure chamber. Hamsters were exposed for 12-15 minutes to small particle aerosols containing nanobodies generated by the Aerogen Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen, Chicago, IL) (19) .

To determine inhaled dose, an all-glass impinger (AGI; Catalog # #7541-10, Ace Glass, Vineland, NJ) containing 10 ml of PBS + 0.001% antifoam was attached to the chamber and operated at 6 lpm, -6 to -15 psi. Particle size was measured once during each exposure at 5 minutes using an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (TSI, Shoreview, MN) operating at 5 lpm. A 5-minute air wash followed each aerosol, after which animals were returned to their cage. AGI samples were evaluated to determine the concentration of nanobodies recovered from the aerosol. The inhaled dose was determined as the product of the nanobody aerosol concentration, duration of exposure, and the minute volume of the individual hamster (50) .
