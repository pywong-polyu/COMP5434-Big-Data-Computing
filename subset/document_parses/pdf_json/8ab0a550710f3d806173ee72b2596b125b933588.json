            "text": "Background Economic cost estimates have the potential to provide a valuable alternative perspective on the COVID-19 burden. We estimate the premature mortality productivity costs associated with COVID-19 across Europe. Methods We calculated excess deaths between the date the cumulative total of COVID-19 deaths reached 10 in a country to 15th May 2020 for nine countries (Switzerland). Gender-and age-specific excess deaths and Years of Potential Productive Life Lost (YPPLL) between 30 and 74 years were calculated and converted into premature mortality productivity costs \u20ac2020 for paid and unpaid work using the Human Capital and the Proxy Good Approaches. Costs were discounted at 3.5%. Results Total estimated excess deaths across the nine countries were 18,614 (77% in men) and YPPLL were 134,190 (77% male). Total paid premature mortality costs were \u20ac1.07 billion (87% male) with Spain (\u20ac0.35 billion, 33.0% of total), Italy (\u20ac0.22 billion; 20.6%) and The Netherlands (\u20ac0.19 billion; 17.5%) ranking highest. Total paid and unpaid premature mortality costs were \u20ac2.89 billion (77% male). Premature mortality costs per death ranged between \u20ac40,382 (France) and \u20ac350,325 (Switzerland). Spain experienced the highest premature mortality cost as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (0.11%). Conclusion Even in the initial period of the pandemic in Europe, COVID-19-related premature mortality costs were significant across Europe. We provide policy makers and researchers with a valuable alternative perspective on the burden of the virus and highlight potential economic savings that may be accrued by applying timely public health measures.",

Population health in terms of increased life expectancy and reduced mortality is positively associated with economic welfare and growth, and hence negative health shocks invariably impact the economy over time. Following the theory of human capital [19] , we applied the Human Capital Approach (HCA) [11] to value the years of potential productive life lost following a COVID-19-related premature death for employed individuals. The model views health as a durable capital stock that produces an output of healthy time [11] . In terms of application, the HCA involves the adoption of a societal, or welfare-based, perspective to measure the potential stream of output that could have been produced over the course of a lifetime. This approach assumes a loss of productivity at work and at home following a reduction in health status or death. The total value of production lost is set equal to the present value of all lost future earnings of the individual up to the age of retirement [8] . Non-paid work of the employed and nonemployed was costed by the PGA. The PGA assumes that time allocated to non-market activities can be valued at its shadow price or a market wage equivalent. The PGA can be used to value time spent on household tasks and caring not remunerated by the market. A market equivalent wage for a close substitute activity is used to value the unpaid productivity lost based on the cost of hiring a paid worker to perform the task [8] .",

Inspection of excess mortality by age and gender revealed no notable excess mortality under 30 in any country, therefore, we restricted consideration to age 30 and older.

Estimates were summed to produce total premature mortality costs, by country, sex and age group. Each YPPLL was also apportioned a time allocated to non-paid work and estimated time spent on each unpaid non-market activity was multiplied by the relevant (substitute) market wage, aggregated to an annual cost and summed.

Spain experienced the greatest economic burden from the initial phase of the pandemic ranking highest for not only number of deaths (as has been reported elsewhere) [10] , but also for YPPLL, premature mortality costs (paid and unpaid) and costs compared to GDP. Moreover, our estimates revealed varied findings as we altered the lens of analysis. For example, France, ranked third in terms of total deaths, YPPLL, and second for premature mortality costs, fell to the lowest ranked country (eighth) in terms of cost per death (paid) and second lowest for premature mortality costs as a percentage of GDP. In contrast, Switzerland changed from lowest burden for deaths per 100,000 of the population to highest for premature mortality costs per death. This change in ranking is primarily due to combining the epidemiological data and the economic data to produce cost estimates of premature mortality. Switzerland's national gross wage and employment rate are in excess of many other European countries, and therefore, the comparative monetary burden of COVID-19 for Switzerland is in excess of the pure public health burden as measured by mortality and years of life lost.",

This is the case across a range of metrics including deaths, where the male/female ratio ranged between 1.42 in Switzerland to 14.71 in Sweden, and our economic estimates where premature mortality costs in the employed population was between 2.13 (France) and 203.59 (Sweden) more burdensome in males. This contrasts with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease where the male/female premature mortality cost ratio was 1.21 in France and 1.15 in Sweden and for cancer (2.01 for France and 1.06 for Sweden) [26, 27] . In particular, our estimates revealed that amongst the employed, male premature mortality costs represented almost 87% (or \u20ac0.93 billion) of the total productivity costs. This finding is driven by male costs tending to be highest in the 55-64 age group, or younger, where individuals earn higher wages and have the potential to generate more years of life lost compared to older age groups. This is in contrast to female costs which are highest in the 65-74 age group across two of the countries studied (Italy and Sweden). This percentage of the burden apportioned to males was reduced somewhat when we aggregated paid and unpaid productivity costs together in a more appropriate societal measure of work lost (76%); however, they still remained dominant in our total aggregated premature mortality cost measure.",
