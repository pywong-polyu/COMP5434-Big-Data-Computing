The reasons behind such ineffectiveness are multifaceted, among which the lack of sufficient pedagogical expertise was often blamed by researchers [2, 5, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] . In addition to the existing research, we posit that the inability of acting as polite as human tutors might play as another influential role here, which is widely recognized as an integral part of civil behavior in social communications and has been demonstrated essential in several educational settings [10, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

To answer this question, we relied on a dataset consisting of over 15K dialogues collected in the setting of one-on-one online tutoring. Specifically, we identified the politeness strategies used by tutors and students by applying the linguistic theories of politeness developed in [3] , i.e., the application of a politeness strategy can be indicated by the use of certain words and phrases (e.g., \"thank \" and \"appreciate\" are often used to express gratitude). Then, we defined a metric called UP-Score, which measures the overall politeness level of tutors and students by taking all of the observed politeness strategies into account. Our work contributes to the literature on dialogue-based ITS with the following main findings: (i) overall, both tutors and students acted politely across the whole tutorial process, among which dialogues with successful problem solving displayed a lower level of politeness than those without; (ii) tutors displayed a similar level of politeness at the beginning of all categories of dialogues, while students were more polite at the end if they successfully solved problems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 435, "end": 438, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In human-human online tutoring, each tutorial session can be regarded as a series of requests, e.g., students request help from tutors to solve problems and tutors also request students to perform certain actions to solve the problems. As indicated in [6] , a request from one person to another is likely to and mainly to give rise to negative politeness strategies, which recognize the friendliness with the other person but assume the expressed content would likely pose imposition on the other person [3] . For instance, the negative strategy Gratitude is an effective one for a requester (i.e., student) to help balance out the burden placed on a tutor (e.g., \"I would really appreciate if you could help me.\"). Therefore, we mainly considered negative politeness strategies here. The embodiment of a politeness strategy can be revealed by the use of certain politeness markers and the positions of these markers. We identified the politeness strategies contained in utterances by employing the politeness strategy classifier constructed by Danescu et al. [6] with Support Vector Machines.

When considering all of the utterances made by tutors and students across all dialogues (Row 1), the UP-Score is 0.80, which implies that the tutorial sessions took place in a relatively polite atmosphere. Also, tutors were far more polite than students (1.01 vs. 0.49). When delving into the UP-Score values of different dialogues, we observe that, surprisingly, Gap-clarified dialogues, where students achieved the least amount of learning, were the most polite one (0.99), followed by Gap-explained (0.76) and then Gap-bridged (0.74). These results motivated us to further check the UP-Score of the utterances made by tutors and students at the beginning and the end of the dialogues (Fig. 1) . Table 1 . The avg. UP-Score of students and tutors across dialogues of different categories. Differences were tested with Mann-Whitney test between any two of the three dialogue categories and are all significant (p < 0.001). Figure 1 (a) shows that tutors of all types of dialogues displayed a similar level of politeness at the beginning, but the tutors in the Gap-clarified sessions became more polite than the others starting from the 7th utterance. By analyzing the frequent strategies adopted by tutors between 7th and 15th utterances, we found that the tutors in the Gap-clarified sessions used much less impolite strategies of Direct Start and Direct Question than the tutors in the Gap-explained and Gapbridged sessions. This is probably because, in Gap-explained and Gap-bridged sessions, the tutors had successfully identified the difficulties encountered by students after the first few utterances and started to help students solve problems by giving direct opinions or concrete suggestions, and thus a higher usage of Direct Start and Direct Question. When it comes to the end of the dialogues ( Fig. 1 (b) ), we notice that the politeness of the tutors in the Gap-clarified and Gap-explained sessions had a sudden increase from about 1.0 to 1.8 at the last utterance, while the politeness level of the tutors in the Gap-bridged sessions stayed relatively stable. This is because the polite strategy Apologizing was often employed by the tutors at the last utterance of Gap-clarified and Gap-explained dialogues to convey their apologies to the students for not being able to help. Lastly, we can observe that the students in Gap-bridged sessions were much more polite than the others at the end of dialogues, which is in line with our commonsense that students were likely to use strategies like Gratitude to express the acknowledgment and appreciation for the help provided by the tutors.
