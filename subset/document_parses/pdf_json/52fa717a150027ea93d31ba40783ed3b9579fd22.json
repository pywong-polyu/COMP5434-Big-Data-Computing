[1] [2] [3] However, in the absence of long-term immunosuppression, immune-mediated rejection of the transplant invariably occurs. 4 Modern immunosuppressive regimes, while effective at reducing the development of acute rejection, do so at considerable expense to both the patient and the allograft. For the majority of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), eventual loss of a kidney transplant occurs through either death with a functioning graft, or through chronic alloimmune-mediated injury. 5 The most common causes of death post-transplant (cardiovascular disease, cancer and infection) are all promoted by immunosuppression. 6 Furthermore, the mainstay of current treatment regimes, calcineurin inhibitors, paradoxically contribute to premature graft loss through the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. 7 8 Innovative strategies are hence needed to reduce the burden of current immunosuppression and maintain the balance between therapeutic efficacy and drug toxicity. The gut microbiome is a critical determinant of human health and modulates host immunity and metabolism through a number of recognised pathways. 9 In transplantation, the gut microbiome offers a novel pathway to modify maladaptive immune and metabolic responses driven by alloantigen exposure and immunosuppression. Microbiota-derived metabolites, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in particular, are emerging as key mediators of the gut microbiomes influence over organ systems, including the immune system. 10 Formed by the fermentation of non-digestible dietary fibre by specific colonic bacteria, SCFAs may exert local effects on gut mucosa or act systemically, following systemic absorption, via engagement of specific G-protein coupled receptors or by inhibiting histone deacetylases and altering epigenetic regulation of gene expression. 11 12 In animal studies, SCFAs or their precursors (dietary fibre) have been shown to attenuate kidney ischaemia-reperfusion injury, 13 and retard the development of allograft rejection, 14 as we have recently shown in a kidney allograft model. 15 Furthermore, post-transplant hyperglycaemia caused by the commonly used immunosuppressive agent, tacrolimus, has been linked to a reduction in intestinal SCFAproducing bacteria, with SCFA supplementation sufficient to prevent or correct the dysglycaemic response. 16 Kidney transplantation results in considerable disruption to the gut microbiome, although the complexity and high interindividual variation in microbial communities of recipients has thus far impaired the ability of small studies to identify universal microbial markers predictive of post-transplant events. [17] [18] [19] However, the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria in recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants has been associated with resistance against respiratory viral infection, 20 suggesting a further role for SCFA in promoting protective immunity post-transplant.",

[26] [27] [28] Dose regimens of inulin and inulin-type fructans in interventional studies have varied widely, 26 however a fixed dose of 20 g/day is sufficient to generate changes in gut microbiota composition while limiting untoward gastrointestinal effects. 29 While dietary prebiotics have been shown to promote the growth of SCFA-producing bacteria in healthy and dysglycaemic cohorts, no studies have examined whether the gut microbiota are similarly amenable to intervention in the post-transplant period. Given the high incidence of dysglycaemia and glucose variability in the post-transplant cohort, 30 31 the potential to derive a meaningful advantage from even small improvements in glucose metabolism is significant.",

Previous controls in inulin trials have frequently included maltodextrins, 51 52 which have a high glycaemic index, or non-fermentable microcrystalline cellulose, 53 54 which is insoluble in water.
