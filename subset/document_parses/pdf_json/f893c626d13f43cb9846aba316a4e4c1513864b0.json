Blackening of the lateral wall of nose with crusts and discharge was observed on nasal endoscopy. Computed tomography of paranasal sinuses revealed evidence of sinusitis involving right maxillary, bilateral ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. KOH test of nasal tissue revealed fungus with broad asepate branching hyphae suggestive of Zygomycosis.

Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus especially diabetic ketoacidosis is a common predisposing illness [4] for acute invasive fungal rhinisinusitis. Although patients in this series had history of diabetes mellitus, none was in diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetes was well controlled in two patients and hence diabetes mellitus may not have been a strong predisposing factor in them. Renal failure was present in two and one patient had coronary artery disease in the past. In addition, it is important to consider that the use of corticosteroids which are prescribed for Covid related complications may potentially reduce immune response [5] . In this series, the already compromised immunological competence of the patients due to Covid infection could have been further worsened by comorbidities and steroids [5] . All patients in this study developed features of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis 10-15 days after the onset of Covid-illness which probably coincides with the phase of sepsis-induced immune suppression [2] . Clinical characteristics, relevant investigations and treatment details are given in Table 1 . Patients in this study presented with features of rapid tissue invasion through nasal mucosa, bone, neurovascular structures and surrounding organs. Radiology was nonspecific and the diagnosis of invasive fungus was made initially by bedside endoscopic evaluation and direct microscopic evidence of fungal hyphae using 10% KOH test, which was later confirmed by mycology culture and histopathology which are reliable methods of diagnosis [4] . Histopathology revealed evidence of angio-invasion and lumenal thrombosis. Treatment of CAIFS consists of reversal of pre-disposing state, surgical debridement and antifungal therapy [4] . ",
