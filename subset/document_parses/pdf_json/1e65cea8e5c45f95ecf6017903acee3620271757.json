We examined the educational effects of the program by evaluating clinical decision-making ability, job satisfaction, and customer orientation among the participants, namely 27 nurses in the emergency center of a general hospital. Data were collected from 3 to 24 May 2017, and analyzed using SPSS 22.0. There was a significant difference in nurses' mean scores on clinical decision-making ability, job satisfaction, and customer orientation before and after the simulation-based education. In other words, after completing the KTAS-based simulation education program, the emergency nurses showed improved clinical decision-making ability, job satisfaction, and customer orientation. Based on the results of this study, it is expected that this educational program can be effectively used for KTAS education, and it was confirmed that simulation-based education is a useful learning method for triage nurses in emergency medical centers.",

In addition, the use of emergency medical centers is rising due to an increase in the number of disasters and accidents; higher levels of service at emergency medical centers are being requested because of improvements in individuals' quality of life due to medical technology developments [2] . Moreover, during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Korea in 2020, the preparedness of emergency departments for triaging patients and ensuring the safety of staff has been of utmost importance [3] .",

The increase in non-emergency patients also leads to inefficient management of medical resources; therefore, the need for a severity classification system to determine and categorize patients' severity for efficient management has been in the limelight [5] . Severity classification involves the systematic classification of patients visiting the emergency medical center by assessing the severity of the health problem, making a judgment about the order of prioritization of care, performing emergency treatment, and allocating cases to appropriate departments [6] . Previous research found that the emphasis on severity classification has sometimes led to disability in patients because of inadequate classification",

Furthermore, studies on clinical decision-making ability [19, 33, 35, 36] also reported a significant effect of job satisfaction, critical thinking disposition, and autonomy on clinical decision-making ability. This is similar to our results, as the opportunity to learn through repeated training and on-site reenactment learning in a safe environment may have led to improved clinical decision-making ability.

This is similar to the results of Cheng et al. [37] , who found increased satisfaction after simulation training for pediatric emergency situations for various medical professionals. The increase in job satisfaction in our study may have been due to increased self-confidence because of the simulation training in a safe environment that is similar to a clinical situation. Based on this, education and training using simulations may help to improve the satisfaction of health professionals and medical staff. In addition, a follow-up study related to this is necessary.",

Kindness toward medical staff (doctors, nurses) increased slightly compared to 2014 (53.9%) in response to 57.1% of responding that they were satisfied, but it was found that patients who visited the emergency room felt that the quality of service was low in relation to the cost [1] . Based on this, improvement in nurses' job satisfaction will lead to improved customer orientation, which further leads to an enhancement in the image of the hospital. Thus, the customer orientation improvement seen in our study is a relevant result for the improvement of satisfaction among inpatient and outpatient visitors. Furthermore, in a medical setting where the demand for customer service is increasing, the improvement of customer orientation found in this study is considered a finding that meets the public's expectations regarding future emergency medical centers.",
