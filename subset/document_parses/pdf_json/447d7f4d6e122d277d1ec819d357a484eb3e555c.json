            "text": "Background: Demand for virtual visits (an online synchronous medical appointment between a health care provider and patient) is increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be additional benefits of virtual visits as they appear to be convenient and potentially cost-saving to patients. People receiving maintenance hemodialysis require ongoing care from their nephrologist and may benefit from virtual visits; however, the optimal model for a virtual kidney clinic is unknown. Objective: To codesign and assess the feasibility of a virtual (video) kidney clinic model with clinic staff, nephrologists, and patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, to be used for routine follow-up visits. Design: Mixed-methods study. Setting: Two main kidney clinics in central Calgary, Alberta. Participants: Adults with kidney failure receiving maintenance hemodialysis, nephrologists, and clinic staff. Methods: First, we individually interviewed clinic staff and nephrologists to assess the needs of the clinic to deliver virtual visits. Then, we used participant observation with patients and nephrologists to codesign the virtual visit model. Finally, we used structured surveys to evaluate the patients' and nephrologists' experiences when using the virtual model. Results: Eight video visits (8 patients; 6 nephrologists) were scheduled between October 2019 and February 2020 and 7 were successfully completed. Among completed visits, all participants reported high satisfaction with the service, were willing to use it again, and would recommend it to others. Three main themes were identified with respect to factors influencing visit success: IT infrastructure, administration, and process. Limitations: Patients received training on how to use the videoconference platform by the PhD student, whom also set up the technical components of the visit for the nephrologist. This may have overestimated the feasibility of virtual visits if this level of support is not available in future. Second, interviews were not audio-recorded and thematic analysis relied on field notes. Conclusions: Video visits for routine follow-up care between people receiving hemodialysis and nephrologists were acceptable to patients and nephrologists. Video visits appear to be feasible if clinics are equipped with appropriate equipment and IT infrastructure, physicians are remunerated appropriately, and patients receive training on how to use software as needed.",

R\u00e9sultats: Huit consultations virtuelles (8 patients; 6 n\u00e9phrologues) \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vues entre octobre 2019 et f\u00e9vrier 2020, dont sept ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es avec succ\u00e8s.

            "text": "The adoption of virtual care is expanding due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many forms and applications of virtual care. Video visits are clinical appointments occurring between a patient and health care provider by video, an alternative to in-person or telephone. While video visits are not appropriate in every circumstance, early reports suggest that overall, they may offer some benefits 1,2 and should remain integrated within the system in future. While video visit technology today is fairly straightforward, integrating video visits into existing health care systems is challenging. Ensuring the technology is easy to use and functional 3 is a prerequisite for successful implementation of video visits; however, implementation into a clinical setting presents other challenges. Video visit adoption in practices requires significant change management and ongoing guidance, training, troubleshooting, and support, 4 that accounts for the unique aspects of each practice setting. 5 People that receive maintenance hemodialysis frequently meet with a nephrologist for routine follow-up visits. Virtual visits may be appropriate for many of these encounters, as physical assessments are not always required. Our earlier work found that patients, nurses, and nephrologists were interested in trying video visits and reported several theoretical benefits that this mode of care delivery may offer. 6 However, in addition to their potential benefits, video visits also have potential risks, such as those related to a limited physical assessment or potential disruption to the patientprovider relationhip, 7 particularly if technology is a barrier to effective communication. 8 Therefore, broad implementation of video visits will require thorough evaluation of benefits and risks to prevent unintended consequences.",

In addition to meeting with nephrologists during dialysis rounds, patients have routine visits 3 to 4 times a year with their primary nephrologist at the kidney clinic. These visits are typically offered in person and occasionally through the provincial Telehealth platform, which still requires patients to travel to a registered health facility to attend the visit. At the time of this study, interest in offering video visits where patients attend from their own homes through simple videoconferencing software was increasing. The Microsoft Skype for Business platform was available through AHS as a video visit platform allowing patients to visit from their own homes, which was scheduled through the AHS Outlook personal information manager. We planned to use Skype for Business software for this study.",

Second, we assessed the feasibility of video visits and iteratively redesigned the virtual visit model through observing actual clinical encounters and a structured survey completed by nephrologists and patients (feasibility pilot study). The intention of this work was to iteratively trial and redesign the virtual visit model until no new feasibility considerations were identified. Therefore, we did not formally calculate a sample size, but recruited until participant and feedback saturation was met. We did not audio record interviews or code transcripts; however, saturation was determined through comprehensive field notes.

We also did a test run with each patient before their actual visit to ensure that they were able to use Zoom independently. This support likely increased the success rate of video visits, and also appeared to empower patients. 18 As virtual care becomes more integrated in our health care system, ensuring patients are equipped with the tools and skills to participate is important, particularly to avoid inequity 19 as not everyone has the same access to or experience with technology.",

Provincial and national administration and policies are unclear. A national virtual care taskforce in Canada has proposed 19 recommendations to move forward with virtual care, 21 which include national standards, safety and quality framework, remuneration, education and curriculum for providers, and licensing, among others. To ensure consistent, safe, and high-quality virtual care, future efforts that focus on the administration, governance, and health information systems of virtual care are needed. The findings from our study provide practical considerations for the future implementation of video visits in Alberta. In brief, clinics should be equipped with sufficient IT infrastructure that enables high-quality video visits. Patients should receive training on an as-needed basis and have an option to borrow a tablet if they do not have access to 1 of their own. Clinic processes will need to be adapted to allow for the integration of video visits in practice, such as scheduling, greeting patient upon arrival, and collecting Allow health care providers to use their own devices or acquire a clinic laptop and share as appropriate.",

While this offered important insight through participant observation, involving clinic staff in this process may have yielded helpful information to better understand how the clinic process needs to adapt to accommodate for these new duties.
