IDV is one of the causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), which causes high morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle worldwide. To date, the molecular mechanisms of IDV pathogenicity are unknown.

The main reservoirs of IDV are cattle, swine, and other small ruminants [4] . IDV is similar to ICV in regards to structure and genes. So far, IDV is mainly divided into three pedigrees: D/OK, D/660, and D/Japan, and cross-reactivity is found among those three pedigrees [5] . Reports showed that IDV is more likely to mutate and evolve than ICV; hence, a continuous monitor for IDV variation is needed [6] . Serological investigation indicates that IDV could infect humans, as screenings showed that 1.3% of general populations presented anti-IDV hemagglutination inhibitory antibodies in serum [4] . When the positive rate of anti-IDV antibodies was analyzed in people who were professionally exposed to cattle in Florida, the seroprevalence of people raising cattle was as high as 95%, and the seroprevalence of individuals who had never been exposed to cattle could be as high as 18% [7] . It is still unclear whether the IDV viruses could cause human disease and whether there is transmission among humans. IDV infections have also been reported outside the U.S., including France, Italy, Ireland, Japan, China, Morocco, Benin, Togo, and Kenya.",

Of these, the Spanish flu epidemic was the most severe one [8] . It is believed that the trigger for influenza pandemics is that the influenza viruses acquired a new type of hemagglutinin during the spread in the general population that lacks antibodies against this new hemagglutinin protein. Describing how the viruses adapt to new hosts will contribute to our understanding of the evolution and spreading of zoonotic infectious diseases that might eventually evolve into a human pandemic [9] .",

Mutations in polymerase could increase the viral pathogenicity towards mammals by enhancing the activities of viral polymerase or some other pathways. Multiple amino acid mutations in IAV polymerase proteins, such as PB2-E627K, are associated with high pathogenicity in mammals [10] . Substituting PB2-E627K can not only enhance the activity of polymerase proteins in mammalian and human cells but also contribute to the replication of influenza viruses in these cells. These two biological characteristics are closely related to the high pathogenicity of influenza viruses in mammals. However, there is a surprising lack of the E627K mutation in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus lineage. Instead, mutations at positions 590 and 591 of PB2 were detected, increasing polymerase activity [11] .",

However, these methods can only observe a small part of the many possible changes occurring in viruses at the genetic level and may neglect extra mutation sites and possible evolutionary pathways for zoonoses in the future. To overcome this potential problem, Soh et al. [12] mutated every single amino acid of influenza A PB2 one by one. Subsequently, they tested if the changes could help the virus grow better in human cells and enhance pathogenicity. In humans, IDV targeted antibodies have been found, especially in those individuals exposed to cattle for an extended period, indicating that the virus may infect humans. Moreover, the ferrets, which are good infectious animal models of the human influenza virus, are also susceptible [13] . It can be used to predict the possibility that IDV may have the ability to invade the lower respiratory tract, resulting in more severe symptoms. Unlike ICV, IDV can replicate well in cell cultures at 37 \u00b0C, which is the exact temperature of human lungs. Similarly, the HEF of IDV has a more open receptor binding region than that of ICV, indicating that IDV has a wider range of cell tropism [14] . Therefore, IDV may infect the lower respiratory tract of humans only via some adaptive genetic variations.",

Overall, 94% of the cattle-exposed persons had a positive HI and MN titer. Characteristics of seropositive cattle-exposed persons included: 41% worked with sick cattle, 4% worked with swine diagnosed with respiratory illness, and 41% selfreported febrile illness in the previous year. When testing the people living close to cattle farms (with potential risk for infection), 8 of 741 serum samples collected were positive for HI antibodies (titers \u2265 40) [7] . Song et al. have analyzed the biological characteristics of the major surface glycoproteins in both IAV and IDV [14] . It was found that IAV can specifically bind to the receptors of N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-Galactose (originating in poultry) or N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-6)-Galactose (human), and some subtypes of IAV can bind to both receptors. The bovine-derived IDV receptors are N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-Galactose and N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-6)-Galactose, while the swine-derived IDV receptor is N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-6)-Galactose, but not N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-Galactose. These findings suggest that the bovine-derived IDV may be transmitted between species just like IAV and even with more widespread cell tropism [15] . At the same time, the saccharide microarray experiment proves that IDV and ICV are similar in structure. The threedimensional crystal structure of the HEF protein receptor complex of IDV shows the segments close to the top of HEF1, together with the 230-helix, 270-ring, 170-ring. In addition, unlike in ICV, three amino acids (T239, K235, D269) form a shallow cavity with an open channel, which may be one of the reasons why IDV gets a broader host spectrum [16, 17] . Although deadly infections have not been reported in humans, IDV significance in public health should not be neglected.",

This study used amino acid point mutations at positions 627 and 701 of influenza D viruses. There are two positions in the PB2 protein that affect the growth of influenza A viruses in mammalian cells: the amino acid at position 627 (PB2-627) and the amino acid at position 701 (PB2-701) [10] . Several credible studies have found that there is always an E627K mutation of PB2 in clinical strains isolated from people who had died or were severely infected with specific subtypes of influenza viruses. Furthermore, this phenomenon occurred not only in one influenza subtype, but the PB2-E627K mutation can also be found in multiple isolates from the patients who were seriously infected or died from influenza, including H5N1 H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 subtypes. Hence, the PB2-E627K mutation may be closely related to the high pathogenicity to humans in these influenza subtypes [18] [19] [20] [21] . Mutation D701N in the PB2 protein has been found in human influenza virus subtype H3N2, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1, and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7N7, which has also been verified to enhance the pathogenicity of influenza virus in mice [22] [23] [24] . Such mutation can enhance the virus replication capacity in mammals by increasing the viral polymerase activity [25] . We decided to focus on amino acids at positions 627 and 701 in influenza D viruses based on these previous studies. We found that in IDV PB2, mutations of the position 627E and 701P are not the key sites that could affect the activities of influenza D virus polymerase.",

The results have been classified into three sections. First, mutations at specific amino acid sites lead to a reduction in viral polymerase activity or even a loss of the expression capacity of the polymerase protein. Secondly, mutations at some specific amino acid sites show no effect on viral polymerase activity. Thirdly, mutations at specific amino acid sites contribute to increasing the activities of the viral polymerase. The statistical analysis found three amino acid sites (M532, D533, and L534) that had enormous implications for IDV polymerase activities. Mutations M532I, D533S, and L534I increased the polymerase activities by 3.26 times, 9.92 times, and 2.66 times, respectively, indicating that these positions are critical. In addition, mutations at the positions 515-519, such as N515G, D516E, and E519Y, increased the polymerase activities by 4.73 times, 2.26 times, and 2.33 times, respectively.

Accordingly, the results of this research contribute to understanding, assessing, and monitoring the risk of a potential IDV pandemic that may occur in the future. That is a way to identify which of those mutations under observation during the viral surveillance is more likely to cause a significant increase in virus replication, pathogenicity, and even transmission. There are, definitely, some possible additional factors, including environmental and epidemiological factors, etc., not captured in this study. The data on amino acid mutations in this study can be combined with other data revealing evolution to explore the risks of IDV cross-species transmission.",
