On the other hand, social media often spread rumors and misleading news to get more traffic and attention. Careful characterization, evaluation, and interpretation of newspaper data can provide insight into intrigue and passionate social issues to monitor any big social incidence. This study analyzed a large set of spatio-temporal Bangladeshi newspaper data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology included volume analysis, topic analysis, automated classification, and sentiment analysis of news articles to get insight into the COVID-19 pandemic in different sectors and regions in Bangladesh over a period of time. This analysis will help the government and other organizations to figure out the challenges that have arisen in society due to this pandemic, what steps should be taken immediately and in the post-pandemic period, how the government and its allies can come together to address the crisis in the future, keeping these problems in mind.",

There were significant cases of infections and deaths. The hospital did not have adequate treatment facilities, including doctors, beds, and emergency supplies. Besides the health crisis, people have suffered enormous economic losses. Many people have lost their jobs; companies lost revenues, many of them go bankrupt. The most affected were the day-laborer and low-income workers. The lockdown in the pandemic suppressed their income. Many workers starved since their livelihood was cut-off. Working people took to the streets in search of their livelihood. They started protesting in the streets for relief. Seeing their plight, many people, including the government, came forward to help them. Because of the lockdown, the international transport system was shut down, and stopped imports and exports. As a result, the country's industry suffered miserably. Objective monitoring and analysis of social dynamics during such a big incident can help the government and other authorities decide and take initiatives where required. This research proposes utilizing articles published in newspapers to objectively monitor and analyze social dynamics during a big incidence, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Wang and Blei (2011) developed an algorithm to recommend scientific articles to users in online communities. Their method combines the advantages of traditional collaborative filtering and probabilistic topic modeling. They applied collaborative topic modeling for recommending scientific articles. Wayasti et al. (2018) applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation function in the research and extracted topics based on ride-hailing customers' posts on Twitter. In their research, they used 40 parameter combinations of LDA to obtain the best combination of topics. According to the perplexity value, the customers discussed 9 topics in the post, including keywords for each topic. Tong and Zhang (2016) recommended two experiments to build topic models on Wikipedia articles and Twitter users' tweets.",

As a result, after translating these articles, all the articles are in the Bengali language. Then, we applied tokenization to split a string of text into smaller tokens. The news articles are split into sentences, and sentences are tokenized into words. Then, we applied noise removal (e.g., removing HTML tags, extra white spaces, special characters, numbers) to clean up the text. Then, we removed the stopwords from the document. As there is no build-in stopwords module for Bengali nltk, we manually created a stopword list and made it available online 4 . Then, we expanded contraction. We set the minimum letter length to 6. We also removed all the words that were below the minimum letter length. There are no good resources for stemming and lemmatization in the Bengali language. So, we applied stemming and lemmatization to the tokens in our own process. After removing all the stopwords and other noises, there were a total of 80,693 tokens. There are some specific suffixes for the Bengali language. The suffix removal from the word has also been done with the help of Python. We used Bangla Steamer.Steamer library of Python to improve accuracy. However, it did not show the expected results as the library is effective for a small number of Bengali words. To increase the accuracy of this 80,693 sizes lemmatized dictionary, we manually verified about 30000 most frequent tokens from 80693 words. We lemmatized where we needed to lemmatized manually, and we also corrected the incorrect and misspelled words where it was needed.

We observed that as the situation deteriorated during the pandemic, newspapers had to publish much news on various topics. Manually analyzing the topics by reading a large number of articles is time-consuming and expensive. We utilized two unsupervised machine learning techniques: (a) LDA (Blei et al., 2003) , a popular topic modeling technique, as static topic modeling to automatically find topics of articles published in newspapers, and (b) dynamic topic modeling in (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) to see how those topics evolve over the long haul. LDA is a Bayesian probabilistic model that discovers topics and provides topic distribution over documents and word distribution over topics. It has two phases: (a) the first phase models each document as a composition of topics, and (b) the second phase models each topic as a composition of words. LDA utilizes word co-occurrences inside documents for discovering topics in a document assortment. Words occurring in an equivalent document are practically coming from the same topics, and documents containing comparative words will undoubtedly include comparable topics. In this research, the Gensim package in Python was utilized to execute the LDA model. We utilized every news article as a document in the topic modeling. Before applying the LDA topic model, we manually associated documents into general classes and sub-classes to know about the quality of LDA extracted fine-grained topics.",

Stacked to form a two-dimensional matrix, pleated filters (different lengths) are applied to the window. To use CNN for text classification, the different words stacked in a sentence are usually stacked in a two-dimensional matrix, and afterward, a convolution is applied to the word in the window in one word to be created applied a new function declaration.

            "text": "Temporal Analysis of Volume The time series volume analysis of newspapers is shown in Figure 7 . The figure has four plots, namely observed level, trend, seasonal, and noise or residual. The first plot Figure 7a shows the original volume, i.e., the number of COVID-19 related news articles in a time point. It shows that the curve began to rise from January when some COVID-19 cases were found in China and other countries. The plot increased sharply in early March when a few instances of COVID-19 cases were identified in Bangladesh. The curve remained high onward with some fluctuations. The second plot Figure 7b shows the trend of the COVID-19 related news publication volume. It shows that the COVID-19 related news started becoming trendy by the end of January, and the trend increased significantly in early March. The trend stayed high through the rest of the time with some fluctuations. The third plot Figure 7c shows the seasonal, cyclical change in the volume. Moreover, the fourth plot Figure 7d shows a residual or random variation in the volume. To see how newspapers reacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we tracked COVID-19 cases, death from COVID-19, and COVID-19 news volume in Figure  8 . The figure shows that the newspapers were vigilant from the beginning of the pandemic. The newspaper journalists increased COVID-19 related news coverage exponentially as soon as COVID-19 cases were found in Bangladesh in early March. The news volume continued increasing until the last quarter of March. This part of the news volume shows the newspapers reacted from about COVID-19 from the very early pandemic stage. They significantly covered the pandemic during the early period of the COVID-19 cases. The number of identified cases increased significantly by the second quarter of April, and it continued to increase. However, the number of COVID-19 related news articles did not increase during this time. Even in some cases, the news article volume decreases marginally. The possible reasons might be: (a) Because Bangladesh is a developing country, to survive at this point, people had to think more about earnings than pandemic. As a result, pandemic news did not increase attention, and newspapers did not increase COVID-19 related articles. (b) Some other big incidences gained more attention than COVID-19. (c) The newspapers reached their allocated space for pandemic news already. Spatial Analysis of Volume The spatial Distribution of Bengali newspapers is shown in Figure 9a . The number of news articles was concentrated on the central part of Bangladesh, mainly Dhaka, Narayanganj, and Gazipur. More than 6000 COVID-19 related news articles were published in Bangladeshi newspapers related to Bangladesh's central part. More than 2000 news articles related to the southern part of Bangladesh, mainly Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. The spatial distribution of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is also shown in Figure 9b . The central part of Bangladesh is the most affected area. More than 10,000 COVID-19 patients were identified in Dhaka during this time. Outbreaks have been reported in the surrounding areas of Dhaka, mainly Narayanganj and Gazipur. After the Dhaka division, we can see the highest infection rate in the southern part of Bangladesh, mainly Chittagong. Figure 9 shows a correlation between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an area and the published news volume related to that area. This means automatic monitoring of news article volume can give a clear view of the severity of a pandemic or big instances in a society. Fig. 11 . Division-wise Distribution of News Articles",

Some research used sentiment analysis in Bengali texts. For instance, Das and Bandyopadhyay (2010a) classified emotions into six categories: Happy, Sad, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Surprise. Chowdhury and Chowdhury (2014) used sentiment analysis in Bangla Microblog Posts. They applied a semi-supervised bootstrapping method utilizing SVM and Maximum Entropy. Hasan et al. (2014) proposed a strategy to identify sentiments in Bengali texts by Contextual Valency Analysis. They employed the methodology of POS Tagger in their approach. Hassan et al. (2016) used recurrent neural networks to Romanize Bengali texts and analyze sentiments. In their experiments, they used Bangla and Romanized Bangla Text (BRBT) dataset. For Sentiment Analysis of Bangla Microblogs, Asimuzzaman et al. (2017) used Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Deduction Framework to anticipate extremity and utilized fluffy rules of speech in semantic rules. Mahtab et al. (2018) designed a model for sentiment analysis on Bangladesh Cricket news. They applied TF-IDF and SVM (Support Vector Machine) in their model and found 64.596% accuracy. Tripto and Ali (2018) used sentiment analysis on Youtube comments. Their research built a model based on deep learning that classifies a Bengali text into three classes and five sentiment classes. Tabassum and Khan (2019) used the Random Forest Algorithm to classify the sentiments in Bengali texts. Tuhin et al. (",
