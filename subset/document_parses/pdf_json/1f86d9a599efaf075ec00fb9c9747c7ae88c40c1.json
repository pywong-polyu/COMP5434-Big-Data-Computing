Globally, for symptomatic patients with COVID-19 severe forms, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission must be considered as it has been described as necessary in almost 25% of hospitalized patients. 2, 3 The current pandemics is affecting health care systems all around the world in so many different aspects, which include limited resources, shortages of personal protective equipment, and lack of ICU beds number. There is a clear scarcity of resources capacity of health care systems and this lack of available responses to patient's needs, could also generate ethical conflicts in nursing ICU clinical practice.",

Critical care units are, in this regard, a setting that is particularly prone to conflict. 5 Concerning technical and medical advancements, the complexity of care situations and the lack of evidence-based approaches require nurses to focus continuously and objectively on how they can contribute to the well-being of their patients, which in turn demands high-level professional skills and ethical maturity.

In a systematic analysis about ethical conflicts, a \"moral (ethical) conflict\" was defined as \"a situation involving a clash of moral values within the practitioner, among practitioners, and/or between practitioners and patients, concerning what was the morally right action to take, or as a situation in which the duties and obligations of health professionals were unclear\" (p. 362). 7 Ethical conflict is a problem with negative consequences, which can compromise the quality and ethical standards of the nursing profession. 8 In the literature we can find five ethical guiding principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy, equity, and efficiency. 9 According to those principles an ethical issue or an ethical conflict arises when at least one of those principles is not adequately considered or two or more of these principles are in conflict. 10 In the field of ethical conflict, the four forms or categories of ethical conflict identified are: moral uncertainty, moral dilemma, moral distress, and moral outrage. 8 Nurses are also supposed to be mindful of the ethical aspects of nursing practice as the literature uses a variety of different terms to explain circumstances that are ethically questionable in one way or another. Some of these terms include ethical challenges, ethical dilemmas, ethical problems, ethical concerns, and ethical questions. Though these situations are described differently, their origin tends to include an individual facing circumstances in which beliefs, norms, or principles are either threatened or in dispute, and a decision about how to respond must be made. 11 Over recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring the ethical controversy of health professionals.",

It is defined as the ability to make decisions and is inter-related with the ethical competence and autonomy of the nurse. 13 Besides, the concept of ethical conflict is a complex construct that includes not only the inability to carry out an ethical action due to the presence of obstacles (moral distress), but also other problems such as the lack of understanding of values and ethics (moral uncertainty), the difficulty in choosing two moral values (moral dilemma), and the feeling of failure to cope with the immoral act of others (moral outrage). 14 Moral wellbeing relates to a positive condition in which moral thought and practice converge. Moral indifference defines the role of a person who does not show interest in or stand on an ethical issue. 5",

            "text": "Within the healthcare team, nurses also play a crucial role, keeping communication lines open and organizing all the clinical resources needed for patient care. The aim of nursing care is always to promote health and help the individual to cope with illness. Nurses are individuals with personal and professional values; they carry out their skills in institutions in conjunction with other professionals, all of whom have different values. In addition to this, they provide nursing care to patients who often have different religious, cultural, and moral values from their own. 7 The dynamic complexity of the work climate, including lack of complete participation of nurses in the decision-making process, different conceptions about certain actions or procedures between doctors and nurses, or lack of time to provide high-quality critical care, and challenges in resolving bioethical problems often play a significant role in the prevalence of ethical conflict and can put nurses under ethical challenges. 15, 16 Intensive care unit nurses and ethical conflicts Previous studies have focused on the analysis of ethical conflicts in nurses working in critical care units, as they are particularly exposed to the phenomenon and three main sources of conflict have been reported in these studies. First, there are decisions involving informed consent, confidentiality, and the protection of patient interests and wishes. Second, there is a conflict between the administration of certain treatments and the implementation of certain clinical procedures, with special attention to therapeutic futility and the limitations of life-sustaining treatment. Conflict situations were identified about nurses' perception of working in an atmosphere that looks like asking questions of a bioethical nature and their lack of participation in clinical decision-making. 8 A qualitative study among 15 nurses was conducted in Portugal with the aims of recognizing the ethical issues perceived by intensive care nurses in their everyday practice and to understand why these situations were considered an ethical issue and what interventions/strategies have been or are expected to be developed to minimize them. The results of this study identified that end-of-life decisions, privacy, interaction, teamwork, and health-care access as rising ethical issues. However, the reasons behind this emerging issue are personal, team, and institutional aspects. In addition to this personal and team, resources are used for resolving these issues. 17 Moral distress affects nursing procedures and, in some cases, patient outcomes and leads to several issues including impairment in physical and psychological well-being. 18, 19 A cross-sectional study was conducted in Italy among 406 nurses working in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The findings of this study reveal that nurses experience low-to-moderate levels of moral distress. However, the situations that obtain the highest scores for frequency, intensity, and level of moral distress related to the implementation of significant life-saving actions and involvement in the treatment of a child dependent on the ventilator. 19 A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran to determine the frequency, degree, level of exposure, and type of ethical conflict among 382 nurses working in the intensive care units. The results of this study suggest that the most frequent conflict reported was related to \"using resources despite believing in its futility,\" with the frequency of at least once a week or a month (68.6%). In addition to this, the most conflictive situation was a violation of privacy (76.9%). It also shows that the level of exposure to ethical conflict according to the theoretical model followed was the situation of \"working with incompetent staff\" and the most frequently observed type of conflict was moral dilemma. 15 Moral outrage is unusually common among nurses who work in intensive care settings. Moral outrage arises when subsequent efforts by the nurse to operationalize a decision are disrupted by constraints. The outrage exacerbates when these restrictions not only obstruct actions but also compel a course of action that contradicts the moral values of the nurse. 20 One study was conducted among 184 critical care nurses to obtain a transcultural Portuguese-language adaptation and validation of the Ethical Conflict Nursing Questionnaire-Critical Care Version (ECNQ-CCV) and to examine the level of exposure and characteristics of the Portuguese critical care nurses to ethical conflict. The results suggest that the frequency of occurrence of ethically conflictive situations, the following cases occurred at least once a month or week without addressing the degree of ethical conflict that might exist in professionals: Scenario: 2 \"Having to administer treatments and/ or carry out procedures without the critical patient, who is conscious, knowing their purpose and the risks involved,\" with 62.5% and Scenario 3: \"Caring for a patient who I believe should be on an ordinary hospital ward rather than in a critical care unit,\" with 62%. The results also identify that moral outrage is the most encountered form of ethical conflict and moderate rates of conflict were exhibited. 21 A major descriptive and correlational study was carried out in Spain among 203 nurses which identify that the index of exposure to ethical conflict (IEEC) was considered moderate. Situations involving analgesic medication (49.7%) and endof-life care (48.7%) are a recurrent source of conflict. Moreover, forms of ethical conflict and moral systems typically ranged from a lower to a higher degree of exposure index to ethical conflict. The most frequently experienced ethical conflict by nursing professionals was moral outrage. 8 There is also evidence that socio-demographic influences among patients admitted to critical care units have a significant impact on the role among patients in ethical decision-making. To address this issue an exploratory study was carried out in Kenya to determine the ethical dilemmas among 123 nurses working in Critical Care Units of the Kenyatta National Hospital in their daily practice and the socio-demographic factors influencing the experience. End-of-life decisions, patient care issues and human rights issues were identified as the emerging ethical issues. Level of knowledge of ethical issues, age and gender, were associated to influencing the way one perceives ethical dilemmas. 4 Another major prospective and descriptive correlation study conducted in Barcelona, Spain, analyzed the level of exposure of nurses to ethical conflict and determine the relationship between this exposure, sociodemographic variables, and perceptions of the clinical environment. The exposure to the ethical conflict was moderate and the most often recorded ethical problems were a recognition that analgesia is ineffective and care administration with-out having engaged in the decision-making process. In addition to this, professionals who viewed their atmosphere as supporting in coping with ethical issues reported lower rates of these incidents. 14 Experts accept that there are some circumstances related to patients and families, care, team interactions, and institutional features as well as ethical conflict outlets. The ethical issue of maintaining the safety of important patients and securing their rights and interests emerges from an informed consent policy about patients and their families. In respect to therapies, decisions on whether to administer them or not are related to restrictions on life-care and medical futility. Nonetheless, some data bring to our attention that it is a very conflictive and common situation in ICUs to test if analgesic medication is inadequate to control pain from the patient. In addition to this, it has been shown that certain contrasting circumstances emerge from professionalteam-dynamics partnerships, from resource management or burnout. 21 Until now, most of the research has been based on conditions that cause moral distress or moral dilemma in ICUs, due to the specific limitations of critical patients and the unique therapeutic option of ICUs. As the literature suggests, very few studies have been conducted among Spanish critical care nurses that examine the types of ethical conflict, and scarce studies speculating the positive perspective or the absence of ethical conflict as a moral state were conducted. This implicates that it is very essential to analyze how critical care nurses feel when they face a conflictive situation which eventually helps in clear recognition of the barrier that restricts the taking of action in ethical issues. The engagement of nurses in the decision-making process in critical care problems is a protective factor against the emergence of ethical issues within ICUs. Evaluating the level of ethical conflict makes it possible to gain a better insight into problematic situations in critical care units. The main research question was \"What are the levels of exposure and characteristics of ethical conflict among Spanish critical care nurses?\"",

A study conducted in Iran found that 58.3% of the critical care nurses are exposed to moderate levels of exposure to ethical conflicts. 23 These results might reflect a high engagement of ICU nurses in the decision-making process, previously described as a protective factor against the emergence of ethical. Perhaps higher levels were expected to be found considering the pandemic situation. However, we believe that the fact that this study was carried out during the critical phase of the first wave of the pandemic in the country may somehow be helpful to understand the results. The high demand for care and the scarcity of resources may have left nurses insufficient time to dedicate themselves to identifying and discussing sources of ethical conflicts in their work contexts, especially in the ICU. In addition, given the absence of family members in these contexts during the pandemic, it may have generated the delegation of these types of questions to the background, to the detriment of practical and objective questions that were constantly being asked to health professionals, especially nurses.",

            "text": "In this study, the highest level of exposure to ethical conflicts in critical care units was related to the ineffectiveness of analgesic pain control treatment in critical patients. This result is similar to two studies conducted in Portugal and Barcelona, which reports the highest level of exposure in the same scenario with mean scores of 13.217 and 14.43. 5, 21 In contrast to this, studies conducted in Iranian critical care nurses identify that working with professionally incompetent medical staff and working with nurses or nursing assistants who are professionally incompetent generated a higher level of exposure to ethical conflict. 15, 23 This study also mentions that one of the potentially conflictive situations in which the family did not know the aims or risks entailed in the treatment administered to a patient-generated the lowest level of conflict and this result corroborates with another Spanish study. 8 The next aim of the research was to identify the types of ethical conflicts. According to this objective, \"Moral Outrage\" was the type of ethical conflict most frequently experienced by the professionals, in line with the previous study conducted in Barcelona. 8 However, these results differ from studies conducted in Iranian nurses, in which \"Moral dilemma\" was the most frequently experienced type of ethical conflict. 15, 23 In line with what was described in the literature, 4,14 we assumed as a hypothesis that sociodemographic variables could have some influence or be related to ethical decision-making processes. However, the findings of our study add support to this statement that socio-demographic variables are not related to exposure to ethical conflicts. This finding is in the same line with the results of a study conducted in the USA which mentions that sociodemographic variables cannot assume the level of moral distress. 18 Conversely, one of the studies revealed that marital status and level of education of critical care nurses were associated with a high level of exposure to ethical conflicts. 23 Likewise, previous studies about moral distress have shown correlations between age and gender with the high level of moral distress. 19, 24 Regarding to the occupational variables, type of contract, work shift, total professional experience no association was detected with exposure to ethical conflicts. However, variables as \"unit of work\" and \"perceived work stress\" were found to be related to the exposure to ethical conflicts. In simpler words, nurses working in ICU had higher exposure to ethical conflict than nurses working in other critical care units. Also, nurses with perceived work stress had more exposure to ethical conflict. It seems that high exposure to ethical conflicts also creates high perceived work stress. Previous studies in ICU shown that conflicts are strongly associated with burnout syndrome in nurses. 25 In the same line, neonatal and pediatric ICU had a low level of exposure to ethical conflict. 24 Another finding of this study indicates that perceived work stress leads to higher exposure to ethical conflicts which is in the same line with the results of the study conducted among Portuguese nurses. 21 In contrast to this, one of the studies implies that neither demographic nor work-related variables can predict moral distress. 18 Concerning the COVID-19 variables, to date, exposure to the ethical conflict has not been compared in the related literature. However, having friends/family infected with COVID-19 showed significant relation to exposure to ethical conflicts in our study. Nurses being infected with COVID-19, being afraid of the pandemic, and perceived ethical conflict in pandemic were not related to exposure to ethical conflict. It\u00b4s important to highlight that \"Administering treatments and/or carrying out procedure without, as a nurse, having been previously involved in the decision to do so\" arise with the highest frequency in our study. We believe these data have a strict relationship with COVID-19 pandemic. In the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the general measures adopted by many health systems was the total limitation or restriction to visitors or relatives to reduce the transmission of the virus. 26 This limitation was also found in the Spanish health system.",
