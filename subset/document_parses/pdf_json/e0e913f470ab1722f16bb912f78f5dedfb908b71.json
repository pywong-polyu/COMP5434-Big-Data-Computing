Adolescents with anxiety often experience other adaptation problems during adolescence, such as pathological internet use [2] , sleeping problems [3], substance abuse [4, 5] , and poor academic performance [6] . Adolescents suffer from trait anxiety, which means that they remain in an anxious mood for long periods of time [7] . According to the microsystem concept in social-ecological systems theory, family and school play important mutually interacting roles through which they jointly affect adolescent mental health [8] . Additionally, Kim et al. [9] suggested that mothers play an important role in adolescent anxiety. Teachers and peers can also play roles in adolescent anxiety [10, 11] . In addition to mothers, teachers and peers will have an impact on adolescents' anxiety. At present, no study has incorporated mothers, teachers, and peers into the same model to investigate the influencing factors of adolescents' anxiety. Therefore, based on the theory of social ecosystems, this study examines the influencing factors of mothers, teachers, and peers on adolescents' anxiety from a two-way perspective of mothers and adolescents.",

            "text": "Hazan and Shaver [12] extended attachment theory to the adult stage by suggesting that emotional connection to a partner in a romantic relationship can be regarded as a type of attachment relationship, i.e., adult attachment. The classification of adult attachment differs from the previous classification of individual attachment as secure attachment, avoidant attachment, and anxious attachment [13] . Brennan et al. [14] proposed the division of attachment into the following two continuous dimensions: attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. Based on this view, numerous studies have used the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale [15, 16] and found that individuals' attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance are important personal physical and mental predictors of health and interpersonal relationship quality [17] [18] [19] . In the field of parenting, mothers with avoidant adult attachment may show more indifference and rejection in parenting and not be sensitive to the needs of their adolescents, resulting in their children lacking warm and effective support in stressful situations. Mothers with anxious adult attachment adopt more controlling and emotionally unstable interactions in their parenting behaviors and are unable to provide warm and effective support to their adolescents in stressful situations [20, 21] . Mothers with secure adult attachment provide emotional stability and warm support when raising their children [22] . Warm and effective maternal support can provide a secure base for adolescents to explore the environment bravely in a nonstressful situation. In addition, such support provides a safe haven for adolescents under pressure [23] and reduces anxiety when adolescents face stressful situations [24] .",

            "text": "Family system theory asserts that a family can be divided into different hierarchical \"energy\" subsystems, such as the marriage subsystem and the parent-child subsystem [25] . The energy generated in one subsystem can be directly transferred to another subsystem, implying that family subsystems are mutually influential [26] . For example, the marriage subsystem represents the characteristics and functions of the interactions between a husband and wife in their roles as a couple, and the mother-child subsystem represents the characteristics and functions of the interactions between a mother and her child. Maternal psychological flexibility refers to the ability of parents to accept their negative thoughts, emotions, and impulses toward their adolescents and still maintain effective parenting behaviors during the parenting process. Therefore, maternal adult attachment, which occurs within the marital subsystem, affects maternal psychological flexibility, which occurs within the mother-child subsystem. Crowell and Feldman [26] found that mothers with higher adult attachment avoidance and anxiety are more likely to use rigid and inflexible parenting behaviors while raising their adolescents [27, 28] such that adolescents with rapid and unbalanced physical and mental development do not receive flexible and effective responses and support when they encounter stressful situations, which aggravates their anxiety in stressful situations.",

            "text": "Mother-adolescent attachment refers to the lasting and strong emotional bond established between mothers and adolescents [29, 30] . According to the overflow hypothesis of family system theory, maternal adult attachment in the marriage subsystem overflows to affect mother-adolescent attachment in the mother-child subsystem [31] . Mothers with avoidant adult attachment habitually adopt evasive and indifferent responses when interacting with their adolescents. These adolescents believe that their mothers cannot provide a safe haven; thus, they form an unsafe mother-adolescent attachment with their mothers [32] . Mothers with anxious adult attachment are more likely to adopt controlling and unstable response methods when interacting with their adolescents. These mothers are also unable to provide a stable, secure safe haven for their adolescents; thus, an unsafe mother-adolescent attachment is formed [33] . As noted by Bowlby [34] , individuals with safe mother-adolescent attachment report that their parents provide a safe haven that allows them to relieve their anxiety when they encounter stressful situations. The safer the mother-adolescent attachment is, the more psychological support the adolescent can obtain when faced with stressful situations. Moreover, the stronger an individual's ability to resist anxiety, the less likely he or she is to suffer its adverse effects [35, 36] . Empirical studies also show that good mother-adolescent attachment quality can effectively reduce adolescent anxiety [37, 38] .",

When adolescents are handling stressful situations, mothers with high psychological flexibility in their parenting can effectively provide them with a safe haven [41] .

Teachers and peers are individuals who, in addition to parents, have important influences on adolescents [44] . Research has shown that teacher support and peer support directly promote the psychological development of adolescents [45, 46] . The microsystem concept in social-ecological systems theory emphasizes that the interaction between different systems affects adolescents' growth, and this concept has been used to explore how the family (mother-adolescent attachment) and school (teacher support and peer support) interact to affect adolescents' anxiety; such exploration is important for reducing adolescent anxiety [47, 48] . In the previous literature, research concerning the joint effects of teacher support, peer support, and family on the mechanism of adolescent anxiety is lacking. Studies have shown that high teacher support can promote the effect of parent-child attachment on adolescent anxiety [49] , suggesting that with adequate social support, adolescents are more likely to feel warmth and support from their mothers and that high teacher support and peer support may promote the reducing effect of mother-adolescent attachment on adolescent anxiety.",

For each of the five hypotheses of the study, we calculated the 95 percent confidence interval by bootstrapping with 5000 iterations. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the indirect effect was a bias-corrected estimate based on 5000 bootstrapping resamples.

This may be because mothers with anxious adult attachment often worry about being abandoned, often use overactivation strategies to address intimacy, fear separation from their husbands, and desire excessive intimacy. When interacting with adolescents, these mothers also use excessive activation strategies, and thus, adolescents feel that their mothers' support is characterized by control and instability, which easily generates conflict between adolescents and their mothers. Mothers with avoidant adult attachment are less sensitive when raising adolescents; lack responsiveness, support, and intimacy; and use deactivation strategies to address intimacy, resulting in adolescents without effective support in stressful situations, leading to anxiety [25] .",

This result is consistent with previous studies [62] . The current study further verifies the family systems theory overflow hypothesis. Maternal adult attachment occurs within the marriage subsystem, while maternal psychological flexibility occurs within the mother-adolescent subsystem, and the marriage subsystem overflows to affect the mother-adolescent subsystem [36] . Mothers with anxious or avoidant adult attachment have fewer psychological resources than mothers without such attachment styles when responding to the psychological needs of adolescents and engaging in flexible and effective parenting behaviors. While parenting adolescents, mothers with anxious or avoidant adult attachment are more likely to use control, experience depression, overreact, and employ rigid parenting behaviors [65, 66] . Previous research has shown that inflexible parenting behavior is related to adolescent anxiety [67] . Higher maternal psychological flexibility is related to adolescents' psychological health and other positive psychological qualities, which can help adolescents resist excessive worry under stressful situations [68] . Thus, mothers need to constantly be aware of whether they are affected by potentially problematic adult attachment styles while raising their adolescents.",

Mothers with avoidant adult attachment feel uncomfortable when close to and dependent on others and are more willing to maintain emotional distance from other people. This emotional distancing results in adolescents experiencing less closeness and care in parent-adolescent relationships and more ignorance and indifference [71] . On the one hand, such emotional distancing may directly cause adolescent anxiety; on the other hand, this emotional distancing could also reduce the quality of mother-adolescent attachment to a certain extent and then affect adolescent anxiety [39, 72] . Insecure mother-adolescent attachment prevents adolescents from having a stable safe haven in stressful situations and from having strong support, which intensifies their anxiety [72] . The safer the parent-adolescent attachment is, the lower the adolescent anxiety level is [73] .

The two protective factors at home and school interact with each other to enhance individual development, suggesting that adolescents can feel greater warmth from their mothers when they have good teacher-student relationships and peer relationships. According to Bronfenbrenner's microsystem of social ecosystem theory, home and school are the environments where adolescents have the closest contacts. School is the place where adolescents have the closest contact with people other than their families. Teachers and peers are adolescents' main contacts. Teacher support and peer support also have important impacts on adolescent anxiety [59] . This result further validates Bowlby's view that secure mother-adolescent attachment is the main factor influencing adolescent anxiety [75] . This study also found that mother-adolescent attachment has a stronger resistance to adolescent anxiety under high teacher support than under high peer support, indicating that compared with peers, teachers have a greater effect on reducing adolescent anxiety. This finding suggests that in interactions between teachers and adolescents, teachers should provide adolescents with more warmth and care so that adolescents can feel warmth and support from teachers, which plays an important role in reducing adolescents' anxiety.",

First, this study adopted the method of convenience sampling and drew its subjects from only one province in China rather than all provinces; therefore, in order to obtain results that are more representative of Chinese youth in general, it would be appropriate for future studies to adopt the method of stratified sampling in different provinces. Even then, the findings would not be generalizable outside the Chinese population; for example, they might not be representative of white or Hispanic populations. Therefore, future studies of adolescents in different countries should also be considered. Second, this study used a cross-sectional research design instead of a longitudinal research design. A longitudinal design could be more fruitful in further investigations examining the causal sequence and identifying trajectories and consequences. Furthermore, other variables, such as genetic factors and history of abuse, may influence anxiety among adolescents. Further studies may consider including these variables to control for their potential influences. Finally, although mothers are the main caregivers in most families, fathers also contribute to children's emotional and behavioral outcomes; thus, further research should examine paternal adult attachment to better investigate the effects of adolescent anxiety.",
