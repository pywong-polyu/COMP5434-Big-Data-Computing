We investigate how miniaturized barometers can be used to perform accurate spirometry in a wearable system that is built on off-the-shelf training masks often used by athletes as a training aid. We perform an evaluation where differential barometric pressure sensors are compared concurrently with a digital spirometer, during an experimental setting of clinical forced vital capacity (FVC) test procedures with 20 participants. The relationship between The two instruments is derived by mathematical modeling first, then by various regression methods from experiment data. The results show that The error of FVC vital values between The two instruments can be as low as 2\u223c3%. Beyond clinical tests, The method can also measure continuous tidal breathing air volumes with a 1\u223c3% error margin.

According to The physical model, The requirement of The garment to enable The spirometry functionality with our approach is only that it forms a chamber with an orifice in front of The wearer's airway. The model also applies to masks consisting of numerous pores such as particulate filters. From The sensing modality viewpoint, measuring The air pressure requires only a fraction of The airway, and The sensor does not need to be placed in The vent; while traditional spirometers require a sensing mesh to cover The entire airway. Moreover, The mesh-based spirometers are sensitive to humidity, and during operation, a cotton filter is usually needed between The patient and The device to absorb The moisture. On The other hand, The BME280 sensor's barometer output is independent of The humidity. In fact, BME280 also provides humidity and temperature measurement, as shown in [46] . The form factor of a stand-alone face mask without any extra tubing makes it possible to unobtrusively monitor The user's tidal breathing continuously while The user performs different activities, as well as dedicated FVC tests. As The sensors are commercially available, they can be easily integrated into personal, fashionable garments, which may appeal to a wider range of consumers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1168, "end": 1172, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Wearable Outlook"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Global Sports and Fitness Wear Market", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Technavio", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2019, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Trace composition of human respiratory gas", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Conkle", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Camp", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Welch", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1975, "venue": "Arch.
