The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 in these patients. Methods A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SciELO, and other databases to identify all relevant studies published up to 10 January, 2020. The proportion and mortality in the patients were assessed by odd ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Results A total of ten case-series including 11,755 cases with SARS-COV-2 infection and 942 deaths were selected. Among them, there were total of 791 DM patients with 186 deaths, 225 CKD patients with 45 deaths, 790 hypertension cases with 86 deaths, and 471 CVDs cases with 60 deaths. Pooled data revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the patients with hypertension, DM, CVDs and CKD were 21.1 %, 16.3 %, 14.0 % and 5.0 %, respectively. Moreover, the SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of mortality in DM (OR = 0.549, CI 95 % 0.448-0.671, p \u2264 0.001) and CKD (OR = 0.552, 95 % CI 0.367-0.829, p = 0.004) patients, but not hypertension and CVDs. There was no publication bias. Conclusions Our pooled data showed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection was the highest in the Iranian patients with hypertension (21.1 %) followed by DM (16.3 %), CVDs (14.0 %) and CKD (5.0 %). Moreover, DM and CKD in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with a 0.549 and 0.552-fold increase in mortality, respectively. Clinicians in Iran should be aware of these findings, to identifying patients at higher risk and inform interventions to reduce the risk of death. Moreover, well-designed, large-scale and multicenter studies are needed to improve and validate our findings.",

In patients with COVID-19, underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and other chronic diseases are associated with a higher risk of severe complications, death and may be associated with a rapid progression and poor prognosis of SARS-COV-2 infection [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . To date, several clinical and epidemiological studies have indicated higher risk of SARS-COV-2 infection in DM patients [19, 20] . However, it is not yet known whether patients with underlying DM are more susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection [21] [22] [23] . Some studies postulated that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be the plausible explanation of the association between risk of SARS-COV-2 infection in DM, CKD and CVDs patients and COVID-19 severity [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, diabetic individuals have a greater risk of respiratory infections due to compromised immune system, especially the innate immunity [27] [28] [29] . Previous studies have indicated that CKD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are vulnerable to be infected and become sever, since SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells through the ACE2 receptor [30] .",

Moreover, the data on the risk and mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection associated with these underlying conditions are conflicting [31] . The actual burden of these underlying diseases in Iran is considerable. Understanding the relationship between risk and mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection and country of origin of these patients is an urgent research priority, in order to reduce the disproportionate burden of disease. Recently there has been an increase in the literature on clinical outcome and demographical data of SARS-COV-2 infection in Iran. However, most available data sources were based on case series or small cohorts, limiting their results. Thus, this meta-analysis was carried out to estimate the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection among Iranian patients with DM, CKD, hypertension, and CVDs.",

A visual inspection of the funnel plot was used to assess potential publication bias. Moreover, Egger's test was performed to assess the publication bias statistically, in which p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. If the publication bias tests indicated bias existed, the Duval and Tweedie ''trim and fill'' method was used to adjust the bias.

It is possible that mechanism mediated by ACE2 receptor links patients with these underlying diseases with a higher risk of SARS-COV-2 infection and death [31, 46, 47] . To date, some studies evaluated the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection in the Iranian DM, CKD, hypertension and CVD patients. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection in the Iranian DM, CKD, hypertension and CVD patients. Our combined data based on ten studies with 11,755 infected cases and 942 deaths showed that the [21, 48, 49] . It is well known that allcause mortality rate in patients with DM is higher than in patients without DM [50] [51] [52] . Our pooled data showed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the Iranian patients with DM was 16.3 %. Moreover, our findings showed that the SARS-COV-2 infection was associated with an increased risk of mortality in the DM patients. We found a 0.549-fold increase in mortality associated with SARS-COV-2 infection in Iranian patients with DM (Table 2) . de Almeida-Pititto et al., in a meta-analysis with a total of 4305 cases with 564 DM demonstrated a 2.3-fold increase in the risk of severity and a 2.5-fold increase in mortality associated with SARS-COV-2 infection in those patients worldwide [31] . Huang et al., in a meta-analysis of 30 studies with 6452 patients revealed that the DM was associated with poor outcome of the COVID-19. Their results showed that DM was associated with higher mortality rate in in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, DM was not associated with increased need for ICU care [53] . Moreover, Kumar et al., in a meta-analysis of 33 studies (16,003 cases) found a 1.90-fold increase for DM mortality among people with SARS-COV-2 infection [32] . Barron et al., in nationwide analysis in England in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection between March 1 and May 11, 2020 reported that patients with DM was associated with significantly increased ORs of in-hospital death with COVID-19. Moreover, their results revealed that DM status, age, gender, ethnicity, and deprivation were potential confounding factors in the mortality of those patients [54] . Singh et al., in a meta-analysis based on 18 studies with 14,558 cases reported that the pooled prevalence for comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 disease was 10 % for CVDs, 11 % for DM, and 23 % for hypertension. They described that CVDs, DM and hypertension significantly increased the risk of severe COVID-19 [18] . Barron et al., revealed that DM patients with COVID-19 had 3.5 and 2.0 times higher mortality in hospital compared to those without DM, and this was attenuated to 2.9 and 1.8 when adjusted for previous hospital admissions with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or heart failure in UK [54] . Previous studies have described that there is the involvement of kidneys with SARS-COV-2 infection which might be caused high mortality [55, 56] . It has been suggested that CKD in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection might be caused by synergistic effect of virus-induced direct cytotropic effect and cytokine-induced systemic inflammatory response [57] . In the current meta-analysis, the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the Iranian patients with DM was 16.3 %. Moreover, our findings showed that the SARS-COV-2 infection was associated with an increased risk of mortality in the CKD patients. Moreover, it was associated with 0.552fold increase of mortality among Iranian infected patients with SARS-COV-2 (Table 2 ). Cai et al., in a meta-analysis based 12 studies with 3,867,367 cases described that the mortality rate among CKD patients with SARS-COV-2 infection was significantly higher that CKD patients without SARS-COV-2 infection (OR = 5.81; 95 % CI 3.78-8.94, P \u2264 0.001). They suggested that the major reason is that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines are increased in the CKD infected patients and leads to an increase in oxidative stress that eventually produces an inflammatory immune response [58] . Moreover, they have shown that CKD was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in elderly (\u2264 70) infected patients. Kolhe et el., in a study among 1,161 UK infected with COVID-19 patients showed a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection which is associated with a 3 fold higher ORs of mortality than infected patients without AKI and a 4-fold higher odds of death than AKI due to other causes [55] .",

            "text": "It appears that hypertension is a risk factor for severe form of SARS-COV-2 infection [59] . CVDs are frequent in SARS-COV-2 infection, and might contribute to severe forms of COVID-19 and mortality [60] . However, the mechanism implicated in the association between severity or mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection and CVD is still under investigation. Potential explanations include the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in older people (another established risk factor for adverse outcome), a functionally impaired immune system, and an elevated angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor expression. Our pooled ORs revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in Iranian patients with CVDs was 14.0 %, respectively. However, there was no significant association between mortality in the patients with CVDs and COVID-19 (Table 2 ). Hessami et al., in a metaanalysis including 159,698 COVID-19 patients reported a high burden of CVDs in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection, which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission [61] . Moreover, in the current meta-analysis, we found that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in Iranian patients with hypertension was 21.1 %. However, pooled data revealed that the SARS-COV-2 infection was not associated with an increased risk of mortality in the hypertension patients ( Table 2) . A study revealed a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes in CVDs patients withF ig. 5 Forest plots for proportion (a) and mortality (b) in the Iranian cardiovascular disease patients with SARS-COV-2 Infection 15 to 70 % of COVID-19 related deaths [62] . However, a previous meta-analysis described that COVID-19 has a higher mortality and case fatality rate and has increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with underlying CVDs [62] . Singh et al., in a meta-analysis revealed that the CVDS increased the risk of mortality in patients SARS-COV-2 infection [18] . A study in Hubei province among 44 672 confirmed cases with COVID-19 reported that infected patients without any underling disease had a case fatality rate of 0.9 %, rising to 6 % in patients with hypertension, 7 % in patients with diabetes and 10 % in patients with CVDs [63] . Momtamanesh et al., in meta-analysis based on 35 studies revealed that CVDs occurred in more than 25 % of infected cases with SARS-COV-2, mortality was 20 times higher, and admission to ICU increased by 13.5 times. They have demonstrated that CVDs are common in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection and are associated with increased severity and mortality in these patients [64] . We suggested that these patients might have used ACE inhibitors and ARBs which reduced mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection. Hippisley-Cox et al., revealed that ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of SARS-COV-2 infection requiring hospital admission, but were not significantly associated with risk of ICU care [65] . Previous studies indicated that the association between hypertension and worse outcomes of SARS-COV-2 Infection may be due to the higher proportion of comorbidities and a more advanced age of these patients. Pranata et al., in a meta-analysis revealed that hypertension was associated with increased mortality and COVID-19 severity [31] . However, Iccarino et al., reported that hypertension was not an independent factor affecting the SARS-COV-2 Infection in Italian patients [66] .",

First, all included articles included in this study published in English-language journals, which might lead to language bias and studies issued in other languages and unpublished studies might be missed. Second, the numbers of studies as well as sample sizes in some studies were relatively limited, which Type-II error might not be dismissed and influenced reliability of this meta-analysis findings. Third, a study included in the current meta-analysis involved data that had not been peer reviewed. However, inclusion of preprint studies helped to provide a broader views of the emerging literature, in a rapidly evolving field. Fourth, the current meta-analysis was performed in Iranian patients, which may have led to the selection bias. Moreover, these results cannot be generalized to other populations. Fifth, the small number of only ten studies indicated that the statistical power to detect differences was suboptimal. However, the pooled results in our review were more reliable than the results in each of the individual studies. Finally, multivariate analysis for adjusting the several confounding factors such as age and gender that could have an effect on results was not performed due to insufficient data in most studies. Thus, a more precise analysis stratified by clinical manifestation would require further evaluation.",

Our pooled data revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection was the highest in the Iranian patients with hypertension (21.1 %) followed by DM (16.3 %), CVDs (14.0 %) and CKD (5.0 %). Moreover, DM and CKD in the Iranian patients with SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with a 0.549 and 0.552-fold increase in mortality, respectively. Clinicians in Iran should be aware of these findings, to identify patients at higher risk and inform interventions to reduce the risk of death. However, multicenter and well-designed studies with larger sample size are needed to improve our findings and to provide a higher level of evidence.",
