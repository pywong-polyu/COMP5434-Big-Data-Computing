Following recent evidence of interoceptive signals modulating higher-level cognition, we examined whether breathing changes the production and perception of quantities. In Experiment 1, 22 adults verbally produced on average larger random numbers after inhaling than after exhaling. In Experiment 2, 24 further adults estimated the numerosity of dot patterns that were briefly shown after either inhaling or exhaling. Again, we obtained on average larger responses following inhalation than exhalation. These converging results extend models of situated cognition according to which higher-level cognition is sensitive to transient interoceptive states.",

These cognitive processes are studied from different theoretical perspectives, among which embodied cognition is currently influential. According to embodied cognition principles, all aspects of human cognition are shaped by their implementation in the human body which provides sensory experiences, enables motor processes and sends interoceptive signals about bodily states to the brain (reviews in Fischer and Coello 2016; Raab 2020; Shapiro 2019) . Several behavioral signatures indicate an intricate interconnection between body and mind. For example, we make more lenient decisions after lunch than before, reflecting an influence of blood sugar levels on cognition (Danziger et al. 2011; Gailliot and Baumeister 2007) and we tend to perceive cartoons as funnier while activating smiling-compared to frowning-related muscles, indicating that muscle tension is incorporated into emotional judgments (Noah et al. 2018 ). According to embodied cognition, even the acquisition and activation of abstract concepts, such as numbers, is crucially influenced by the body (Anobile et al. 2021; Fischer 2012 Fischer , 2018 Hartmann et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "Recently it became evident that also repetitive autonomous bodily activities, such as heart beats and breathing cycles, modulate our cognitive processes (e.g., Critchley and Garfinkel 2018; Park et al. 2020) . For example, slower breathing improves performance in a Stroop task (Prinsloo et al. 2013) , presumably mediated through cardiac vagal activity (cf. Hoffman and Lumpkin 2018) . Memory for briefly presented words is reduced when they are learned during systolic contraction compared to diastolic relaxation of the heart muscle, presumably reflecting interoceptive interference with stimulus encoding due to acutely increased blood pressure (Garfinkel et al. 2013 ; see also Thayer et al. 2009 ). Similarly, we initiate voluntary actions more frequently during the exhalation or expiration phase of breathing compared to the inhalation or inspiration phase (Park et al. 2020) . Given this recent surge of evidence for an impact of autonomous bodily rhythms on stimulus encoding and action production, as well as an advanced understanding of respiratory control mechanisms (Del Negro et al. 2018; Yackle et al. 2017) , we aimed to investigate the impact of our breathing rhythm on higher cognitive processes. Communicated by Francesca Frassinetti. Inhaling oxygen from the atmosphere and exhaling carbon dioxide from the lungs is essential for our bodily existence. Normal respiration in human adults involves 10-12 breaths per minute at rest and this changes their lung volume by up to 5 L (e.g., Del Negro et al. 2018; Hough 2001) . The rhythmic process of inhaling and exhaling is controlled through neuronal networks in subcortical brain structures (pons and medulla) that receive input from the spindles in our breathing muscles, stretch receptors in the lungs, arterial pressure receptors and chemoreceptors that monitor the composition of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood (Del Negro et al. 2018; Scheid 2005) . Breathing involves also motoric and limbic structures (e.g., the hypothalamus) and generates peripheral pressure and stretch signals that convey multimodal information to the central breathing control system.",

While the anterior insula is a convergence point for interoceptive signals in the brain (Allen 2020; Craig 2009 ), quantitative or intensity information from all senses converges in the parietal lobes and this has sparked A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM; Bueti and Walsh 2009; Walsh 2003 Walsh , 2015 according to which the parietal lobes house a generalized or cross-modal magnitude system. Although ATOM currently makes no reference to interoceptive intensities or magnitudes, it explains a wide range of cross-domain interactions between stimulus quantities, including time, space, weight and numerosity.

This task measures general cognitive capacity, such as executive functions of working memory (Baddeley 1986) . RNG performance exhibits several systematic signatures, such as a tendency to avoid repetitions and to produce counting-like responses in demanding situations (e.g., Brugger 1997) . Moreover, RNG has already proven sensitive to repetitive bodily changes, leading to larger numbers on average being stated following rightward or upward compared to leftward or downward head movements (Loetscher et al. 2008; Winter and Matlock 2013) . Interestingly Loetscher and colleagues (2010) demonstrated how even the direction of the eyes is a predictor of the magnitude of the subsequently generated number. Similarly, Audiffren and colleagues (2009) described that exercise led to longer ascending and descending series of RNG compared to a resting condition. To our knowledge there has been no published work on interoceptive effects on RNG. Given that exercise requires more and deeper breathing (Casaburi et al. 1989; Courteix et al. 1997) , we expected to see systematic effects of inhalation vs. exhalation on RNG.",

First, we counted the frequencies of numbers chosen for every participant (see Fig. 1 ) and then calculated the averages of generated numbers for every breathing phase (inhalation, exhalation) for each participant. Consistent with ATOM (Walsh 2003 (Walsh , 2015 , we predicted larger values for all these descriptive statistics following inhalation compared to exhalation. We also assessed the quality of participants' randomness by computing First Order Differences (FODs; Sosson et al. 2018; Towse and Neil 1998) and Redundancy scores (R scores; Towse and Neil 1998) . FODs refer to the difference between each number and its preceding number. An FOD value of 0 implies a repetition of the preceding number and is known to be rare in human RNG, while a value of 1 reflects counting and is known to reflect increased cognitive load. Consistent with ATOM (Walsh 2003 (Walsh , 2015 , we expected to observe a stronger ascending trend (mean FOD > 0) after inhalations and a stronger descending trend (mean FOD < 0) after exhalations (see Fig. 2 ). R scores reflect the ability of the participant to be random. In particular, the lower the R scores, the higher the randomness is (R score equal to 100% indicates total redundancy and, as a consequence, null randomness).",

Participants generated more large numbers such as 9 or 10 following inhalation and more small numbers such as 1 or 2 following exhalation (see Fig. 1 ). This previously uncontrolled aspect of performance in the widely used RNG task was predicted from an embodied cognition perspective according to which all cognitive performance is affected by bodily signals. Some previous RNG studies relied on simple correlations between body states and numerical cognition (Loetscher et al. 2008 (Loetscher et al. , 2010 Winter and Matlock 2013) , while our first experiment provided evidence for a causal link between bodily signals and numerical magnitude production. Before discussing this finding and its theoretical implications, some methodological concerns should be addressed. First, all verbal productions require some exhalation because the air stream from the lungs must vibrate our vocal chords (Rosenbaum 2009, chap. 10) . Thus, all responses in our RNG task were given while exhaling (although with vastly different quantities of air in the lungs) and this may underestimate the true effect size for the breathing-related impact on quantity processing, currently estimated at 2 p = 0.48-0.50. The described effect was observed in 17 participants out of 22. Therefore, we next presented visual quantities very briefly either at the end of inhalation or at the end of exhalation to obtain a more valid estimate for the size of the breathing-related effect on quantity processing. This improved method would also extend our discovery to the perceptual domain, consistent with a prediction from embodied cognition, according to which also encoding-related processes are affected by bodily signals (e.g., Abrams et al. 2008; Fischer and Hoellen 2004; Symes et al. 2008) . Finally, in light of the current reproducibility crisis (e.g., Camerer et al. 2018) a conceptual replication of our novel finding was desirable.",

The numerosity of dot patterns exceeding six dots (the so-called subitizing range) is generally underestimated (Izard and Dehaene 2008) . Consistent with embodied cognition, sensory features that are normally correlated with numerosity, such as the area, density, and convex hull of a dot cloud, also influence perceptual judgments (DeWind et al. 2015) .

The breathing-related errors for larger numerosities comply with Weber's Law as they are proportional to the stimulus (Dehaene et al. 1998; Gallistel and Gelman 1992) . The overall effect size was similar to that of Experiment 1, with 20 participants out of 24 showing the effect.

First, the breathing effect documented in our study supports a common representation of all kinds of sensory magnitudes in our brain. This contribution of breathing to magnitude processing calls for an extension of the scope of ATOM (Walsh 2015) to encompass also interoceptive signals. Indeed, inhalation relates to larger magnitudes and exhalation to smaller ones, and this covariation extends across perception and production. A similar proposal to extend the scope of ATOM was recently made by Miklashevsky et al. (2021) who reported spontaneous grip force adjustments after number processing. ATOM is concerned with spatial and action-related magnitudes; while our hands are prime candidates for voluntary action, breathing is a less controlled or intentional act but still related to action initiation (Park et al. 2020) . Future neurocognitive studies should determine the neurophysiological substrate of this interoceptive effect by targeting connections between the vagus nerve and the two afferent integration centers anterior insula and parietal cortex (Gasquoine 2014; Vonck et al. 2014) .",

Within the broader framework of numerical cognition, such transient influences on cognition have been theorized by Fischer (2012) who distinguished situated from embodied and grounded number knowledge. In this view, grounded cognition refers to evolutionarily inherited physical constraints, such as the impact of gravity or object impermeability on spatial-numerical associations, while embodied cognition acknowledges the impact of individual and culturally shaped sensori-motor learning histories on cognition. Importantly, situated factors such as recently performed attention shifts (Fischer et al. 2009 ) and recently encountered spatial-numerical associations ) are particularly powerful: they can dilute and even reverse such associations. The present findings of strong breathing-related changes (with effect sizes of around 0.50) in numerosity perception and production fit well with this theoretical position.",

This resulted in a lack of precise control and the impossibility to record the respiratory phase of the participants. Improvements and suggestions to the design of the present experiments should address most of the current limitations. As claimed before, one of the limits of the study involves the lack of control and recording of the respiratory phases.
