It is required for the safe re-use of potentially contaminated personal protective equipment and medical and laboratory equipment. Heat treatment is widely used for the inactivation of various infectious agents, notably viruses. We show that for liquid specimens (here suspension of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture medium), virus inactivation rate under heat treatment at 70 \u2022 C can vary by almost two orders of magnitude depending on the treatment procedure, from a half-life of 0.86 min (95% credible interval: [0.09, 1.77]) in closed vials in a heat block to 37.0 min ([12.65, 869.82]) in uncovered plates in a dry oven. These findings suggest a critical role of evaporation in virus inactivation using dry heat. Placing samples in open or uncovered containers may dramatically reduce the speed and efficacy of heat treatment for virus inactivation. Heating procedures must be carefully specified when reporting experimental studies to facilitate result interpretation and reproducibility, and carefully considered when designing decontamination guidelines.",

Transmission is thought to occur primarily via large respiratory droplets and close contact, but transmission via aerosols and fomites has also been suggested [1] [2] [3] [4] . In this context, and considering the non-negligible environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces [5, 6] , there is a need for rapid and effective decontamination methods. Clearly, decontamination is a concern for all other infectious agents as well.",

The same type of procedures are used for many other viruses such as influenza viruses, hepatitis viruses, parvoviruses and human immunodeficiency viruses [20] [21] [22] [23] . Ways to apply heat treatments vary, notably settings can use dry versus moist heat and allow different levels of heat transfer (e.g., oven versus heat block, the latter theoretically allowing a higher heat transfer) and different levels of evaporation (e.g., samples in closed vials versus in open plates, two containers classically used in laboratories). Studies often do not report detailed procedures; this may make it difficult to interpret and replicate findings or to translate them into safe guidelines if inactivation rates differ by procedure.",

Then, we estimated the decay rates of viable virus titer following treatment using a regression model. This modeling approach allowed us to account for differences in initial virus titers (0 min time-point) across samples as well as other sources of experimental noise. The model yields posterior distributions for the viral decay rates under various treatment procedures-that is, estimates of the range of plausible values for these parameters given our data, with an estimate of the overall uncertainty [26] . We then calculated half-lives from the estimated exponential decay rates. We analyzed data obtained under different treatment procedures separately. We placed weakly informative prior distributions on mean initial virus titers and log virus half-lives.

There are several mechanisms by which evaporation can impact the effectiveness of heat treatments to inactivate viruses. First, evaporation can induce a local drop in temperature due to the enthalpy of vaporization of water, limiting the effect of heat itself. Second, evaporation can lead to modifications of the virion's solute environment. Salts and proteins become more concentrated as the solvent evaporates, and under certain conditions crystallization can occur [30] . Evaporation can also modify ambient pH [30] . These processes do not depend solely on temperature; factors such such as initial composition of the medium ( [17, 31] ) and ambient relative humidity [30] play a role. Furthermore, the effects of salinity and pH on viral infectivity are not fully characterized, and hence are difficult to predict. Better understanding the impact of temperature and humidity on viral stability is critical not only for designing efficient decontamination protocols but also for predicting viral stability under different environmental conditions-with consequences for real-world transmission [32, 33] . Heat transfer could potentially also play a role in determining the rate of virus inactivation using dry heat, but our experimental design did not allow us to explore this hypothesis since virus inactivation was fast in closed vials regardless of whether they were exposed to heat using an dry oven or a heat block.",

In particular, our results show that protocols in open containers or uncovered surfaces lead to a much slower viral inactivation, at least in bulk medium. Hence, meta-analyses of the effect of temperature on virus inactivation integrating together data collected following different procedures can lead to false conclusions. This observation also has important implications regarding decontamination practices using heat treatment, as it highlights that inactivation rates reported by studies conducted on closed vials are likely not representative of inactivation rates one can expect using a dry oven to decontaminate a piece of equipment. As a matter of fact, the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel and N95 fabric treated by heat (70 \u2022 C) using a dry oven, without any container susceptible to limit evaporation, has been estimated at approximately 9 and 5 min respectively [11] . These values are on the same order of magnitude as the half-life of the virus in DMEM exposed to heat treatment in a covered plate (3.94 [3.12, 5.01] min), and considerably higher than the the half-life of the virus in DMEM exposed to heat treatment in a closed vial.

Finally, another critical aspect to consider is the potential impact on the integrity of the decontaminated equipment or specimen, notably for PPE and biological samples [11, 35, 36] .
