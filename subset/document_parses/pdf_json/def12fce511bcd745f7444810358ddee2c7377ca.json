Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on nucleic acid testing, but it has false negatives and hysteresis. e use of lung CT scans can help screen and effectively monitor diagnosed cases. e application of computer-aided diagnosis technology can reduce the burden on doctors, which is conducive to rapid and large-scale diagnostic screening. In this paper, we proposed an automatic detection method for COVID-19 based on spatiotemporal information fusion. Using the segmentation network in the deep learning method to segment the lung area and the lesion area, the spatiotemporal information features of multiple CTscans are extracted to perform auxiliary diagnosis analysis. e performance of this method was verified on the collected dataset. We achieved the classification of COVID-19 CT scans and non-COVID-19 CT scans and analyzed the development of the patients' condition through the CT scans. e average accuracy rate is 96.7%, sensitivity is 95.2%, and F1 score is 95.9%. Each scan takes about 30 seconds for detection.",

Although RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, there are still some influencing factors, such as the degree of standardization of sample collection and the time of sample collection [7] . Also, whether RT-PCR can detect COVID-19 depends on the viral load. If the sampling site does not contain viruses nor has a low viral load, the nucleic acid test will be prone to false negatives.",

To assist doctors in realizing rapid diagnosis and rapid interpretation of lung CT scans, this paper proposed an automatic COVID-19 detection method based on spatiotemporal information fusion. It analyzes the spatial characteristics of CT scans to assist doctors in COVID-19 diagnosis and fuses time information of the scans to assist doctors in quantifying the patient's condition. We achieved the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 on the collected datasets.
