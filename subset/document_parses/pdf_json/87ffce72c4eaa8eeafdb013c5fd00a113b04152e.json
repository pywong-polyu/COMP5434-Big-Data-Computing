In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, to control the rapid spread of the virus, health authorities worldwide have implemented strict social distancing measures, and have recommended hand washing, the use of PPE (i.e., masks), and the increased sanitization of public spaces [8, 17] . Many of these measures were adopted early on in the pandemic, along with the closing of non-essential businesses [35, 34, 30, 33, 39, 5] . However, as local and global economies have been suffering, various countries have eased lock-down measures, allowing non-essential businesses to resume their services [35, 34, 30, 33, 39, 5] while adhering to specific public health guidelines. Stricter measures were implemented after new variants were discovered in Fall 2020 [2, 42, 10] . According to recent studies [40, 20, 12, 28, 41] , the new variants are more contagious than the one known so far, with an increase of transmissibility ranging between 35% and 71% [12, 28, 41] .",

Considering an indirect mode of transmission only, Xie et al. ( [43] ), examined the importance of adopting frequent sanitization routines to reduce transmission via contaminated surfaces ( [43] ). Using a hybrid multi-scale model including direct and indirect transmission, Bounchinta et al. ([4] ) showed that infected surfaces can play a crucial role in disease transmission. We extend the study of direct and indirect transmission to a theme-park setting where both transmission routes will affect COVID-19 spread. Here within, we quantify the effects of environmental sanitization in reducing indirect transmission, and the effects of social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) adherence rates in reducing direct transmission of the virus. We also assess the efficacy of COVID-19 symptom checking (i.e., temperature checks) at the park gate. A multi-patch model is employed to capture transmission outcomes in two different areas of the park. Both areas include a queue and a ride environment.",

Panels (a)-(c) show outcomes when infected individuals are seeded into the visitor population that is not wearing PPE, the visitor population that is wearing PPE, and when infected individuals are distributed between these two classes and the worker population. This figure shows that increased cleaning rates greatly reduce the number of secondary infections A in the park.

Cleaning of the rides and queues (and other areas of the park),symptom testing at the gate, and mask wearing and hand-washing within the park represent mitigation strategies that a theme-park can adopt to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus. In this study, we have quantified the effects of these mitigation strategies for one themepark day using a multi-patch model simulating the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 considering both transmission between workers and visitors, and workers and visitors with the environment. The model simulates the interaction between visitors and workers in a theme-park setting while exploring a range of intervention scenarios to reduce disease transmission.",

We, however, also find that increases in park cleaning rates significantly affect this outcome, and that, as the proportion of visitors entering the park iap increases, the cleaning rate becomes the most important control mechanism for COVID-19 spread. We note, however, that when i ap is low, theme-parks can adopt the strategy of cleaning once a day if they ensure adequate use of PPE (face covering and hand sanitization). We note that as knowledge of waning immunity from vaccination and infections is currently [15] lacking, the wearing of PPE in the park should remain a top priority.",

This outcome, however, can been explained when considering specific characteristics of direct human-human and indirect environment-human transmission in the park. During a visit to the park, individuals directly contact individuals over very short periods of time during their short visit to the park. Given that the basic reproduction number R 0 of COVID-19 lies in the interval 2\u22125 [1, 23] , over the lengthy infectious period of COVID-19, the probability of transmitting the virus between humans is small. The shedding rate of the virus to the environment thus lengthens the 'effective infectious period' of an infected individual, increasing the probability of infection of susceptible. Thus, cleaning rates and mitigation of human-environment contact increases in importance.",

In the current study we have not considered the costs of implementing COVID-19 testing, park cleaning, and any provision of PPE to park workers and visitors, so we cannot comment on optimal policies that minimize transmission while minimizing cost to the park. This is a course for future work. The current study employs a system of ordinary differential equations. This type of model structure includes broad-sweeping assumptions on the mixing of individuals in the park that ignore spatial aspects of movement, and therefore, may not accurately reflect actual worker and visitor behaviour in the park. Additionally, the existing model ignores different transmission probabilities between indoor and outdoor venues. In current work we are implementing agent-based models using specific park structures with pathways, queues and rides that better represent theme-park spatial structure, indoor and outdoor spaces, and movement of the workers and visitors.
