The production of translationcompetent lysates originating from human cells or tissues remains challenging, mainly due to the variability of cell lysis conditions. Here we present a robust and fast method based on dual centrifugation that allows for detergent-free cell lysis under controlled mechanical forces. We optimized the lysate preparation to yield cytoplasm-enriched extracts from human cells that efficiently translate mRNAs in a cap-dependent as well as in an IRES-mediated way. Reduction of the phosphorylation state of eIF2\u03b1 using recombinant GADD34 and 2-aminopurine considerably boosts the protein output, reinforcing the potential of this method to produce recombinant proteins from human lysates.",

Ranging from the historical experiments that led to the determination of the genetic code [3, 4] to recent advances that allow the design of orthogonal in vitro translation systems [5, 6] , cell-free protein synthesis has revolutionized the possibilities of synthetic biology by employing and expanding the properties of in vitro translation.

Moreover, RRL cannot be genetically modified to deplete or enrich certain protein factors [10] . Previous efforts have advanced the use of mammalian cells to produce translation-competent lysates. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) have been used to develop an in vitro translation system that allows for IRES-dependent translation of reporter constructs and has been shown to produce functional glycosylated proteins of interest [11] . Lysates of human origin that support cap-dependent and independent in vitro translation of reporter mRNAs originate from HeLa cells [12] [13] [14] or from HEK-293 cells for the study of native mRNP complexes in vitro [15] .

            "text": "In our previous efforts to address mechanistic questions about translation termination, we developed an in vitro translation system based on HeLa cells that was used to monitor ribosomal density at the termination codon of reporter mRNAs [16] . This protocol was optimized to prepare lysates using the shearing forces of syringe treatment under hypotonic conditions to break up the cells and release functionally active molecules that can reconstitute the complex translation process in vitro [16] , based on a previously reported protocol [14] . During this development, we observed that cell lysis is the most crucial step for the success of our in vitro system. To further improve the efficiency and the reproducibility of this step, we applied dual centrifugation (DC) as a novel approach to lyse cells. Dual centrifugation differs from regular centrifugation by combining the simultaneous rotation around two axes. As a consequence, the centrifugal acceleration constantly changes, resulting in powerful agitation of the sample material inside the vials (Fig. 1A) . Thus, in contrast to conventional centrifugation that separates components, DC leads to efficient sample homogenization [17, 18] . Adapting this technique as a cell lysis method, we streamlined the production of translation-competent lysates in various batch sizes in a reproducible manner. The resulting lysates allowed us to dissect the role of Nsp1, a potent virulent factor produced during the early steps of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in human cells [19] .",

While many different protocols have been developed to produce biologically active lysates that can be used for in vitro studies, they are often limited in accurately defining the mechanical force applied during lysis. To apply reproducible shearing forces, we opted for dual centrifugation (DC). In this process, the samples undergo a simultaneous rotation around two axes of symmetry (Fig. 1A) . The continuous change of centrifugal forces in the sample vials leads to shearing and homogenization of the processed material [17, 18] . We rationalized that such a mechanical treatment would allow the lysis of cells independently of the buffer conditions.

In all experiments, it was confirmed that the samples did not freeze during this step.",

To visualize the lysis efficiency, we performed a Trypan Blue staining that assesses cell membrane integrity; living cells are visible as white spheres, whereas dead cells and nuclei as dark blue foci.

Lysis was achieved even under isotonic buffer conditions (in PBS, data not shown), rendering dual centrifugation an appealing method for lysing cells in virtually any buffer conditions without the addition of detergents. This is of particular interest in cases where preserving intact, functional biomolecules is crucial.

After a 50 min incubation at 33\u00b0C, we measured the enzymatic activity of RLuc, which is proportional to the protein production in the lysates. As shown in (Fig. 3A) , the luminescence measurements verify the translation capacity of all the tested lysates, with an optimal activity of lysates that were subjected to DC at 500 RPM and underwent, as shown in (Fig. 2A) , a relatively mild lysis process. No translation activity was detected in the presence of the translation inhibitor puromycin. The fact that milder lysis conditions lead to a higher translation output may be attributed to the optimal balance between disruption of sensitive components due to the mechanical forces and the efficiency of releasing the cytoplasm. Additionally, the prevention of lysis of nuclei may also contribute to the higher translation efficiency of the lysates.",

Among the most crucial factors for efficient translation is the Mg 2+ concentration. Thus, we decided to titrate this parameter to ensure that the concentration is optimal under the new lysis conditions. Setting as reference a concentration of 0.30 mM, we assessed the efficiency of translation under different MgCl 2 concentrations in the translation buffer, and we observed that the concentration of choice falls in the optimal range of translation activity (Fig. 3B) . For this reason, we selected a concentration of 0.30 mM MgCl 2 for our in vitro experiments. Notably, the range of suitable concentration was wider than for our previous translation system, indicating that lysates prepared by DC are more robust towards small changes of in vitro translation conditions. Next, we titrated the effect of the reporter mRNA concentration on the translation output of the in vitro translation reaction. We added increasing amounts of reporter mRNA, ranging from 0 to 80 fmol/\u03bcl of reaction, and as shown in (Fig. 3C) , we observed a concentration-dependent increase of the reporter protein output. This increase is linear for concentrations up to 40 fmol/\u03bcl (Fig. 3C) . Based on this result, we routinely use 5 or 10 fmol/\u03bcl for standard translation reactions since these concentrations clearly correspond to the linear range and therefore do not saturate the translation system with mRNA. The concentration of mRNA used can be adjusted depending on the downstream applications and depends on the translation efficiency of the individual mRNA.",

The eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a key regulator of global translation initiation [21] and the dephosphorylation of its \u03b1 subunit (eIF2\u03b1) has been shown to increase the translation efficiency of HeLa lysates [27] . We assessed and modulated the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 in our lysates to further increase the protein production capacity. eIF2 is the major Met-tRNAi carrier when it is bound to GTP, however, eIF2 is more stable when it is bound to GDP [28] . For this reason, the activation of eIF2 requires the activity of a guanine exchange factor, eIF2B, which promotes GDP dissociation and facilitates GTP and Met-tRNAi to form a ternary complex with eIF2. eIF2 is subject to tight control as it can be phosphorylated by several protein kinases at Ser 51 of its \u03b1 subunit (eIF2\u03b1). Once phosphorylated, eIF2\u03b1 does not allow eIF2B to exchange GDP to GTP, and protein synthesis initiation is inhibited [21] . To assess the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 in our cells and lysate, we immunoblotted total and Ser51phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. We observed that eIF2\u03b1 was considerably phosphorylated in the lysates compared to intact cells before lysis (Fig. 6A) , probably due to the activity of kinases during and/or after lysis. To modulate the phosphorylation status of eIF2\u03b1 in the lysates during in vitro translation, we used GADD34 and 2-aminopurine. GADD34 forms a complex with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and promotes the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in vivo [29] . It was shown that treatment with a 240 amino acids N-terminal truncation of recombinant GADD34 (GADD34 \u0394240) can reduce the phosphorylation state of eIF2\u03b1 and increase translation efficiency of HeLa lysates [27] . 2-aminopurine (2-AP) is an inhibitor of the protein kinase R (PKR) and other serine/threonine protein kinases and therefore represses the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at Ser51 [30, 31] . To reduce the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in our lysates, we expressed and purified recombinant GADD34 \u0394240 (Sup. Fig. S2A ), titrated 2-AP in the presence of the optimal GADD34 \u0394240 concentration, and assessed the effect on translation using RLuc reporter assays (Sup. Fig. S2B ). The addition of 2-AP alone led to a decrease in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation but did not affect the translation output. The addition of GADD34 \u0394240 led to a distinct decrease in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and a two-fold increase in the translation output (Fig. 6B, C) . Interestingly, the addition of both 2-AP and GADD34 \u0394240 (3 mM and 0.5 mM, respectively) to the translation reactions led to almost complete dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 6B ) and a 6-fold increase of protein synthesis compared to the untreated lysates (Fig. 6C) . We quantified the protein output of RLuc under these conditions by comparing the immunoblot signal of the produced protein to standard dilutions of recombinant RLuc and estimated the production of approximately 1 ng of recombinant protein per \u03bcl of lysate after 50 min \u03bff translation (Sup. Fig. S2C ). This output can be further increased by prolonging the translation reaction, increasing the concentration of the reporter mRNA, and using more concentrated lysates of higher cell equivalent density (data not shown). In other words, the translation-competent lysates can be used to produce potentially toxic proteins in vitro, yielding more than 1 \u03bcg protein per millilitre of translation reaction. In conclusion, we provide a new protocol for producing translation-competent lysates from human cells in a fast, scalable, and highly reproducible manner. Our system is highly active and enables capdependent translation with unprecedented protein yields, which not only facilitates fundamental research on translation regulation but also paves the way for the future development of large-scale in vitro protein synthesis in a human system. Figure 6 . In vitro dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 leads to increased translation output. A. Western blot analysis of extracts from growing cells and translation-competent lysates against eIF2\u03b1 and P-eIF2\u03b1 (Ser51). All samples correspond to approx. 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cell equivalents. B. Comparison of RLuc measurements of in vitro translation reactions of DCderived lysates in the absence (Control) or the presence of 0.5 mM GADD34 \u0394240 and 3 mM 2-aminopurine. RLuc activity measurements are depicted as arbitrary units (AU) of luminescence. The dots depict the values of three individual experiments (biological replicates) that were measured each three times (technical replicates). C. Western blot analysis of lysates after in vitro translation against eIF2\u03b1, P-eIF2\u03b1 and RLuc of non-supplemented lysate (No sup.), the addition of protein reconstitution buffer (Buffer), 0.5 mM GADD34 \u0394240, 3 mM 2-aminopurine, 0.5 mM GADD34 \u0394240 in combination with 3 mM 2-aminopurine or treated with puromycin. All samples correspond to 3 \u00d7 10 5 cell equivalents. In vitro translation experiments were performed in lysates produced using translation-competent buffer using 10 fmol/\u03bcl RLuc reporter without preincubating the translation reactions before adding the reporter mRNAs. Asterisk denotes the position of full-length RLuc.",
