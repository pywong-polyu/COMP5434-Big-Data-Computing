First, there are differences in the genetic background of the study populations, because the Greenlandic study included mainly Eskimo children (80%) and our study included only white children. RTIs are known to occur earlier and more frequently among Eskimo children [25] . The specific genetic background and an a priori high risk of RTI make the results of Koch et al. hard to generalize to white children. Second, RTIs were measured differently in both studies.
