This has led to key questions as to the ideal start point and the absolute span of the ensuing lockdown. Major cases in support of lockdown are Vietnam and Cuba, that have claimed almost no death [7, 8] , although such claims have been questioned [9] . In countries like Italy, the UK, the US, Sweden and Brazil, with strategic reluctance for early lockdown, comparatively softer prohibition lockdown protocols have admittedly transpired to gruesome statistics. On the other hand, European countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France as also non-European countries like Australia, New Zealand and Korea who enforced early lockdowns initially registered remarkably low infection and mortality rates [10] , with 1.0 < R 0 < 2.0 during lockdown, that spiked later (www.worldometers.info). Many suffered post-lockdown relapse [11, 12] with a sudden spurt in infection [13] . Regions like India, Iran and New York State, with variable quarantine measures, have all seen late infection surges. While India resorted to an early clampdown with an early withdrawal, New York State resorted to a late lockdown, but both with similar numerical implications, a feature attributed to inevitable movement of migrant workers [14] .",

This finding was revisited in Covid-19 transmission kinetics [18] pointing to the importance of appropriate early (pre-symptomatic) stage strategizing. Other studies stress the importance of combining isolation [19] , social distancing with widespread testing [20] and contact tracing [2] . Initial predictive models [14] used data from Wuhan and Italy [20] . Both efforts suffer from a lack of robustness due to inaccurate future prediction that is reliant on sparse data, devoid of any inherent ML training protocol.The first predictive study used a Bayesian inference structure on a simplistic SIRV model [21, 23] , using infection statistics from Germany. While a move in the right direction, it suffered from two key deficiencies: lack of a time evolving death rate as an independent dynamical variable and over-reliance on infection statistics in predicting mortality rate. [19] addressed this, but it lacked the probabilistic kernel of [21] . Another issue that has often been overlooked is the role of a containment strategy in counterpoising the contagion of the disease by identifying and blocking the key nodal links in the complex signaling network defining the chemical pathways [22] .",

Class Class D comprises India, Poland, Iran, France, Portugal and Brazil, with ongoing infection regimes. We deliberately chose New York State instead of the entire United States due to its high population density and tourist/ worker traffic that is quite different from the national average. With the number of reported cases being highly dependent on the number of daily testings, not necessarily in agreement with the actual disease propagation dynamics, we observe some deviations between the simulated I(t) and the actual number of reported cases. On the other hand, D(t) is less affected by the testing rate. Since we are using mortality statistics with the same weightage as the infected data, we prioritize mortality prediction.

It precisely estimates mortality statistics for 18 countries, accurate upto the next 30 days, beyond the last date of data training. Ideal lockdown imposition and withdrawal times have been predicted and validated, including for ongoing regimen e.g. India. PHIRVD also predicts secondary relapse timings and establishes mortality-to-infection ratio as the key pandemic predictive descriptor instead of reproduction number. PHIRVD is also capable of analyzing the impact of migration, an ongoing project. Our findings clearly suggest that phased lockdown is a potent containment tool but needs to be strategically imposed, where the correct implementation and withdrawal times are paramount. Secondary infection and mortality prediction will be key to future strategic quarantine imposition and analyzing impact of future therapeutics. PHIRVD leads to three key outcomes. First, we present highly accurate probabilistic predictions for the numbers of infected and dead for each country for a total of 18 countries, typically 3 weeks beyond the last date of (Machine Learned) data training. We can safely claim that this is the first, inherently probabilistic COVID-19 model that can claim such high levels of accuracy over such an extended time period (upto 30 days) probing in to the future and that too for all countries considered.",

While the qualitative trends are similar for all classes (A, B, C, D) of countries, the impact of lockdown on the first peak, and then a second (relapse) peak, hint at the internal health versus econometrics of the countries concerned. To prove this point, we compare infection (and mortality) propagation kinetics of 2 chosen countries for two different dates, one on the recess (UK: Figure 7 ), the other with uprising infection level (India: Figure 8 ). As opposed to the recent furore about school children being exposed to the Covid-19 menace as a result of early lockdown withdrawal, our result clearly shows that there is practically no difference in mortality between a withdrawal on June 1, 2020 as against a later withdrawal e.g. July 1, 2020 (although a withdrawal on May 1 would have been disastrous). The 1 June (almost equally safe) withdrawal would, of course, be favoured on economic and social grounds. The third key outcome of our analysis is the establishment of mortality:infection ratio as the key descriptor of pandemic over and above reproduction number, that has conventionally been used for the purpose. The proof of this is in the accurate prediction of the secondary infection relapse time that the reproductive number fails to predict. As can be seen from Figures 7a and 7b , this relapse time period could be deferred with a late lockdown withdrawal on July 1 (as compared to June 1) although the peak mortality rates are not hugely different (ca 200 at 1 July compared to ca 400 at 1 June). Using 1 July 2020 as the UK lockdown withdrawal date, there is a clear signature of secondary relapse in the first week of September (identified as the second peak in Figure 7 . The Indian situation is clearly more challenging, though, as shown in Figure 8 . While perhaps economically unsustainable, India could benefit with a lockdown even beyond 31 July, 2020. For other nations like Iran, Portugal, France and Poland, our predictions of non-trivial secondary relapses (all in late June) match almost perfectly with data, both infected and dead. A real point of contention amongst politicians, health professionals and medical scientists has, for long, been the correct lockdown implementation and withdrawal times. In statistical parlance, this effectively amounts to an estimation of the FWHM as has been estimated for Wuhan at 2.6 weeks from initial infection [32] . To analyze these counterclaims, we incorporate the effects of withdrawal of lockdown as a country specific, dynamically evolving quantity.",

The function L(t) is such that before lockdown withdrawal, it does not alter the contact probability while after withdrawal, it linearly increases from the value 1 to \u03b1 over a time interval of k days, ensuring that the contact probability between susceptible and infected increases from a low to a high value within this period.",

            "text": "The Bayesian MCMC data training leading to supervised learning is itself conducted in two steps using a double-filtration process. First, infection data alone are used to arrive at a preliminary set of values, characterizing each country. The said values are then filtered through combined infected and mortality statistics for a second training to sequentially converge to a preset upper limit. The training schedule is repeated multiply to ensure accurate predictions of the training dataset. Estimation of the equilibrium reproduction number is strategically used to reduce the effective parameter space from 13 to 8 parameters, perfectly conforming with the Bayesian MCMC prediction which shows that value fluctuations with other parameters do not contribute much to the infection kinetics. The model clearly separates the H and P infection classes to reflect their differential levels of infection and mortality. Another constituent is the death rate kinetics embedded in the central structure. The infection propagation model outlined in Eq. (1) is a multi-parameter model whose parameters are evaluated using predictive data modeling within the Bayesian MCMC construct. Similar structures have been selectively used in (19, 23) albeit for single-country specific models without any explicit mortality dynamics. Over-reliance on infection statistics has often led to incorrect estimation for mortality statistics, whose accurate prediction is our first key target, an aim that is remarkably well served by our ML-embedded compartmentalised model. We present both the cumulative and daily (inset plots) statistics of infected population over 400 days, data trained between 10 February 2020 to 29 June 2020 (140 days) and then predicted up to the next 8 weeks (shown up to 12 July 2020 in Table 1 ). To understand how the algorithm uses the data to determine the parameters, it is useful to recall some elements of Bayesian statistics (32, 33) . Let D = (D 1 , D 2 , ..., D n ) represent the full data vector that is being used to train the algorithm. For our case, the subscripts run over both the time intervals (daily) as well as the data types, such as I c (t i ) and D(t i ). Similarly, let \u0398 = (\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 , ..., \u03b8 \u03b1 ) represent the vector of parameters. A key ingredient is the prior probabibility distribution (Bayesian priors) for each \u03b8 i . While the absence of any knowledge of the system would call for a prior that is flat in the physically allowed region, the incorporation of such knowledge (which, in the present context, could be divined from the analysis of, say even part of the data for a single country in a given class) quickly gives the prior a somewhat peaked structure. In other words, one could as well start with a normal-distributed prior, viz., \u0398 \u223c N (\u0398 0 , \u03c3), where the vector \u0398 0 represents the mean of the parameters and \u03c3 = (\u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 , ..., \u03c3 \u03b1 ) the standard deviation. As it turns out, the dependence of the final result on the prior is quite insignificant.Given a \u0398, it is straightforward to calculate the conditional probability P(D|\u0398) of obtaining a realization D for the data. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability for \u0398 given the data is expressed as",
