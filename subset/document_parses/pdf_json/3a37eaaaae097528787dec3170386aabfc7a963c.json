Due to the lack of drugs and prophylaxis against COVID-19, most of the countries are now relying on preventive measures focusing on maintaining social distance. However, this social distancing can create global socio-economic threats and psychological disorders. Therefore, these control measures need to have an assessment to evaluate their potential in containing the situation. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to control measures, health care facilities, and prevalent diseases. Based on our findings, the number of COVID-19 deaths found to reduce with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. We found 0.23, 0.16, and 0.21 as the measurement of non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of .

Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between the reduction of COVID-19 cases and the earliness of preventive initiation. As a result, enhancing health care facilities as well as imposing those control measures in a short time could be valuable to prevent the currently raging COVID-19 pandemic. The apathy of taking immediate health care action from the nations has identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worst. Gambia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Namibia, and Nepal have marked in a state of danger based on the comparative study towards the health care action for the top twenty burdening and least affected countries. Interestingly, no association in most diseases except for few cases has found between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19, which warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level. We believe that this study could provide a guide for future COVID-19 research.",

The virus causes a severe form of respiratory illness, including pneumonia, fever, diarrhea, breathing difficulty, lack of smell/test, and lung dysfunctions with 4.5% of global mortality rate (Adhikari et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Syal, 2020) .

Apart from the casualties, another primary concern is to deal with the ongoing global socio-economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Gangopadhyaya and Garrett, 2020; Joo et al., 2019) .

For instance, the majority of the COVID-19 patients are male (54.3%), while the fatality is more frequent (15%) in older age groups (above 80 years old) than in the younger population (Syal, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Furthermore, asymptomatic patients may play a critical role in the transmission process (Shen et al., 2020) .

In most countries among the 20 profoundly affected countries, the visa restriction policy has employed after a couple of weeks of the first COVID-19 case report, except for Iran and Switzerland. Congruently, many of the countries showed their apathy to prioritize the screening in airport and border. In contrast, the starting of declaring a state of emergency has seen distinctly by the top burdening. Figure 1 shows that excluding the USA, Iran, and India, all the top burdening shows aloofness in the solidification of the public health structure. Among twenty top burdening USA, Italy, Iran, and Canada seem to take immediate action to stimulate emergency administrative structure afterward, the first confirmed cases of the epidemic compatibly. It is a scandalous finding that most of the top saddling countries introduce isolation and quarantine policies a minimum sixteen days later except few countries.

            "text": "The correlation between COVID-19 case fatality and health service parameters have evaluated to assess their effect on current pandemic as shown in Figure 2 (a-c) . Herein, we considered three vital health system resources: (a) the number of physicians (Figure 2 (a)), (b) the number of nurses and midwives (Figure 2(b) ), and (c) the number of hospital beds (Figure 2(c) ). All the resources have taken with an inclusion of the calculation of per 1000 peoples. It has speculated that the COVID-19 case fatality is strongly associated with these resources. We found 0.23, 0.16, and 0.21 as the measurement of non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians, nurses and midwives, and hospital beds and these relationships are highly significant with p-value of 7.13\u00d710 -06 , 0.0046, and 0.0196, respectively. As expected, the COVID-19 case fatality is high in those countries that have a lower number of physicians, hospital beds, and nurses and midwives. This observation is plausible since more doctors could treat more patients while fast health care could have provided with more nurses and hospital beds.",

Quite a few associations, correlations, as well as comparisons, have used throughout the investigations to find the relevant insights about the epidemic. The analyses of the top twenty saddling, as well as the least affected countries, have identified roughly the reasons along with the taken national health care actions. Those nations who have shown the apathy of taking immediate health care actions after the first identified case brand their circumstances more dreadful. Besides, similar lethargy of taking the immediate health care action also seen in some least burdening countries and marked as in danger. Moreover, there is an acute emergency of taking immediate health care actions to control the pandemic as most of the least saddling countries found the benefits. Also, the findings of this paper support that the COVID-19 case fatality of a country is affected by the number of physicians, hospital beds, and nurses and midwives since it has observed that there is a high COVID-19 case fatality in those countries that have a lower number of physicians, hospital beds, and nurses and midwives. The evidence of the study also validates that the increasing number of doctors, hospital beds, and nurses will result in a decline in the number of deaths from COVID-19. A stimulating finding is that the countries having higher life expectancy appear to have radically lower fatality rate in the epidemic.",

Also, weak immunity has listed as one of the significant risk factors in many chronic disorders, including infections, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases(Franceschi et al., 2018;Niccoli and Partridge, 2012). Therefore, we investigated the relation between COVID-19 case fatality and the human lifespan. Due to the unavailability of the age-specific information of the COVID-19 cases and deaths, the life-expectancy was as it represents the percentage of older peoples living in a particular country.TheFigure 2(d) illustrates the relationship between life expectancy and COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) per 1000 cases. The CFR ofCOVID-19 was substantially lower in countries with higher life expectancy. This observation is interesting as it previously thought that the CFR of COVID-19 would be higher in people older than 70 years (Glynn, 2020). The explanation of these findings could lie in their diet and lifestyle. In countries with high lifespan, people tend to have healthy food habits. For instance, a quality diet has linked to the longevity of Japanese people(Kurotani et al., 2016). The diet can positively influence the overall health and immunity that eventually lead to a long lifespan(Hale et al., 2015;Kalache et al., 2019). In a human study,",
