We investigated risk factors and outcomes for infection with the delta variant among vaccinated hemodialysis patients. Methods Patients on maintenance hemodialysis who received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine were analysed according to having developed COVID-19 (study group) or not (control group), in a retrospective, observational, comparative study. We compared risk-factors for developing breakthrough COVID-19 and assessed clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality rates. Results Twenty-four cases of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared to 91 controls without infection. Breakthrough infection was associated with chronic immunosuppressive treatment, hematological malignancies, and low antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. All COVID-19 cases occurred at least 5 months after vaccination, and most were caused by the B.1.617.2 variant (at least 23/24 cases). COVID-19 was categorized as severe or critical disease in 11/24 patients (46%), and 54% required hospitalization and COVID-19-directed treatment. The source of infection was nosocomial in 6/24 cases (25%), and healthcare-related in 3/24 (12.5%). Mortality rate was 21%. Overall mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed COVID-19 than in controls (odds ratio for all-cause mortality 7.6, 95% CI 1.4-41, p = 0.002).",

Protection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, is not absolute. Concerns regarding breakthrough COVID-19 in vaccinated patients are increasing, as vaccine efficacy appears to gradually decline in the months following vaccination [1, 2] . The emergence of highly infectious variants and especially the predominance of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, escalate these concerns [3, 4] . End-stage kidney disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) is a risk-factor for severe COVID-19 infection and mortality [5] . Vaccinated patients on MHD may be more susceptible to breakthrough COVID-19 because of impaired immune systems and increased exposure. While most MHD patients develop an immune response following messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination [6] , this response is weaker than in the healthy population [7] , and may diminish over time [8] .",

However, several studies reported significantly reduced vaccine effectiveness, ranging from 53 to 66%, at the time when the delta variant became predominant [14, 15] .

The risk for breakthrough COVID-19 caused by the B.1.617.2 variant was not negligible in our cohort of vaccinated MHD patients, 6 months after vaccination. Humoral response to the BNT162b2 vaccine is weaker in MHD patients than in healthy controls [18] . Both early and late post-vaccination IgG anti-S levels are lower in older and immunocompromised MHD patients [7, 8, 19, 20] . In our cohort, breakthrough COVID-19 was associated with immunosuppression. Subjects with breakthrough infection had lower IgG anti-S levels than controls. This might be the result of waning immunity since vaccination, or an initial weaker response to the vaccine, or both. Antibody levels increase substantially in MHD patients after a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine [21, and unpublished data] . Increased antibody responses with improved neutralization kinetics, including against the delta variant, were recently reported [22] . A third (booster) dose of the vaccine demonstrated effectiveness in reducing confirmed COVID-19 and severe disease in a large study from Israel [23] , during the B.1.617.2 variant predominance [11] .",

An outbreak of the delta variant, which included breakthrough infections in vaccinated healthcare workers and admitted patients, was recently reported. It resulted in significant morbidity, although mortality was limited to hospitalized, mostly unvaccinated patients [25] . Another recent study reported on a nosocomial outbreak of the delta variant among a highly-vaccinated group of patients and healthcare workers (96.2% of the exposed population was fully vaccinated with 2 doses of BNT162b2). Again, severe and critical COVID-19, as well as fatality rates, were significant among admitted patients. The time from vaccination in this report was at least 5 months, implying that waning immunity was a major contributor [26] . In both reports, SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred despite wearing surgical masks [25, 26] . Our study adds to the concerns of healthcare-associated COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals.",

Viral genomic sequencing was not performed in the case who was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on anti-N-Ab conversion. Nevertheless, B.1.617.2 became the dominant variant in Israel during the study period, accounting for 93-99% of cases in which viral genomes were sequenced nationwide, during July-August 2021 [11] , and 100% of cases sequenced from our hospital. Thus, it is highly likely that this case was also caused by the delta variant. IgG anti-S levels were available only 6 months following vaccination and for only 29% of the cases with breakthrough infection, which could have biased the results. However, these patients were otherwise similar to the rest of the study group, and as such we believe they are an adequate, representative sample. We used a cutoff of 50 AU/ml as reflecting adequate levels of IgG anti-S-Ab; however, the protective threshold is currently undefined.",
