Our findings show that governments in all four countries reacted to the COVID-19 crisis by providing extensive protection for jobs and enterprises. Differences arise when it comes to solidaristic policy responses to care for the most vulnerable population, in which CEE countries show great variation. We find that social policy responses to the first wave of COVID-19 have largely depended on precious social policy trajectories as well as the political situation of the country during the pandemic.

Writing about the 2008 financial crisis, Chung and Thewissen (2011) emphasize path dependency and claim that European countries basically implemented temporary measures that were in line with what type of welfare regime to which they belonged. Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia in a broader sense fall under the so-called post-communist or Eastern European welfare state model. This ideal-typical model mixes characteristics from both the liberal and conservative-corporatist regimes as well as including some distinct features of the post-communist societies. Namely, these countries have inherited from the statesocialist era a high take-up rate of social security but relatively low benefit levels. They also share a commitment to social insurance, combined with elements of universalism, corporatism and egalitarianism (Aidukaite, 2011; Cerami, 2006; Cerami & Vanhuysse, 2009; Deacon, 1992; Haggard & Kaufman, 2008; Szikra & Tomka, 2009 ). Recent literature (Jahn, 2017; Jahn & Kuitto, 2011; Kuitto, 2016 ) that focuses on social policy performance in CEE countries (often in comparison with Western ones) concludes that the CEE countries do not form their own welfare state regime type. Instead, they are considered to be either hybrid cases (Kuitto, 2016) or fall into different regimes (Jahn, 2017) .",

Diversity can be observed in spending patterns, with Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic being higher social spenders in terms of percentage of GDP than the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, with Poland being in the middle. Social spending as per cent of GDP (see Figure 1 ) underpins patterns discussed above. Higher spending in Hungary and Poland compared to the other two countries is notable despite the fact that the former country has shown a steady decline in social spending during the period of 2010-2018. In terms of disaggregated welfare spending, the most important similarity is that all four countries have a pension-heavy welfare state with around 40% of their social spending going to this purpose (OECD, 2020) . Hungary can also be characterized as a high spender on family policies with greater investment in child care services and longer periods of parental leaves that are based on the income replacement principle (Rat & Szikra, 2018) , while Slovakia bases its system more on long parental leaves with flat rate benefits (Saxonberg, 2014) ; meanwhile, Poland recently switched from having more market-oriented policies to a system with greater investment in child care services and longer period for parental leaves, as well as generous universal payments (Szelewa, 2017) .",

CEE welfare states have been under heavy pressure following the financial and economic crisis of 2008-2010 (see Aidukaite, 2019; Saxonberg & Sirov\u00e1tka, 2014; Szelewa, 2014; Szikra, 2014) . The pressure was felt most severely in Lithuania, where cuts in social benefits and public wages were implemented in order to reduce government budget deficits as also indicated by Figure 1 (Aidukaite, 2019) . Slovakia and Hungary have also suffered a decline in GDP, while Poland has managed to retain the same level of GDP during the crisis. As illustrated by Figure 2 , all four countries have managed to overcome the crisis and have experienced fast growth in their GDPs since 2010.

In their case, the state was not as generous as with companies to keep jobs. The length of the unemployed insurance benefit remained maximum of 3 months, and the benefit level kept at 70% of the minimum wage. Workers who were laid off by their employers and became registered unemployed under the pandemic received no special protection or social assistance. The loopholes of the Hungarian unemployment benefit system already existed prior to the 2020 crisis but now affected a larger size of the population. National data show that close to half of all registered unemployed received no benefit from the state because they did not fit the strict eligibility criteria (Nemzeti Foglalkoztat\u00e1si Szolg\u00e1lat -NFSZ, 2020). A similarly sizable population was left out of the unemployment benefit schemes due to being formerly employed in the black or grey economy, and these people received no social protection from the state at all, be that universal or targeted benefits. The neglect of the unemployment benefit scheme reflected the ideology of the ruling party about a 'work-based society' that claims that no handouts should be provided to the workless (K\u00f6ll} o, 2019; Szikra, 2019). In line with this social policy paradigm, the public works programme was extended providing simple physical work to some of the unemployed (Moln\u00e1r et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Lithuania stands out by offering more generous social assistance benefits than the other three countries and easing the criteria to receive them. The government in Lithuania has also implemented an innovative social policy measure by offering one-time lump-sum payment worth 120-200 EUR to all families with children (depending on the number of children and income of the family), and 200 EUR to pensioners, people who receive disability allowances, that is, to the most vulnerable social groups. The political situation in Lithuania can account for these solidaristic measures because the country was facing parliamentary elections in autumn 2020. The president, who had been recently elected on May 26, 2019, has promised to make Lithuania a 'welfare state' and the slogans of reducing poverty and inequality were central also to his presidential election. Meanwhile, the ruling party during the period 2016-2020, the 'Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union' also promoted social solidarity and left-wing ideas. Thus, the coincidence of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the electoral competition over the 2020 elections that thematized social solidarity led to the approval of special social policy measures in this country. In contrast, the Hungarian government insisted on continuing its previous program of 'workbased society' as an explicit anti-thesis of the welfare state (see Szikra, 2019) . According to this paradigm, implemented during the previous economic crisis, no handout is provided to people 'without work.' In line with the 'work-based society' idea, policies tried to maintain and create jobs through generous subsidies to employers to pay salaries and through the extension of the public works program. Many of those who lost their jobs, however, could not benefit from these actions. Because of the lack of meaningful social assistance benefits in Hungary, the most vulnerable often had to rely on charity and local aid organized by municipalities.",

A liberal understanding of mortgage protection is reflected in the fact that this decision is left to the discretion of banks.

When it comes to protecting the most vulnerable social groups, Poland incrementally extended some of its social insurance schemes, including the unemployment and sickness leave benefits, but issued no new programs for that purpose.",

In Hungary, most policy measures targeted employers in forms of generous labour cost subsidies and tax exemptions. In contrast to the other countries, unemployment benefits and social assistance remained meagre, as they were prior to the crisis, and no extra compensation for home-based care was provided. In Lithuania, the improvements made in social policy (social assistance and social housing) have long-term implications. Those with a low income can now enjoy greater government protection against falling into poverty. This comes as a surprise and a contradiction to measures implemented during the 2008-2010 crisis when the government carried out cutbacks (temporal and long term) in family policy, unemployment insurance and sickness benefits (see Aidukaite, 2019) . In Slovakia, the policies concerning COVID-19 are not likely to lead to long-term changes. An important indirect impact may be that successive governments showed that the state is capable of taking strong measures to improve the general welfare of the population. This situation could lead to a general increase in support for welfare state policies and a decrease in support for neo-liberal notions claiming that the market can solve the most important social problems.",

Even though the post-communist countries all have hybrid welfare states that deviate somewhat from the Western models, they all have strong conservative-Bismarckian elements (see Aidukaite, 2011; Deacon, 1992; Kuitto, 2016) , so in this sense, they have also behaved so far similar to Chung and Thewissen's expectations of conservative welfare states. Lithuania, however, deviated from the other three countries not only keeping up with Keynesian demand management and labour market protection but also implementing universal policies and granting more generous benefits for those most in need. In Lithuania, where social policy reforms in this direction are likely to be maintained after the crisis, these changes have a potential to lead to more comprehensive and universal social policies in the future.",

            "text": "8 days of diagnosing the first case of COVID-19, the Polish government declared a state of emergency on March 12 (PrimeMinister of Poland, 2020). Apart from closing the borders, the government introduced the obligation to wear masks in all public places; it started enforcing rules about social distancing and it closed all education/ early education and care facilities. Among the countries in the region, Poland noted the highest number of cases per one million inhabitants, that is, 1,137.88.In order to counteract the economic effects of the pandemic, as well as to respond to the public health crisis, the Polish government proposed a package of three legislative acts at the end of March, mid-June and mid-July.Social policy measures including employment protection became a crucial element of the legislative package labelled 'Anti-Crisis Shield,' together with protecting the economic activities of companies, with 212 billion PLN (about 9.1% of GDP) spent on the former and 100 billion PLN (about 4.3% of GDP) on the latter (Government of Poland, 2020).Employment protection measures became available to employers if they needed to halt their operations in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak or if they were forced to shorten the working time. In the first case, employers had to demonstrate a decrease in sales and received compensation of all labour costs up to only 50% of the minimum wage (currently 2,600 PLN gross, around 590 EUR per month). A parallel scheme for small and medium companies links the level of support to the degree of loss in sales, covering up to 90% of all employment-related costs in the case when loss in sales reached 80% (Government of Poland, 2020). Employers can receive this type of aid up to 3 month. When it comes to reducing working time, the state covers the cost of wages up to 40% of the average pay including social security dues for 3 months.Furthermore, for self-employed, a one-off cash transfer of 80% of the average wage was made available. In case of a significant drop in activity, a one-off cash payment of up to PLN 2080 (80% of minimum wage) for selfemployed and workers employed under civil law contracts was paid for up to 3 months.The unemployed who have lost their jobs under the pandemic could receive a special solidarity scheme with a cash benefit of 1,400 PLN (about EUR 350) per month for a maximum of 3 months beginning June 1, 2020(ZUS, 2020a). This unemployment compensation scheme provides a higher level payment than the regular one, that is, when unemployment is not caused by the pandemic (689 PLN -156 EUR). It increased first to 881 PLN (189 EUR) from 1 June and further to 1,200 PLN (272 EUR) from September 1, 2020 (Gazeta Prawna, 2019). Although the increase seems quite large, the level of the regular unemployment benefits in Poland was very low at 37% of one's previous (average) income (as compared to the OECD average of 64%) (OECD, 2019 in Naczyk, 2020).",
