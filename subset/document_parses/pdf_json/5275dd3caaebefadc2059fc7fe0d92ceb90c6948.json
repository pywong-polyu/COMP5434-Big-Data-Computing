A descriptive study of malaria in the period 2003 to 2020 was conducted using data from the Malaria Epidemiological Surveillance Information System related to a remote municipality with an extensive border with Peru to understand the disease transmission, focusing on the obstacles to its elimination. The transmission increases at the end of the rainy season. During the period of 18 years, 53,575 malaria cases were reported (Mean of API 224.7 cases/1,000), of which 11% were imported from Peru. Thirteen outbreaks of malaria were observed during the studied period, the last one in 2018. The highest burden of cases was caused by P. vivax (73.2%), but P. falciparum was also prevalent at the beginning of the study period (50% in 2006). Several changes in the epidemiological risk were observed: (1) the proportion of international imported cases of malaria changed from 30.7% in 2003 to 3.5% in 2020 (p<0.05);",

The number of cases and the incidence of malaria in 2019 and 2020 were the lowest in the period of 18 years. The burden of malaria in indigenous areas and its determinants, seasonality, geographical access and the long international border are obstacles for the elimination of malaria that must be overcome.",

Aiming at \"a world free of malaria\", one of the global technical strategies (GTS) for 2030 is to reduce malaria mortality and case incidence rates by at least 90% when compared to 2015 1 . Transforming malaria surveillance into a core intervention is one of the pillars of GTS. Reliable information and analyses are essential for planning actions and for identifying populations and areas at higher risk for malaria 2 . In Brazil, 144,888 cases of malaria were reported in 2020. From 2000 to 2015, Brazil showed a significant reduction in the number of malaria cases (76%), reaching one of the millennium goals 3 . However, when compared to 2016, there was a 61% increase in the number of cases in 2017 4 .",

As malaria results from specific ecological, sanitary, political and cultural conditions in each place 5 , it is necessary to know the local epidemiology in which the disease is present to establish adequate measures to fight against it. Different determinants are pointed out for malaria endemicity and they are related to the difficulty of disease elimination; the main determinants are: gold mining malaria [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , malaria in indigenous area 11, 12 , urban malaria [13] [14] [15] , border malaria [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and malaria in conflict zones 17 , each one with different degrees of endemicity. Atalaia do Norte, one of the largest municipalities in Amazonas State, Brazil, is an area historically affected by malaria, with a high incidence of the disease, although it has been poorly studied until now. This study analyzed the epidemiology of malaria in this municipality during the last 18 years (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) (2019) (2020) to understand the disease transmission, focusing on the surveillance of malaria as a core intervention to achieve elimination.",

Approximately 80% of the population is indigenous. Part of the Vale do Javari Indigenous Land is located in this municipality, one of the largest indigenous lands in the world, inhabited by the Marubo, Matses (Mayuruna), Kanamari, Matis, Kulina-Pano and Korubo ethnic groups. Peruvian and Colombian immigrants also live in the municipality's headquarters. Vale do Javari is the territory with the highest concentration of isolated (and not contacted) indigenous people in the world. Access to rural locations is by small boats and occasionally by air with small landing strips in some villages and flights conducted by the military in small aircraft that provide services to the State, at a very high cost. There are no commercial planes in this area. Laboratory diagnosis and treatment are supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The local health service is responsible for malaria outside indigenous areas while malaria in indigenous areas is managed by professionals from the Special Indigenous Unit of the Vale do Javari Sanitary District (DSEI-VJ) organized in seven base poles with health structures. All cases must be reported to the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Malaria), a robust Ministry of Health database filled in by local health workers.",

The upper limit was calculated by adding two standard deviations to the mean. The lower limit was calculated by subtracting two standard deviations and the mean of cases. Months that exceeded the upper limit of the average were excluded from the initial analysis; b) the means and standard deviations were recalculated for each month, after excluding the epidemic months, to build the expected endemic curve for the municipality. Graphs were made with the expected and the observed number of cases. Months were considered epidemic when they exceeded the expected upper limit. Such classification was an adaptation for the study to demonstrate the frequency variation in the time series. For the analysis of the duration of epidemics, the classification described by Braz et al. 19 was used: short (one to four epidemic months in a year); medium (five to eight epidemic months in a year) and long (nine to 12 epidemic months in a year).",

In 1994, the National Health Foundation reported an important number of deaths in the indigenous population that was initially attributed to hepatitis, but was later demonstrated to be malaria, the main cause of morbidity and mortality in that outbreak 21, 23 . Sampaio et al. 21 showed that the cases were related to the distance between villages and extractive areas and that the disease was spread, not radiated from a single focus. In 1997, the non-governmental organization down and programs need to maintain their activities as API and number of cases are still very high.

Other studies have consistently shown the changing pattern between men and women over time 10, 31 . In the Amazon region, malaria has long been considered an occupational disease associated with mining, extractive activities and other predominantly male occupations 32 . The quarantine due to COVID-19 led to a reduction in the occupational mobility. This may explain, at least partially, the decrease in the percentage of cases among men in 2020, but this fact must be clarified. Changes in the most affected age group were also observed. In 2003, 58% of the individuals affected were less than 15 years old; in 2020, 60.8% of those affected were under 15 years old (p<0.01). Similar changes were observed in other contexts with long histories of malaria and a high epidemiological risk in the Amazon region 3,10,21 . Taking these findings into account, it is imperative to carry out field studies to establish the presence of asymptomatic infections. Several studies have shown that after many malaria episodes in high epidemiological risk areas, adults may develop clinical immunity and not show (or show few) symptoms, while children, who have not yet developed this type of immunity, are more likely to suffer from symptomatic clinical malaria 33, 34 .",

However, in 2019, there was an increase of 31% in cases compared to 2018 3 . One of the goals of the Brazilian National Malaria Control Program is to eliminate cases caused by P. falciparum, and to achieve this goal actions against this parasite, that are more susceptible to vector control activities are necessary.

Despite the decrease of imported cases from Peru in the last years, the international border of 1,180 km long may be one of the obstacles to malaria control. Both countries are separated by the Javari River that can be easily crossed, and the inhabitants are permanently moving to both sides of the frontier in search of health, goods and services. In the region of Loreto, the bordering area in the Peruvian Amazon, malaria cases have almost tripled in recent years 38 and riverside communities living at the border of Peru have a fragile structure of health services. The study by Braz and Barcellos 22 , carried out in 2016 and 2017, showed that Atalaia do Norte forms a conglomerate with six other municipalities bordering Peru, maintaining a high incidence of the disease. It is worth mentioning that malaria in border areas is difficult to control due to the displacement of people, border conflicts, cultural differences and complicated national public health regulations 39 . Control strategies involve necessarily a coordinated work between both countries. Sharing epidemiological information systematically can be the first step to start a coordinated work 40 .",

Antimalarial drugs are provided after a laboratory diagnostic test. There are no other health services available in this area and apparently, there is no illegal trade for selling antimalarials to the populations.

At the end of 1999, the Brazilian government started the implementation of Special Indigenous Health Districts (DSEIs in its Portuguese) with support from the MSF. After structuring the DSEI, the work of MSF was completed leaving the indigenous primary health workers and microscopists well trained 20 . Brazil was one of the countries that reached the \"combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases\" Millennium Development Goals (MDG), with a decrease of 75% of malaria cases in 2015 (142,583 cases) compared to 2000, when 615,247 cases were reported 24 . In contrast to the reduction of cases in Brazil after the epidemic in 2005 and 2006, malaria burden in the city of Atalaia do Norte continued extremely high, with a peak in 2008 and another one in 2012. These peaks seem to have been caused by the discontinuity of malaria actions. Fewer cases in 2003 and 2004 were likely underreported. After 2013, malaria cases decreased and in 2019 the lowest number of cases in the last 15 years was reported. This success can be attributed to the intensification of the malaria control program in the municipality with expansion of the diagnostic network in rural localities, especially in indigenous areas. An active community participation combined with surveillance, vector control, active case detection and treatment was part of the success. In 2020, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recognized the efforts made and awarded the municipality as \"Champions\" of Malaria in the Americas 25 .
