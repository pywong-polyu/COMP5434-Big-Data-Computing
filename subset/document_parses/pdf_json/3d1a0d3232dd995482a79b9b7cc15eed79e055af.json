            "text": "Due to its high transmissibility, Omicron BA.1 ousted the Delta variant to become a dominating variant in late 2021 and was replaced by more transmissible Omicron BA.2 in March 2022. An important question is which new variants will dominate in the future. Topology-based deep learning models have had tremendous success in forecasting emerging variants in the past. However, topology is insensitive to homotopic shape variations in virus-human protein-protein binding, which are crucial to viral evolution and transmission. This challenge is tackled with persistent Laplacian, which is able to capture both the topology and shape of data. Persistent Laplacian-based deep learning models are developed to systematically evaluate variant infectivity. BA.5 are more contagious than BA.2. In particular, BA.4 and BA.5 are about 36% more infectious than BA.2 and are projected to become new dominating variants by natural selection. Moreover, the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art methods on three major benchmark datasets for mutation-induced protein-protein binding free energy changes.",

The research community focuses its attention on the mutations at the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) due to the fact that the RBD facilitates the binding between the S protein and the host angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which initiates the viral entry of a host cell and infection. It turns out that the binding strength between the S protein RBD and the ACE2 is proportional to the viral infectivity [20, 25, 41, 45, 47 ]. An artificial intelligence (AI) study revealed that natural selection is the governing mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 evolution [10] . Specifically, viral evolution selects those mutations that are able to strengthen the RBD-ACE2 binding. This mechanism led to the occurrence of many variants, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Mu, etc. Natural selection in SARS-CoV-2 mutations was conformed beyond doubt in April 2021 by the genotyping of over half a million viral genomes isolated from patients [50] .",

A strong RBD-antibody binding would lock off RBD-ACE2 binding and directly neutralize the virus [24, 48, 60] .

It was unveiled that viral evolution also selects those mutations that are able to weaken RBD-antibody binding, leading vaccine breakthrough infections [52, 53] . Therefore, a new virus with RBD mutations that make the virus more infectious and more capable of evading the antibody protection would become the next dominating variant, which is the underlying principle for the successful forecasting of Omicron BA.2's dominance [11] .",

Due to the structural complexity and high dimensionality of of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), methods that are able to effectively reduce the PPI structural complexity and dimensionality have demonstrated great advantages in predicting PPI BFE changes [49] . Advanced mathematics, particularly, persistent homology [6, 15, 16, 33, 57, 61] , offers tremendous abstraction of PPIs. Persistent homology is the main workhorse in popular topological data analysis (TDA) [3, 12, 13, 59] .

            "text": "Based on FPH, a topology-based network tree (TopNetTree) model was constructed from conventional neural network and decision trees for predicting PPI BFE changes [49] . In the past two years, this approach has been extended with SARS-CoV-2 related deep mutational data to predict the BFE changes RBD-ACE2 and RBD-antibody complexes up on RBD mutations [7, 8] . Initially, in early 2020, TopNetTree model was applied to successfully predict that RBD residues 452 and 501 \"have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains\" [10] . These RBD mutations later appeared in all major variants, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Theta, Kappa, Lambada, Mu, and Omicron L452R/Q and N501Y mutations. In April 2021, the TopNetTree model predicted a list of 31 RBD antibody-escape mutations, including W353R, I401N, Y449D, Y449S, P491R, P491L, Q493P, etc. [50] . Notably, experimental results confirmed that mutations at RBD residues Y449, E484, Q493, S494, and Y505 enable the virus to escape antibodies [2] . It was revealed that variants found in the United Kingdom and South Africa in late 2020 would strengthen virus infectivity, which is consistent with the experimental results [14] . In summer 2021, a topology-based deep neural network trained with mAbs (TopNetmAb) was developed to forecast a list of most likely vaccine-escape RBD mutations, such as S494P, Q493L, K417N, F490S, F486L, R403K, E484K, L452R, K417T, F490L, E484Q, and A475S [8] , and mutations S494P, K417N, E484K/Q, and L452R were designated as the variants of concern or variants of interest denounced by the Worldwide Health Organization (WHO). The correlation between the experimental deep mutational data [26] and AI-predicted RBD-mutation-induced BFE changes for all possible 3686 RBD mutations on the RBD-ACE2 complex is 0.7 [8] . In comparison, experimental deep mutational results for the same set of RBD mutations from 2 different labs only have a correlation of 0.67 [26, 46] . TopNetmAb predictions of Omicron [9] and Omicron BA.2 [11] infectivity, vaccine breakthrough, and antibody resistance were nearly perfectly confirmed by experiments and pandemic evolution in the world. These mechanistic discovery and successful predictions may not be achievable via purely experimental means, indicate the indispensable role of AI for scientific discovery.",

In particular, the shape of data arisen from a family of homotopy geometries cannot be captured by persistent homology. For example, the geometry of each drum in an acoustic drum set is designed to offer a specific sound or frequency, but persistent homology is insensitive to the change in the sizes (or shapes) in the drum set. This challenge in TDA was addressed by the introduction of persistent Laplacian, or persistent spectral graph [54] . Persistent Laplacian manifests the full set of topological invariants and the shape of data in its harmonic and non-harmonic spectra, respectively. Additional mathematical analysis [31] and a software package, i.e., HERMES [55] , for persistent Laplacian have been reported in the literature. This method has been successfully applied to biological studies, including protein thermal stability [54] , protein-ligand binding [32] , and protein-protein binding problems [56] .",

We hypothesize that persistent Laplacians generates intrinsically lowdimensional representations of PPIs and dramatically reduce the dimensionality of PPI data, leading to a reliable high-throughput screening of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. To quantitatively validate this hypothesis, we integrate the harmonic and non-harmonic spectra of persistent Laplacians with efficient machine learning algorithms, i.e., gradient boosting tree (GBT) and deep neural network (Net), to predict PPI \u2206\u2206G following mutations. The resulting topological and spectral-based machine learning models are validated on three major benchmark datasets, the AB-Bind database [44] , SKEMPI dataset [34] and SKEMPI v2.0 dataset [22] , giving rise to the state of the art performance. Meanwhile, with additional training on SARS-CoV-2 related datasets, our models forecast emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and recommend four Omicron subvariants, i.e., BA.2.11, BA.212.1, BA.4, and BA.5 for active surveillance.",

Lastly, we present the validation of our models on SARS-CoV-2-related datasets. [11] . These values are significantly higher than those of other major SARS-CoV-2 variants as shown in Figure 1 . Note that Omicron BA.2 is the most infectious variant. It is about 20 and 4.2 times as infectious as the original SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant, respectively.

Its 645 single mutations involving 29 antibodyantigen complexes are denoted as the AB-Bind S645 set. In the AB-Bind S645 set, about one-fifth of mutations strengthen the binding, while the rest are destabilizing mutations. In particular, 27 non-binders, which are mutants determined not to bind within the experimental sensitivity of the assay, are in the dataset. The mutation-induced binding free energy changes for these non-binders were set to -8 kcal/mol. For machine learning models, non-binders are outliers and can cause a very negative impact on model accuracy. As shown in Table 1 , our TopLapGBT and LapNet models achieved the R p of 0.89 and 0.72 for the AB-Bind S645 set. In comparison, TopNet outperforms LapNet because TopNet includes auxiliary features, while LapNet has only Laplacian features. The R p values of our other seven models are lower than 0.89 but higher than 0.72. Note that our worst model (LapNet) still outperforms the other best model in the literature by a large margin of 36%, while our best model is about 68% better than the other best model in the literature, indicating the predictive power of our topology and Laplacian-based machine learning models. Both GBTs and Nets models are quite sensitive to system errors as the model training is based on optimizing the mean-square error of the loss function. The BFE changes of 27 non-binders (-8 kcal/mol) did not follow the distribution of the whole dataset. For the TopLapGBT model, the RMSE of AB-Bind S645set is 1.68 kcal/mol and reduces to 0.97 kcal/mol when 27 non-binder samples are excluded. In this case, the R p of the TopLapGBT model is increased from 0.89 to 0.95. The consensus results of GBT and Net have correlations of 0.86-0.87, which are lower than that of GBT but higher than that of Net. GBT models outperform Net models in the validation, showing that GBT performs better than Net on a small dataset.",

This dataset is collected from the literature for protein-protein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally determined structures. It consists of single-and multi-mutations. Among them, 2,317 single mutations out of 3,047 entries are called the S2317 dataset. Recently, a subset of 1,131 non-redundant interface single-mutations is selected and denoted as the S1131 set [58] . Table 2 shows the Pearson correlation coefficients on tenfold crossvalidations of various models, including topology-and Laplacian-based models. The proposed topology-and Laplacian-based models are found to be more accurate than other existing methods. One may notice that for a larger training set, the consensus predictions of GBT and Net outperform GBT methods. Additionally, topology-based models contain topology features and auxiliary features, which include more biomolecular information than Laplacian-based models. For the S8338 set, TopLapNetGBT has the highest Pearson correlation R p of 0.8702 and RMSE of 1.01 kcal/mol as shown in Table 3 . TopLapNet has the most accurate results with R p of 0.8688 and RMSE of 0.984 kcal/mol. Topology models, aided by auxiliary features, have the R p in the range of (0.848, 0.870) and RMSE in the range of (1.070 kcal/mol, 0.984 kcal/mol). LapNet and LapGBT models have their R p values slightly lower than that of mCSM-PPI2, but the R p of their consensus (LapNetGBT) is higher than that of the mCSM-PPI2.",

These are deep mutational enrichment ratio data, including mutational scNeting data of ACE2 binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein [40] , mutational scNeting data of RBD binding to ACE2 [26, 46] , and mutational scNeting data of RBD binding to CTC-445.2 and of CTC-445.2 binding to the RBD [26] . Note that in our validation, our training datasets exclude the test dataset, which is a mutational scNeting data of RBD binding to ACE2.

Features generated by binned barcode vectorization can reflect the strength of atom bonds, van der Waals interactions, and can be easily incorporated into a machine learning model, which captures and discriminates local patterns. Using the atom subsets, for example A A (r) and A B (r), simplicial complexes are constructed by only considering the edges from A A (r) to A B (r) for Vietoris-Rips complexes. Then from the Vietoris-Rips complex filtration, barcodes generated from persistent homology are enumerated by bar lengths in certain intervals with number 0 or 1. Meanwhile, for each complexes in the filtration, eigenvalues are calculated according to the graph Laplacian analysis. The statistics of eigenvalues such as sum, maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation are collected to have a normalized features for machine learning methods. Another method of vectorization is to get the statistics of bar lengths, birth values, and death values, such as sum, maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation. This method is applied to vectorize Betti-1 (H 1 ) and Betti-2 (H 2 ) barcodes obtained from alpha complex filtration based on the facts that higher-dimensional barcodes are sparser than H 0 barcodes.",

The validations are performed on the datasets discussed in the results section. The accurate prediction of the mutation-induced binding affinity changes of proteinprotein complexes is very challenging. After effective feature-generations, a machine learning or deep learning model is also required for validations and real applications. The gradient boosting tree is a popular ensemble method for regression and classification problems. It builds a sequence of weak learners to correct training errors. By the assumption that the individual learners are likely to make different mistakes, the method combines weak learners to eliminate the overall error. Furthermore, a decision tree is added to the ensemble depending on the present prediction error on the training dataset. Therefore, this method is relatively robust against hyperparameter tuning and overfitting, especially for a moderate number of features. The GBT is shown for its robustness against overfitting, good performance for moderately small data sizes, and model interpretability. The present work uses the package provided by scikit-learn (v 0.23.0) [37] . The number of estimators and the learning rate are optimized for ensemble methods as 20000 and 0.01, respectively. For each set, ten runs (with different random seeds) were done, and the average result is reported in this work. Considering a large number of features, the maximum number of features to consider is set to the square root of the given descriptor length for GBT methods to accelerate the training process. The parameter setting shows that the performance of the average of sufficient runs is decent.",

Paired with advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the proposed persistent Laplacian method outperforms the state-of-art approaches in validation with mutation-induced binding free energy changes of PPIs using major benchmark datasets. An important forecasting from the present work is that Omicron subvariants BA.2.11, BA.212.1, BA.4, and BA.5 have high potential to become new dominating variants in the world.",

This dataset has 7,085 entries, including single-mutations and multi-mutations. To validate mCSM-PPI2, David et al. filtered only single-point mutations, selected 4169 variants in 319 different complexes, and denoted them as the S4169 set[42]. Additionally, set S8338 was derived from set S4169 by setting the BFE changes of the reverse mutations as the negative values of the original BFE changes induced by mutations. We present our tenfold cross-validation results on sets S4169 and S8338 inTable 3. For S4169, TopLapNetGBT has the most accurate result with R p of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.06 kcal/mol. Topology-based models, aided by auxiliary features, have correlations greater than 0.80 and RMSE from 1.04 kcal/mol to 1.10 kcal/mol. Purely Laplacian-based models also performed quite well, with the Pearson correlation of 0.76, which is the same as that of the mCSM-PPI2.",
