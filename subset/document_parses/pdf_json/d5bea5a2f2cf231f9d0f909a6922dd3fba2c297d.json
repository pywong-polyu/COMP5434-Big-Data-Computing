            "text": "Physiological signals can contain abundant personalized information and indicate health status and disease deterioration. However, in current medical practice, clinicians working in the general wards are usually lack of plentiful means and tools to continuously monitor the physiological signals of the inpatients. To address this problem, we here presented a medical-grade wireless monitoring system based on wearable and artificial intelligence technology. The system consists of a multi-sensor wearable device, database servers and user interfaces. It can monitor physiological signals such as electrocardiography and respiration and transmit data wirelessly. We highly integrated the system with the existing hospital information system and explored a set of processes of physiological signal acquisition, storage, analysis, and combination with electronic health records. Multi-scale information extracted from physiological signals and related to the deterioration or abnormality of patients could be shown on the user interfaces, while a variety of reports could be provided daily based on time-series signal processing technology and machine learning to make more information accessible to clinicians. Apart from an initial attempt to implement the system in a realistic clinical environment, we also conducted a preliminary validation of the core processes in the workflow. The heart rate veracity validation of 22 patient volunteers showed that the system had a great consistency with ECG Holter, and bias for heart rate was 0.04 (95% confidence interval: \u22127.34 to 7.42) beats per minute. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean \u00b1 1.96SD. This system has been deployed in the general wards of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Department and Respiratory Medicine Department and has collected more than 1000 cases from the clinic. The whole system will continue to be updated based on clinical feedback. It has been demonstrated that this system can provide reliable physiological monitoring for patients in general wards and has the potential to generate more personalized pathophysiological information related to disease diagnosis and treatment from the continuously monitored physiological data.",

            "text": "Physiological signals contain abundant personalized information. Studies have shown that vital signs can help to detect early deterioration in a general ward. In current medical practice, vital signs of patients at general wards are often measured at an interval of more than 8 h [1, 2] , only 2-4 times per day. According to some studies, 75% of the preventable adverse events occurred in patients who were not monitored outside the ICU, and 84% of them showed signs of deterioration in the first eight hours of an adverse event such as cardiopulmonary arrest [3] . As a result of non-continuous monitoring of physiological signals and low frequency of vital sign collection, many detailed early signs of deterioration may be missed, especially at night [4] . However, the medical resources of the general ward are difficult to achieve full-time and lightweight monitoring, which is a risk for patients [5, 6] .",

In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a hot-spot in recent years. Wearable technologies based on AI have led to numerous novel functions so that many research findings of medicine based on machine learning have become available. The changes in wearable devices brought about by AI technology are summarized as follows: First, the methods of monitoring and health management have been diversified. Many wearable devices gather physiological signals via ambient wireless technologies, such as 3G/4G/5G, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi, and users can see the results and receive advice on a smartphone wherever they are [11] [12] [13] [14] . These functions might help make users capable of basic self-management. Second, medical decision assistance can be provided with the diagnosis and prediction algorithms. The development of different algorithms and models makes some applications of diagnosis and prediction more reliable and robust using wearable devices [15] [16] [17] [18] . Third, the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation can be assessed. Some patients need to have their physiological signals monitored for a long time after interventions, or have their daily state monitored in case of accidents.",

            "text": "Even though there are already different kinds of wearable devices and featured applications, most of the applications are still home-grade. Things may become different when they are related to clinical-grade practice, which demands better accuracy and stability. In a narrow sense, medical-grade devices can be defined as devices that be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, some researchers have pointed out that many wearable devices and their functions lack sufficient validation in terms of clinical accuracy and usability [19] . Furthermore, our opinion is that a medicalgrade wearable device should be validated in realistic clinical environments against traditional accepted medical grade equipment in order to prove its accuracy and feasibility. A series of previous validation studies have shown that some well-known wearable devices, such as SensiumVitals and HealthPatch, can measure physiological signals accurately when patients are in bed [4] . However, patients at general wards are not always in a relatively static state, thus throwing doubt on the accuracy of the signals measured by wearable devices. On the other hand, the high-value information hidden in physiological signals remains to be discovered. Although researchers have developed a large number of methods such as heart rate variability (HRV) analysis [20, 21]/multiscale entropy (MSE) [22] /Poincare plot [23, 24] to mine hidden information in the signals, the analysis and utilization of time-series physiological signals remain in its infancy. Rather than providing a bunch of data and increasing the burden of clinicians, researchers need to process what the wearable devices measure and show more further analysis results or conclusions based on evidence. Moreover, Dinh-Le et al. [9] suggested that time-series physiological signals collected by wearable devices have the potential to be combined with electronic health records (EHRs) for analysis. It is also a reminder that the analysis of physiological signals separately may be difficult and the conclusion is not reliable, so integration with EHRs may be the key to finding a way out of the dilemma facing physiological signal analysis. Demographics, lab tests, and anamnesis in EHRs can increase the dimension of information significantly and help us make better use of physiological signals measured by wearable devices.",

The system has been deployed in the general wards in the Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) Department and the Respiratory Medicine Department at Chinese PLA General Hospital (PLAGH) since April 2018 and has been collecting data from patient volunteers. To our knowledge, this system is one of the earliest attempts to implement the physiological signal monitoring system in the clinic in China. Figure 1 is the block diagram of the system architecture. The left block exhibits the patient side of the system, which is always at general wards. The system utilizes wearable devices to obtain patients' vital physiological signals and transmit the data to servers via Wi-Fi. The middle block shows the servers that we include in our system. The server for data is used for storage while the algorithm server can analyze the signals online based on machine learning algorithms, and we can make full use of the physiological signals in combination with the EHR information in the existing Hospital Information System (HIS) of the hospital. The right block is the user side of our system. There are many AI-based functions displayed on different terminals, including the central monitoring station, workstation for doctors/nurses, and PAD.

Heterogeneous data refers to data integration by various data types. In our system, the major heterogeneous data types are: 1) the timeseries physiological signals and vital signs captured by wearable devices; 2) the structured EHRs generated from daily clinical practice, such as the patient's personal information, admission records, and laboratory tests; 3) the unstructured clinical records, such as the medical images report and discharge summary. We thus adopted a mixed database structure design, which has three different logical databases co-existing in the system, tackling the three corresponding data types aforementioned.

The structure of the BLSTM is shown in Fig. 4 . An open-access sleep database, sleep heart health study (SHHS) [29] , was used for model training because the volume of the in-house dataset is not big enough for the establishment of a model (about 30 labeled cases right now). The SHHS database consists of the PSG monitoring of 6600 patients in the U.S. The six-class sleep stage data for each subject manually determined by clinical experts in the database was converted into four-class (wake, light sleep (Non-rapid eye movement (NREM)-1 and NREM-2), deep sleep (NREM-3 and NREM-4), REM). Due to the limitation of the data information dimension of the training set, we only used the R-R interval and respiratory signal to extract features, the EHR information such as demographics, lab tests, drug, and anamnesis information has not been included as well. We finally extracted 152 features from R-R intervals and respiratory signals to build and train the model [30] [31] [32] .

In this paper, we conducted a heart rate veracity validation study, in which we compared the system with ECG Holter. ECG Holter (BI6812, Biomedical Instruments Company, China. It's a type of Holter commonly used in clinical practice in PLAGH.) and they were allowed to move freely. The study was approved by the ethics committee of PLAGH. The raw data transmitted by SensEcho contained the measurements and their timestamps while the raw ECG data gathered by ECG Holter was retrieved in TXT format. We scanned the ECG data of the two devices with the same algorithm in order to mark the R wave positions. Afterward, the HR was calculated according to R-R intervals. In order to reduce the impact of outliers in the signals, we set one rule that was applicable to both devices: We scanned the signal according to the 3\u03b4 principle, the time window we set was 60 s, we calculated the mean (x ) and standard deviation (\u03b4) in the time window and checking if the HR value of the middle point was within x AE 3\u03b4, then we considered the points beyond the threshold as outliers as well. Finally, we set all of the outlier points in signals to null (NaN) which were not included in the analysis. HR data was then resampled to once per minute before subsequent analysis. We defined HR < 50 beats per minute (bpm) as bradycardia and HR > 100 bpm as tachycardia according to the reference standard [37] [38] [39] .",

As a result, the monitoring data obtained from the 22 patients lasted from 591 min to 1434 min. The median (Q1 -Q3) monitoring time was 1411 (1338-1418) minutes. The basic information of the patients is shown in Table 1 . In this table, similar characteristics of the patients in the HBO Department could be identified, who were mostly overweight, middle-aged and elderly, and afflicted with senile diseases. Figure 6a shows 10-min ECG and HR signals SensEcho and the Holter measured from patient NO.01, who was a 62-year-old female patient with extensive cardiac and vascular comorbidities like hypertension, hyperlipemia, arrhythmia. The red dots in the subplot 1&2 of Fig. 6a mark the R peaks in the ECG signals. Figure 6b shows the same periods of signals as in Fig. 6a , a respiratory wave is measured from the chest by SensEcho. From the respiratory wave and triaxial acceleration signals, we can find that the patient was quiet and the increase of HR was not caused by movement. Afterward, the increase of HR was recognized as tachycardia by a clinical expert that lasted about 4-min and the following two spines in Fig. 6b were two premature beats. The time tachycardia occurred was about 5:30 am and such clinically abnormal events are often ignored by clinicians or patients. The Fig. 6c shows the entire HR signals of this patient monitored by SensEcho and Holter respectively, which consist of 80,513 s of recording. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the two systems have good consistency in terms of ECG recording and heart rate calculation.",

The mean bias (Holter minus SensEcho) in HR was 0.04 bpm with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of \u22127.34 to 7.42 bpm. Figure 7 is a box plot to show the HR measurement distribution of every patient. From Fig. 7 , we can find that most of the patient volunteers showed similar performance between the two methods while the Figure 8a is the Bland-Altman plot of the whole dataset. The analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean \u00b1 1.96SD. From Fig. 8b we can find that the Bland-Altman plot shows great agreement between the two measurement methods, but the SensEcho is more likely to produce measurements that are too high or too low compared to the Holter. However, these measurements are quite unlikely, for there are only very few points located outside Mean \u00b1 1.96SD. We can still consider the HR measurement capacity of SensEcho reliable. In addition, unbalanced measurements may be caused by the difference in hardware passbands between the two devices. During the long-term and high-frequency sample rate of the monitoring of the high-risk patients, as we defined before, tachycardia (HR > 100 bpm) was 1.27% and 1.23% while bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm) was 0.49% and 0.54% of all HR measurements for Holter and SensEcho respectively.

He was diagnosed with coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, hyperlipemia and hypertension risk level 3. Figure 10 shows a section of the HR, RR and triaxial acceleration signals for his first night of admission, when the patient experienced a deterioration of his condition. Doctors gave first aid when the system generated alarms at about 9:15 pm. Meanwhile, we found that from 9:15 pm to 9:30 pm, the patient got two episodes of atrial fibrillation. The first one was 10 min ahead of the coming severe atrial fibrillation. A high frequency of premature beats occurred before 9:00 pm also. From the triaxial acceleration signals, we can find that the patient was relatively quiet before the atrial fibrillation occurred and he changed his position before the first atrial fibrillation ended. The second episode of atrial fibrillation was deadly and needed intervention immediately. Fortunately, he survived. It is believed that in this case the detailed information of disease deterioration may be missed in the absence of monitoring by the system.",

AHI: Apnea Hypopnea Index There is a wealth of information in the reports we provided, which can help clinicians make better evaluation of patients or quantitatively evaluate the therapeutic effect. Moreover, an important prerequisite for good system operation is the guarantee of good data quality. We designed a set of schemes to ensure data quality and model performance, including training for nurses before implementation of the system, data cleaning standard operating procedure and sufficient validation of the models. To achieve a better capability and usability of the system, we need to develop and explore effective methods to reduce the impact of outliers, improve the measurement accuracy and accumulate more data to improve the model performance.",

Furthermore, there are still some limitations to our study. One major limitation is the unfinished validation of several applications in the system. The validation study calls for the cooperation between clinical experts and engineers, which is a kind of cross-disciplinary cooperation that is often difficult but important because we need to match the engineering results with clinical experience. Another limitation of the study is the inadequate use of EHR information, although we tried the combination of EHRs and continuous physiological signals, only a fraction of EHR information has been included, and a great deal of valuable information remains to be integrated.",

Patients infected with the COVID-19 are more likely to develop symptoms such as fever and respiratory distress, with their SpO2 decline severely. Clinicians are at high risk of infection when having direct contact with patients although they wear protective gear. Experience gained from the pandemic shows that little exposure to the virus can effectively reduce the chance of infection. Clinicians especially nurses, need to measure vital signs of patients several times daily, and this procedure is expected to be replaced by the wireless monitoring system. For patients, the system can monitor multidimensional physiological signals that can be used to predict and indicate the deterioration of the new coronavirus pneumonia. In conclusion, we will expand the functions and applications of the system to be more suitable for infectious disease hospitals.",

However, we have not heard of any comprehensive database that combines the EHR information and physiological signals measured from wearable devices. Up to February 2020, we have already collected more than 1000 cases of data from the realistic clinical environment. We will clean the data and construct a comprehensive database, which will include the physiological signals, information in HIS, manually record tables from the doctors and nurses. It is time-consuming because manually recorded information is always subjective and prone to biases and errors. Data cleaning is a necessary step, and we believe that it is The third research focus is that as individualized and accurate medicine is an important development of modern medicine, personalized information in physiological signals needs to be mined deeply. Continuous monitoring of physiological signals is a new type of 'Big Data' for individuals as well, reflecting the health states at different stages. The variation trend between physiological signals of one patient in different periods should be further studied to develop an index that quantitatively evaluates the health level of the patient, which can be used as a solution to individualized and accurate medicine.",
