Accurate prevalence estimates, however, can be difficult to calculate due to a combination of low population prevalence, imperfect diagnostic tests, and limited testing resources. In addition, strategies based on convenience samples that target only symptomatic or high-risk individuals will yield biased estimates of the population prevalence. We present Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification models that incorporate probability sampling designs, the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test, and specimen pooling to obtain unbiased prevalence estimates. These models easily incorporate all available prior information and can yield reasonable inferences even with very low base rates and limited testing resources. We examine the performance of these models with an extensive numerical study that varies the sampling design, sample size, true prevalence, and pool size. We also demonstrate the relative robustness of the models to key prior distribution assumptions via sensitivity analyses.",

Limited testing resources, however, can derail surveillance testing, particularly in the early stages of an outbreak when the speed of the disease can outpace resources. This was the case in the United States where in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the surveillance testing needed to monitor the pandemic was hampered by shortages of test materials and personal protective equipment 1 . These chronic shortages forced a narrow testing strategy dedicated to managing the care of hospitalized patients and preventing health care workers from transmitting COVID-19. Prevalence estimates from these targeted strategies were subject to large ascertainment bias because the sample excluded non-exposed individuals and exposed individuals who were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. This exclusion hindered the understanding of infection levels since these individuals can silently transmit the disease over an extended period of time, perhaps longer than two weeks 2 . In addition, these estimates, while informative, did not yield inferences that generalize beyond the sampled population. Surveillance testing that aims to provide unbiased prevalence estimates must include non-exposed individuals and exposed but asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals in samples. This paper describes the use of active surveillance testing for estimating disease prevalence. In particular, we examine probability sampling designs to obtain generalizable inferences, incorporate the sensitivity and specificity on the diagnostic test, and evaluate the use of specimen pooling to address limited resources. We present a Bayesian model building on the work of Gelman and Carpenter 3 , but address several issues not considered by the authors such as statistical sampling designs and specimen pooling, as well as provide simulation studies for scenarios that iterate over factors such as sample sizes, prevalence, and number of pooled specimens, and perform sensitivity analyses. Our research extends the literature on the use of surveillance random testing for prevalence estimation by evaluating how changing these factors impacts the statistical characteristics of the estimates.",

The standard for making generalizable inferences from a sample to the full population is probability sampling, where each population member has a known, nonzero probability of being sampled. Non-probability samples, such as those taken from targeted strategies, are typically not generalizable to the population without additional assumptions. Three common probability sampling designs include simple random sampling (SRS), stratified random sampling (StRS), and multistage cluster random sampling (MCRS). We consider all three sampling designs, discuss settings under which each would be preferred, and assess their relative impact on prevalence estimation.",

Estimating disease prevalence using imperfect diagnostic tests is well-studied and methods date back to the classic Rogan-Gladen estimator 4 . This estimator, however, can produce estimates of prevalence below zero or above one. More modern approaches include direct maximum likelihood 5 , expectation-maximization 6, 7 , and Bayesian methods 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 3 . The Bayesian approach is particularly appealing because it can readily incorporate uncertainties in the sensitivity and specificity as well as prior knowledge about the true prevalence into the estimation procedure. In low prevalence settings, estimates can be critically sensitive to the sensitivity and specificity 13 (e.g., more false positives than true positives), further necessitating the need to propagate those uncertainties.",

SRS, however, could be preferable to either StRS or MCRS in settings where the population is small and homogeneous in their risk to contract the disease and/or appropriate strata are difficult to construct. For example, suppose the population of interest is a correctional facility population where the risk of disease can be thought to be reasonably homogeneous as individuals are limited in their choices that may vary disease exposure. In such a scenario, a SRS would be sufficient for estimation.

The histograms indicate that the model draws fit the data well as the majority of the proportions lie close to the observed prevalence, which is close to p. eFigure 3 shows a similar histogram for the SRS setting. We notice that observed prevalence for each p is biased due to the very small number of tests but the predicted outcomes are pulled towards the true p. Figure 1 and eTable 1 present the averages of the posterior medians, median absolute deviations, and 95% posterior intervals for the StRS setting under varying true mean prevalence, number of tests, and pool size. We notice that even with 200 tests, the mean estimate has small absolute bias for all true prevalences. In addition, the mean 95% intervals are reasonably broad range given the small number of tests and relatively large variability in the \u03b2 parameters. For instance, the mean interval for p = 0.005 is (0.000, 0.014), which is broad enough to convey large uncertainty but not to the extent of suggesting a wildly implausible prevalence level. As the number of tests increased, we obtained narrower 95% intervals, while still keeping the bias of the mean estimates small. In addition, the effect of pooling can be observed for each prevalence with 200 tests. For p = 0.005, even pool sizes of 5 can yield 95% intervals narrower than those with 600 tests and no pooling, with pool sizes of 10 yielding even narrower intervals. Similar results are observed for the other prevalence levels. Table 1 presents results evaluating the sensitivity of the results with 200 tests, and shifts in the \u03b2 0 prior distribution. For the positive (negative) prior shifts, the prevalence estimates are slightly positively (negatively) biased, with the magnitude of the bias increasing with the magnitude of the shift. The 95% intervals, however, are reasonable even for the most extreme setting with shifts of \u00b10.8. For instance, the 95% intervals for p = 0.05 with shifts of \u00b10.8 are (0.023, 0.082) and (0.018, 0.073) compared to (0.020, 0.077) with no shift.",

As we increased the number of tests to 800 and 1200, we obtained narrower intervals as expected. In addition, pooling of samples yields appreciable increases in precision as the posterior intervals get narrower with increasing pool sizes.

To ensure that such decisions are evidence-based, it is imperative that unbiased, representative statistics characterizing the status of the outbreak are available. We contend that the use of active surveillance testing where a probability sample is selected from the population of interest without considering an individuals' symptoms or health status to estimate the point prevalence is critical. We outline several statistical challenges in carrying out such surveillance testing ranging from the sampling design to the estimation of prevalence and propose methods to address them. Specifically, we address the selection of an efficient probability sample, low population prevalence, imperfect tests, and limited testing resources. We propose Bayesian models that incorporate the sensitivity and specificity, pooled testing, and MRP to account for the sampling design. For the proposed method, the key choices that must be made are: (1) developing a sampling design to select a representative sample from the study population, (2) the structure of the MRP model, and (3) the prior distributions for the parameters.",

Nevertheless, we emphasize the importance of the selection of a representative sample without considering their health status. In this paper, we gave three generic exemplars, broadly representing small, intermediate, and large populations, under which SRS, StRS, and MCRS may be considered. These sampling designs are not limited to their respective example settings; namely, any of these designs could reasonably be justified for statistical and/or practical reasons. For example, if the population is the undergraduates at a university and a StRS cannot be constructed due to the campus being too spread out to collect samples in a timely manner, a MCRS may have to be used. Similarly, if appropriate strata or clusters cannot be defined due to privacy concerns, a SRS would be the only option available.",

The basic principle of MRP is to adjust for all variables that affect the selection and response of individuals by including them in the regression model. This of course necessitates that these variables must also be measured on the sample selected. In addition, poststratification requires knowledge of the population sizes of each poststratification cell. Such data could be available for the population (e.g. university administrators having access to population age, gender, race, etc. data) but if not, nationally representative surveys such as the American Community Survey could be used to match the sample to the population. If no population data is available on certain factors, then the analysis will not be able to poststratify on those factors. After data is collected, the functional form of the multilevel model must be specified. Any amount of complexity can be added to properly model the survey outcome including interactions between covariates and nonlinear effects, among others. Although we did not address these specific modeling details in this paper, these are issues that are very closely tied to the data used in the analysis and must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

We chose to make this dependence explicit by using Bayesian inference where this prior knowledge is encoded probabilistically. The relevant prior choices for the models in this paper include those for \u03b2 and the variance hyperparameters for the random effects. We used N + (0, 0.5) priors for the variance of the random intercepts, which correspond to a prior belief that the prevalence varies moderately by those poststratification factors. This prior could be set so that the prevalence varies more or less than that based on previous sero-epidemiological studies or contact tracing efforts. In addition, we set the priors for any \u03b2 apart from \u03b2 0 to be N(0, 1). This prior specification imposes some prior regularization on the contribution of the respective covariate to the prevalence but still allows it to vary moderately. More or less regularization can be imposed as the data requires resulting from the sparseness of poststratification cells. The prior for \u03b2 0 , the probability on the logit scale that the average person in the sample has the disease, is set to N(\u00b5 \u03b20 , 1) where \u00b5 \u03b20 is set by the analyst depending on prior knowledge. While this prior could be set to be weaker (e.g. a unit logistic prior) if the number of tests was large, the low test settings considered in this paper necessitate stronger priors to obtain reasonable inferences.",

In addition, the estimates were relatively robust to shifts in the prior distribution for the probability on the logit scale of the average person in the sample having the disease. There are other practical and methodological considerations involved with carrying out surveillance testing that are beyond the scope of this paper, including the mechanism by which subjects are asked to get tested and the frequency of testing as well as possible dilution effects from pooled testing or the trade-off between the size of the pools and the number of tests and samples. These issues depend highly on the study population, the disease under consideration, as well as time and resource availability, and would be fruitful future research avenues.",
