In this work, we focus on NFT creators and present results of an exploratory qualitative study in which we interviewed 15 NFT creators from nine different countries. Our participants had nuanced feelings about NFTs and their communities. We found that most of our participants were enthusiastic about the underlying technologies and how they empower individuals to express their creativity and pursue new business models of content creation. Our participants also gave kudos to the NFT communities that have supported them to learn, collaborate, and grow in their NFT endeavors.

NFTs replicate the properties of physical items, such as scarcity, uniqueness and proof of ownership on a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) using cryptographic mechanisms and are usually traded in online marketplaces with cryptocurrencies [55] . A blockchain generally refers to decentralized ledger systems that are append-only, i.e., once data has been written onto the blockchain, they cannot be altered [62] . In the case of NFTs, once the NFT is created on a blockchain, one's ownership of the NFT underlying asset (e.g., an image) is public and can be viewed and verified by anyone.",

People can create and sell NFTs on online marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Rarible. Many believe that NFTs are poised to transform the art world, changing not only how art is bought and sold, but also, what kind of art people value. Despite the growing popularity of NFTs, extant research on this emerging phenomenon is scant, mostly focusing on the technical aspects of blockchain-based protocols [62] and market trade networks [49] .

A creator would create an NFT by signing a transaction, including the hash of the NFT data, and sending the transaction to the underlying smart contract. When the smart contract receives the transaction with NFT data, the minting process begins. The minted NFT is associated with a unique identifier in the blockchain, which is an evidence of ownership for NFT creators/owners [39] . NFT marketplaces allow users to \"bid\" for NFT collectibles where buyers need to place a bid to meet the reserve price set by the creators, outbid other buyers, and finally settle the price to win [39] . When tradings of a certain NFT are confirmed, the NFT metadata and ownership details are added to a new block to preserve the ownership chain. Creators can also \"burn\" their NFTs to completely erase art pieces from the blockchain. The entire process is built upon the underlying blockchain which stores information electronically in the distributed ledger. The Underlying Blockchain. Blockchain was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, where a proof of work (PoW) mechanism was used to reach a consensus on transaction data among untrusted participants in a peer-to-peer network [35, 51] to ensure the integrity of the entire blockchain.

            "text": "There is a small but emerging body of research in HCI concerning blockchain, largely the experiences, motivations and values of Bitcoin users. For example, Gao et al. indicated the misconception of crypto non-users of being incapable of using Bitcoin, since they did not fully understand how the protocol functions and if it satisfies properties of usual payment systems they currently use [34] . Lustig studied online communities of Bitcoin to explore users' values and trust in the algorithmic protocol [46] , showing that users preferred to integrate human judgment to mediate algorithmic authority for fairness. Kow et al. described the cultural affinities of early crypto adopters as a sociocultural journey [43] . This study indicated that meaningful community building and cultural enterprise, in addition to providing technical support, are important for early stage users [43] . History of NFT Projects. The notion of NFTs had become popular before NFT standards were established on Ethereum [58] . Back in 2017, memes started to be traded on Ethereum. In the same year, John Watkinson and Matt Hall created unique characters, i.e., Cryptopunks, on the Ethereum blockchain. Each character was different, and the number of characters was limited to 10,000. The first project using the ERC-721 NFT standard was the famous CryptoKitties, which was on every news station, from CoinDesk to CNN. People made enormous profits by trading the virtual cats. The years of 2018 and 2019 saw a massive growth within the NFT ecosystem. There were 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs, primarily on Ethereum and WAX blockchains, between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021 [49] . Hundreds of NFT projects have emerged in the past few years. NFT marketplaces were also thriving, led by OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, etc. Web3 wallets such as MetaMask further made it easier for people to participate in the NFT space. Public attention towards NFTs exploded in 2021, when the market experienced many record-breaking sales. One such example is the digital artist known as Beeple, who sold an NFT of his work for $69 million [13] . That sale positioned him \"among the top three most valuable living artists, \" according to the auction house. Another popular NFT project in 2021 was Bored Ape Yacht Club, which offered ten thousand unique iterations of the cartoon primates for sale, each at the price of about two hundred dollars. The initial batch of NFTs were sold in more than two million dollars, and eventually increased to fourteen thousand dollars for each item in trading value [18] . Yet another big sale was \"meetbit\" NFT collection by Larva Labs. \"Meebits\" is a series of 20,000 distinctive 3D avatars designed to be used in the metaverse, which was initially priced at 2.5 ETH per item [15] . Advantages and Challenges of Blockchain and NFTs. NFT projects (e.g., games and collectibles), infrastructures (e.g., crypto wallets), and NFT marketplaces (e.g., Opensea and Rarible) are built upon the underlying blockchain. The decentralization feature of the blockchain enables crypto applications to be tamper-resistant [31] . However, some unwanted features also come with decentralization, e.g., lack of scalability [27] , high gas fees, and lack of regulation.",

Stakeholders interact through different social interactions, such as visual and material conduct of bidding and buying, during trading [37] . In contrast, NFTs are collections of art, music, games, etc., the trading of which is supported by the underlying distributed ledger, with consistent records of transactions. NFT tokens are unique and can have different value depending on its rarity, quality, and reputation of creators. NFT marketplaces allow users to bid for NFT collectibles. When an NFT is sold or resold, its metadata and ownership details are added to a new block on the blockchain, thus the ownership history is recorded and preserved.",

How to handle the issue of forgery in the traditional art space has always been an open problem in previous literature. NFTs provide such a feature backed by the underlying blockchain, bridging the gap of traceability which may improve its trustworthiness. Societal Benefits of Creative Markets. Art exhibitions provide a platform for artists around the world, and support their careers with creative development, exhibition and publication opportunities. For the audience, exhibitions are an environment to learn about art in an interactive manner, and socialize with other artists and visitors [61] . Research has shown evidence of positive relationship between the engagement in art and physical/psychological well-being of people [52] . Arts also provide a paradigm of interaction to enhance people's experience, and support their engagement, learning, and alignment with community [56] . There have been attempts for virtual art exhibitions to allow local and remote visitors to co-exist in the environment, access the interactive content, and communicate with each other [61] .",

People in a group, either in the physical world or social media space, may share similar interest in art, politics, sports, etc. Research shows that socializing, as a vital social activity, is not necessarily task-related; people also socialize with other individuals for emotional reasons [30] . People with similar interests tend to support certain events together, e.g., posting and cheering for certain sports teams, using slogans and videos [23] . Different ways can facilitate social interaction, such as image sharing, and text-based communication [67] . Even everyday objects, augmented with technologies, can contribute to disseminating people's lifestyle values [25] . The circulation of values may inform us about the alternative roles of technologies in speaking for our norms in a community environment [26] . In a previous study on online innovation communities [53] , intrinsic motivations prove to be effective for initial participation and long term engagement . It is shown that the majority of participants are engaged to the online innovation community for fun, and activities that challenge them. In most cases, participants' roles are contributors and collaborators. Extrinsic motivations such as reward also attract people who are more interested in objective values [44] .",

One type of phishing NFTs mentioned by our participants was that malicious creators copied the content of others' existing NFTs to create their own NFTs, and then set a lower price than the original ones. Since buyers are often not aware of this fact, they tend to buy NFTs from these cunning creators due to cheaper prices. The copied content was sometimes modified with very minor changes that make them almost visually indistinguishable from the original NFTs.

NFTs Support Creativity. Unlike fungible tokens such as Bitcoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, i.e., any two NFTs are different. This uniqueness allows content creators to fully explore their creativity in the digital realm. As we saw in the results section, one of the main motivations for NFT creation is indeed creators embedding their personal identities, feelings and emotions into their NFTs. Our participants had different backgrounds, such as a blogger, a video editor, a tattoo artist, and a landscape photographer. In their traditional offline work, their creativity was often constrained by their client requirements. They saw NFTs as an exciting opportunity where they could express their own artistic ideas. NFTs Democratize Content Creation and Commercialization. Blockchains are the technical bedrock of NFTs. One of the key properties of blockchain technologies is decentralization, which often means storage, computation and even governance of the blockchain systems are decentralized, i.e., there is no centralized authority to make and enforce rules [41] . Critically, this decentralization can remove intermediaries in the marketplace. In the traditional art industry, there are often intermediaries (e.g., exhibit organizers, auction companies, artist agencies) that artists rely on [60] .",

For instance, it is much easier for them to promote and sell their work as well as do the business accounting (all the transaction records are public and on-chain). Another recurring and encouraging theme is how NFTs empower many under-resourced artists and creative professionals, such as those who were from developing countries, who were less known, and who were in a poor financial standing during the COVID19 pandemic. Some of our participants (e.g., a tattoo artist and a photographer) were struggling to make a living during the pandemic due to the physical lockdown.

NFT Communities Provide Mutual Support and Help Collaborations. Our participants also attributed part of their positive experiences with NFTs to the supportive NFT communities (e.g., official Discord channels of NFT projects). During the early stage of their NFT expeditions, they tended to take a self-and independent-learning approach where they learned the primary concepts around NFTs, such as, minting, bidding, burning as well as blockchain concepts, such as gas fees for minting NFTs from Google search and Youtube. In comparison, during the more experienced stage, they tended to follow a social learning approach, in which they relied on different NFT community groups in Discord, Twitter for advanced learning by Q/A and community events. In this stage, they played with their skills and learned to use different tools, such as Adobe Photoshop, Tiltbrush, VR software to create 3D arts, GIF, and sketch manipulation. Our participants mentioned NFT official project groups in Discord and Twitter as their main venue to promote their work. Research has shown that sustainability of organizations depend on how they are designed as social learning systems which built upon individuals' personal experience and sense of belonging through engagement and alignment [63] .

POAP.art [11] was one example mentioned by one participant, where people could collectively finish an NFT painting on the virtual canvas. Online meetings were also organized by NFT platform founders and developers to discuss how to create a better NFT ecosystem for artists. Literature has shown that the success of an innovation community can be measured in terms of the number of completed collaborations [47] . Collaboration can also help foster a supportive and sustainable marketplace. Thus the NFT communities could further support collective and collaborative creation of NFTs as an opportunity to enhance the ties among NFT artists, and create a sustainable community. Though several participants expressed their interest in collaboration in the near future, mainstream NFT platforms such as Opensea and Rarible did not support such a function. Future research can explore the adoption of collaboration mechanisms in NFT marketplaces.",

            "text": "Our interview results suggest that the blockchain technical mechanism alone does not solve the ownership question completely in practice. Many participants were very vocal about their loathing for the wide spread of low-quality NFTs and even scams. The decentralization of blockchain and NFT technologies lower the barriers of content creation but also opens the floodgate of NFTs. NFT technologies can support rehashing or creating derivative NFTs based on existing ones (derivative NFTs actually allow the owner of the original NFTs to make a cut from the proceeds of the trading of derivative NFTs). However, NFT technologies also allow the creation of what we called \"phishing NFTs\" where malicious actors essentially make a copy (e.g., a screenshot) of the underlying content of a popular (and expensive) NFT, apply negligible changes to the copied content, and then create a new NFT and offer to sell it at a lower price than the original NFT, albeit pretending to be the original NFT and hoping to lure the unsophisticated buyers. This issue calls into question the intellectual property rights of digital content in NFTs. This naturally leads to our next question. Are Regulations Needed? Regulation is another dilemma emerged from our results. Here regulations cover both government regulations and NFT platform rules. Our participants were mostly ambivalent about them. On one hand, they felt that the whole premise of NFTs and blockchains is decentralization, which is the antithesis of centralized regulations. They believed that having regulations would increase the barriers of entry for NFTs. On the other hand, they feared that the lack of regulations would harbor misuses of NFTs, which lead to low-quality NFTs, scams and even possible money laundering. Countries around the world are expediting their legislation around cryptocurrencies [38] . For instance, countries such as China have already banned crypto mining operations and cryptocurrency trading [12] . The US government is also actively looking to regulate the crypto industry [38] . All of these legislative efforts will have a ripple effect on NFTs.",

            "text": "On the NFT platform / marketplace front, some of them have already started experimenting different types of restrictions to prevent scams or low-quality NFTs. For example, Foundation uses an \"invite-only\" policy: only invited artists can mint NFTs on the platform. Such efforts are intrinsically double-edged swords. Despite their potential effectiveness in improving NFT quality, they are essentially creating a private club, preventing talented yet under-resourced content creators from creating their own NFTs on the platform. This type of policies are hurdles for creating an open-access domain for everyone, which goes against the initial vision of blockchain. Future research is needed to strike a good balance between decentralization and NFT quality control. The rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could be a promising direction as they often codify and enforce (via voting and smart contracts) emerging community norms. Challenges Encountered by NFT Creators. Our participants described many challenges in creating NFTs which includes learning about blockchain and NFT functions to operate throughout the creation process. Early stage NFT creators found the blockchain concepts, such as, gas fees, irreversibility of blockchain intimidating, especially when they encountered bugs during the process. They also faced technical difficulties in setting up wallets and depositing cryptocurrencies in order to mint NFTs. The lack of resources in many NFT marketplaces made it more challenging for newcomers to learn about those concepts. They also wasted their cryptocurrencies (for gas fees) if they made mistakes in minting the NFTs as they expected. Early stage creators were less familiar with the purpose and irreversible nature of gas fees. Minting NFTs actually has made the gas fees on Ethereum prohibitively expensive from time to time in 2021. The scalability of Ethereum is a fundamental challenge and there are many Layer 2 solutions (e.g., opportunistic or zero-knowledge rollups) and alternative Layer 1 blockchains (e.g., Solana, Avalanche, WAX) that can reduce the gas fees of minting NFTs. There is also a lack of standard assessment metrics for the quality of NFTs. To assess the NFT quality, our participants used some heuristics, such as prior reputation of the creators, and the number of social media followers. These heuristics are particularly challenging for new creators who do not (yet) have a strong fan base and reputation. Next, we will discuss design implications based on our findings that could help address some of these challenges.",

However, many participants noted that NFT has a steep learning curve especially for those who did not have an IT or digital art background. Our study indicates that newbie NFT creators are often intimidated by the tech-heavy NFT concepts and terminologies. The process of minting NFTs also introduces several challenges, including creating a crypto wallet, depositing cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH tokens) into the wallet, linking the crypto wallet to NFT marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea), and finally minting NFTs. As we can see, the minting process includes several elements in the blockchain ecosystem, i.e., cryptocurrencies, crypto wallets and NFT marketplaces. The usability of these components are under-studied in the literature. Educational materials dedicated to blockchain concepts and instructional guides can be integrated as built-in resources in NFT marketplaces to make it easier for non-technical users to create NFTs. Chatbots or conversational agents about NFTs can also be built to support new users. The conversational logic of these chatbots can be designed based on commonly asked questions in NFT forums or communities. Assessing NFT Quality. Measuring the quality of NFT creators and NFTs has remained as an open problem. One idea is a creator dashboard or a public creator profile page. Creators are incentivized to fill out the details, e.g., prior experience in NFTs and other content creation, and social media accounts. If anyone provides faked or inaccurate information, the community might catch it and basically ruin their reputation and prospect in the community. Interested buyers or collectors can then check the creator profile before purchasing the NFTs. Our participants suggested several metrics for assessing the quality of NFTs and NFT creators, such as the number of followers on social media and in NFT marketplaces, record of interpersonal communication in the marketplace, history of prior spam incidents, and NFT ownership record, which could be integrated into the profile. With such a public profile system, NFT creators can also look for potential collaborations. Furthermore, machine learning models could be trained, taking the information mentioned above as the input, to classify legitimate vs. scam NFTs. Providing the model predictions to users can help them make more informed buying decisions, and reduce the chance of falling for scams. Supporting Community Moderation. We have already seen that low-quality NFTs and scams are prevalent problems in the NFT ecosystem. Some NFT marketplaces have started some restrictions. For instance, Rarible gave its users the option to go through a Twitter verification process, and those who do so may gain more visibility for their NFTs. In addition, our participants indicated that NFT communities would alert its members about any sketchy NFTs. However, this usually involves mostly manual checking of the NFTs in question, and is thus hard to scale and keep up with the rate at which new NFTs are minted.",

Crossmod is a learning-based system [24] , which provides moderation recommendations for Reddit moderators by leveraging a large corpus of previous moderator decisions. P7, who developed a private NFT project, also mentioned automatic filtering of irrelevant NFTs using off-the-shelf AI. We believe that one way to use AIs here is to apply existing computer vision techniques (e.g., visual hashing) to automatically compute visual similarity of two NFTs. This assumes that there is a database of existing NFTs, which is not far-fetched because virtually all NFTs should be public and on-chain. NFT marketplaces can already do this because they have all the data about the NFTs on their platforms. When visual hashing detects highly similar NFTs, it can alert community members.",
