            "text": "Machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of distinctive genomic signatures among viral sequences. Such signatures are motifs present in the viral genome that differentiate species or variants. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of such signatures can contribute to taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, help in recognizing and defining distinct emerging variants, and focus the characterization of functional properties of polymorphic gene products. Here, we study KEVOLVE, an approach based on a genetic algorithm with a machine learning kernel, to identify several genomic signatures based on minimal sets of k-mers. In a comparative study, in which we analyzed large SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset, KEVOLVE performed better in identifying variant-discriminative signatures than several gold-standard reference statistical tools. Subsequently, these signatures were characterized to highlight potential biological functions. The majority were associated with known mutations among the different variants, with respect to functional and pathological impact based on available literature. Notably, we found show evidence of new motifs, specifically in the Omicron variant, some of which include silent mutations, indicating potentially novel, variant-specific virulence determinants.

To analyze this complex and massive data, Machine learning, which refers to the development and application of computer algorithms that improve with experience, has proven to be efficient.

To overcome this, we are working in our laboratory on the design of machine learning based methods for discriminative signatures identification within viral genomic sequences. These signatures which are a specific motifs to groups of viruses known to be pervasive in their genome, are used to 1) build accurate and explainable prediction tools for pathogens and 2) highlight mutations potentially associated with functional changes.

Its sequence identity with 6 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 79.5% and 50% at the nucleotide sequence level, 7 respectively [2, 3] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 11 genes encoding 15 Open 8 Reading Frames (ORF), which result in between 29 and 33 viral protein products [1] . 9 SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a very high mutation rate ranging from 5.2 to 8.1 \u00d7 10 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year [4, 5] , higher than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 11 which has a mutation rate of 3 to 8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year [6] . Many of these 12 mutations, principally in the spike gene, are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 13 transmission rates [7] , and the development of new variants associated with reduced 14 efficacity of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody-based treatments [8] . 15 Given this rapid rate of evolution, it is important to be able to efficiently identify 16 genomic signatures that discriminate between the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and 17 highlight potential functional changes. These signatures are defined as species or 18 variant-specific motifs that are pervasive throughout the viral genome [9] . In the 19 context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of this type of signature can contribute to 20 taxonomic [10] and phylogenetic [11] studies to differentiate distinct groups of variants, 21 provide an explanation for their evolutionary history [9] , as well as to facilitate 22 mechanistic studies to elucidate the functional basis of variant-specific differences in 23 virulence [12] . 24 ",

            "text": "To identify discriminating motifs that constitute genomic signatures among different 25 groups of biological sequences, the traditional approach is to first compute multiple 26 sequence alignment [13] with tools as: MUSCLE [14] , Clustal W/X [15] or MAFFT [16] . 27 These alignments can then be analyzed to identify the divergent genomic regions that 28 constitute the discriminating motifs. However, the use of multiple alignment approaches 29 has significant limitations, particularly when applied to viral genomes [12] . 30 First, alignment-based approaches are generally computationally-and time-intensive 31 and are therefore less well suited to dealing with very large viral sequence datasets that 32 are increasingly available [17] . Indeed, computing an accurate multi-sequence alignment 33 is an NP-hard problem with (2N )!/(N !) 2 possible alignments for two sequences of 34 length N [18] , which means that in some case, the alignment cannot be solved within a 35 realistic time frame [19] . Even with dynamic programming, the time requirement is on 36 the order of the product of the lengths of the input sequences [20] . 37 Second, alignment algorithms assume that homologous sequences consist of a series 38 of more or less conserved linearly arranged sequence segments. However, this 39 assumption, named collinearity, is often questionable, especially for RNA viruses [19] . 40 This is because RNA viruses show extensive genetic variation due to high mutation 41 rates, as well as high frequencies of genetic recombination, horizontal gene transfer, and 42 gene duplication, leading to the gain or the loss of genetic material [21] . 43 Finally, performing multiple alignments often requires adjusting several parameters 44 (e.g., substitution matrices, deviation penalties, thresholds for statistical parameters) 45 that are dependent on prior knowledge about the evolution of the compared 46 sequences [19] . The adjustment of these parameters is therefore sometimes arbitrary 47 and requires a trial-and-error approach. Many experiments have shown that minor 48 variations in these parameters can significantly affect the quality of alignments [22] . 49 To overcome the limitations of discriminative motif identification among different 50 groups of biological sequences using multiple sequence alignment, specialized 51 statistical-based tools have been developed. The most popular of these method is 52 MEME [23, 24] , which is dedicated to motif identification. MEME has a discriminative 53 mode [25] that considers two sets of sequences and identifies the enriched motifs that 54 discriminate the first set (primary) from the second (control). A suite of other MEME 55 tools has been developed, of which STREME [26] is the latest and most powerful for 56 motif discovery in sequence datasets. The STREME algorithm is based on a generalized 57 suffix tree and evaluates motifs using a statistical test of the enrichment of matches to 58 the motif in a primary set of sequences compared to a set of control sequences [26] .",

KEVOLVE, is a new method 114 based on a genetic algorithm including a machine learning kernel. KEVOLVE 115 implementation is based on two main units: 1) an identification unit that provides 116 subsets of features that are minimal and likely to provide the best performance metrics; 117 and 2) a prediction unit that applies an ensemble classifier using the subsets of features. 118 The second tool that was evaluated was CASTOR-KRFE [30] . It is an alignment-free 119 machine learning approach for identifying a set of genomic signatures based on k-mers 120 to discriminate between groups of nucleic acid sequences. The core of CASTOR-KRFE 121 is based on feature elimination using SVM (SVM-RFE). CASTOR-KRFE identifies an 122 optimal length of k to maximize classification performance and minimize the number of 123 features. This method also provides a solution to the problem of identifying the optimal 124 length of k-mers for genomic sequence classification [32] . 125 The third tool that was evaluated was MEME (discriminative mode) [25] , a tool 126 from the MEME suite [24] specialized in motif identification. MEME inputs two sets of 127 sequences and identifies enriched motifs that discriminate the primary set from the 128 control set. In discriminative mode, the algorithm first calculates a position-specific 129 prior from the two sets of sequences. It then searches the first set of sequences for 130 motifs using the position-specific prior to inform the search based on the discriminative 131 prior D [33] . In addition, MEME considers as a parameter a potential motif distribution 132 type to be identified to improve the sensitivity and quality of the motif search. In 133 discriminative mode, the two available options are: 1) zero or one occurrence per 134 sequence (zoops), where MEME assumes that each sequence may contain at most one 135 occurrence of each motif; and 2) one occurrence per sequence (oops), where MEME 136 assumes that each sequence in the dataset contains exactly one occurrence of each motif. 137 The last tool evaluated was STREME [26] , which during a recent comparative study 138 of motif identification was found to be more accurate, sensitive and thorough than 139 several widely used algorithms [26] . STREME algorithm makes use of a data structure 140 called a generalized suffix tree and evaluates motifs using a one-sided statistical test of 141 the enrichment of matches to the motif in a primary set of sequences compared to a set 142 of control sequences STREME assumes that each primary sequence may contain zoops 143 but the motif discovery will not be negatively affected if a primary sequence contains 144 more than one occurrence of a motif. section was dedicated to it.

Subsequently, this initial dataset was partitioned into two independent subsets. The 159 first (training subset) was composed of 2,250 randomly selected sequences (250 160 sequences for the 9 types of variants). The second (testing subset) was composed of the 161 remaining sequences (224,282 sequences).",

Initially, KEVOLVE was designed 185 to identify multiple discriminating subsets to build a single ensemble prediction model. 186 However, in this evaluation, for each identified subset, a model was trained and 187 evaluated by predicting the test set.",

The Tools column provides information about the different tools evaluated in this study. The column Number of motifs indicates the number of discriminating motifs that have been asked to identify for each tool.

The column Motifs width corresponds to the length of the discriminating motifs to be identified. The column Site distribution refers for MEME to how the discriminating motifs are supposed to be present in the sequences to improve the sensitivity and quality of the search. The column Discovery mode also indicates for MEME the type of search to perform. In this context we have selected the mode for identifying motifs that discriminates between groups of sequences given as input. The Performance Threshold column refers to a quality criterion that the identified motif must satisfy. For MEME and STREME the n best motifs in terms of p-value are selected where n corresponds to the number in the Number of motifs column. For CASTOR-KRFE and KEVOLVE, the algorithms will search until they obtain a set of motifs that satisfy an F1-score > 0.99 during their internal evaluation.",

To describe the results of MEME and STREME we use the 215 name of the tool followed by the distribution type and the number of motifs to identify. 216 If this is not specified we discuss the overall tool. With the option of 1 motif per 217 variant, MEME zoops, MEME oops and STREME were each able to constitute a subset 218 of 9 discriminative motifs, which is similar to CASTOR-KRFE. For the 2 motifs per 219 variant option, MEME zoops, MEME oops and STREME identified 14, 17 and 18 220 discriminative motifs respectively. Finally for the 3 motif per variant configuration, the 221 identified subsets reached the size of 18, 24 and 26 respectively for MEME zoops, 222 MEME oops and STREME. These results show that by increasing the number of motifs 223 to be discovered, MEME zoops tends to identify more motifs that are redundant unlike 224 MEME oops, STREME, CASTOR-KRFE and KEVOLVE. In summary, KEVOLVE identified from a small portion of the dataset multiple 290 motifs that can discriminate by their absence or presence between different groups of 291 SARS-CoV-2 variants.

            "text": "In this study, we compared the ability of machine learning-based tools to classify 357 SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to statistical tools specialized in discriminative motif 358 identification. We found that the identification of motifs in SARS-CoV-2 genome 359 sequences readily discriminates different groups of variants. However, the machine 360 learning-based approaches, CASTOR-KRFE and KEVOLVE, were generally more 361 efficient. The predictive models based on the motifs (8 for KEVOLVE and 9 for 362 CASTOR-KRFE) identified by these two approaches predict a large set of SARS-CoV-2 363 variant sequences with an average F1 score greater than 0.98. Furthermore, these two 364 approaches predicted a large set of SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences (over 225,000) with 365 an average F1-score greater than 0.98. In contrast, the model involving the most motifs 366 (26), using STREME, which was the best performing approach after KEVOLVE and 367 CASTOR-KRFE, only obtained an average F1-score of 0.836. In addition, unlike the 368 statistical approaches, KEVOLVE and CASTOR-KRFE, can deal with multi-class sets 369 and are not limited to binary sets. In addition, KEVOLVE is distinguished by its ability 370 to identify multiple discriminative sets unlike other tools that are limited to a single 371 optimal set. 372 Subsequently, we analyzed the motifs identified by KEVOLVE with respect to their 373 recognized or potential functional importance from the existing literature. Not 374 surprisingly, we found that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 motifs identified by KEVOLVE 375 were associated with known mutations among the different viral variants. However, of 376 interest, several motifs derived from CASTOR-KRFE and KEVOLVE did not 377 correspond to recognized variant-specific mutations. With respect to Omicron, 4 motifs 378 contained what appear to be silent mutations, indicating potentially novel 379 variant-specific virulence determinants [47] . Interestingly, although Omicron displays 380 increased transmissibility and evades vaccine-induced and natural-acquired neutralizing 381 antibodies through its numerous spike mutations, it may also cause less severe disease, 382 perhaps due to altered tissue tropism [48, 49] . As the genetic basis of SARS-CoV-2 383 virulence remain incompletely understood, variant-discriminating mutations represent 384 valuable targets for understanding differences in viral phenotypes and clinical outcomes. 385 These results suggest that KEVOLVE is a robust tool for the rapid and accurate 386 determination of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The identified motifs provide genomic 387 signatures that can be used to build peptide or oligonucleotide libraries for rapid and 388 accurate pathogen detection using tools such as VirScan [50] . The identification of 389 motifs by KEVOLVE is automatic and independent of multiple sequence alignments, in 390 contrast to traditional methods by which mutations are associated with 391 variant-discriminating motifs. Indeed, such analyses require manual verification based 392 on annotated reference sequences and multiple sequence alignment, making them 393 impractical for variant discrimination of diverse viruses with large and complex genome 394 structures, such as cytomegalovirus [51] . KEVOLVE and CASTOR-KRFE can also be 395 adapted to allow the automatic analysis of previously-identified motifs, further 396 increasing its efficiency. ",
