The magnitude of the RSCs for EO are so low, relative to typical endogenous equivalent metabolic concentrations (1.1-5.5 ppb) that contribute~93% of total exposure, that the RSCs provide little utility in identifying excess environmental exposures that might increase cancer risk. EO monitoring data collected in the vicinity of eight EO-emitting facilities and corresponding background locations were used to characterize potential excess exogenous concentrations. Both 50th and 90th percentile exogenous exposure concentrations were combined with the 50th percentile endogenous exposure concentration for the nonsmoking population, and then compared to percentiles of total equivalent concentration for this population. No potential total exposure concentration for these local populations exceeded the normal total equivalent concentration 95th percentile, indicating that excess facility-related exposures are unlikely to require additional management to protect public health.",

As everyone is exposed to single-digit, parts per billion (ppb) equivalent levels of endogenous, metabolically-produced EO and fractions of ppb levels from inhalation of ambient air, regardless of their occupation or location of residence [2] [3] [4] [5] , these exceedingly low RSCs relative to endogenous levels and variability raise questions as to their practical utility in risk management of public exogenous EO exposure, as well as their scientific merit. In contrast, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) using the same cohort data as EPA IRIS, but a different doseresponse model, estimated 10 \u22126 to 10 \u22124 RSCs of 0.24 to 24 ppb, respectively [6] . We note that neither the EPA nor TCEQ addressed the assumption of low exposure concentrations for early sterilization workers, which was shown to be invalid [7] . The EPA assessment short comings left a gap in our ability to interpret the health significance of general population exogenous EO background exposures from non-industrial and natural EO sources, and, perhaps more importantly, local general population exposures from point source industrial emissions. Kirman and Hays [2] and Kirman et al. [3] proposed an endogenous exposure metric, endogenous equivalent concentration, to provide context to exogenous exposures for decision-making by risk managers. This study proposes and evaluates the utility of a total exposure metric (total equivalent concentration) incorporating both background endogenous and exogenous EO exposures to help inform the health significance of excess ambient air exposures to EO.",

In addition, these RSCs are below the capabilities of current technology to measure these EO concentrations in ambient air (current method limit of detection (LOD)~0.025-0.040 ppb). These RSCs are also more than two orders of magnitude below the EO ambient air concentrations, which are not associated with industrial emission sources (mean of 0.13 ppb based on recent EPA monitoring [5] ). More importantly, these RSCs are more than three orders of magnitude below airborne concentrations equivalent to endogenously produced EO, in the general nonsmoking population (mean concentrations of~1.9 and 2.9 ppb) based on data evaluated by Kirman and Hays [2] , based on data from published unexposed control subjects [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and Kirman et al. [3] , and based on data from nonsmoking U.S. individuals [4] , respectively. For additional perspective, as described by Bogen et al. [7] , these RSCs are up to seven orders of magnitude below the levels of EO to which 1930s-1970s sterilization operators and other highly exposed sterilization workers in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) cohort used by EPA in its risk assessment were exposed (50,000 to >100,000 ppb). Based on these comparisons, it is obvious that the EPA RSCs are incapable of providing useful benchmarks to evaluate the health significance of such low general population EO exposures. In addition, regulatory use of these RSCs inadvertently led to substantial confusion on the health significance of exogenous EO exposures among emitting facility management and locally exposed populations, resulting in public fear and closure of key medical supply sterilization operations [18, 19] , during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

A summary of HEV levels in non-smokers and smoker populations and the relatively high variability in adduct levels in these population is provided in Kirman and Hays [2] and Kirman et al. [3] . The distribution of HEV levels for the non-smoking general population, therefore, describes the expected range of adducts from background exposure from endogenous and exogenous sources to which everyone is exposed in their daily lives. Kirman et al. [3] describe the three primary pathways of EO exposure to the non-occupational general population in the U.S.-(1) EO is produced endogenously in the body via multiple pathways, including ethylene from bacterial pathways in the gastrointestinal lumen and systemic enzymatic production from methionine and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid, (2) exogenous ethylene inhaled from ambient air and converted metabolically to EO, and (3) exogenous EO inhaled from ambient air from sources other than industrial emissions. To compare the contribution of these sources to total background EO exposure, HEV levels were converted to endogenous equivalent air concentrations (i.e., the amounts of exogenous EO exposures necessary to result in the measured endogenous HEV adduct concentrations, regardless of the three potential sources). Based on data collected between 1986 and 2012, a mean and standard deviation (SD) endogenous equivalent concentration were calculated (1.9 \u00b1 1.3 ppb) [2] . More recently, Kirman et al. [3] recalculated equivalent levels incorporating two important changes-(1) HEV values for non-smokers in the U.S. population between 2013 and 2016 were used as the basis, instead of relying upon pooled data for unexposed experimental control subjects in the previous analysis, and (2) background levels of HEV were adjusted for contributions from exogenous exposure pathways (via ambient air), instead of assuming that the contributions from exogenous exposures were negligible. The new endogenous equivalent mean was higher than that previously calculated (2.9 \u00b1 2.3 ppb).",

As described by Kirman et al. [3] , the specific contributions of all sources to the mean total EO exposure concentration, as measured by the HEV adducts among the non-smoking general population (2.9 ppb; background EO exposure), were estimated as follows: (1) endogenous metabolism, 2.7 ppb (~93.1%); (2) exogenous ethylene inhalation and metabolism, 0.04 ppb (~1.4%); and (3) exogenous EO inhalation, 0.16 ppb (~5.5%). The contribution from ethylene metabolism from endogenous and exogenous sources (~94.5%) clearly indicates that exogenous EO exposure is a minor contributor to total background exposure among individuals in the non-smoking general population. As such, it is reasonable to conclude that EO exposure concentrations among the non-smoking local population near emitting facilities could be compared to the general population endogenous equivalent concentrations (based only on the endogenous contribution) [2, 3] or perhaps more representatively, total equivalent concentrations (background endogenous and exogenous EO contributions), as exposure metrics to provide context for EO risk management. An example of this approach was shown in Kirman et al. [3] . This practical alternative risk management approach is based on the premise that increased exogenous exposure does not necessarily pose a significant increase in the risk of disease if the total exposure does not exceed the upper bound of the non-smoking total background exposure concentration range. This approach is equivalent to the medical interpretation of risk, based on the comparison of the level of a clinical measure to the normal population range (i.e., if the measured clinical value of interest is in the normal population range, such a value is not interpreted as an indicator of a treatment-required disease state).",

Facility monitoring programs collected local background/reference samples at locations between 2000 and 10,000 m from the facility location. Again, the exception was Viant, where no reference samples were identified, so four location >2100 m from the facility were selected as the background reference locations.

The overall national mean calculated here (0.13 ppb) was slightly lower than the mean calculated from an earlier data set (0.16 ppb) [3] . Figures 3 and 4 summarize the values for exposure metrics that provide context for interpreting the health significance of potential EO exposure concentrations in the vicinity of the eight emitting facilities evaluated in this study. In all cases, the mean concentration in the vicinity of the facility was no greater than eight times the mean background concentration for the facility and in a substantial majority of the cases, was greater by two or less ( Figure 3) . Thus, the facility mean concentrations were not substantially elevated above the related background mean concentrations. Similarly, the facility mean concentration composed a small fraction of the endogenous equivalent mean concentration, generally 0.1 or less. This finding was consistent with previously reported analyses that exogenous concentrations constitute a small fraction of endogenous EO exposure concentrations [3] . More importantly, the final two metrics that evaluate the significance of adding the exogenous facility area 50th and 90th percentile EO concentration to nonsmoking population 50th percentile endogenous concentration, showed that these total exposure concentrations were within the normal population range of total equivalent exposure concentrations experienced by nonsmoking populations in the United States (Figure 4 ). For the 50th percentile exogenous addition, all total concentration values were within the 75th percentile total equivalent concentration and the vast majority were approximately equal to 50th percentile total equivalent concentration. For the 90th percentile addition, all total concentration values were within the 95th percentile total equivalent concentration and the vast majority were equal to or less than the 75th percentile total equivalent concentration.

As everyone is exposed to EO and endogenous exposure from ethylene metabolism is the predominant pathway, Kirman and Hays [2] and Kirman et al. [3] calculated endogenous equivalent concentration values for nonsmokers to help risk managers in search of a pragmatic science-based approach to informing management potential EO risk for exposed general populations. The evaluations herein provide an additional nonsmoker population exposure metric, total equivalent concentration, focused specifically on providing context to the health significance of EO exposures for populations in the vicinity of sterilization facilities and other industrial emitting facilities, as these population receive an additional exogenous EO exposure beyond the general population background exposure. Both the endogenous equivalent concentration and total equivalent concentration metrics are based on the premise that exposure concentrations within the normal ranges of these metrics should not significantly increase risk. This premise is consistent with clinical metrics for which the risk of disease does not increase significantly until the values are above the healthy population normal range defined by individual variability within the population.",

More importantly, this analysis showed that the excess exogenous concentrations experienced near facilities did not contribute substantially to the nonsmoking population total EO exposure. This was indicated by the total equivalent concentration percentile comparisons, which showed that all total concentration values were within the 95th percentile total equivalent concentration for background populations not exposed to industry emission sources, and the vast majority were equal to or less than the 75th percentile total equivalent concentration.",
