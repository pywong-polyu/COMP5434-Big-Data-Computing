Little is known about how the presence of chronic risk factors correlates with mortality at the population level. Here we determine the relationship between these factors and COVD-19 mortality in NYC. Methods: A cross-sectional study of mortality data obtained from the NYC Coronavirus data repository (03/02/ 2020-07/06/2020) and the prevalence of neighborhood-level risk factors for COVID-19 severity was performed. A risk index was created based on the CDC criteria for risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19, and stepwise linear regression was implemented to predict the COVID-19 mortality rate across NYC zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) utilizing the risk index, median age, socioeconomic status index, and the racial and Hispanic composition at the ZCTA-level as predictors. Results: The COVID-19 death rate per 100,000 persons significantly decreased with the increasing proportion of white residents (\u03b2 adj = \u2212 0.91, SE = 0.31, p = 0.0037), while the increasing proportion of Hispanic residents (\u03b2 adj = 0.90, SE = 0.38, p = 0.0200), median age (\u03b2 adj = 3.45, SE = 1.74, p = 0.0489), and COVID-19 severity risk index (\u03b2 adj = 5.84, SE = 0.82, p < 0.001) were statistically significantly positively associated with death rates. Conclusions: Disparities in COVID-19 mortality exist across NYC and these vulnerable areas require increased attention, including repeated and widespread testing, to minimize the threat of serious illness and mortality.",

            "text": "Clinical studies across the US and NYC have shown that people with underlying health conditions and risk factors, including diabetes, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease, are at higher risk for severe outcomes and mortality from COVID-19 [1, [9] [10] [11] . However, little is known about how the presence of these chronic risk factors correlates with mortality at the population level [12] [13] [14] . Such information is key to developing effective public health interventions to mitigate COVID-19 spread and adverse outcomes, and population studies can guide policy at the community-level. In addition, population level studies are enriched with minorities and the whole spectrum of socioeconomic status, thus reflecting reality more closely. A study of US data looked at the prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19 severity according to CDC guidelines, and asserted that people living in low-income households and those who are Black or American Indian are more likely to have chronic conditions that place them in a higher risk category for COVID-19 complications [12] . The study however did not correlate this high-risk profile with mortality data. Within NYC, the distribution of behavioral risk factors and chronic conditions is highly variable from neighborhood to neighborhood; higher obesity rates in Brooklyn and the Bronx have been posited as being partially responsible for the increased COVID-19 mortality in these areas [15] . A separate study reported older age and severe obesity as risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and worse in-hospital outcomes in a Bronx cohort [16] . However, the research published so far only partially tackles a more complex reality when studying COVID-19. Minorities and underserved populations have higher prevalence of chronic conditions that put them in danger of a more serious infection; at the same time, they also have higher risk of exposure to the virus, as they frequently live in neighborhoods with higher population density and proportions of essential workers, with fewer opportunities to exercise social distancing [17] [18] [19] . Here we study risk factors associated with COVD-19 mortality at the neighborhood level in NYC. We hypothesized that areas with the highest prevalence of risk factors, minority residents and lower SES experienced the highest mortality in NYC.",

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene online tool EpiQuery [23] Hepatitis B, C, and alcohol related hospitalizations were used as proxies for liver disease. Epiquery was also used to assess 2015 birth rates by UHF, as a proxy for pregnancy, while heart attack hospitalizations by UHF in 2016 were extracted from New York City Environment and Health Data Portal [25] . The percent of the population 65 years and older was extracted from American Community Survey 2018 5-year estimates. The median age, proportion of white, and proportion of Hispanic residents were also extracted from 2018 census data. Median age was extracted despite the inclusion of age as a risk factor in order to adjust for different age distributions across NYC, as the prevalence of risk factors were not age adjusted. Data for all indicators were converted to ZIP code, using crosswalks provided by the census [26] and the New York City Department of Health (NYC DOH) [27] .

There was heterogeneity among ZCTAs in other NYC boroughs, including in Staten Island, which has low death rates in the southwest but high death rates in the northeast portion of the borough. Likewise areas of central Queens and eastern Brooklyn have high death rates, while death rates decrease in areas closer to Manhattan in these boroughs. Areas with high death rates have noticeable overlap with the risk score and inverse correlations with socioeconomic index, such as the Bronx. However, areas of central Queens with high death rates have moderate risk and socioeconomic scores, illustrating the complex interplay between risk factors and mortality.",

Here we identify that areas with fewer white residents, more Hispanic residents, older residents, and with higher prevalence of a greater number of risk factors had increased COVID-19 mortality. These findings expand on existing literature that has partially addressed the potential risk of severe COVID-19 illness deriving from the complex intersection of chronic risk factors, SES and race [12] and can be useful in plans to address and reduce excess mortality in NYC 5 . In the present analysis, the COVID-19 death rate was highest in areas with the highest prevalance of risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, asthma, and older age. Within NYC, these areas of greatest risk correspond to the Bronx, southeastern and southern Brooklyn, and parts of southern Queens; areas that are also of lower socioeconomic status with larger resident minority populations. Past neighboorhood analysis of NYC communities has reported that these areas have limited capacity to social distance, as measured by NYC subway data, and therefore have higher infection risk [29] . It is possible that these areas contain a large proportion of essential workers, such as healthcare, transportation and public-service workers, who are unable to work from home. It has been cited that social distancting, including working from home, is a privilege [18] , and this is not a reality in communities characterized by higher proportions of comorbidites, risk factors for COVID-19, and adverse social determinants of health, including potential overcrowding and food insecurity. Further disparities in SES and healthcare access would only exacerabate adverse circumstances in these communities and contribute to increased risk of infection and mortality. It has been noted that blanket public health recommendations in regards to social distancing for COVID-19 do not take local contexts and populations into account [17] , and may be applied less effectively in socioeconomically disadvatanged and minorty communities due to several factors, including overcrowded households and higher proportions of essential workers. Instead, understanding local contexts is central in creating effective public health solutions. One avenue to begin to rectify disparities is to perform increased testing in these communities [2] , and more specifically in sub-groups at higher risk of serious COVID-19 complications. However, there remains a gap in appropriate testing and attention given to these vulnerable communites [2] . Here, we emphasize that many of the same communities that are more suceptible to increased COVID-19 spread also face higher risks of severe illness and mortality if infected. The data point to the need for more aggressive actions in preventing COVID-19 spread and detecting early infections in specific areas of NYC.",

This study was ecological in nature and there are more individual level factors that may influence COVID-19 mortality that could not be taken into account here, although an accepted and comprehensive risk factor measure from the CDC was utilized. Another limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the analysis. Future studies should investigate these relationships with mortality using a larger study period, representing a larger number of COVID-19 related deaths, to validate these findings.",

This analysis represents the first to our knowledge to investigate risk factors for COVID-19 mortality at the population-level in New York City, and supports the need for repeated and widespread testing in these communities with many risk factors for severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Additionally, this analysis shines light on vulnerable communities that require equitable resources to rebound from COVID-19 related hardships and mortality in these communities. Future analyses could explore how the presence of comorbidities influences the immune response following COVID-19 infection, as this could ultimately be a major determinant of mortality outcomes [30] . Future vaccination efforts should understand the vulnerability to across New York City Zip Code Tabulation Areas. The risk index is a sum score of quartiles of asthma prevalence + cancer prevalence (excluding skin cancer) + COPD prevalence + diabetes prevalence + heart disease prevalence + hypertension prevalence + kidney disease prevalence + obesity prevalence + Heart attack prevalence + proportion of the population aged \u226565 years + birthrate prevalence and liver disease (measured by summing quartiles of Hepatitis B prevalence, Hepatitis C prevalence and alcohol hospitalizations prevalence). The socioeconomic status index was constructed from principal component analysis of 2018 American Community Survey estimates of median household income in the past 12 months, median gross rent, percent living below 150% of the poverty line, education, percent working class, percent unemployed, > 1 occupants per room. The education index was calculated on the population \u2265 25 years and is a weighted combination of the percent high school graduate, high school only, and more than high school, with a greater value indicating higher educational attainment.
