            "text": "Africa. Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the agebased distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contactcases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18-35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36-60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1-42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6-50%) and OPEN",

As the spread of the virus was expanding worldwide, the first case of COVID-19, in Africa, was reported on February 14th, and a month later on March, 13th, Gabon declared its first case. Gabon was among the few African countries that rapidly and successfully scaled up and implemented detection, prevention, and control measures. The country opted very quickly for a SARS-CoV-2 population-wide testing strategy. In this country of 2.1 million inhabitants, the population is essentially young (54.6% are under 25) (PNUD). With 60 sampling sites and a network of 15 RT-PCR laboratories located across the country, Gabon performs between 2000 and 5000 tests per day. Between March, 13th and November 13th, the country tested 266,271 people and recorded a total of 9069 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases (3.4% infection rate), 8938 were cured (98.5% cured rate), 65 active cases and 58 deaths (0.6% case fatality rate) (Country report). Today, original factual researches on SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Africa are scarce. We have few studies from South Africa (showing the heterogeneity of the pandemic) 1 , and Nigeria (showing an early slow epidemic trajectory, while highlighting the iceberg of asymptomatic cases in the country) 2 . Most studies on Africa are model-based, or commentaries (work of reflection on COVID-19) [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

COVID-19 positive patients followed an anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol, which consisted of oxygen therapy, hydroxychloroquine (250 mg once on day 1, followed by 125 mg daily for 10 days), azithromycin (500 mg for 5 days), vitamin C (500 mg per day for 10 days), zinc tablet (15 mg per day for 10 days) and dexchlorpheniramine (2 mg daily for 10 days). Patients were followed and regularly retested (day 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, 30, 40 and 50) until they had two subsequent negative tests. Based on that protocol, we established a timeframe indicative of the length of time it took our COVID-19 patients' test results to come back negative (we called it time to the negativity). We analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, we analyzed the variance of leukocytes counts according to the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Also, we analyzed the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (screened using both kits from Roche and bioMerieux, France) in selected patients and contact-cases.",

This study is one of the first describing SARS-CoV-2 infection in an African context. The study looked at agedstratified infection rate, symptomatology, the prevalence of chronic diseases, time to SARS-CoV-2 negativity (from diagnosis) and the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Data showed that in our setting, from March to August 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 positive rate based on RT-PCR tests was 17.2%. SARS-CoV-2 age distribution analysis showed that young and middle-aged adults accounted for 88.4% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). Young and middle-aged adults likely contribute to community transmission of COVID-19 in our setting. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly and children (13%), whereas the highest infection rate was observed in young and middle-aged adults (~ 19%). These figures can be explained by the age stratification in our context (Gabonese context), where elderly, children and young/middle-aged adults represent about 4%, 40% and 56% of the population respectively. Other explanations include population activity (elderlies are less active) and the country's strong measures to protect the most vulnerable segment of the population (early total confinement, obligation to wear a mask in public places, cases close contact cases quarantine, etc.). The median age of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects in our setting was 39 years, which is lower than what was observed respectively in France (44 years) 10 . Moreover, in the western world elderlies represented between 17 and 40% of COVID-19 cases 11 . Today, there is a change in the trend of COVID-19 in the west 12, 13 . The gap between age groups shrank considerably 11, 13 . Like in Africa, young and middle-aged adults are becoming the cornerstone of community transmission of COVID-19.",

The selected features of SARS-CoV-2 in this African context are in some aspects similar but in others different to what was observed elsewhere. Except for the report from the Tuscany region of Italy (50-75% of asymptomatic cases) 14 , the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive asymptomatic cases in our context is different from what is observed in developed countries (approximately 40% to 45% of asymptomatic cases 11, 13 . Also, looking at the spectrum of disease severity in symptomatic patients, our figures are not that much different from what was observed in China 15 , or France 16 (80-90% of mild cases). The level of comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was relatively low in our setting. Only 3% of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons had diabetes, the number one factor that heightens COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality 7 .

Very similar features were observed in Chinese COVID-19 patients 17, 18 . Neutrophilic leukopenia was more common in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1-42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6-50%) and lymphocytopenia (20-40%) were more prevalent. In the literature, neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia have been reported as frequent features of in patients with severe-to 18, 19 . Also, thrombocytopenia was a feature observed in all patients' groups with the highest rate around the first week after diagnosis (11.4-25%) . A published meta-analysis study by Muhammad S. Asghar et al. 20 shows thrombocytopenia as a significant feature of COVID-19 patients. Overall, the whites blood cells and thrombocytes features of African COVID-19 patients are similar to what was observed in other populations. With nearly 80% of COVID-19 patients producing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, our data indicates that Africans antibody response following SARS -CoV-2 infection seems to be similar to what is observed in Europe 21 and Asia 22, 23 . However, the durability of this acquired immunity still needs to be investigated in the African context to establish the value of antibody-based herd immunity and perhaps validate the concept of \"immunity passports\". The high rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies observed in SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative contact cases suggests that subclinical infection may have been overlooked 24 , as it is common in respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 infection 25 . It is therefore clear that case counts based on RT-PCR tests may underestimate the actual SARS-CoV-2 attack rate 24 .",

As published data suggest that people with the blood type O may have the lowest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop less severe COVID-19 disease than others 8, 9, 26 , the predominance of people with the blood type O in the population may be an additional factor explaining the low rate of COVID-19 severe disease in our setting. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was higher among A and B blood types compared with type O (the gap in SARS-CoV-2 infection rate between the groups did not reach 5% probably because of the relatively low numbers of people of the blood types A, B and AB. Nevertheless, our finding regarding infection prevalence was similar to what was observed by Zietz et al. 27 . A great part of the population was positive for Rh (D).

Africans should not be complacent and should not lower their level of vigilance. Also, population-based serological studies are needed in the African context to provide insights on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the immunological state of the population.",
