Here, we used a human intestineon-a-chip (Intestine Chip) microfluidic culture device lined by patient organoid-derived intestinal epithelium interfaced with human vascular endothelium to study host cellular and inflammatory responses to infection with NL63 coronavirus. These organoid-derived intestinal epithelial cells dramatically increased their ACE2 protein levels when cultured under flow in the presence of peristalsis-like mechanical deformations in the Intestine Chips compared to when cultured statically as organoids or in Transwell inserts. Infection of the intestinal epithelium with NL63 on-chip led to inflammation of the endothelium as demonstrated by loss of barrier function, increased cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Treatment of NL63 infected chips with the approved protease inhibitor drug, nafamostat, inhibited viral entry and resulted in a reduction in both viral load and cytokine secretion, whereas remdesivir, one of the few drugs approved for COVID19 patients, was not found to be effective and it also was toxic to the endothelium. This model of intestinal infection was also used to test the effects of other drugs that have been proposed for potential repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these data suggest that the human Intestine Chip might be useful as a human preclinical model for studying coronavirus related pathology as well as for testing of potential anti-viral or anti-inflammatory therapeutics.",

Recently, human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture technology that recapitulates human organ-level pathophysiology in the lung, was used as a preclinical model to repurpose approved drugs for diseases caused by respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza (Si et al., 2021) . However, sixty percent of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 also display gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and the epithelial lining of the GI tract has been suggested to be a potential transmission route as well as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection because it expresses high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the primary receptor that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry (Xu et al., 2020a; Pan et al., 2020; Parasa et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2021) . Other coronaviruses that similarly use the ACE2 receptor for entry, such as the alpha coronavirus NL63 that causes the common cold, also have been reported to induce GI symptoms (Bordeianu, 1980) . The GI symptoms observed in infected patients may be due to virus-induced damage to the intestinal epithelial lining or to associated inflammatory responses, including release of cytokines and recruitment of circulating immune cells.",

Thus, to study these more complex responses to coronavirus infection in human tissues, we leveraged a human Organ Chip model of the intestine (Intestine Chip) (Kasendra et al., 2018) that is lined by highly differentiated human intestinal epithelium isolated from patient-derived duodenal organoids interfaced with human vascular endothelium and cultured under flow in presence of cyclic, peristalsis-like, mechanical deformations, with or without exposure to circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We show that this human preclinical Organ Chip model can be used to study host injury and inflammatory responses to infection by the NL63 coronavirus, and to test the responses of drugs that target the virus or surface proteases involved in virus entry.",

The first 10 principal components were visually chosen to describe a large portion of the variance in the dataset based on the \"elbow-method\" and were used for further dimensionality reduction with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. Cells were clustered using Louvain clustering (resolution 0.4), and differentially expressed gene markers were identified with log2-fold changes greater than 0.25 and minimum differences in the detection of fraction greater than 0.1. Gene module scores were added with the AddModuleScore function in Seurat.",

To determine if human Intestine Chips could be used to study ACE2dependent coronavirus infection, we first compared expression of ACE2, and the intestinal stem cell marker LGR5 in the cultured duodenal organoids and either Transwell insert or Intestine Chip cultures lined by intestinal epithelial cells isolated from the same organoids. Differentiation in both the organoids and Intestine Chip cultures is induced by shifting from an expansion medium (EM) that is used to drive cell proliferation to a differentiation medium (DM) that acts by reducing Wnt signaling (via removal of Wnt3a) and Notch signaling (via addition of \u03b3-secretase inhibitor) while concomitantly promoting cell cycle arrest through Raf/ERK inhibition (via removal of p38 MAP kinase inhibitor) (Kasendra et al., 2018) . Although cells from the same donor organoids were used to create all three in vitro models which were then grown in DM, the organoids and Transwell cultures exhibited significantly higher mRNA expression of the intestinal stem cell marker LGR5 (\u223c6-and 21-fold, respectively) ( Figure 1B) . This relative decrease in proliferative stem cells in the Intestine Chips was accompanied by much higher expression of ACE2 mRNA compared to the organoid and Transwell cultures (\u223c15-and \u223c70-fold, respectively) ( Figure 1B) , and this was confirmed independently by measuring ACE2 protein levels in Western blots ( Figure 1C) . The induction of ACE2 and downregulation of LGR5 in chips was confirmed in two independent organoid donors. The presence of DM was critical for this induction as ACE2 mRNA levels in intestinal epithelial cells cultured on-chip in EM were 3-fold lower (Supplementary Figure S2) . We also confirmed that the organoids, Transwells, and Intestine Chips all expressed three transmembrane proteases that are involved in coronavirus Figure S3) .",

When we perfused nafamostat through the endothelium-lined vascular channel at its reported human plasma maximum concentration (C max ) to simulate intravenous administration in patients, we found that it significantly reduced viral infection, as measured by quantifying subgenomic viral N protein transcripts using RT-qPCR ( Figure 2C) . In contrast, similar administration of remdesivir, another intravenous drug that has been given emergency use authorization for COVID-19 (Eastman et al., 2020) , was not effective and it did not provide an added effect when given in combination with nafamostat ( Figure 2C) . Moreover, this dose of remdesivir also damaged the endothelium, as indicated by detachment of most to the endothelial cell layer (Supplementary Figure S5) . To further investigate remdesivir induced endothelial cell toxicity, we tested a range of doses on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in conventional static cultures and found that remdesivir had significant toxicity above a dose of 1uM (Supplementary Figure S6) . While nafamostat appeared to reduce viral load by about 2-fold, neither it nor remdesivir were able to prevent the compromise of intestinal barrier integrity ( Figure 2D) . To confirm the specificity of the nafamostat effects, we carried out similar studies using the laboratory adapted strain of beta coronavirus OC43, which is known to be insensitive to nafamostat, and indeed this drug had no inhibitory activity in this model (de Haan et al., 2008; Shirato et al., 2018; Sasaki et al., 2021) Figure S7) .",

            "text": "Having developed this human preclinical model of intestinal coronavirus infection, we also tested oral drugs, including toremifene, nelfinavir, clofazimine, and fenofibrate, which have been shown to inhibit infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in vitro (Yamamoto et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2020b; Martin and Cheng, 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) . Toremifene (10 \u00b5M) showed similar efficacy to nafamostat in reducing NL63 viral load ( Figure 3A ) while again not rescuing barrier compromise ( Figure 3B ). In contrast, nelfinavir (10 \u00b5M), clofazimine (10 \u00b5M) and fenofibrate (25 \u00b5M) were ineffective at the doses tested ( Figures 3C,D) . Host Tissue and Immune Responses to NL63 and Modulation by Drugs Viral infection of the GI system induces a coordinated response between multiple cell types including endothelial cells and immune cells. To study immunecell recruitment and activation, fluorescently labeled PBMCs were introduced into the endothelium lined vascular channel, and then flow was stopped and the chips were inverted for 3 h to promote interactions with the endothelium. Quantification of the PBMCs adherent to the endothelium revealed an increase immune cell recruitment in virus infected Intestine Chips 24 h after infection compared to uninfected ( Figures 4A,B) , and this was accompanied by endothelial damage, as measured by loss of staining for the junctional protein VE-cadherin and increased staining for the apoptosis marker, caspase 3 ( Figure 4A ). When we analyzed Intestine Chips that had been pretreated with nafamostat for 24 h prior to infection and the addition of immune cells, we found that while treatment with this drug reduced viral RNA levels ( Figure 2C) , it did not produce statistically significant inhibition of PBMC recruitment to the endothelium ( Figure 4B ). This is consistent with the finding that nafamostat treatment also did not reduce production of multiple inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, I-6, MCP-1, MIP-1a, IL33, IFN-g) released into the vascular channel effluent, and only produced modest reduction in IP-10 levels ( Figure 4C) . Interestingly, while NL63 infection induced these cytokines, it moderately suppressed production of the antimicrobial protein, Lipocalin-2, whereas treatment with nafamostat increased its expression ( Figure 4C ).",

It is not clear whether coronavirus infection can start through the oral-faecal route; aerosolization of faecal matter, swallowing of virus replicated in throat, nasal epithelium or phlegm likely contribute to the spread of the infection from the lungs to the intestine. GI symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting have been reported in many cases (Lin et al., 2020; Villapol, 2020) and are even considered as a common symptom for suspecting SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lan et al., 2020; Villapol, 2020) . Patients with NL63 also often exhibit GI symptoms, although they are not as severe . However, it is not clear if this is due to direct infection of the intestine or due to systemic inflammation. Furthermore, infection of the GI tract by SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated in the severity of COVID-19 (Livanos et al., 2020) and it is involved in multi-system inflammatory disease (Yonker et al., 2021) . In addition, some populations might be at increased risk for viral infection through the GI route, for example, people taking gastric acid reducing drugs, such proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers or acid neutralizing compounds or people with impaired GI motility (Goodgame, 1999; Bavishi and Dupont, 2011; Prag et al., 2017; Vilcu et al., 2019; Nightingale et al., 2020) . Thus, we set out here to leverage a human Intestine Chip microfluidic culture device (Kasendra et al., 2018) to create an enteric human coronavirus infection model that can be used to study coronavirus infection of the human intestinal epithelium as well as a preclinical tool to identify potential therapeutics.",

While NL63 does not cause life-threatening pathology like SARS-CoV-2, it can be studied in biosafety level-2 laboratories, which makes these studies available to a much broader range of laboratories that are currently exploring Organ Chip approaches. Interestingly, when we compared the levels of ACE2 expression in patient duodenal organoid-derived epithelium cultured in the Intestine Chip, Transwells, or as intact organoids, we observed much higher levels of this viral receptor in cells cultured in the microfluidic chip. As expected, this finding inversely correlated with expression of the LGR5 stem cell marker expression. Organoids and Transwell cultures have been used to study infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in vitro (Lamers et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020; Triana et al., 2021) . However, the physical microenvironment of Organ chips (e.g., fluid flow, cyclic peristalsis-like mechanical deformations) has been previously shown to have potent effects on cell differentiation and function that are crucial for recapitulation of complex organ level physiology and pathophysiology with high fidelity (Gazzaniga et al., 2021; Ingber, 2021; Si et al., 2021) . This also seems to be the case here given that the same organoid-derived cells were cultured in the same medium in the different models, yet their phenotype differed greatly. Also, scRNA-seq analysis confirmed that the primary human intestinal epithelial cells differentiated into multiple intestinal cell lineages, including ACE2-expressing absorptive enterocytes.",

            "text": "Importantly, the high expression of ACE2 in the Intestine Chip, along with expression of multiple surface proteases, such as TMPRSS2, that also help to support virus entry, enabled efficient infection of the intestinal epithelium when NL63 virus was introduced into the apical lumen. Viral replication in the epithelium was confirmed by detection of a large increase in subgenomic viral RNA transcripts, with a noticeable peak at 24 h and return to baseline levels by 72 h post infection. While coronaviruses have been detected in stool from infected patients by PCR it is not clear if infectious viral particles are shed from the intestine. This study does not address shedding of infectious virus. It provides a model of intestinal infection and inflammation in response to this commonly circulating coronavirus. Unique features of the Organ Chip include the ability to quantify changes in intestinal barrier integrity, measure host inflammatory responses in the presence or absence of endothelium, and study recruitment of immune cells that are introduced through the endothelium-lined channel. Indeed, we were able to demonstrate intestinal barrier compromise in response to NL63 infection on-chip, which is one of the known symptoms of coronavirus infection. However, in contrast to past work on influenza virus infection of human Lung Airway Chips (Si et al., 2021) , we did not find that the presence of the endothelium altered viral infection efficiency. We also used the Intestine Chip to study the host inflammatory response to NL63 coronavirus infection. We first introduced fluorescently labeled PBMCs into the endothelium lined vascular channel and found that virus infection resulted in a significant increase in recruitment of immune cells to the endothelium surface at 24 h after infection. This is consistent with our finding that NL63 infection induced secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, etc.) that are known to stimulate immune cell recruitment. The PBMCs were not HLA typed and are unlikely to recognize viral peptides presented on the MHC of the epithelial and endothelial cells and thus activation of T cells in this model will be limited and this system cannot model the contribution of cytotoxic T cells.",

The outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic started a race to identify approved drugs that might be rapidly repurposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by avoiding the lengthy steps required for new drug approvals. One of the first drugs to receive an emergency use authorization from the FDA was the anti-viral drug remdesivir. Because we have dynamic flow in our chips, we can administer drugs either through the epithelial channel lumen to mimic oral administration or via the vascular channel to simulate intravenous administration, and we can introduce the drugs at their clinically relevant C max dose. Interestingly, our results show that when we administered the intravenous drug remdesivir through the vascular channel, it had no protective effect against NL63 infection in the Intestine Chip. This finding is likely due to inherent differences between coronavirus subtypes (i.e., NL63 vs SARS-CoV-2). But surprisingly we found that remdesivir also induced significant endothelial cell toxicity, and we confirmed this in two different types of human endothelium, which should raise some concerns for its use clinically in COVID-19 given the contribution of vascular injury to patient morbidity in this disease. Gastrointestinal and other toxicities have been reported for remdesivir (Fan et al., 2020) ; however they are considered acceptable given that remdesivir is being prescribed for hospitalized patients.",

Moreover, similar results were obtained when the oral approved drug, toremifene, which also has been reported to inhibit TMPRSS2, was administered through the lumen of the epithelial channel. Thus, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 appear to be involved in NL63 coronavirus entry into the human intestinal epithelium.",

This likely reflects the fact that the infection was not prevented completely by this drug and an important aspect of organ level control of the infection, as the presence of a controlled level of inflammation is a key response to infection (Triana et al., 2021) . Given the modest clinical efficacy of remdesivir which did not show any activity in our model and the limited availability of anti-COVID19 therapeutics, drugs like nafamostat and toremifene could provide clinical benefit. Interestingly, while NL63 infection induced production of some cytokines, it partially suppressed production of an antimicrobial protein, Lipocalin-2, whereas treatment with nafamostat reversed this effect and slightly increased their expression. This might imply a role of these peptides in cellular response to NL63 infection. Finally, when we screened other approved drugs that have been shown to inhibit infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in vitro, including nelfinavir, clofazimine, and fenofibrate, none of them showed any efficacy in preventing intestinal infection by NL63, although no adverse effects were observed with these drugs.",
