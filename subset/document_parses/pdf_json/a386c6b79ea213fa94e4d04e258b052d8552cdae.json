Clinical manifestations, laboratory examination results, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, treatments and outcomes were analyzed. Result: All patients showed different mental disorders as the only manifestation. There were two cases of alcohol abuse, one of Asperger's syndrome with malnutrition, one of infection and one of invasive pituitary adenoma. The other cases were diagnosis as major depressive disorder, dissociative and conversion disorders, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, unspecified psychosis and bipolar disorder, respectively. Three patients were completely recovered while the clinical symptoms of rest seven patients partially recovered at the follow-up three months later. Oval-shaped lesion centered on the splenial of corpus callosum (SCC) was observed in all patients using MRI. The lesions of SCC of all patients were completely resolved within five weeks.",

            "text": "Consistent to the previous findings, three cases in our study developed metabolic abnormalities. MBD is one of the forms of metabolic abnormalities [8] . The pathogenesis of MBD is associated with chronic alcoholism, nutritional deficiency and metabolic disorders [8, 22] . Consistently, both of our case 1 and case 2 are diagnosed as alcohol dependence. Long-term alcohol might lead to severe malnutrition (especially lack of B vitamins). Case 3 was diagnosed as Asperger's syndrome and showed decreased serum vitamin B12 level. He had a seriously irregular intake, and thus developed serious malnutrition, which may explain his markedly decreased serum vitamin B12 level. Given that there is no evidence of an association between Asperger's syndrome and RESLES, we believe that malnutrition is more likely to be the cause. The alcohol abuse and malnutrition increase the susceptibility to injury pro-apoptotic drive and then lead to endothelial dysfunction, which result in the cytokines released from microglia and eventually cause the cytotoxic edema of corpus callosum [14, 23] . Although the cases of RESLES with other malignancies might be caused by chemotherapy [12, 24] , the RESLES was also found in CNS malignancies before treatment [12, 14] . Case 5 had pituitary adenomas and did not get any treatment at the onset. The effect of the pituitary adenomas on RESLES has not been determined. In some cases of CNS malignancies, the author suggests that the RESLES is attributed to a release of cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid resulted by infiltration of malignant cells [13] . Also, we speculate that the metabolic abnormality caused by endocrine disorders is likely to be a precipitating factor of RESLES with pituitary adenomas. However, without exact evidences, further researches are needed to reveal the underlying mechanism.",

The virus is the main pathogen [16] , as well as the bacteria [11] , mycoplasma pneumoniae [25] and plasmodium [26] are also reported as the causes of RESLES. Similar to previous reports, our case 4 had a history of infection in forms of recurrent of maculopapular. Differently, the case 4 only showed altered mental states without any prodromal manifestations, while some manifestations, such as fever, digestive tract symptoms and cough, were reported to preceded the appearance of neurological symptoms in previous reports [5] . Moreover, the antipsychotic treatment for him was not working but antiinflammatory treatment was effective. It indicated that etiological therapy might be more effective for RESLES caused by infections. Similarly, the clinical symptoms of case 1-3 significantly improved after treatment of vitamin B complex. Therefore, it is important to be alert of RESLES thought the patients only showed mental symptoms to choose the effectively treatment.",

Firstly, most of the etiologies described above were ruled out through clinical history, examinations, and clinical diagnosis. There was no evidence of history of malignancy or chemotherapy, the symptom of infection (fever, leukocytosis, nuchal rigidity and history of travel to endemic areas), SAH (thunderclap headache), metabolic pathology (Fluid-electrolyte imbalances, cirrhosis or hepatic dysfunction, liver transplantation, malnutrition, or AIDS, Wernicke encephalopathy or Marchiafava-Bignami disease and Wilson disease) and Trauma. Secondly, they start with mental disorders without prodromal symptoms, and were clinically diagnosed with different mental disorders. Thirdly, the possibility of drug cause was also ruled out based on the remarkable improvement of symptoms after treatment of psychotropic drugs, although the drugs used in these cases like Olanzapine [27] have been reported as an inducement of RESLES. Thus, we suspect that RESLES of these cases might be caused by mental disorders. Moreover, we found that a case report about postpartum psychosis without any other physical diseases was similar to case 7. She presented two weeks postpartum with new onset of behavioral alteration and irrelevant talking without fever, headache, or seizures. A possibility of postpartum psychosis was considered to be the associated condition after ruling out various etiologies for RESLES [28] . Given the evidences, the mental disorders are inclined to be considered as the possible etiology of the RESLES.",
