But less is known about the knowledge, protection behavior and anxiety regarding the outbreak among the general population. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted in China and abroad from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Socio-demographic information was collected and knowledge scores, practice scores, anxiety scores and perceived risk were calculated. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used to identify possible associations. Results: We included 9,764 individuals in this study, and 156 (1.6%) were from Hubei Province. The average knowledge score was 4.7 (standard deviation, 1.0) (scored on a 6-point scale); 96.1% maintained hand hygiene, and 90.3% of participants had varying levels of anxiety. People in Hubei Province were the most anxious, followed by those in Beijing and Shanghai. People who had experienced risk behaviors did not pay more attention to wearing masks and hand hygiene. Conclusions: The public had high awareness on knowledge of COVID-19 outbreak, and a high proportion of people practiced good hand hygiene behavior. Many people claimed anxiety, especially in heavily affected areas during pandemic, suggesting the importance of closing the gap between risk awareness and good practice and conduct psychological counseling to public and patients.",

On January 8, 2020, a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 a month later 4 ) was laboratory confirmed as the cause of the outbreak, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 5 that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in China in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 6 that caused severe respiratory disease outbreaks in the Middle East in 2012. Since January 3, China began to report the outbreak information to the World Health Organization (WHO) regularly. 7 The test kit was initially developed on January 10. As of January 28 (when this study started), COVID-19 infection caused 5,974 cases in Mainland China and the number was growing dramatically. 8 As of February 1 (when this study ended), 14,380 cases were reported. 9 Currently COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic, with more than 6 million cases and more than 370,000 deaths reported in 216 countries and territories by the end of May 2020 10 (See eFigure 1 for detailed timeline).",

The evidence suggested that human-tohuman transmission had occurred among close contacts, 11, 12 and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) was estimated approximately as 2.68. 13 The outbreak coincided with the Chinese Lunar New Year, and the mobility of people visiting relatives and friends increased, which also increased the difficulty of prevention and control. To improve the awareness of self-protection among the general population, the National Health Commission had released six versions of the new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control protocol 14 and published guidelines for public prevention, recommending minimizing outings, wearing a mask, and keeping hands clean. 15 These suggestions, as well as daily outbreak information, are transmitted to the public through television, mobile phones, the internet, and other means. People have discussed the outbreak and expressed their views in \"we media\" era during the spread of the outbreak. Due to the rapid spread of the outbreak and the control activities, some people developed anxiety and fear. Guidance on emergency psychological crisis intervention was published for patients, medical professionals, and the general public to prevent the psychological damage caused by the outbreak and promote social stability. 16 Psychological assistance hotlines have been set up in all cities and counties, providing free 24-hour service. 17 To our knowledge, there has been no article reporting the current public awareness and psychological status of Chinese people focused on virus and epidemiology of outbreak. Understanding the public knowledge, practice of prevention, and psychological status can improve effectiveness of health risk communications, and analyzing their demographic differences can help avoid unequal protection across society. 18 Therefore, at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we designed an online questionnaire to measure the knowledge and practice, providing references for reassuring citizens and outbreak control.",

Binary logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between risk behaviors and wearing masks and hand hygiene, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The component ratio was used to describe the channel through which people obtained information.",

The epidemic can generally be controlled effectively through syndromic (fever) surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and self-protection, just like SARScov and MERS-cov. 19 Therefore, China had strongly restricted movement across Hubei Province and then escalated it to the rest of the provinces in a short period. 20 Our research found that the internet media and mobile media played a very important role in the publicity and communication of epidemic prevention and control, with more than two-thirds of the respondents getting the outbreak news and official announcements through online media, such as official website, Weibo, and WeChat. In China, there were 112.2 mobile phones per 100 people on average in 2018, 21 which provides a guarantee for the government to guide people to strengthen self-protection online. In fact, more than three-fourths of people accurately understood the transmission route, incubation period, and preventive measures of COVID-19 because of the spread of official information. It is very important for people to know the accurate information of the disease, especially the prevention measures, which play an important role in the prevention and control of the outbreak. In the study, 95.4% of the respondents knew the incubation period of COVID-19. In Awareness, Practice, and Anxiety for COVID -19 contrast to China, a study from Saudi Arabia showed that people had a high awareness of transmission routes and clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV but a low awareness of its incubation period. 22 Young adults appeared as being more active in terms of knowledge. We considered that this difference may be caused by the popularity of mobile phones and the internet. About 50% of people currently infected with COVID-19 are over 50 years old in China. 23 Therefore, what deserves our attention is the improvement of epidemic knowledge of people over 50 years old, especially in Hubei Province. We found that 66.9% of respondents were able to wear appropriate masks to prevent COVID-19 infection, 81.5% were able to change their masks regularly, and 96.1% of people maintained hand hygiene and washed their hands frequently. WHO and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend wearing masks to prevent infection and suggests hand-washing as a protective measure for general population as of the completion of this investigation. 24, 25 However, based on Chinese guidelines, we could conclude that more than 30% of respondents were not able to wear appropriate masks to prevent COVID-19 infection, and nearly 20% did not change their masks regularly. The proportion of people taking preventive measures is similar to that among the population in Reunion Island during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 26 but still low. Previous literature showed that the relationship between age and preventive behavior may change with different diseases and different population. [26] [27] [28] Reducing the misunderstanding of personal protection is the focus of public awareness and health education in the next step.",

            "text": "Our study confirmed that anxiety related to COVID-19 outbreak was common in the general population. Anxiety and fear has a negative impact not only on health, but also has economic effects and social consequences, as was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. 29 In addition to Hubei Province, people in multiple provinces, like Shanghai and Beijing, also had experienced much anxiety. Cities that experienced previous outbreaks might be more sensitive to the epidemic of infectious diseases. 30, 31 Younger people living in urban areas or with higher education were more anxious about the outbreak, which showed similar trends observed for anxiety and panic during the H5N1 avian influenza pandemic in Hong Kong 32 and during the SARS outbreak in Qatar. 33 While COVID-19 is still spreading across the country, the public generally experiences high levels of panic, fear, anxiety, and irritability. These negative emotions can progress into behavioral changes, such as being afraid to leave the house, blindly disinfecting, and scrambling for medicines. Baidu, one of the most common search engines in China, has released an information index, for which \"psychological counseling\" in Hubei Province increased by 3,275% from January 20th to January 26th, and the search index increased by 51% in the 7 days. 34 In this study, 86.5% of people in Hubei Province reported that they had contacted high-risk population or environment, compared with only 6.5% of people in other provinces. Besides, many areas have cut off traffic with Hubei. This would increase their psychological stress. These results suggested we should not only support Hubei Province in medical treatment, but also need to strengthen health education and psychological counseling. It is recognized that extensively implementing mental health monitoring in the community is a worthwhile strategy. Community workers should regularly assess the psychological status of community families and report to their superiors. Meanwhile, the government should strengthen media efforts to ensure the validity and accuracy of output information. We strongly recommend that the government develop health education strategies to address mental health issues, promote healthy behaviors, and reduce psychological stress. In this study, people with risk behaviors clearly know that they were at high risk, but they did not pay enough attention to wearing a mask when going out and maintaining good hand hygiene. According to local regulations, people must wear masks when going out. What's more, maintaining hand hygiene is an effective protection for themselves. We consider that appropriate risk perception of the outbreak can lead to beneficial changes in health behaviors, such as wearing masks and washing hands frequently. And strong publicity and punishment may increase the possibility of wearing masks and other protective behaviors. However, due to the sudden outbreak, the supply of masks in China is insufficient to meet the needs of some people.",

The findings suggest the importance of closing the gap between knowledge and good practice, and the need to reduce anxiety caused by the pandemic.
