We report evidence of exceptional performance and qualitative variation in learning object-names in dogs. 34 na\u00efve family dogs and 6 knowledgeable individuals that knew multiple toy names, found in 2 years of search around the Globe, were exposed to 3 months of training to learn two novel toy-names and were tested in two-way choice tests. Only 1 na\u00efve and all 6 knowledgeable dogs passed the tests. Additionally, only these dogs learned at least 10 new toy names over the 3 months, showing qualitative variation in this capacity. Although previous object-name knowledge could provide an explanation for the superior performance of the knowledgeable dogs, their rarity and the absence of previous training of this skill point to exceptional giftedness in these individuals, providing the basis to establish dogs as a model-species for studying talent.",

Individual variability in external and internal organ morphology is present in all organisms, including among genetically identical individuals, such as human identical twins (e.g. 1 ). Individual variability is also present in behaviour and in various domains of cognitive performance 2 . Exceptional performance-i.e., the performance of outliers in individual variability-is a well-known, established phenomenon that is also present in various human activities such as music, mathematic and linguistics (e.g. 3 ). Since Galton's monograph Hereditary Genius 4 , the origins of individual variation in cognitive skills have been debated. While some authors suggest that genetic factors play the most significant role 5, 6 , others propose a preponderant role of environment and deliberate practice (e.g. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

First of all, we had selected puppies and adult dogs that were motivated for fetching toys. Moreover, these subjects did not show any sign of reduced motivation for the task throughout the experiment: they appeared always eager to fetch a toy and they invariably did so in all test and training trials. Yet, they failed in relying on the toy name to select it.",

However, it is worth noting that, also in the na\u00efve group, 18 dogs were Border collies and, yet they did not show evidence of learning object names. The prevalence of Border collies over other breeds in this and previous studies provides some suggestive evidence for genetic influences potentially acting at least at two levels: (1) Border collies (or more generally herding breeds), being selected for visual and acoustic interaction with humans, may have some predisposition www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for this trait; (2) some specific combination of genetic variation may further facilitate the emergence of the capacity for object name learning. However, we also note that the vast majority of Border collies in our study did not show this trait and at least two dogs reported by previous studies to have learned multiple object names are Yorkshire terriers 33, 39 , which is not a breed selected for herding. In summary, it seems that purely environmental, social and other non-specific individual factors (e.g., motivation for toys) do not explain the exceptional performance of the 6 WK and 1 na\u00efve dog. Our results rather point to talent as a label for the extremely specific skill of those few individuals. Thus, we suggest that these subjects are gifted word-learners, in the sense that they possess a specific quality which is far above the typical population and that their exceptional capacity and performance parallel the phenomenon of talent and extreme individual variation in cognitive traits in humans.",

Thus, it seems that they are able to mentally classify sounds/object-names into remembered categories. Gifted word-learner dogs, like humans with absolute pitch, may possess a referential mental representation or a template that they use to categorize the objects. Categorization skills in absence of specific training were found in a previous study with one of these dogs, Whisky 30 . Whisky was able to sort novel dog toys into four known categories, without having previously been trained to categorize, but simply having been exposed to a typical dog's life in a human family. (2) Rarity: People with absolute pitch are rare, with estimates of 1 < in 10,000 persons reported 18 . There are no estimates of the proportion of dogs with the ability to learn object names but in our study, out of 34 dogs motivated for toys, only one (2.94%) showed the capacity to learn toy names. Moreover, this subject was not randomly selected among owners motivated to participate in the study, like the other na\u00efve dogs. Her owner thought that, among her dogs, this one was \"special\" in the way she would listen and react to human language. Therefore, the above-mentioned 3 out of 100 may well be an overestimation. The rarity of the capacity to learn object-names in dogs is also indirectly corroborated by the fact that the existing studies on object-name learning in dogs always include only one or very few subjects. This is consistent with this capacity being an exceptional trait possessed only by some gifted individuals. (3) Limited effect of training: The capacity to learn object-names did not emerge in most subjects, even after 3 months of intensive training. Similarly, absolute pitch does not emerge in musicians even after tens of thousands of hours practicing and reading scores 40 . (4) Sensitive period: The manifestation of some skills, like first language learning, may rely on mandatory experience during a restricted window of early mental and neural development (e.g. 41 ). In the case of absolute pitch there are both supporting [42] [43] [44] and non-supporting 21 findings whether early experience to musical training is needed for the emergence of this skill. Here we found that intensive exposure during puppyhood is not enough for the emergence of object-name skills in typical dogs. Whether and the extent to which earlier exposure (during a possible sensitive phase) is needed for this talent to emerge remains to be determined.",

In contrast, during spontaneous interactions it is probably more difficult to recognise similar relationships. Thus, learning in the latter case may rely on partly different mental mechanisms. In addition, gifted word-learner dogs need only a few exposures for learning object-names, as revealed by two dogs with previous vocabulary of multiple object-names 47 . Those two dogs were able to learn new object-names in only four exposures in a social, playful context, providing evidence for rapid mapping (e.g. 48, 49 ) . Taken together, the mental process allowing gifted word-learner dogs to acquire new object-names during spontaneous social interactions, may share some important features with the mental apparatus supporting word learning in young infants [50] [51] [52] during the so-called vocabulary spurt 53 .",

The owners were requested to show the toy to their dogs while pronouncing its name and then to play with it by giving it to the dog, playing tug of war, tossing it and asking the dog to fetch it, always repeatedly saying its name. Dogs received a brief play session with the fetched toy for choosing the named one. They were also rewarded by praise, and / or food (depending on each individual dog motivation). Dogs that were rewarded solely with playing with the fetched toy and dogs that were also receiving food as reward were present in both groups. The toys were introduced gradually, one at a time. If the owners and trainer noticed that the dogs were able to discriminate between two toys based on their names, more toys were introduced, always one by one.",
