The lack of utility from low-titre (1:40) CCP in moderate COVID-19 was confirmed by the PLACID trial [13] .

Considering that the qualitative composition of CCP is due to the nAb titre (the higher, the better), its accurate evaluation is particularly critical and could make the difference between clinical efficacy and inefficacy. Thus, although most trials perform a correlation analysis between PRNT and high-throughput serological assays, in many cases, the CCP units are tested only with the latter tests (44% in the PlasmAr trial [3]), with the risk of an incorrect evaluation of the neutralizing CCP activity. One major cause could be that, despite IgM, IgG and IgA all being capable of mediating neutralization, virus neutralization test titres correlated better with binding levels of IgM and IgA 1 than IgG [16] , which are the only class routinely measured in high-throughput serological assays. In addition, the quaternary structure of the Spike protein available on infected replication-competent cell lines is poorly replicated by recombinant antigens bound on solid substrates.",

First, during a pandemic, there is massive accrual of severely ill patients to emergency departments, and in collapsed health systems, the turnaround time between emergency room admission and admission to a ward can be relevant. Additionally, in the absence of quick (antigenic or molecular) tests for SARS-CoV-2, the turnaround time for final confirmation of diagnosis with polymerase chain reaction tests, usually run in batches, takes from 5 to 10 h. Then, bureaucracy also takes time when it comes to preparing the papers for recruiting a patient within a clinical trial, and there are challenges associated with outpatient transfusion of known infectious individuals. Finally, ABO-compatible CCP units may not be readily available at the local blood bank, and recruited patients are therefore left on the waiting list. All these variables are likely to affect the efficacy of CCP treatment. We suggest wide deployment of quick tests within emergency departments, where CCP could be safely administered even before the patient reaches the final ward.",
