Moreover, the relation between substance use and compliance with anti-COVID regulations is still unexplored. Thus, this study aimed to determine the level of compliance with anti-COVID measures by adolescents and the link between substance use and compliance with anti-COVID regulations. This was a cross-sectional study including 909 participants (M age = 12.57; SD = 0.81). The most complied measure was mask-wearing, followed by avoiding hug/kiss friends and, finally, social distancing. All substance use negatively correlated with compliance with measures. However, strong alcohol and tobacco were the only substances significantly related to less compliance of anti-COVID measures after controlling for covariates. These results provide evidence about the relation between substance use and compliance with anti-COVID measures. Strategies addressed to decrease substance use could be effective to reduce behaviours associated with coronavirus transmission.",

Lockdowns, social distancing and the uncertainty generated by the pandemic have triggered an increase in adverse psychological reactions in the population, such as stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms (Salari et al., 2020; Savolainen et al., 2021) . Some people use substances as a coping strategy against adverse psychological reactions (Sinha, 2008) . This can be even more true in adolescence which is a period of deep biological changes that can trigger some emotional instability (Bailen et al., 2019) . At the same time, Pardo et al. (2002) showed that drug use increases disinhibition and anti-normative behaviours. Thus, substance use can trigger undesirable behaviours that are incompatible with COVID-19 measures. Substance use and other antisocial behaviours, including rule-breaking, tend to form patterns (Nasaescu et al., 2020) , and these problem behaviours could also be two manifestations of the same underlying construct. This can be especially true in adolescence, a period characterized by high risk-taking and sensationseeking (Steinberg, 2004) that are further increased by substance use (Lane et al., 2004) .",

Limiting alcohol consumption has been included in some specific national and regional strategies against COVID-19, assuming that \"alcohol is a psychoactive substance which inhibits judgement\" and \"the direct effects of alcohol impair consumers' ability to comply with transmission control measures in hospitality settings\" (Scottish Government, 2020) . Nevertheless, the relation between substance use and compliance with COVID-19 rules still needs to be empirically studied. Policies have been developed to reduce substance use in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Among them, it has been banned to smoke in Spain when safe distance could not be kept (BOJA 51, 2020) , and restrictions to the sale of alcohol at certain hours have been decreed (BOJA 16, 2021) . Most of these policies have been based on intuitions and knowledge from related fields, but it still needs to be discovered if substance use is related to the adherence to anti-COVID measures. Thus, the current study focused on the relation between substance use and the compliance with the COVID-19 measured in a broad sample of adolescents.",

Moreover, a growing body of research relates substance use and vulnerability to COVID-19. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding compliance with anti-COVID measures by people who use drugs. Substance use could be a risk factor because it provokes disinhibition and, in some cases, users share substances or materials (cigarettes, bottles, etc.).

In Spain, following the guidelines by the WHO, people must keep social distancing and wear face masks in public spaces or when social distancing is not possible to keep (Han et al., 2020) . As a public health concern, the level of compliance with COVID-19 regulations has been studied in several countries (Nivette et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2020; Wismans et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . However, there are still many gaps in knowledge regarding compliance with COVID-19 regulations. The majority of studies has been conducted with adults (Barcel\u00f3 & Sheen, 2020; De la Vega et al., 2020) , and research with adolescents is still necessary. Moreover, changes in substance use behaviours have been reported during the pandemic and these changes have been related to a negative experience of the pandemic (Gritsenko et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Vidot et al., 2020) . However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the relation between substance use and compliance with COVID-19 regulations. Thus, this study aimed to discover the level of compliance with COVID-19 regulations and its relation to substance use in adolescents. In relation to the first objective, the highest compliance was found regarding maskwearing. Adolescents seem to be aware of the importance of face masks, given that less than 2% reported never wearing it. This is congruent with the results of Tong et al. (2020) , who also found that mask-wearing was the most respected rule, although their percentage of compliance was higher. A possible explanation to such difference could be that the culture of mask-wearing is more extended among individuals who live in Asian countries for different reasons, such as pollution or other diseases (Choi & Lee, 2021) .",

Moreover, only one out of three students in our study reported never kissing and/or hugging their friends. Sports activities and other games or a low number of spacious places to socialise could explain these overall low levels of compliance with COVID-19 regulations. Thus, educators should promote keeping social distancing and limiting physical contact among students in order to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.",

Previous studies found that young people were more likely to skip COVID-19 norms (Barcel\u00f3 & Sheen, 2020; De la Vega et al., 2020; Wismans et al., 2020) . However, we found that compliance with COVID-19 regulations was higher in younger adolescents. This is congruent with Dardas et al. (2020) who found similar results in Jordan adolescents. Given these results, the relation between age and adherence to COVID-19 measures may not be linear. It is possible that younger adolescents preserve some moral values from childhood and their compliance with rules is higher in comparison to older adolescents. Middle and late adolescents tend to challenge rules and involve in risky behaviours (Steinberg, 2004) . These trends usually disappear as young people mature and compliance with measures increases in adulthood (Gibbs, 2020) . It is also possible that parental supervision of younger adolescents is higher than the supervision of older adolescents. It is, therefore, possible that adolescents who are supervised more closely are more compliant with COVID-19 regulations.",

A plausible explanation for this sex divergence with previous research could be the developmental stage of participants. Our study focuses on early adolescence. It is known that girls usually mature earlier than boys (Lim et al., 2015) and, thus, girls in our sample could display behaviours in which boys involve later. Moreover, a kiss on each cheek is a casual and common greeting among females in Spain, but not among males. Thus, it is possible that this sex difference reflects this part of the Spanish culture.",

Precisely, the second objective of this study addressed this gap in knowledge. Although the use of any of the studied substances negatively correlated with adherence to COVID-19 regulations, strong alcohol and tobacco were the only substances that were uniquely related to lower compliance with COVID-19 measures after controlling for covariates. The explanation could be threefold. First, disinhibition provoked by alcohol could cause skipping these rules by the adolescents. Second, it has been found that adolescents tend to engage in more than one antisocial behaviours at the same time (Nasaescu et al., 2020) . In this case, substance use and skipping rules can be considered two antisocial behaviours. Third, drug use itself can involve taking off masks and less social distancing at tables or smaller places. Nevertheless, the use of illegal substances was not related to compliance with COVID-19 regulations in the regression analysis. A possible reason is that substances such as cannabis or cocaine are not yet widely accepted by the peer group in early adolescents. Thus, students at this age who use this kind of substances may do it with a limited number of people instead of using them as social behaviour.",

Moreover, it reported the level of compliance with COVID-19 regulations by Spanish adolescents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which these variables are studied and related with this population. Most of the previous studies on COVID-19 were conducted online or by phone, whereas participants in this study were supervised during data collection. Undoubtedly, this improves the quality of the data. However, there are also some limitations. The design is cross-sectional, so the order of appearance of phenomena cannot be established. It is possible that substance use causes rule-breaking related to COVID-19 regulations. It is also possible that substance use and non-compliance with COVID-19 measures are associated with one another solely because of their relation to a third variable (e.g. externalizing behaviours). Furthermore, the sample was selected by convenience, and future studies with representative samples should confirm our results. As data were collected using self-reports, a possible presence of social desirability bias should be taken into account. Future projects should study these variables using longitudinal designs and representative samples. Moreover, compliance with COVID-19 regulations should be related to other antisocial behaviours, such as bullying, cyberbullying or cyberhate.",

These results provide a framework to policymakers when regulations about substance use to reduce the transmission of the virus are made. It has been confirmed that tobacco and alcohol use are related to a lower level of compliance with COVID-19 regulations. Thus, the usefulness of policies limiting substance use during the pandemic seems to be confirmed, particularly during the outbreaks of the pandemic. Moreover, families should supervise their adolescent children, so they are not involved in substance use, especially during the pandemic. Although it is not allowed to sell alcohol and tobacco to minors in Spain, substance use in adolescents is common (Rodr\u00edguez-Ruiz et al., 2021) . Many adolescents reported noncompliance with COVID-19 measures. Thus, complying with anti-COVID regulations and reducing substance use should be further promoted by schools and taken into account by policymakers.",
