We aim at clarifying this controversy. A mathematical analysis of compartmental models with subpopulations has been conducted, starting from the SIR model, and progressively adding features modeling outbreaks or upsurge of variants, lockdowns, and vaccinations. We find that in all cases, the in-school transmission rates only affect the overall course of the pandemic above a certain context dependent threshold. We provide rigorous proofs and computations of the thresdhold through linearization. We then confirm our theoretical findings through simulations and the review of data-driven studies that exhibit an often unnoticed phase transition. Specific implications are: awareness about the threshold could inform choice of data collection, analysis and release, such as in-school transmission rates, and clarify the reason for divergent conclusions in similar studies; schools may remain open at any stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, including variants upsurge, given suitable containment rules; these rules would be extremely strict and hardly sustainable if only adults are vaccinated, making a compelling argument for vaccinating children whenever possible.",

Even studies of the same situation reach opposite conclusions 19, 20 . When trying to analyze available Covid-19 data using simulations of compartmental models, we observed a remarkable instability: the observed effect of school opening depended in a crucial way on small changes in the models parameters, and we kept oscillating between making the schools the culprits of the pandemic, or completely absolving them; see Fig. 3a -c below.",

We observe the transition in all scenarios, albeit with different vales of the threshold. Of particular interest is the case of a vaccination campaign of adults, in which the threshold for in-school transmission rates turns out to be extremely small, giving a strong indication of the need of a children vaccination campaign. The presence of a threshold for the in-school transmission rate can explain the divergent conclusions of several statistical studies, as they might have been observing the two opposite conditions. In addition, if in the situation under investigation school transmission is close to the threshold, epidemiological models, which necessarily rely on, often hard to estimate, parameters, might end up forecasting one or the other scenario depending on tiny changes in the calibration. Awareness of a threshold is crucial for modeling, data collection and analysis, and policies determination 23 .",

If opportunities to reduce the effective reproduction number ( R e ) with non-school-based measures are exhausted or undesired and R e is still close to 1, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable, particularly among older school children. \" The first scenario of Rozhnova et al. corresponds to a subcritical in-school transmission rate, so that the effect of closing schools would be very moderate. The second scenario seems to correspond to an in-school transmission rate around the critical value, so that both containment, in-or out-of-school, are effective 12 . Yuan et al. uses a detailed compartmental model and data from the second semester 2020 in Toronto, an outbreak context, to estimate the likely impact of school opening; with parameters estimated and collected from literature, the paper finds that opening school has little effect on the overall course of the pandemic: in all scenarios presented in their Figs. 2 and 4 the difference between school opening and closure is extremely contained 16 . The findings of the research is then consistent with our phase transition scenario. In particular Yuan et al., find that \"school reopening was not the key driver in virus resurgence, but rather it was community spread that determined the outbreak trajectory\"; in other words, the parameters of the models, although not explicitly given in the paper, are such that the external transmission is preponderant 16 . As an additional finding, it is observed in Yuan et al. that, according to their model, \"brief school closures did reduce infections when transmission risk within the home was low\" 16 : in this case, a reduced transmission rate outside makes the one in school likely supercritical.",

As measure to achieve such a low reproduction number are highly demanding, this level of containment seems to be sustainable for brief periods only, after which vaccination for children becomes the only viable possibility to return to normality.",
