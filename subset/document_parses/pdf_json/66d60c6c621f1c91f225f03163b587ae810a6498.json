Social distancing restrictions implemented during this global pandemic may bring potential impact on physical activity habits of the general population. However, running is one of the most popular forms of physical activity worldwide and one in which it could be maintained even during most COVID-19 restrictions. We aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on runners' training habits through analyzing the training records obtained from their GPS enabled wearable trackers. Retrospective and prospective data were collected from an online database (https://wetrac.ucalgary.ca). Runners' training habits, including frequency, intensity and duration of training, weekly mileage and running locations were analyzed and compared 9 months before and after the start of COVID-19 restrictions in March 2020. We found that runners ran 3 km per week more (p = 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.12) after the start of COVID-19 restrictions, and added 0.3 training sessions per week (p = 0.03, Cohen's d = 0.14). Moreover, runners ran an additional 0.4 sessions outdoors (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.21) but there was no significant change in the intensity or duration of training sessions. Our findings suggested that runners adopted slightly different training regimen as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Our results described the collective changes, irrespective of differences in response measures adopted by various countries or cities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (World Health Organisation, 2020), prompting immediate action from governments to mitigate the spread of the disease in an effort to save lives. Various countries adopted different approaches to slowing the spread of COVID-19, however, almost all countries implemented some form of temporary lockdown measures, with ongoing social distancing restrictions. The impact of such restrictions caused the cancellation of large events and gatherings of people. As countries begin the process of returning to normal life post-COVID-19, it is important to understand the impact that COVID-19 restrictions had on individuals' physical activity and exercise habits.",

Running as a form of exercise is shown to have a wide variety of health benefits, ranging from improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced burden of chronic disease and even improved mental health (Lavie et al., 2015; Oswald et al., 2020) . Aside from the obvious health benefits, running is consistently one of the most popular sports due to being low cost, widely accessible, and its associated social engagement from running clubs and large running races (Clough et al., 1989; Janssen et al., 2020; Dejong et al., 2021) . The implementation of COVID-19 restrictions meant that large races and group training in running clubs were often canceled, potentially having an impact on the motivation, participation, mental and physical health of runners during the pandemic.",

            "text": "Under the COVID-19 restrictions, running was one of the very few forms of exercise that could still be conducted due to its individual nature and the ease of maintaining social distancing restrictions. Two previous studies (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020; Dejong et al., 2021) examined the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on runners but identified conflicting results. Dejong et al. (2021) reported an increase in weekly running mileage (+1.4 km/week) and frequency (+0.3 session/week), whereas Bazett-Jones et al. (2020) found a decrease in the same variables, \u22125.4 km/week and \u22120.7 session/week respectively. The discrepancy between these two studies might be explained by the sampled populations. The severity and length of restrictions could be location-specific and could have affected the runners' training habits differently. Additionally, Bazett-Jones et al. (2020) focused exclusively on the impact in youth competitive runners, a population with unique challenges, running biomechanics and physiology McSweeney et al., 2021) , thus further limiting the generalizability of these previous results. As such, the true impact of COVID-19 restrictions on adult runners' training habits is still unclear. Research into the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on physical activity habits will allow athletes, health professionals, and even public health officials, to better understand how population-wide infection control measures impact physical activity habits.",

            "text": "Both aforementioned studies (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020; Dejong et al., 2021) used a retrospective survey design, which allowed for quick analysis and identification of trends. However, a retrospective survey design increases the risk of recall bias (Hassan, 2006) , mis-reporting of training variables and impacting on the accuracy of the results of the studies (Townshend et al., 2008; Dideriksen et al., 2016) . A potential solution to this lies in the field of wearable technology. The increase in popularity and accessibility of wearable technology allows for a new way for researchers to collect real-world data on runners' training habits (Pobiruchin et al., 2017; Wiesner et al., 2018) . Wearable devices, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled smart watches, have recently been shown to be valid and reliable tool in tracking distance and heart rate among runners. These commercially available devices have shown a mean absolute percentage error of under 5% in tracking distance (Gilgen-Ammann et al., 2020) , and a good to very good concurrent validity when tracking heart rate (St\u00f8ve et al., 2019; D\u00fcking et al., 2020) . Thus, wearable technology can be utilized as an alternative to runner surveys, collecting accurate, real-world data on running training variables for analysis. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on runners' training habits using wearable technology. We aimed to determine the impact on running training variables, such as weekly mileage, frequency of training sessions, intensity of training sessions and duration of training. Based on Dejong et al. (2021) results in an adult population, we hypothesized that runners would have an increase in weekly mileage and frequency of training sessions. We also hypothesized that runners would have a reduced intensity of running training, due to reduced motivation from cancellation of races and running clubs (Dejong et al., 2021) . Additionally, as most governments encourage outdoor activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also aimed to identify if runners had a change in the location of their running training. As exercise was one of the main reasons individuals were allowed outdoors during stay-at-home orders, we hypothesized that runners would have an increase in the number of training sessions performed outdoors during COVID-19 restrictions.",

These criteria were selected to mitigate the unique demands of youth runners, such as lower rates and poorer recall of overuse injuries (Krabak et al., 2016 , and the age-related decline in performance and training seen in older runners (Korhonen et al., 2003; Conoboy, 2006) . The time period (i.e., 9 months prior to the start of COVID-19 restrictions) was set to ensure sufficient data for comparison before and after COVID-19 restrictions and mitigate the impact of seasonal running trends. Additionally, this time period ensured that runners had sufficient experience with using the GPS enabled smart watches, thus minimizing potential device errors such as incorrect wearing or data recording (D\u00fcking et al., 2020; Gilgen-Ammann et al., 2020) .",

A run was considered outdoors if the user recorded the run as \"Running, \" \"Track running, \" \"Street running, \" or \"Trail running.\" High intensity interval training (HIIT) has gained popularity with runners over recent years due to its proposed shorter training volumes with equivalent fitness gains when compared to steady state aerobic training (Foster et al., 2015) .

            "text": "Overall, participants of our study increased their weekly mileage by an average of 3 km. This statistically significant increase, although trivial, has demonstrated participants' adherence to running even under COVID-19 restrictions. A similar increase of 1.4 km was reported in Dejong et al. (2021) large-scale survey study, the current study observed a larger increase, possibly attributed to the difference in the reporting time frame and methods employed between the two studies. Specifically, DeJong et al.'s study compared running habits before the pandemic and at peak social isolation restriction (May to June 2020), while we averaged the weekly mileage across 9 months before and after restrictions (March 2020) were introduced. COVID-19 has disrupted not only physical activity, but mental health, family life and daily lifestyle (Petersen et al., 2021 ) and a longer time frame could have allowed runners to overcome the stress, adapt to the changes and restore their routines, including running trainings. This supposition is supported by a recent study that reported an initial decline in physical activity engagement within the first month of COVID-19 lockdown, but engagement was restored and even surpassed the level before COVID-19 restrictions after 3 months (Mata et al., 2021) . Future studies should consider longitudinal monitoring of a homogenous cohort to further examine effect on both running behaviors and injury risk of COVID-19 restrictions and the lifting of such restrictions. In addition to the increased weekly mileage, an increased number of runs per week was also observed among participants involved in the current study. The training duration remained unchanged, suggesting that runners were running more frequently rather than completing longer runs. Longer runs has been associated with fatigues and potentially injurious biomechanics (Futrell et al., 2021) . Considering the trivial increase in weekly mileage, frequency and duration of runs, the relative risk of running-related injury is likely unchanged. Moreover, intensity of runs were also unchanged, most likely due to most marathon races in 2020 being canceled or postponed, including major races such as the Boston Marathon (Minsberg and Futterman, 2020) and the Berlin Marathon (Bussiness Standard, 2020) . Bazett-Jones et al. reported that changes to training intensity were especially prominent within competitive youth long-distance runners (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . However, in the current study, participants were adults who ran an average of 25 km per week before the pandemic. This result is further supported by the fact that runners in the current study maintained their percentage of maximal heart rate at 72-86%, which is considered moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, for around 135 mins per week. This amount of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity met the recommendations for substantial health benefits according to the guidelines on exercise prescription published by the American College of Sports Medicine (2018) and further supports the shift in motivation from performance to maintaining physical activity level and health benefits (Dejong et al., 2021; Petersen et al., 2021) .",

(2021) and can be explained by two main reasons-the closure of fitness centers and indoor running tracks and governments encouraging outdoor physical activities. For example, the majority (55%) of the runners in our study reside in Calgary, Canada and the provincial government declared a state of public health emergency on March 15, 2020 (Office of the Chief Medical Health Officer, 2020) and implemented a 3-month closure of sport programs, fitness centers and recreation facilities, which likely forced runners to run outdoors. Various states in the United States and Hong Kong have also implemented similar preventive measures, enforcing phased closure of fitness centers since March 2020 (Fisher, 2021) . Furthermore, the government has also encouraged outdoor physical activities (Government of Alberta, 2020) for the possibility of socially distancing and limiting indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19 (Bazant and Bush, 2021) . Additionally, spending more daytime outdoors has also been found to extenuate the negative effect of COVID-19 restrictions and prevent sleep disruption (Korman et al., 2021) .",

The current study further supports the findings of other qualitative and large-scale survey studies conducted on the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. Furthermore, our study has established the framework for using wearable devices to evaluate individual or group level changes across longer time periods.

The online portal only registers training data that were recorded by the wearable device, and we have only obtained the age and gender of participants. Further sub-group analysis was therefore unavailable based on the existing dataset. Another limitation is that the devices used for recording heart rate are all wrist-worn Garmin devices, which was found to have a higher mean absolute percentage error than electrocardiogram measured by a chestband (Evenson and Spade, 2020) . Lastly, the uneven distribution of physical location among the participants could limit the generalizability of our results. Majority of runners from North America (United States and Canada). Future studies involving similar methodologies may bring new insights into how specific groups of runners altered their running habits as a response to COVID-19 restrictions.",
