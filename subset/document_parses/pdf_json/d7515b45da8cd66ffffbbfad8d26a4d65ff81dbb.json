However, complicated trade routes and supply chains make it impossible to trace the 4 origin of agricultural products. This is particularly problematic when the source of food 5 contamination cannot be determined with the currently available methods. For example, a recent 6 recall of contaminated romaine lettuce from North American shelves had caused significant 7 economic losses and raised public concerns on food safety before a lengthy investigation 8 pinpointed the origin of the outbreak. A recent study by Springer's team from the Harvard 9 Medical School has described the so-called Barcoded Microbial Spores (BMS) method, which 10 enables safe, rapid, and high-resolution tracing of the origins of agricultural products (Qian et al., were transformed into the genomes of a common spore-forming bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) and 17 fungus (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). To minimize risk to the environment, the engineered BMS 18 organisms were impaired in their germination and growth under natural conditions either by 19 removing genes essential for germination (B. subtilis) or by boiling (S. cerevisiae). 20 After these barcoded spores were inoculated onto various surfaces of interest, origin and contact 21 tracing was conducted using a Cas13a-based RNA detection technique known as SHERLOCK",

Currently, synthetic pesticides 55 are widely used to control pests in agricultural fields, but their overuse often causes serious 56 environmental problems and threatens human health. Different from pesticides, some 57 environmental-friendly chemical elicitors (also known as plant strengtheners), such as 58 benzothiadiazole and jasmonates, although unable to directly kill insects, can induce or enhance 59 plant resistance to pests, emerging as promising substitutes for pesticides. However, most of the 60 reported chemical elicitors can reduce plant growth through hormonal crosstalk, which is 61 undesirable for achieving high yield in crops, thereby limiting their use in agricultural practices. proposed that they may prevent WBPH stylets from reaching the phloem through physical 77 blocking, thereby decreasing food intake ( Figure 1) . Interestingly, the spraying of 4-FPA not 78 only decreased WBPH populations but also increased rice grain yield in the field. Furthermore, 79 4-FPA was found to confer broad-spectrum resistance to other piercing-sucking insects tested, 80 with no harmful effects on spiders, which are the main predatory natural enemies of insect pests 81 on rice plants.

GUIDE-seq enables genome-wide profiling of To overcome these setbacks, a team from Wu's and Yan's labs recently developed a strategy 185 known as the integrated peptidogenomic pipeline (Wang et al. 2020) . Using this pipeline, they 186 discovered 1,993 NCPs and 844 CPs in maize. Although non-AUG translation start sites are 187 commonly used in CPs and NCPs, they found that NCPs have some distinct characteristics; e.g., 188 they are shorter and homogeneously distributed in the genome compared with CPs. To validate 189 these identified NCPs, the authors analyzed the available RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data 190 from maize and verified 90.62% and 36.73% of NCPs, respectively. Consistent with previous 191 studies showing that quantitative trait locus (QTLs) are highly associated with noncoding regions 192 in maize, they found that NCPs are significantly associated with several QTL-related traits such 193 as disease resistance, kernel length, and oil content, implying that NCPs are likely involved in 194 regulating these processes. Interestingly, NCPs were also found to be enriched within regions 195 associated with maize domestication and selection. Furthermore, the authors carried out a similar 196 study in Arabidopsis, a dicot model plant, and identified 1,860 NCPs and 2,363 CPs, suggesting 197",

            "text": "112 out alleles of genes by generating short insertions or deletions in various plant species. However, 113 targeted insertion (knock-in) or replacement of long DNA sequences by CRISPR/Cas remains 114 challenging in plants (Chen et al., 2019). For such edits, the donor DNA that acts as the repair 115 template for the endogenous homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism is often supplied with 116 the CRISPR-Cas machinery that creates double-strand DNA breaks at designated genomic 117 targets. However, precise gene replacement and insertion in plants via HDR with the supplied 118 donor is inefficient, as HDR usually occurs at a much lower frequency compared with non-119 homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair in plants. 120 In mammalian cells, robust targeted insertions have been demonstrated by using 5'-121 phosphorylated linear donor DNA bearing phosphorothioate linkages at the ends (Figure 1A) 122 (Tsai et al., 2015), as these chemical modifications prevent the degradation of donor DNA and 123 promote its integration through NHEJ. Building upon this knowledge, Lu et al. (2020) recently 124 established breakthrough methods for high-efficiency sequence insertion and replacement in rice. 125 They demonstrated in rice calli that chemically modified donor DNA could increase the 126 efficiency of targeted sequence insertion by one order of magnitude (Figure 1B). Using various 127 chemically modified donors, they inserted regulatory DNA elements of various sizes ranging 128 from 26 bp to 2049 bp at fourteen designated genomic sites in rice. The average insertion 129 frequency among the regenerated transgenic plants was 25%, a significant improvement in 130 efficiency compared with previous reports. 131 Furthermore, using chemically modified donor DNA, Lu et al. (2020) devised a strategy known 132 as tandem repeat-HDR (TR-HDR) for precise sequence insertion or replacement (Figure 1C). In 133 TR-HDR, the donor sequence is first inserted at the designated genomic target, creating a tandem 134 repeat. Subsequently, Cas9 generates a cut between the two similar sequences, thereby triggering 135 high-efficiency HDR to replace the original sequence with the donor DNA fragment carrying the 136 desired edits. Using TR-HDR, the authors achieved base substitution or protein tag fusion at five 137 loci in the rice genome with an average efficiency of 6.1%. 138 Although increased off-target insertions and frequent chimerism were observed in primary 139 transformants, these problems in plants can be overcome by screening a large number of 140 transformants and/or by backcrossing and genetic segregation (Lu et al., 2020). In short, the 141 versatile and effective methods reported in this study for targeted sequence insertion and 142 replacement have great potential to transform these once-challenging edits into routine practices 143 in plants in the future.",

In addition, plants also 171 contain many other types of small peptides. Compared with conventional peptides (CPs), which 172 are derived from annotated coding sequences (CDSs) or open reading frames, plant genomes also 173 encode non-conventional peptides (NCPs) derived from unannotated CDSs including introns, 174 UTRs and intergenic regions, as well as different reading frames of annotated CDSs. 175 176 Several strategies have been developed for the large-scale identification of NCPs, including 177 predication of translational small open reading frames by bioinformatic analyses, and validation 178 of translation by ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry-based analyses. Peptidogenomics, a 179 method that integrates peptidomics and genomics, has recently emerged as an efficient strategy 180 for identification of NCPs in microorganisms and humans. However, there are setbacks for the 181 identification of NCPs in plants, such as nonspecific protease digestion, low abundance of 182 peptides in planta and lack of proper reference databases.",
