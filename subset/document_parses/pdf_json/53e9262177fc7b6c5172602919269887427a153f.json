            "text": "Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet has been customarily assessed with the Mediterranean diet score (MDS or Trichopolou Index), with values of 0 or 1 assigned to each of the nine elements, and with the use of the sex-specific median as the cutoff. The value of persons whose consumption of the six beneficial items (ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids, vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereal, and fish) is at or above the median and is assigned a value of 1. Otherwise they receive 0 points. For detrimental elements (meats and dairy products) persons whose consumption is below the median are assigned a value of 1. An additional ninth point is assigned to moderate ethanol intake. We assessed the effect of each of the nine components of the MDS (replacing the fats ratio with olive oil, the main source of monounsaturated fats in the Mediterranean diet) on the risk of COVID-19 infection, symptomatic and severe COVID-19. From March to December 2020, 9,699 participants of the \"Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra\" (SUN) cohort answered a COVID-19 questionnaire. After excluding doctors and nurses, 5,194 participants were included in the main statistical analyses. Among them, we observed 382 cases of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical diagnosis; 167 of them with test confirmation. For the two COVID-19 definitions used, we found a significant decrease in risk for a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.98, p for trend = 0.040; and OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.88, p for trend = 0.020, for test-diagnosed cases). A protective effect was also found for symptomatic COVID-19 (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41-1.00, p for trend = 0.050). Among the different individual food groups, only the consumption of whole dairy products showed a harmful direct association. The Mediterranean diet as a whole seems more important than each of its components in preventing the infection and symptoms of COVID-19.",

However, there are other non-hygiene related factors which can help reducing the risk of infection or its related clinical complications. As there are some comorbidities clearly associated with COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, hypertension or obesity (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , in the long-term, previous adherence to a healthy lifestyle and diet could reduce the vulnerability of subjects to acquire the infection by reducing the burden of these chronic conditions. A key component of a healthy lifestyle is a balanced and healthy diet, which is in turn associated with an adequate immune response, as well as with antiinflammatory properties to reduce the risk of infections (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Therefore, both the innate and adaptive immune cell functions against the entrance and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the cytokine storm produced by this infection can be improved and modulated by the effect of an adequate nutritional status, in not-at-risk individuals as well as those with comorbidities (14) . Additionally, diet is known to exert an impact on the human microbiota, which in turn can be associated with the risk of acquiring the virus or the development of symptoms after infection (15, 16) .",

Thus, early in June 2020 the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region Office published the \"Nutrition advice for adults during the COVID-19 outbreak\" supporting the relevance of nutrition on the pandemic (19) . Additionally, since the very beginning of the pandemic, observational research and interventional studies focusing on nutritional aspects were carried out to find further non-pharmacological options and to prevent or reduce the health impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initially micronutrients were mainly analyzed, particularly vitamins (20, 21) . Afterwards, the antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiviral activities of some nutrients and foods have been evaluated (6, (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . Less evidence is available for the effect of complete dietary patterns on COVID-19 (4, 32, (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) , and most published reports on dietary patterns are related to the changes in diet caused by the pandemic or the lockdown.",

There, we displayed the odds ratio of COVID-19 infection for non-healthcare professionals. For the two COVID-19 definitions, we found a significant decrease in risk with greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet. For the highest adherence category, we found a 56% decrease in risk (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.88, p for trend = 0.020) when considering only cases with a positive test and 46% (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.98, p for trend = 0.040) when using the broader definition. Among the different foods, only yogurt and the consumption of whole dairy products showed a significant direct association. In whole dairy products, the lowest consumption category had a 45% decreased risk (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.94, p for trend = 0.027) and a 35% decrease in the risk of COVID-19 (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.92, p for trend = 0.015), as measured in test-positive cases and in all possible cases, respectively. The results for yogurt are consistent with these results, showing an OR = 0.49 (0.28-0.86) and an OR = 0.71 (0.50-1.03) for the low consumption category, respectively, as compared with the highest consumption, although this last result was no longer significant (p for trend = 0.068).",

On one hand, for some foods, there was not a big difference between the most extreme consumption categories; therefore, the effect of high or low consumption would be more difficult to be observed. As more foods are included, these differences will grow. On the other hand, although we found a significant inverse association between dairy products and COVID-19, the effect of the Mediterranean diet is the combined effect of all its components, which can combine and enhance each other. Undoubtedly, the recommendation of a complete pattern is much more effective than that of isolated foods.",
