There was also a wide range of responder demographic factors, including 267 those with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds which makes these survey results more 268 characteristic of the general population compared to prior studies that included mostly responses 269 from white women. 270 271 One of the main limitations of this study is the low survey response rate and the possibility that 272 the results were influenced by sampling bias. The low response rate may be due to the 273 distribution of surveys through email rather than in person, as well stressors from the COVID-19 274 pandemic that might have hindered participation. The high rate of non-respondents preclude 275 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f our surveys were anonymous, we were unable to compare characteristics between respondents 277 and non-respondents. We were also unable to assess if women had other virtual health care 278 visits. Furthermore, given our sample size, we were unable to address certain patient 279 demographics or visit characteristics that were predictive of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The 280 higher satisfaction rate may be attributed to the fact that this survey was conducted during the 281 COVID-19 pandemic, when patients may not have wanted to appear for in-person visits. The 282 surveys we used were also not validated as prior validated surveys did not reflect the range of 283 questions we sought to answer. 284 285 Another limitations of the study is the high rate of cancelled visits initiated by provider offices 286 during the 2020 time period, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These cancellations are attributable 287 to extensive rescheduling that occurred due to conversion to telehealth visits or to coordinate in-288 person visits with other scheduled visits, such as ultrasound examinations. Since this study was 289 completed during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients remained home, thus making 290 telehealth adherence more feasible than if patients had occupational responsibilities. This may 291 prevent application of these results to areas not significantly affected by the COVID-19 292 pandemic. 293 294",
