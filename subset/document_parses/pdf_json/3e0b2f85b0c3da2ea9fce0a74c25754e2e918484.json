            "text": "ABSTRACT Introduction South Africa's evolving burden of disease is challenging due to a persistent infectious disease, burgeoning obesity, most notably among women and rising rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). With two thirds of women presenting at their first antenatal visit either overweight or obese in urban South Africa (SA), the preconception period is an opportunity to optimise health and offset transgenerational risk of both obesity and NCDs. Methods and analysis Bukhali is the first individual randomised controlled trial in Africa to test the efficacy of a complex continuum of care intervention and forms part of the Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI) consortium implementing harmonised trials in Canada, China, India and SA. Starting preconception and continuing through pregnancy, infancy and childhood, the intervention is designed to improve nutrition, physical and mental health and health behaviours of South African women to offset obesity-risk (adiposity) in their offspring. Women aged 18-28 years (n=6800) will be recruited from Soweto, an urban-poor area of Johannesburg. The primary outcome is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry derived fat mass index (fat mass divided by height 2 ) in the offspring at age 5 years. Community health workers will deliver the intervention randomly to half the cohort by providing health literacy material, dispensing a multimicronutrient supplement, providing health services and feedback, and facilitating behaviour change support sessions to optimise: (1) nutrition, (2) physical and mental health and (3) lay the foundations for healthier pregnancies and early child development. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Human Ethics Research Committee University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa (M1811111), the University of Toronto, Canada (19-0066-E) and the WHO Ethics Committee (ERC.0003328). Data and biological sample sharing policies are consistent with the governance policy of the HeLTI Consortium (https://helti.org) and South African government legislation (POPIA). The recruitment and research team will obtain informed consent.",

The number of children and adolescents with obesity has risen to 124 million worldwide and could exceed 250 million by 2030 without substantial interventions. 4 A meta-analysis of 61 studies showed that increased preconception and interpregnancy weight gain was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM; 88% greater risk), pre-eclampsia (92% greater risk) and large-for-gestational-age (36% greater risk) babies. 5 A systematic review of 38 studies found a consistent association between maternal prepregnancy weight and offspring obesity. 6 Furthermore, Heslehurst and colleagues showed that a child has a 2.6-fold greater risk of obesity if the mother is obese prior to conception. 7 A systematic review by Dean and coauthors identified 23 randomised controlled trials of preconception care and counselling delivered via health facilities or community groups, that reported improved women's health behaviours (calorie restriction and increased physical activity), as well as, more positive maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes including an increase in antenatal care seeking and an increased likelihood of breast feeding. 8 9 None of these preconception interventions were conducted in Africa.",

In Soweto (urban-poor area of the Johannesburg Metropole covering 200 km 2 with over 1.3 million residents; 6400/km 2 ), we have found that the prevalence of OWO in females increases from 10% by age 8% to 43% by age 22 years, while the prevalence in males remains fairly constant into young adulthood at 10%; further, girls who are obese by age 5 are 42 times more likely to be obese adults. 10 11 Furthermore, 66% of pregnant Soweto women at first antenatal clinic visit were either overweight or obese, and 10% were diagnosed with GDM in late pregnancy. 12 13 Consequently, there is a high obesity burden need in Soweto for preconception interventions to support women to optimise health and manage weight to combat intergenerational obesity. 14 The Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI), an international consortium developed in partnership with the WHO to address childhood obesity. We hypothesise that an integrated complex intervention comprising a continuum of care starting preconception and across pregnancy, infancy and childhood will reduce childhood adiposity and the risk for NCDs, as well as, improve child development. Four randomised controlled trials in Ontario and Alberta (Canada), 15 Shanghai (China), 16 Mysore (India) 17 and Soweto (South Africa) have been harmonised to test this hypothesis. These sites were selected based on the community need and that they possessed both the infrastructure, and multidisciplinary teams with cohort/trial experience to execute an ambitious 10-year programme of work. This paper describes the HeLTI South African trial protocol in Soweto called Bukhali (a Zulu word meaning smart/powerful) signifying the beneficial potential of optimising women's health for herself and her future offspring.",

We initially opted for a cluster randomised study design in order to included community peer group sessions as part of the intervention. To assess the feasibility and implementation of this design, a pilot trial of data collection and intervention commenced in 2018 and concluded in 2019. We recruited 1719 participants within six community clusters, randomised the clusters, collected baseline data and biological samples, and implemented the planned intervention and control arm activities. The pilot trial data highlighted critical learning, among others, that: (1) it was feasible to recruit and collect good quality data and biological samples (95% consented to provide a blood sample and 75% consented to provide a DNA sample) from a large group of our target population; (2) young women living in Soweto lead complicated and economically stressful lives and are preoccupied with survival strategies, which often entails moving and living at multiple homes across family and friends in the community over time; (3) there is poor health literacy around preconception health among young women in Soweto; (4) young women were anxious about participation due to fear of criminal activities and abduction; (5) community safety of study community health workers (CHWs) could not be assured; and (6) we could not effectively deliver the planned community peer group component due to poor attendance despite convenient Saturday meeting times, multiple opportunities during the month to attend, and the provision of refreshments. To address these challenges, we formulated a multipronged strategy: (1) we rolled-out a communication campaign; a soap opera series of 11 episodes drawing attention to preconception health issues in multiple languages through two local radio stations with the largest population reach supported by social media engagement (https://soundcloud.com/ user-662329775); (2) we engaged and obtained additional support to operate within the community through community leadership forums and police awareness of the study team; (3) we produced branded material for staff and vehicles with clear university and project identification to promote credibility; and (4) we modified the study design (we pivoted from cluster randomisation to individual randomisation due to cluster contamination linked to young women shifting between multiple households) and intervention delivery, and jettisoned the peer group component because of poor compliance. 32",

The randomisation officer then escorts the participant to a separate wing on a different floor within the centre to introduce participant to either the intervention arm or control arm coordinator, thus preserving the concealment of allocation. The research trial data team and associated researchers will be blinded to participant allocation throughout the trial, and this will be achieved by: (1) ensuring that group allocation is locked on the database and cannot be accessed by the research team; (2) training the research team not to ask and encouraging participants not to divulge their allocation status; and (3) when participants visit the centre for their respective arm programme these activities will occur in a separate part of the centre away from the research team. All participants will be exposed to the preconception intervention or control programme for up to 18 months. If a participant does not become pregnant within the 18 months, she will have an exit assessment.

Trained in HCS, HHs will explore the barriers that women experience in trying to change their behaviour, ways of overcoming these barriers and setting goals for change. The HCS approach enables a woman to reflect on her particular priorities for physical and mental health, and to support her in finding her own solutions to challenges she experiences. The training is standardised and supported by the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit (UK). HCS training is aimed at achieving four basic competencies that are known to be useful in supporting behaviour change: (1) the use of open-discovery questions, questions that begin with 'how' and 'what' and lead people to explore and find their own ways of overcoming barriers to change;",

Assessment of implementation will focus on finding out what is delivered and how delivery is achieved, and which is vital information if the intervention is to be replicated. We will assess compliance by counts using a log (eg, contacts made), and by discussions between HHs and participants.

We will also observe the contact between call centre assistants and control participants to record the interactions. We will monitor intervention dose by recording the frequency and duration of contact between participants and HHs using diaries. To understand the mechanisms through which the intervention brings about change in the trial's specified outcomes, we will assess the acceptability of the intervention, and women's experiences of contact with HHs using interviews and focus groups. In assessing the context, we will aim to identify factors that might act as barriers or facilitators to intervention implementation or effects. This will include local and national policy, local service configuration and provision and sociodemographic and environmental factors within the communities taking part in the study.

In addition, Maelstrom will support the implementation of a data infrastructure within each country using DataSHIELD/Opal software 39 to allow federated data analysis (country-specific or meta-analysis by pooling estimates across countries) to be conducted without having access to individual participant data or exporting and pooling data on a central server. This capacity will provide a mechanism for addressing restrictive regulation regarding exporting data across countries.

When data are missing at random, which we expect to be the case, we will use multiple imputation so as to maximise sample size and study power in a dataset. We will assess the comparability at randomisation of the groups using descriptive analyses. We will also assess process indicators including recruitment and retention, Open access and indicators of programme delivery in the intervention group. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the influence of attrition and compliance. Intention-totreat analysis will be used for key outcomes based on all viable pregnancies adjusted for compliance and selection of viable pregnancies to minimise bias. For the primary outcome, we will assess the effect of the intervention on FMI at age 5 years. The concept of this multiple-phase trial is that the outcomes of interest in a particular phase result from the intervention administered in the same phase, but is also mediated by the outcomes observed in the previous phase(s). For example, a reduction in obesity risks during pregnancy caused by the intervention in this phase will impact birth weight and the child weight/BMI observed in the next phase. Therefore, at the end of the study, we will measure an 'overall' effect of the interventions over the four phases on the final outcomes, but also, could assess how the association between the final outcomes and the interventions is mediated by the phase-specific outcomes (see figure 3 ). Other secondary anthropometric outcomes to be assessed at 5 years of age include OWO, BMI and centiles and adiposity (skin-fold thickness, arm circumference). We will also assess the effect of the intervention on glucose metabolism, blood pressure and cognitive outcomes. Mixed models with random intercept/slope effects and fixed effects (for the intervention) will be used to estimate the intervention effect. Due to possible heterogeneity of effects for key outcomes according to the time of initiation of the intervention (eg, preconception vs pregnancy), we will conduct a subgroup analysis stratifying by this variable, testing for heterogeneity. The distribution of modifiable risk factors for childhood obesity, poor cardiometabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes at baseline and their changes over time will be assessed according to the study group.",

            "text": "Trial status and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Trial formative research started in April 2017, the pilot trial was initiated in 2018, main trial recruitment began in October 2019 and is expected to conclude early in 2022, and the trial is expected to be completed by 2029. The collective HeLTI initiative provides an unprecedented preconception health platform with the potential to expand to other settings. To maximise the learning and impact of these studies, HeLTI aims to host postgraduate students and training opportunities, and facilitate accelerated managed access to data and biological samples. Our formative work has revealed just how complex both the environments and lives of young urban women in South Africa are. The health implications are further compounded by poorer than anticipated health literacy levels. Among these women, health is not prioritised amidst competing economic and food security concerns, and the daily stress of navigating challenging household (relationships, households with multifamilies) and community circumstances (poverty, crime and exposure to violence). Also, the Soweto environment is becoming more obesogenic with easier access to less healthy fast foods that are affordable and sold on most street corners. This makes the decision to purchase healthier, more expensive foods that are sold further away less appealing. 20 For these reasons, we have opted for a more pragmatic and adaptive trial design, whereby the intervention package can be Open access modified to the circumstances of each participant and can incorporate new learning on how best to engage, support and improve compliance. The strength of this approach is to remain relevant and responsive to the urban poor context, and thereby, increase the likelihood of achieving health behaviour change. The challenge of this adaptive and individually responsive approach is how to capture and analyse the dose effect of intervention elements. To address this challenge, we have setup a sophisticated data management and dashboard system which can monitor key quality assurance, delivery and compliance indicators that are not only useful for trial management, but also assist the intervention and control arm teams. Six months into the main trial the COVID-19 pandemic hit South Africa through a series of waves and lockdown levels. A hard lockdown (level 5) was implemented in South Africa from 26 March to 30 April 2020. Thereafter a level 4 lockdown was implemented until 31 May 2020. Level 3 then lasted until 17 August, when the country moved to level 2 and finally level 1 (September 2021). The recruitment has been severely interrupted particularly between 26 March and 30 July 2020. On resuming community recruitment, additional COVID-19-specific questions were added to the questionnaire, support and surveillance protocols were implemented and a dedicated COVID-19 nurse was appointed. Intervention face-to-face interactions were replaced with virtual face-to-face sessions during more severe lockdowns and micronutrient supplements were delivered to participants' homes. To boost trial recruitment, we launched a revised community drive that included community pop-up stands, and enlisted community leaders aiding recruitment drives. We have also developed a participant retention SOPs. In conclusion, changing the course of the obesity tide globally will require a major concerted effort to examine initiatives across the lifecourse. The preconception period, in particular, represents an exciting and largely untested stage in life to prevent the transgenerational impacts of maternal metabolic and mental health.",
