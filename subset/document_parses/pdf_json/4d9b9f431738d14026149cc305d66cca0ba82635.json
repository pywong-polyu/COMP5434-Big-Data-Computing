Here we map how all mutations to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 affect binding by the antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail and the antibody LY-CoV016. These complete maps uncover a single amino acid mutation that fully escapes the REGN-COV2 cocktail, which consists of two antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, targeting distinct structural epitopes. The maps also identify viral mutations that are selected in a persistently infected patient treated with REGN-COV2 and during in vitro viral escape selections. Finally, the maps reveal that mutations escaping the individual antibodies are already present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. These complete escape maps enable interpretation of the consequences of mutations observed during viral surveillance.",

We recently developed a deep mutational scanning method to map how all mutations to the RBD affect its function and recognition by antiviral antibodies (7, 8) . This method involves creating libraries of RBD mutants, expressing them on the surface of yeast, and using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting and deep sequencing to quantify how each mutation affects RBD folding, ACE2 affinity (measured across a titration series), and antibody binding (fig. S1A). In this study, we used the duplicate mutant libraries described in (7) , which consist of barcoded RBD variants that cover 3804 of the 3819 possible amino acid mutations. Our libraries were made in the genetic background of the RBD from the early isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, which still represents the most common RBD sequence, although several mutants are currently increasing in frequency (9, 10) . We mapped how the 2034 mutations that do not strongly disrupt RBD folding and ACE binding (7) affected binding by recombinant forms of the two antibodies in Regeneron's REGN-COV2 cocktail (REGN10933 and REGN10987) (11, 12) and Eli Lilly's LY-CoV016 antibody (also known as CB6 or JS016) (13) (fig.

REGN10933 and REGN10987 are escaped by largely nonoverlapping sets of mutations in the RBD's receptor binding motif (Fig. 1A) , consistent with structural work showing that these antibodies target distinct epitopes in this motif (11) . But unexpectedly, one mutation [Glu 406 \u2192 Trp (E406W)] strongly escapes the cocktail of both antibodies (Fig. 1A) . The escape map for LY-CoV016 also reveals escape mutations at a number of different sites in the RBD (Fig. 1B) . Although some escape mutations impair the RBD's ability to bind ACE2 or be expressed in properly folded form, many come at little or no cost to these functional properties, according to prior deep mutational scanning measurements using yeast-displayed RBD (7) (color gradient in Fig. 1 , A and B, indicates loss of ACE2 affinity and in fig. S2 indicates decrease in RBD expression).",

As expected from the maps for the REGN-COV2 antibodies, a mutation at site 486 escaped neutralization only by REGN10933, whereas mutations at sites 439 and 444 escaped neutralization only by REGN10987-and so none of these mutations escaped the cocktail. But E406W escaped both individual REGN-COV2 antibodies and thus also strongly escaped the cocktail. Structural analyses and viral-escape selections led Regeneron to posit that no single amino acid mutation could escape both antibodies in the cocktail (11, 12) , but our complete maps identify E406W as a cocktail escape mutation. E406W affects the REGN-COV2 antibodies in a relatively specific way and does not grossly perturb the function of the RBD, given that it only mildly reduces neutralization by LY-CoV016 (Fig. 1C ) and the titers of spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles ( fig. S3F ).",

That work identified five escape mutations from REGN10933, two from REGN10987, and none from the cocktail ( Fig. 2A ). All seven cell culture-selected mutations were prominent in our escape maps while also being accessible by just a single-nucleotide change to the wild-type codon in the Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD sequence ( Fig. 2B ), demonstrating concordance between the escape maps and viral evolution under antibody pressure in cell culture. Notably, E406W is not accessible by a singlenucleotide change, which may explain why it was not identified by the Regeneron cocktail selections despite being relatively well tolerated for RBD folding and ACE2 affinity.",

The late administration of the treatment allowed ample time for the patient's viral population to accumulate genetic diversity, some of which could have been driven by immune pressure, because the patient mounted a weak autologous neutralizing antibody response before treatment (16) . Administration of REGN-COV2 was followed by rapid changes in the frequencies of five amino acid mutations in the RBD ( Fig. 2C and fig. S4 ). Our escape maps showed that three of these mutations escaped REGN10933 and that one escaped REGN10987 (Fig. 2B) . Notably, the mutations Sites of strong escape (purple underlines) are shown in logo plots at right. The height of each letter is proportional to how strongly that amino acid mutation mediates escape, with a per-mutation \"escape fraction\" of 1 corresponding to complete escape. The y-axis scale is different for each row, so, for instance, E406W escapes all REGN antibodies but is most visible for the cocktail as it is swamped out by other sites of escape for the individual antibodies. See https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_clinical_Abs/ for zoomable versions. Letters are colored according to how mutations affect the RBD's affinity for ACE2 as measured via yeast display (7) For each antibody or antibody combination, the escape score for each mutation is plotted versus its frequency among the 317,866 high-quality human-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences on GISAID (26) as of 11 January 2021. Escape mutations with notable GISAID frequencies are labeled. The REGN-COV2 cocktail escape mutation E406W requires multiple nucleotide changes from the Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD sequence and is not observed among sequences in GISAID. Other mutations to residue E406 (E406Q and E406D) are observed with low frequency counts, but neither of these mutant amino acids is a single-nucleotide mutation away from W either.",

This pattern has been observed in the adaptive within-host evolution of other viruses (17, 18) and can arise from genetic hitchhiking and competition among viral lineages. Both these forces appear to be at play in the persistently infected patient (Fig.  2C and fig.

Three of the four escape mutations in the REGN-COV2-treated patient were not identified in Regeneron's viral cell culture selections (Fig. 2B) , illustrating an advantage of complete maps.

N439K is prevalent in Europe, where it has constituted a large percentage of sequences from regions including Scotland and Ireland (22, 25) .

As might be expected, escape mutations generally occur in the antibody-RBD interface. However, structures alone are insufficient to predict which mutations mediate escape. For example, LY-CoV016 uses both its heavy and light chains to bind a wide epitope overlapping the ACE2-binding surface, but escape is dominated by mutations at RBD residues that contact the heavy-chain complementarity-determining regions ( Fig. 4A  and fig. S6 , E to G). In contrast, escape from REGN10933 and REGN10987 mostly occurs at RBD residues that pack at the antibody heavyand light-chain interface ( Fig. 4A and fig. S6 , A to D). The E406W mutation that escapes the REGN-COV2 cocktail occurs at a residue not in contact with either antibody (Fig. 4, A and B) . Although E406 is in closer structural proximity to LY-CoV016 ( Fig. 4B and fig. S6H ), the E406W mutation has a much smaller impact on this antibody (Fig. 1, B and C) , suggesting a long-range structural mechanism specific to the REGN-COV2 antibodies ( fig. S6I ). Taken together, mutations at RBD residues that contact antibody do not always mediate escape, and several prominent escape mutations occur at residues not in contact with antibody ( Fig. 4B and fig.

These maps demonstrate that prior characterization of escape mutations was incomplete, having identified neither a single amino acid mutation that escapes both antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail nor most mutations that arose in a persistently infected patient treated with the cocktail. Of course, our maps still do not answer the most pressing question: Will SARS-CoV-2 evolve widespread resistance to these antibodies? But certainly, it is concerning that so many escape mutations impose little cost on RBD folding or receptor affinity and that some are already present at low levels among circulating viruses. Ultimately, it will be necessary to wait and see what mutations spread as SARS-CoV-2 circulates in the human population. Our work will help with the \"seeing,\" by enabling immediate interpretation of the effects of the mutations cataloged by viral genomic surveillance.",

The dotted blue line at 1 indicates WTlike neutralization, and values >1 indicate increased neutralization resistance. Point colors indicate whether escape was expected at that site from the maps. Point shapes indicate that the fold change is censored (an upper or lower limit) owing to the IC 50 being outside the dilution series used.
