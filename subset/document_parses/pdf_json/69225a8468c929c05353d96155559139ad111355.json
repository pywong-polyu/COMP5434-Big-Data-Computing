The study obtained 2,695 valid answers. -Rates of possible anxiety, possible depression and bad sleep quality were 56.5%, 46.1% and 49.2%, respectively.

A cut-off of 9 points for each symptom was considered for tagging the responder as a bearer of those conditions. For the last questionnaire, researchers used a modified version of Brazilian validated translation (23) of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index -PSQI (24) , what was called mPSQI. This instrument is designed for the triage of people with sleep of bad quality, regardless of etiology. The PSQI score is calculated by the sum of components (subset of questions), each receiving a determined weight. For most authors, a cut-off score of 5 points is adequate for the identification of bad sleepers (25) .",

Secondly, and in particular regarding anxiety rate, studies that used the DASS-21 scale also assessed stress levels. Some of the stress questions are of resemblance with anxiety questions of the HAD scale -for instance: \"I found it hard to wind down\" is accounted for stress in DASS-21, and \"I feel tense or 'wound up'\" is accounted for anxiety in HAD. This raises a possibility that, in studies based on the DASS-21, anxiety rates were lower due to a split caused by the stress group. Thirdly, none of those studies included were from Latin-American countries. Another Brazilian study (32) , with 45,161 participants, intended to evaluate sadness/depression, anxiety/nervousness and sleep problems. Data was collected online between April 24 th and May 24 th , 2020, a time window very much similar to ours.

A Brazilian, multicenter survey of 2014 (33), was conducted with data from 1,857 participants who were assessed when using primary healthcare, from four Brazilian cities. This study also used the HAD scale as instrument to access mental disorders. Anxiety rates oscillated from 35.4% to 43%, and depression rates ranged between 21.4% and 31%. In our survey, anxiety and depression rates (see Tables 2a-d) are higher. Another study (34) estimated, by analysis of 12,000 people that responded to the 2011 National Health and Wellness Survey in Brazil, the prevalence of Major Depression to be 10.2%, again much lower than what we found.",

Also, of note, people that preferred to exercise early were less depressed. That could be due a bidirectional relationship, as depression is commonly linked with morning fatigue and unwillingness to engage in energetic activities (37).",

Smokers had greater incidence of bad sleepy quality, especially those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day. This is expected, as smoking is known to be disruptive to good sleep (38).",

Some groups were more prone to those disturbances, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, unemployed, caregivers, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19, sedentary or those who engaged less in physical activity, and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities. More studies, especially longitudinal, could provide more information on if the prevalence of mental and sleep issues remains constant during the pandemic crisis or suffer changes related to different aspects, like adaptation to the situation, social restriction relaxation and improved treatments or vaccines.
