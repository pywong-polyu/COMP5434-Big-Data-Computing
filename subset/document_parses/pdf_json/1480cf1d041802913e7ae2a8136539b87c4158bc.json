            "text": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been concern about novel SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that are more transmissible. During the third quarter of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01 (a.k.a. 501Y.V1; B.1.1.7) lineage carrying the N501Y mutation emerged and took hold in the UK, followed by several European countries. The N501Y mutation is also shared with other VOCs first identified in South Africa (501Y.V2; B.1.351) (Tegally et al., 2020) and Brazil (501Y.V3; P.1) (Faria et al., 2021) , but B.1.1.7 has several additional 'signature' mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, including deletions at 69-70 and 144, as well as mutations A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H (Rambaut et al., 2020a) . The earliest sequence of B.1.1.7 was collected on September 20, 2020 in England (GISAID EPI_ISL_601443), but it has since spread rapidly across the UK, becoming the dominant lineage within just a few months (Chand et al., 2020; Cyranoski, 2021; ECDC, 2021; Rambaut et al., 2020a) . This lineage is more transmissible, with a growth rate that has been estimated to be 40-70% higher than other SARS-CoV-2 lineages in multiple countries, which is hypothesized to be partly due to the N501Y mutation increasing receptor binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 (Volz et al., 2021) . While initially thought to have comparable clinical outcomes to other SARS-CoV-2 variants, preliminary reports indicate that infection with B.1.1.7 may lead to ~30% higher mortality rates (Iacobucci, 2021) . Though the exact origin of the B.1.1.7 variant is unclear, it was only through the proactive and ongoing large scale SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program in the U.K. facilitated the initial detection after investigators in South Africa had observed an association between N501Y and increased transmission (Chand et al., 2020) .",

Retrospective analyses from the U.K. show that the proportion of B.1.1.7 in SGTF samples rose from 3% during the week of October 12, 2020 to more than 90% during the week of November 30, 2020.

Surveillance programs typically select a subset of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests for sequencing, and therefore identifying SGTF samples for sequencing provides a built-in prioritization method to enrich for detection of B.1.1.7. In this study we describe the introduction and early spread of B.1.1.7 in the U.S., based on historical SGTF rates in RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and a nationwide SGTF viral sequencing program. We find that B.1.1.7 arrived in the U.S. towards the end of November, 2020 and as of January, 2021 it has since spread to at least 30 U.S. states. Importantly, we find that the B.1.1.7 variant is 35-45% more transmissible across the country, doubling in relative frequency about every week and a half. These findings show that B.1.1.7 will likely become the dominant variant in many U.S. states by March, 2021, leading to further surges of COVID-19 in the country, unless urgent mitigation efforts are immediately implemented.",

The Helix \u00ae COVID-19 Test calls positive samples when at least two of three targets (N, Orf1ab, and S) are detected using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath\u2122 assay. We only considered samples to be SGTF if they were positive for both N and Orf1ab, and negative for S. We restricted our analyses to positive samples with Cq<27 for the N gene based on previous reports that single target failures were more frequent at higher Cq (Bal et al., 2020; Kara Steel And, 2021) . We began to observe consistent, low frequency SGTF in early October 2020, with 0.2% of daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the week of October 18, 2020, followed by a steady increase (Supplemental Figure S1 ). We found that during the month of January 2021, the nationwide proportion of SGTF increased from an average of 0.8% in the first week to 4.2% in the last week (Supplemental Figure S1 ). As described in more detail below, the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases reached 3.6% in the U.S. by the last week of January, 2021 ( Figure 1B, C) . To investigate regional differences across the U.S., we examined the nationwide distribution of SGTF. By grouping our samples based on patient state of residence, we observed SGTF in 22 out of 53 U.S. States and territories during January 2021, several of which had SGTF frequencies consistently above 1% (Supplemental Figure S1 ). When restricting our analysis to assess U.S. states with more than 500 positive tests in January 2021, we observed that the fraction of SGTF varies significantly across the nation (Supplemental Figure S1) . A caveat to this analysis is that our testing footprint does not evenly cover the U.S. (Figure 1A) , hence SGTF may currently be undetected in several states.",

Given the lag of sequencing, we used the average proportion of B.1.1.7 in all sequenced SGTF cases from January 13 to January 18 to estimate the proportion of the variant out of total tests from January 18 to January 20. We found that the proportion of B.1.1.7 in our SGTF samples grew to a nationwide average of ~90% in the middle of January, 2021, although with substantial variance across the country, ranging from ~95% in California to ~70% in Florida (Supplemental Figure S2 ).",

To investigate the growth rate of B.1.1.7 in the U.S. compared to non-B.1.1.7 lineages, we fitted a logistic growth model to our rolling 5-day average of estimated B.1.1.7 cases. We determined that B.1.1.7 has a logistic growth rate of 0.07 in the U.S. (Figure 1C) , which translates to an increased transmissibility of 35-46% in the U.S., with rates in California of 29-37% and 38-49% in Florida ( Figure 1C ). Using a serial interval of 5 -6.5 days (Volz et al., 2021) , we estimated the doubling time of B.1.1.7 to be 9.8 days in the U.S., 12.2 days in California, and 9.1 days in Florida ( Figure 1C ).",

These findings are consistent with those from other countries (Volz et al., 2021) , and given the current trajectory of B.1.1.7 in the U.S., it is almost certainly destined to become the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage by March, 2021 across many U.S. states, which is consistent with modeling analyses from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Galloway et al., 2021) . However, obtaining accurate estimates of the prevalence of B.1.1.7 across the country is complicated by uneven and biased sampling, combined with a lack of a national SARS-CoV-2 genomics surveillance program, like those implemented in the U.K., Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, among other places. In the current study, we obtain relatively robust estimates from California and Florida, but our analyses outside these places are limited.",

These findings are consistent with community transmission following several of these introductions, including spread across U.S. states However, unresolved polytomies of sequences belonging to different regions nationally and internationally at several basal nodes in our phylogenies, mean that we are unable to fully resolve directionality and likely origins for the U.S. sequences (Grubaugh et al., 2019a) .

These findings suggest that significant community transmission of the B.1.1.7 variant is already ongoing across the U.S., which is likely fueled by its increased growth rate and transmissibility of B.1.1.7. We found the growth rates in California (~6% / day) to be slightly lower than those in Florida (~8% / day). This difference may be due to differences in statewide or regional social distancing protocols or mobility patterns, population density, biases in sampling and/or demographics, or competition from other SARS-CoV-2 variants, like the B.1.429 variant recently described in California (CDPH, 2021). The nationwide growth rate of ~7% / day is a little lower than those observed in Portugal (10% / day (Borges, 2021) ), Denmark (10.3% / day (Statens Serums Institute)) and the United Kingdom (10.4% / day (Davies et al., 2020) ). The reason for the slightly lower growth rate of B.1.1.7 in the U.S. compared to European countries require further investigation, but may be down to the relative sparsity of the current dataset, the lack of strong mitigation efforts in this country, or competition from other more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

This will allow the simple SGTF testing anomaly to be used to monitor the spread of B.1.1.7 in the U.S. in the absence of nationwide genomic surveillance. While B.1.1.7 is of current interest given the concerns regarding increased transmission dynamics, the results here reinforce the need for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance to monitor the dynamics of B.1.1.7 and other emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including those yet to be discovered. Because laboratories in the U.S. are only sequencing a small subset of SARS-CoV-2 samples, the true sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in this country is still unknown. The more established surveillance programs in other countries have provided important warnings about variants of concern that can impact the U.S., with B.1.1.7 representing only one variant that demonstrates the capacity for exponential growth. As viral surveillance efforts increase in the U.S., we will no doubt find additional SARS-CoV-2 variants, some at high prevalence and others with increased fitness. Only with consistent, unbiased sequencing at scale that includes all geographic and demographic populations including those often underrepresented, together with continued international scientific collaborations and open data sharing, will we be able to accurately assess and follow new variants that emerge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 are still at relatively low frequency in the U.S., there is still time to implement the necessary surveillance programs and mitigation efforts in the weeks to come. Unless decisive and immediate public health action is taken, the increased transmission rate of these lineages and resultant higher effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 will likely have devastating consequences to COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in the U.S. in a few months, if decisive action is not immediately taken.",

This algorithm utilized a kmer reference database to match kmers from the sequencing read to kmers from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NCBI Accession NC_045512.2). To create the kmer reference list, the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was split into 32 nucleotide (nt) kmers, and any kmers containing crossreactivity were removed. To measure cross-reactivity, the kmer reference list incorporated the NCBI database of 100,000 genomes for human and animal pathogens in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 reference. Bat and pangolin viruses were excluded because of their similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Each of the reference kmers was labeled with a corresponding amplicon from either SARS-CoV-2 or external controls. If an amplicon contained at least 150 matches to SARS-CoV-2 reference kmers, the amplicon was considered detected.

The proportion of B.1.1.7 samples was estimated using: (Observed B.1.1.7 sequences/Sequenced SGTF samples) * (Positive tests with SGTF/Total positive tests). Due to the lag in sequencing, the average proportion of B.1.1.7 sequences in sequenced samples with SGTF from the last five days (January 13-18) was used to infer the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases in total positive tests for the January 19-30 time period between. The black line shows the 5-day rolling average of the estimated proportion of B.1.1.7 in total positives.
