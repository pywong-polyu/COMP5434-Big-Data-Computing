Numerous findings suggest that JNK3 is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, so the inhibition of JNK3 may be a potential therapeutic intervention. The identification of novel compounds with promising pharmacological properties still represents a challenge. Fluorescence thermal shift screening of a chemically diversified lead-like scaffold library of 2024 pure compounds led to the initial identification of seven JNK3 binding hits, which were classified into four scaffold groups according to their chemical structures. Native mass spectrometry validated the interaction of 4 out of the 7 hits with JNK3. Binding geometries and interactions of the top 2 hits were evaluated by docking into a JNK3 crystal structure. Hit 5 had a K d of 21 \u03bcM with JNK3 suggested scaffold 5-(phenylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxamide as a novel and selective JNK3 binder. Figure 1. Known JNK3 ligands.",

The temperature at which 50% of the protein has denatured is designated as the melting temperature (T m ). A fluorescence probe that binds to protein hydrophobic surfaces is used to monitor protein unfolding and give a thermal melting curve. In this manner, the changes in T m are indicative of the ligand binding affinity. Due to the broad scale of applicability and combination with high throughput screening (HTS) techniques, the HTS\u2212FTS assay has gained widespread popularity 19\u221222 in the study of protein\u2212ligand interaction, protein\u2212 DNA interaction, protein stability investigation, and membrane protein crystallography.",

As not all proteins are amenable to FTS measurements, we first subjected purified JNK3 to FTS with the positive controls ATP and SP600125 35 to evaluate the performance of the FTS assay. Both ATP and SP600125 dramatically increased the T m of JNK3 protein. The maximum T m shift induced by 500 \u03bcM ATP and SP600125 was about 4.6 and 12.7\u00b0C, respectively, at a protein concentration of 2 \u03bcM. More interestingly, the involvement of cofactor Mg 2+ significantly increased the temperature shift of ATP, indicating that Mg 2+ is favorable for thermally stabilizing the transient complex conformation (Figure 2 ). We also measured the FTS denaturation profile at gradient concentrations of ATP and SP600125, respectively, and ensured they elicited a dose\u2212 response ( Figure 2 ). Taken together, these findings established the assay's tractability to perform thermal unfolding experiments to identify potential ligands for JNK3.",

As we aim to explore ligands possessing considerable binding potency, the \u0394T m50 value induced by native ligand ATP was set as the cutoff value (2.73\u00b0C). Eventually, seven compounds containing four new scaffolds ( Figure 3 ) met the above selection criterion with the \u0394T m50 values ranging from 2.99 to 4.77\u00b0C ( Figure 4A ). The JNK selective inhibitor SP600125 displayed the highest temperature shift of 7.86\u00b0C. It is also noted that when comparing the melting curve of SP600125 with all seven hit compounds, a steeper transition was shown for compound 1 by a greater \u0394T m10 value than that of \u0394T m50 ( Figure 4B ).

When one compares the chemical structures in this group, it is suggested that the 2-morpholinomethyl and 5-(thiophen-2-yl) substitutions contribute more to binding potency while the substitution on position 6 counts little whether it is hydrogen or an alkyl group. The 5-(phenylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4carboxamide (scaffold II, compound 5) also showed excellent binding potency with a \u0394T m50 value of 3.38\u00b0C. Indeed, there were two more compounds with this scaffold ranked in the top 31 (\u0394T m50 \u2265 1\u00b0C); however, due to their different substituent groups on the carboxamide nitrogen, the potencies were weaker than ATP and subsequently not selected here. The last two scaffold groups showed nearly equivalent potency with \u0394T m50 values of 3.00 and 2.99\u00b0C, respectively. Scaffold III (compound 6) has a triazolmethypiperidine moiety, and scaffold IV (compound 7) is a piperidinecarboxamide derivative. Although each scaffold has at least five different candidate compounds in the screening library, all of the other compounds induced only a slight T m shift change. Thus, scaffolds III and IV probably may not be a priority for future lead optimization chemistry programs. In summary, the FTS assay result suggested that scaffold I and scaffold II are promising starting points for further medicinal chemistry campaigns to explore novel JNK inhibitors.",

The percentages of the ligand-bound complex within the sample were used to plot a dissociation curve from which a K d of 21.0 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcM was calculated ( Figure 5B ). Compound 2 (scaffold I) also showed a moderate binding affinity to JNK3 with 68.6% protein occupation with 100 \u03bcM ligand addition. Another native MS screening has been conducted for compounds 1\u22127 against protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), which is known to control the induction of the JNK pathway. 36 No binding was observed, indicating hits 2 and 5 may target the JNK level directly ( Figure S2 ).",

First of all, the docking quality was evaluated by comparison of the docked pose and experimental pose of SP600125 in the JNK3 crystal structure. The analysis of the best predicted conformation of SP600125 ( Figure 6 ) showed the ligand made hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Glu147 (3.4 \u00c5) and the main chain nitrogen of Met149 (3.1 \u00c5), which was in accordance with the experimental data from the PDB structure (2.8 \u00c5 each). The calculated binding energy of SP600125 was the lowest (\u22129.2 kcal/mol) among all hit compounds, which is in good accordance with the experimental data of the FTS assay. Furthermore, the alignment of the best-docked conformation with the crystal conformation yielded a rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.8 \u00c5, indicating the docking simulation was able to reproduce the X-ray structure.",
