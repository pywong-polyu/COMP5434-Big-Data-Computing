            "text": "Re-opening of communities in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has ignited new waves of infections in many places around the world. Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. This study evaluates several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, isopropanol precipitation is shown to provide an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCRs is evaluated without an RNA extraction step. A simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition is validated using contrived swab samples. Third, an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR is described that permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples with a limit of detection of approximately 50 RNA copies per reaction. Quantification cycle (Cq) values for purified RNA from 30 known positive clinical samples showed a strong correlation (r 2 = 0.98) between this homemade master mix and commercial Taq-Path master mix. Lastly, end-point fluorescence imaging is found to provide an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler. Adoption of these simple, opensource methods has the potential to reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing.

            "text": "Many current RT-PCR protocols for COVID-19 detection, including the CDC-approved test, employ an RNA extraction step to isolate and concentrate viral RNA from patient nasopharyngeal swabs prior to amplification. Typically, this involves the use of a column-based extraction kit such as the Qiagen QIAmp Viral RNA kit or a magnetic bead-based method such as the Roche MagNA Pure kit [3] . Reliance on these commercial kits created supply shortages that hindered testing [4] . Traditional laboratory techniques for RNA purification may offer less expensive alternatives to commercial kits. Trizol extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation provides a high yield of purified RNA [5], however, it requires extensive labor, is difficult to scale to high-throughput, and involves hazardous materials. Simpler isopropanol precipitation methods, in which patient swab samples are first mixed with commercial or homemade lysis solutions, have been reported to give Ct values comparable to those obtained using commercial RNA purification kits [6] [7] [8] .",

While this affords a substantial reduction in the time and expense of testing, the absence of a purification step means that RNA is not concentrated, limiting the sensitivity of detection. Moreover, commonly used swab collection solutions may inhibit RT-PCR. Indeed, while several groups have demonstrated RNA amplification by direct addition of swab samples in the widely used viral transport medium (VTM), inhibition of RT-PCR by VTM typically leads to a significant delay in amplification [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

Some RT-PCR-compatible commercial lysis solutions have also been used to detect SARS-CoV-2 by direct addition [21] [22] [23] , however the high cost of these products may preclude widespread use. An ideal swab collection solution would be widely available or cheaply made in any laboratory, allow for sensitive, direct detection of patient swabs, and not require specialized storage conditions. Proposed swab collection solutions include saline [18] , PBS [14], TE [24], or simply distilled water [15, 18] . Also, addition of proteinase K (PK) to UTM or saline was reported to improve detection of viral RNA by direct addition [19, 25] .",

As an alternative approach, direct addition of small amounts of swab sample in UTM permits SARS-CoV-2 detection, consistent with previous reports, however inhibition of the reaction by UTM limits the amount of sample that can be added, and hence the detection sensitivity. A simple alternative swab collection solution-proteinase K (PK) in water-permits sensitive detection of RNA from in vitro-cultured SARS-CoV-2 in contrived swab samples containing human nasal mucus.

Researchers and clinicians aiming to implement RT-PCR testing for COVID- 19 have faced a shortage of the necessary reagents to perform tests in addition to the long homemade Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (\"BEARmix\"), permits the detection of as few as tens of RNAs per reaction and can be produced from relatively inexpensive raw materials.

Isopropanol precipitation was next evaluated using the same NP swab samples in universal transport medium (UTM) described in a previous publication [26, 36] . For safety, the samples were first inactivated in one of two ways: Samples Pos1-Pos2 and Neg1-Neg2 were mixed with 1 volume of 2x DNA/RNA Shield, while the remaining samples (Neg3-Neg12 and Pos3-Pos12) were treated with 0.4 mg/mL proteinase K for 30 min at 37\u02daC, heated at 95\u02daC for 5 min, and then incubated at 75\u02daC for 30 min. RNA was then purified using either the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit or isopropanol precipitation (see Materials and methods; note that due to supply shortages, the QIAmp Viral RNA extraction kit was not available when these experiments were performed). Purified RNA was then assayed using CDC-approved Thermo Fisher TaqPath master mix and N1, N2 and RNase P probe sets. Out of 12 known positive samples, 11 showed amplification using isopropanol-precipitated RNA, while only 9 showed amplification using Qiagen RNeasy-purified RNA ( [36] ). The relatively poor performance of the Qiagen RNeasy kit is consistent with a previous report showing that this kit gives higher Cq values than the CDC-recommended QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit [17] . None of the negative samples showed amplification of viral RNA using either extraction method, while all positive and negative samples (with the exception of sample Pos5 for the RNeasy kit) showed amplification using the human RNase P positive control probe set ( Fig 1B  and 1C ).",

To overcome this problem, companies have generated \"hot-start\" versions of Taq polymerase, typically by including a proprietary monoclonal antibody or aptamer in the reaction, which inhibits the polymerase at low temperatures but is denatured at high temperature [39] [40] [41] . Because these approaches are expensive or patent-protected, an off-patent method was evaluated to convert Taq polymerase to a hot-start version using formaldehyde fixation [42] [43] [44] . Treatment with formaldehyde produces crosslinks within the enzyme that inhibit its activity, while incubation at 95\u02daC during the PCR cycle reverses the crosslinks to restore enzymatic activity. Hot-start Taq polymerase prepared in this way was compared with non-crosslinked Taq polymerase in reactions with N gene RNA and the N1 primer/probe set. Reactions were incubated either on ice or at room temperature for various lengths of time after primer addition. Reactions containing unmodified Taq polymerase showed substantially reduced amplification after a 10-minute incubation at room temperature, and amplification formaldehyde-crosslinked hot-start Taq polymerase (red). Linear fit for non-hot-start BEARmix: Cq = 39.9-3.489x (amplification factor 1.93), where x is the logarithm with base 10 of the number of RNAs per reaction. Linear fit for hot-start BEARmix: Cq = 48.8-4.15x (amplification factor = 1.74). Bottom panel: Fraction of reactions that did not show amplification (failure rate) for each RNA concentration. N = 24 reactions for 10 to 500 copies of RNA, N = 8 reactions for 1000 to 106 copies. (B) Homemade hot-start Taq polymerase permits reaction setup at room temperature. BEARmix reactions were set up using unmodified and hot-start (crosslinked) Taq polymerase with 20 molecules of N gene RNA per reaction. Reactions were performed in a qPCR thermocycler after incubation for 60 min either on ice or at room temperature. In contrast to regular Taq polymerase, amplification by hot-start Taq polymerase is not inhibited by incubating reactions for 60 min at room temperature prior to running the RT-qPCR cycle.",

In contrast, reactions containing hot-start Taq polymerase showed amplification even after a 1-hour incubation at room temperature (Fig 4B, bottom row) . However, amplification of a given quantity of RNA with hot-start Taq polymerase occurred at a later cycle than with regular Taq polymerase (Fig 4A and 4B) . This was the case across a wide range of input RNA concentrations (Fig 4A) , which may reflect incomplete reactivation of the enzyme by heating at 95\u02daC. Consistent with this interpretation, the amplification efficiency, as judged by the slope of the Cq vs. RNA concentration curve, was lower for hot-start Taq than for regular Taq (amplification factor of 1.74 for hot-start Taq versus 1.93 for unmodified Taq). Increasing the time of the 95\u02daC uncrosslinking step to 15 or 20 minutes led to earlier amplification, however amplification with crosslinked Taq was still delayed relative to uncrosslinked Taq (S7 Fig). Thus, formaldehyde crosslinking of Taq permits reaction setup at room temperature, albeit with reduced amplification efficiency.",

Amplification was not observed with either N1 or N2 for samples Pos3 and Pos4, which previously had the highest Cq values with TaqPath master mix. None of the 12 negative samples showed amplification with N1 or N2, while all positive and negative samples showed amplification with the RNase P control probe (mean Cq of 28.3, range 25.4-31.0). Direct addition of 0.5 \u03bcL of each swab sample to 10 \u03bcL BEARmix reactions gave amplification in at least one of two replicates for 10/12 positive samples and 0/12 negative samples ( Fig 5B) . However, amplification failed for at least one replicate in three positive samples, while samples Pos3 and Pos4 failed to show amplification in either replicate. Taken together, these results show that RT-qPCR with BEARmix can detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, either using purified RNA or by direct addition of swab samples, albeit with somewhat lower sensitivity than commercial TaqPath master mix. It is conceivable that sample degradation contributed to the observed reduction in sensitivity in this experiment, as RNA samples were frozen after being assayed with TaqPath, stored at -80\u02daC for 1 week, and thawed for testing with BEARmix.",

As expected, Cq values were higher for direct addition of contrived swab samples than for purified, concentrated RNA.

While RNA was concentrated between 2-fold and 8-fold in the experiments described above, greater fold concentration could likely be achieved by increasing the amount of input swab sample or decreasing the volume in which the pellet is redissolved. Although recovery yields from isopropanol precipitation were comparable to the QIAamp Viral kit for purified RNA (Fig 1A) , isopropanol precipitation gave higher Cq values than the QIAamp kit when tested using NP swab samples in 1x PBS + 1x DNA/RNA Shield (Fig 5C and 5D ). Another drawback of this method is that aspiration of supernatants from individual tubes is time consuming and low-throughput compared to platebased methods (although less time consuming in practice than commercial spin column-based methods). It is possible that precipitating samples in 96-well plates and removing the supernatant using a multi-well aspirator might allow for a greater number of samples to be processed in parallel. Despite these disadvantages, isopropanol precipitation permitted the detection of viral RNA in the majority of positive samples tested (Figs 1C and 5C) , establishing it as a possible contingency option if commercial kits are unavailable or unaffordable.",

Consistent with previous studies, the above results show that it is possible to detect virus by adding a small volume of heat-inactivated swab sample in UTM to an RT-qPCR (Fig 2) . Incubation of swab samples with proteinase K prior to heat-inactivation yielded slightly lower Cq values for detection (Fig 2A) . Interestingly, this beneficial effect of PK treatment was not observed for cultured virus (compare Figs 2A and 3B) , perhaps reflecting degradation by PK of RNases or some other inhibitory protein component that is present in human fluids but not in cell culture supernatant. Unfortunately, inhibition of RT-qPCR by the commonly used swab collection solutions UTM and V-C-M limits the amount of sample that can be added to the reaction, and hence the sensitivity of detection (Figs 2C and 6) . The above results suggest that direct addition would be facilitated by collecting swabs in either a low-salt buffer or water containing proteinase K. Strikingly, direct addition of heat-inactivated virus in low-salt buffer or water gave Cq values close to those expected based on the total RNA copy number, indicating that RT-qPCR amplification is approximately as efficient with heat- Fig 1B and 1C . Shown is a 2-channel overlay in which the ROX control dye in TaqPath master mix appears in the rhodamine channel (red) and dequenched FAM product from the TaqMan probe appears in the fluorescein (cyan) channel. An N gene RNA positive control is in the lower right-hand corner. Positive and negative samples are clearly distinguishable based on fluorescence in the FAM channel. Note that leaving empty spaces between samples was an arbitrary choice. B) BioRad Chemidoc fluorescence image of the qPCR plate used for the IPA precipitation and direct addition reactions in Fig 1B, 1C and 2B. Positive and negative samples distinguishable by qPCR are also distinguishable by endpoint fluorescence imaging. Red, rhodamine (0.5 s exposure). Cyan, fluorescein (0.05 s exposure). Scale is set from 0 to 55000 counts for each channel. C) Endpoint detection using the N2 probe set and BEARmix. Reactions were set up in alternating tubes with water (negative control) or in vitro-transcribed N gene RNA at 100 or 1000 copies per reaction.

This method is also safe to use, as the virus can be heat-inactivated without opening the tube (S3 Fig) . Samples were heat-inactivated for 30 min in the present study to comply with biosafety regulations, and it is possible that shorter periods of time would be efficacious, however it is critical to inactivate PK completely to avoid inhibition of RT-qPCR. Even with improved collection buffers, there is of course a limit to the volume of sample that can be added per reaction, and direct addition is thus less sensitive than purification methods that concentrate RNA.

The results of this study show that \"BEARmix\", a simple laboratory-derived master mix, is capable of detecting tens of RNA molecules per reaction. BEARmix is made using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase, which are easy to purify with high yield in any laboratory equipped for protein biochemistry. A hot-start version of BEARmix can be made by formaldehyde crosslinking Taq polymerase, however this comes with the drawback of less efficient amplification (Fig 4A and 4B and S7 Fig) . BEARmix successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a majority of NP swab samples, albeit with generally higher Cq values than commercial TaqPath master mix (Fig 5) . Validating BEARmix for clinical diagnostics would of course require more extensive side-by-side comparison of BEARmix and a commercial master mix in an actual testing center, and it is likely that the relative performance of BEARmix and other master mixes may differ depending on the primer set used [13] . Additionally, it would be interesting to evaluate BEARmix in combination with direct-addition protocols for saliva testing [46, 47] . This basic master mix recipe could be improved in various ways, for instance, by including dUTP and UDG to prevent amplicon contamination, optimizing the conditions for hot-start Taq preparation and reactivation, or testing other public-domain DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase variants [48] .",

Although the laboratory-derived master mix described here is not quite as sensitive or reliable as commercial master mixes, it successfully detected viral RNA in most clinical specimens tested and showed strong quantitative correlation with a commercial mix. Because the use of a non-hot-start Taq polymerase requires that reactions be prepared on ice, this basic recipe could be improved by developing inexpensive methods to produce more reliable hot-start polymerases. Isopropanol precipitation provides a cheap alternative to commercial RNA purification kits, however it requires tedious manual aspiration of RNA pellets and was found to give higher Cq values for clinical samples than a state-of-the-art commercial kit. Direct addition of swab samples bypasses RNA purification entirely, which greatly simplifies the protocol at the cost of reduced sensitivity. Importantly, collection of swabs into a low-salt solution can boost sensitivity by permitting addition of a larger sample volume per reaction.",

This study demonstrates that relatively simple and inexpensive methods can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. While these open-source approaches may not match the exquisite sensitivity of expensive commercial kits, testing centers must consider whether some reduction in sensitivity is worth increased availability of tests in the face of economic and logistical constraints. Continued refinement of open-source diagnostic methods and their adoption by \"pop-up\" testing centers [26, 46, 47] could facilitate expanded testing, both in the current pandemic and in response to novel viruses in the future.",

Curves for individual wells are shown in blue (upper row; non-hot-start BEARmix) or red (lower row; hot-start BEARmix). Means are shown in black. Each column corresponds to a different (average) number of RNA molecules per reaction. Linear background subtraction was performed, using the first 15 cycles to establish the baseline drift.

Top panel: Fluorescence trace for a BEARmix reaction containing 250 N gene RNA molecules, showing a slow upward drift in baseline fluorescence prior to the onset of detectable amplification. Middle panel: Derivative of fluorescence intensity with respect to cycle number, calculated over a sliding window of \u00b13 cycles. Bottom panel: Second derivative of the fluorescence intensity, i.e., derivative of the curve in the middle panel. The second derivative is zero during the initial phase of linear baseline drift and peaked near the onset of detectable amplification. Red vertical line: Cq value, determined as the center of a parabolic fit to the peak of the second derivative curve. (TIF) S7 Fig. Effect of uncrosslinking time on hot-start Taq activity. BEARmix reactions prepared with hot-start Taq (hsTaq) were incubated for 10, 15, or 20 min at 95\u02daC to reverse formaldehyde crosslinks prior to amplification cycles. A 5 min incubation at 95\u02daC was used for regular (non-crosslinked) Taq. Thin curves represent traces for 7 individual reactions, while thick curves represent their average. Longer uncrosslinking times led to earlier amplification, however amplification with hot-start Taq was still delayed relative to unmodified Taq. (TIF) S8 Fig. Purified enzymes.
