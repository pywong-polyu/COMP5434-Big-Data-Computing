It is a key biological messenger playing an important role in various biological processes at the cellular level. Nitric oxide is known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor and is biosynthesized endogenously from semi-essential amino acid, L-argenine, molecular oxygen, and various nitric oxide synthase enzymes [7] . Nitric oxide is anti inflammatory and contributes to nonspecific host defence against bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic infections, hence takes care of infection in the body. Nitric oxide improves ventilation-perfusion ratio in the lung along with relaxation of bronchial tree smooth muscles, hence oxygen uptake is increased and provides relief in bronchial asthma.",

The tip of index finger should rest on the lateral wall of nose. Both middle fingers are put on base of ala of nose. Mouth is closed on both sides, upper lip by ring fingers and lower lip by little fingers. Both eyes are focused in Shambhavi drishti at the Ajna Chakra in between both eyebrows. A constant rhythmic uninterrupted specific frequency sound (mouth closed jaw relaxed) is generated. Spiritual concentration is focused on DwarikaDhish (Deity). During humming command is given that whole body is getting charged and you are full of energy. Visualise and feel the energy. After complete exhalation, hold the breath out; Vahya Kumbhak is enforced and spiritual focus on Lord Shiva (Deity). Keep holding the breath out as long as possible, simultaneously give a command to brain that my whole body is revitalizing. I am relaxed, I am healthy, I am happy and feel the happiness and wellness along with increase vitality. The exercise can be performed sitting comfortably in calm place, eyes closed, relaxed mood with a smile on face, A high pitch sound gives better results. For better result, whole body, mind and soul should be relaxed eyes are gently closed. You should be able to visualise a faint dusty brown light at solar plexes (Ajna Chakra) matching with the colour of pineal gland. After completing the bhramari hold the breath out for maximum comfortable duration. This optimizes the CO 2 level in blood, tissue and cellular level enhancing HCO 3 anion leading to apoptosis and revitalization [12, 13] .",
