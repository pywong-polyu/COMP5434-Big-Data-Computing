            "text": "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy or APECED, is a monogenic inborn error of immunity typically caused by biallelic deleterious variants of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene (Ahonen et al., 1990; Nagamine et al., 1997 , Finnish-German APECED Consortium, 1997 Ferre et al., 2016; Husebye et al., 2018) . Heterozygous variants can also underlie autosomal dominant forms (Oftedal et al., 2015) . Patients with APS-1 have defective central T cell tolerance, leading to the thymic escape of autoreactive T cells and the development, from early childhood, of a broad range of autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against various autoantigens, including endocrine and other tissue antigens and cytokines (Bruserud et al., 2016; Chan and Anderson, 2015; Constantine and Lionakis, 2019; Guo et al., 2018; Orlova et al., 2017; Proekt et al., 2017) . Among these anti-cytokine auto-Abs, neutralizing auto-Abs against IL-17A and IL-17F phenocopy inborn errors of IL-17A/F and underlie chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC; Kisand et al., 2010; Puel et al., 2011; Puel et al., 2010) . High mucosal concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 were also proposed to contribute to CMC (Break et al., 2021) . Virtually all patients with APS-1 produce auto-Abs against type I IFNs, generally against the 13 individual IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and IFN-\u03c9 (Bruserud et al., 2016; Levin, 2006; Meager et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2016; Orlova et al., 2017) . These auto-Abs were long thought to be clinically silent. This was surprising, as these auto-Abs are neutralizing and type I IFNs are potent antiviral molecules, acting through both innate immunity (in particular via their secretion by plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and cell-intrinsic immunity (in most cell types; Duncan et al., 2021; Gresser, 1997; Hoffmann et al., 2015; Jing and Su, 2019; Lazear et al., 2019) . Moreover, the essential role of type I IFNs in fending off viruses in humans was confirmed by the description of patients with autosomal recessive, complete IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency and adverse reactions to measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or yellow fever virus (YFV; YFV-17D) live-attenuated viral vaccine (Duncan et al., 2015; Gothe et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2019) , herpes simplex encephalitis (Bastard et al., 2021b) , or critical COVID-19 pneumonia (Bastard et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b) . Nevertheless, the viral phenotype of these patients is not as broad as initially predicted, as neatly illustrated by two IFNAR1-deficient adults (26 and 38 yr old) who had never been hospitalized for severe viral disease until they were admitted for critical COVID-19 pneumonia (Zhang et al., 2020b) .",

These cases suggested that the auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFN were pathogenic. They further contributed to the discovery that they can also underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in previously healthy individuals without APS-1, accounting for at least 10% of the cases in an international cohort of patients (Bastard et al., 2020) . These auto-Abs were more frequent in men (95%) than in women (5%), and in elderly patients with critical COVID-19, half of the patients with auto-Abs were older than 65 yr (Bastard et al., 2020) . These auto-Abs typically neutralized the 13 individual IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03c9 (or both) but only rarely neutralized IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03ba, and IFN-\u03b5. These findings were replicated in other cohorts (Combes et al., 2021; de Prost et al., 2021; Koning et al., 2021; Troya et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020 Preprint; Wijst et al., 2021 Preprint) . Subjects with inborn errors of type I IFN immunity or neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFN are, thus, at high risk of critical COVID-19 pneumonia, with impaired control of viral replication in the first few days of SARS-CoV-2 infection probably resulting in a secondary phase of pulmonary and systemic hyperinflammation (Zhang et al., 2020a) . Subjects with such auto-Abs are also at high risk of YFV-17D disease, with these antibodies accounting for three of the eight cases studied (Bastard et al., 2021c) . Interestingly, the three patients with YFV-17D disease had auto-Abs that neutralized both the 13 IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03c9, and two also had auto-Abs against IFN-\u03b2, these proportions being higher than those reported for COVID-19 patients. It is unknown whether patients with APS-1 have ever been vaccinated with YFV-17D. Following on from the brief description of three APS-1 patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia, we report here the immunological and clinical features of 22 patients with APS-1 during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

All had undergone vaccination according to the schedules in force in their country of origin, including vaccination with the liveattenuated MMR, with no overt adverse events, between the ages of 1 and 2 yr. None of the patients had a previous history of severe viral infection, and only one had a history of pneumonia. The 22 patients came from 21 unrelated families (two patients were siblings). The patients originated from and lived in England (n = 1), France (n = 5), Italy (n = 1), Russia (n = 11), Scotland (n = 1), Sweden (n = 1), and the United States (n = 2). 21 of the 22 patients had a typical clinical diagnosis of APS-1 (i.e., any two of the classic triad of manifestations: hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and CMC), with confirmation of the presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants of AIRE in the 17 patients tested. One 16-yr-old patient with biallelic loss-of-function AIRE mutations (p.R257X) presented only CMC. 21 of the 22 patients had a history of severe tissue autoimmunity, including hypoparathyroidism (n = 20), adrenal insufficiency (n = 20), hypogonadism (n = 9), enteropathy (n = 9), pernicious anemia (n = 6), alopecia (n = 6), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 3), and vitiligo (n = 3), and all but four had a history of CMC. One patient was on immunosuppressive treatment with the B cell-depleting mAb rituximab and monthly intravenous Ig (IVIg) substitution, another was on treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, a third patient was receiving treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus, and another two patients were on monthly IVIg treatment. Other treatments included endocrine replacement therapy (hydrocortisone and/or fludrocortisone, n = 20; levothyroxine, n = 5) and antifungal prophylaxis (fluconazole, n = 8).",

She developed hypoxemia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation for 6 d. She developed secondary pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsisinduced ventricular dysfunction. She was treated with corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. 2 mo after discharge from hospital, her pulmonary function was persistently impaired (i.e., diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, 55%). Patient 2 is a 35-yr-old Scottish woman with a history of hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypogonadism, but not CMC (Bastard et al., 2020) .

As we do not know how many SARS-CoV-2-infected APS-1 patients there are worldwide and our series probably reflects an ascertainment bias, we cannot rigorously estimate the proportion of life-threatening cases. However, our findings strongly suggest that APS-1 patients are at very high risk of critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Our previous report of auto-Abs against type I IFNs in at least 10% of patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia and none of the subjects with asymptomatic or benign SARS-CoV-2 infection tested (Bastard et al., 2020) further suggests that APS-1 patients are at high risk of developing critical disease because of their neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs. This very poor outcome seems to be independent of age, sex, European ancestry, and the nature of any other autoimmune manifestations. Importantly, our findings confirm that auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs present before SARS-CoV-2 infection, as opposed to other auto-Abs potentially triggered by this infection, confer a very high risk of critical COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2020; Beck and Aksentijevich, 2020; de Prost et al., 2021; Koning et al., 2021; Meffre and Iwasaki, 2020; Troya et al., 2021; Wijst et al., 2021 Preprint; Zhang et al., 2020b) . We also found similar levels of auto-Abs before and after COVID-19 in the patients tested, further suggesting that the infection does not significantly trigger their production.",

Nevertheless, APS-1 patients should not be vaccinated with the newly developed vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that uses the YFV live attenuated vaccine as a carrier (Bastard et al., 2021c; Sanchez-Felipe et al., 2021) . In the meantime, all necessary measures should be taken to avoid infection. Our report of seven patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection following a mild or moderate, nonhypoxemic course is of interest in this respect. Three of these seven patients were on monthly IVIg treatment, which may have decreased the pathogenicity of the auto-Abs against type I IFNs or acted through other mechanisms. Consistently, one of these patients was also receiving rituximab at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, which may have altered the nature or decreased the titer of auto-Abs against type I IFNs. In addition, three patients whose medical teams had been informed by us of the risk of critical COVID-19 were treated early in the course of infection, one with an early and prolonged course of stress-dose corticosteroids, another by prophylactic admission with the administration of corticosteroids and remdesivir, and the third by early administration of subcutaneous IFN-\u03b2. We thus recommend that infected patients should be hospitalized promptly.",

First, cocktails of mAb against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may be given to accelerate the decline in viral load (Chen et al., 2021; Weinreich et al., 2021) ; these antibodies should be preferred over convalescent plasma, which has not shown efficacy in severe COVID-19 pneumonia and may also contain auto-Abs against type I IFNs or other detrimental components (Simonovich et al., 2021) . Intramuscular or nebulized IFN-\u03b2 or subcutaneous pegylated-IFN\u03b2 may also be considered in patients without auto-Abs against IFN-\u03b2 (Monk et al., 2021) , as successfully reported for intramuscular IFN-\u03b12 in patients with inborn errors of type I IFN (L\u00e9vy et al., 2021) and for IFN-\u03b2 in a patient with incontinentia pigmenti and auto-Abs against type I IFNs (Bastard et al., 2021a) . Obviously, the administration of IFN-\u03b12 is not indicated in APS-1 patients. In patients treated with IFN-\u03b2, a monitoring of anti-IFN-\u03b2 auto-Abs will be important. In the small minority of APS-1 patients carrying auto-Abs against IFN\u03b2, alternative options could be considered.",

In hypoxemic APS-1 patients, the early initiation of high-dose corticosteroid treatment is important to prevent a worsening of lung injury and death, as suggested by the observation that other patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids at or within 24 h of the onset of hypoxemia recovered, whereas the later initiation of corticosteroids was associated with death (Horby et al., 2021) . Indeed, two symptomatic patients without hypoxemic disease who received corticosteroids did not progress to severe disease, further suggesting that early corticosteroid treatment might prevent or attenuate the secondary hyperinflammatory phase of disease (Zhang et al., 2020a) . The prompt initiation of corticosteroid treatment is of particular importance in APS-1 patients, because of their common adrenal insufficiency, and especially in those with preexisting autoimmune pneumonitis, a frequently overlooked manifestation of APS-1 that affects up to \u223c40% of patients (Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2019) , as the inflammation-prone lung tissue in these patients may confer a predisposition to a worsening of lung injury. Two of the eight patients tested here had auto-Abs against the lung auto-Ab BPIFB1. Such patients are often misdiagnosed as having a prior history of reactive airway disease or recurrent pneumonia (Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2019) . Finally, both in the early phase of disease and after the development of COVID-19 pneumonia, plasmapheresis should be considered, as it has been safely performed in two APS-1 patients (this report) and four patients without APS-1 (de Prost et al., 2021) . This procedure can lower the titers of circulating auto-Abs against type I IFNs without lowering the titers of antiviral Abs (de Prost et al., 2021) , and it may be more beneficial when performed early in the course of hospitalization.",

By inference from our recent observation that auto-Abs against type I IFNs can underlie life-threatening disease due to the YFV-17D liveattenuated virus vaccine (Bastard et al., 2021c) , APS-1 patients should not be vaccinated against YFV. None of the 22 patients described here reported having been inoculated with the YFV-17D vaccine. It is intriguing that these and other APS-1 patients have not been reported to suffer from other severe viral infections, including MMR disease and herpes simplex virus encephalitis, which have been reported in patients with IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency (Bastard et al., 2021b; Duncan et al., 2015; Gothe et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2019) . This may reflect the residual activity of some of the 17 type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b2 in particular, or that at the age of vaccination or HSV-1 infection, the auto-Abs were not yet present, not as potent, or did not target all the type I IFNs neutralized in older APS-1 patients. There is, nevertheless, one case report of an APS-1 patient suffering from recurrent cutaneous HSV-1 infection (Nagafuchi et al., 2007) . The paucity of viral infections in patients with inherited IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency is, itself, intriguing (Duncan et al., 2015; Hernandez et al., 2019; Gothe et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Bastard et al., 2021b; Meyts and Casanova, 2021) . Careful retrospective and prospective studies of viral infections and viral diseases in APS-1 patients are therefore warranted. More generally, a careful study of viral infections and viral diseases in patients with inherited IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency, and in patients with auto-Abs against type I IFNs, regardless of their etiology, is also warranted.",
