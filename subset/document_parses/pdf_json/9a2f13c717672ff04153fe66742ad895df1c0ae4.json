The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic in March 2020. During this time, restrictions on movement were put into place worldwide, to flatten the curve of infection through social distancing. The functioning of colleges and universities during the pandemic presents a challenge. Globally, strategies to manage the situation have included containment and mitigation, such as access control with contact tracing and quarantine, hygiene, sanitation, ventilation, and social distancing. In the United Kingdom (UK), this required rapid development of local organisational COVID-19 policies in universities, requiring regular adaptation in line with evolving updates from the UK Higher Education Taskforce, and rapid changes in government policy and guidance, as the national situation changes. In the UK, universities rapidly transitioned to online teaching and learning during the first surge of COVID-19 in March 2020, followed by large-scale reopening of campuses for the new academic year in September/October 2020. This mass movement of students from across the UK and overseas aligned with a second surge of COVID-19 across the UK [1] and the establishment of a national tiered system of restrictions to address local outbreaks of COVID-19 (Supplementary File S1).",

A systematic review found that in two general population studies, the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection at time of testing was 20% and 75%, respectively, and among three studies in contacts it was 8.2% to 50% [2] . In the absence of a national strategy or policy, some universities developed local capability for frequent and regular mass asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing programmes [3, 4] in effort to reduce the risks [5] of viral transmission between asymptomatic students. This approach aimed to maximise the safety of staff, students, and local communities, and aligned with recommendations made by the UK's Independent SAGE Behavioural Advisory Group [6] . Without national guidance, there was hesitancy around asymptomatic testing, as the implications for students' social behaviours and wellbeing were unknown.",

            "text": "The success of mass testing approaches relies on high levels of testing and social isolation [7, 8] to reduce viral transmission. Further, a combination of moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation, and contact tracing is more likely to achieve control of severe virus transmission [7] . However, we know little about students' views towards these approaches to mitigation and containment. Although adherence to COVID-19 social regulations was generally high in the UK population (>90%), less than half of the population adhered to full self-isolation (duration adjusted adherence to full self-isolation was 42.5%) [9] . Additionally, 46% of 'resisters' to the lockdown rules were from younger age groups (16-24 years) [10] . Since 1 in 3 people aged 18 to 24 years were in full time education [11] it is possible that education settings host a high proportion of individuals who are less likely to adhere to social isolation. There is a high prevalence of younger age groups in universities; in 2019/20 there were 2.46 million students at UK higher education institutions [12] , with [18] [19] year-olds making the largest contribution to the Higher Education Initial Participation (HEIP) measure (the sum of the initial entry percentages in each of the age groups from 17 to 30 years, in a given academic year) [13] .",

Self-reported adherence to weekly virus testing in this pilot delivery was high (92.4% completed \u22656 tests; 70.8% submitted all 10 swabs; 89.2% completed \u22651 saliva sample) and 76.9% submitted \u22653 blood samples [4] .

            "text": "However, at our institution, at the start of the Autumn term, there was a wide-scale deployment of local asymptomatic testing in residential student halls with much lower uptake than was found in the pilot service. Uptake amongst students first offered an asymptomatic test in residence-based deployments was 13% up to the end of October. During October there was a marked decrease in testing uptake, beginning at 58% in the first deployment in early October and decreasing to as low as 5% in a late-October deployment. Concurrently during this time there were around 2000 self-reports of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in students, the majority of which were associated with symptomatic infection. A significant minority of these reports were associated with students following advice to seek confirmatory UK National Health Service (NHS) community testing, in response to a positive test identified through the University's asymptomatic testing service. The institution had one of the highest reported rates of COVID-19 in the country at that time [15] , although it was anticipated that the asymptomatic testing programme would identify cases earlier and more quickly as it rolled out through the term and detected positive cases that might have otherwise remained undetected. The testing service was intended to reduce asymptomatic transmission and the number of future cases. Nevertheless, the impact of COVID-19 on social isolation at our institution was dramatic during this time, with many more students reporting entering isolation than reporting positive tests. Despite publication of isolation numbers being uncommon, the total number of people self-isolating across 45 universities with positive cases reported to be above 3540 within just 9 weeks [16] , suggesting that this was a common experience across UK universities. The overall aim of the study was therefore to explore university students' perceptions and experiences of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing and strategies for mitigation (social distancing) and containment (self-isolation) in a higher education setting. The findings provide insight into students' barriers to testing uptake and adherence to social restrictions, contribute to a wider debate around mass testing approaches in a pandemic [17] [18] [19] [20] , and the impact of mitigation and containment strategies on young people's social behaviours and wellbeing.",

At this time, people were advised that no households should mix indoors or in groups of more than 6 outdoors with social distancing, remote working (and studying), other restrictions on travel, facilities, and services (Supplementary File S1). Students had to contend with abrupt changes in the way that education was delivered, the risks of COVID-19 more broadly, significant reductions in social contact, and separation from friends and family due to social distancing measures. Large numbers of students had to adapt to confinement strategies in residential education settings, including shared student accommodation and houses in multiple occupation. Due to increasing numbers of positive cases locally and nationally, many students were required to self-isolate during this time, which meant staying in their home or place of residence and not going outside for any reason, including not travelling to a different place of residence. At the time of data collection, a mass asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing programme was underway at the participating university [4] , with testing deployments taking place in a small number of university halls of residence, with plans for a rapid roll out of testing to all university staff and students being developed.",

Purposive sampling was used to provide a diverse range of ages, genders, living circumstances (on/off campus), SARS-CoV-2 testing, and self-isolation experiences (Table 1 and Supplementary File S3). Students required to self-isolate were those that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, lived with someone who had symptoms or had tested positive, or were identified as a contact of someone who had tested positive by the NHS 'Test and Trace'. Of the 25 students in the sample, 12 were tested, of which 11 were symptomatic and one was asymptomatic. All participants were currently residing in the UK and gave informed consent online to be approached for interview via Jisc Online Surveys, and additional verbal consent was provided and audio-recorded prior to the start of the focus group. Recruitment continued until achievement of maximum variation sampling, in terms of the pre-specified interviewee characteristics. The 2-week data collection period allowed for rapid data analysis so that findings of the study could feed into university COVID-19 strategy around mass testing and student support. Students were not compensated for their participation. Online data collection was necessary due to social isolation policy. However, online focus groups are commonly used in health research to capitalise on group interaction in diverse and geographically dispersed participants, to collect rich responses to questions posed in a cost saving and convenient way [23] .

Two psychologists (H.B./H.K.) generated the question guide, moderated the focus groups and analysed the data. We used a semi-structured question guide focused on the research outcomes of several studies [4, 22, 24] , to cover the main topics related to the outcomes of the study. A draft topic guide was developed by the same two psychologists (H.B./H.K.). To judge the relevance of the topics and the possible emotional impact on students, the topic guide was discussed with experts who had expertise in mass SARS-CoV-2 testing (n = 2), psychology (n = 2), university operations (n = 2), student wellbeing (n = 3) and student members of a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) group (n = 2). Following feedback, the draft topic guide was pilot tested for comprehensibility and level of burden with two students who were not participants in the study, which resulted in minor amendments to question wording. Both moderators were trained in qualitative research and interview skills and were not involved in delivery of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing programme. Focus groups were conducted according to recommendations from NHS England's focus group guide [25] . A funnel approach was used with broader, generic questions at the outset (e.g., introductions), leading to more directed questioning (e.g., views on specific issues). The purpose was to build rapport within the group and ensure there was enough 'lead-in' time for participants to feel comfortable about contributing to the discussion. Due to the nature of the discussion, and the timing of data collection amidst a surge in the pandemic, it was not deemed appropriate to require all students to respond to every question, although every effort was made to encourage participation within the group. All focus groups followed the same questioning route (Supplementary File S4), were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants are referred to as new students (first year students beginning their studies in the Autumn term) and returning students (those resuming their studies in the Autumn term following a summer break).",

To ensure reliability of data interpretations, two researchers (H.K./H.B.) then independently read the emerging codes and supporting quotations to enhance the accountability of the analysis [26] . Codes were individually and critically examined by both researchers, and the overlapping codes and subcodes were further refined and grouped together. Codes and subcodes with similar characteristics were then grouped into meaningful overarching themes that emerged organically from the data. Themes, codes and subcodes were confirmed by two student participants.

Theme 1 ('Term-time Experiences') highlights the impacts of COVID-19 on practical issues surrounding students' daily life and academic studies, alongside university approaches to protect and safeguard. Themes 2 and 3 ('Risk Perception and Worry'; 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours') demonstrate the individual and structural drivers of students' engagement with social behaviours that protect against virus transmission. Themes 4 and 5 ('Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing') highlight students' openness to mass asymptomatic testing alongside the barriers and enablers of testing and its consequences. Theme 6 ('General Wellbeing') highlights the broader impacts of the pandemic on social and mental wellbeing, which are core concepts interwoven within Themes 1-6.",

Nevertheless, there were students for whom access to food and basic supplies was likely to be more challenging during this time (e.g., students living offcampus in privately owned accommodation, particularly international students arriving to the UK for the first time). These groups might be at particular risk since food insecurity (worry about how, and where, to access food) was identified in 35% of students during COVID-19 lockdown, and students' living arrangements during the pandemic was found to be the strongest predictor of food insecurity [29] .",

This applied across different campus settings, including accommodation, libraries, lecture halls and gym facilities. Although perceptions of safety on campus were high, some felt that the safe-guarding measures negatively impacted the broader student experience. In particular, individuals undertaking laboratory-based research reported that their studies were heavily impacted by university-wide safe-guarding building closures. To some, the safe-guarding processes surrounding self-isolation in halls of residence were viewed to be particularly restrictive. However, this was mitigated by regular communications from university staff that improved students' experience of university life, and appeared to enhance students' feelings of connectedness, particularly during periods of social isolation.",

Impacts on studies were particularly notable at the start of the Autumn term alongside efforts to shift to online teaching and learning, and to mobilize mitigation and containment strategies in a short period. Students endorsed varying levels of adjustment to learning online. Many students described adapting well to online functioning, noting that the course conveners had also adapted well to this shift, and consequently, their education did not suffer. Some students enjoyed the novelty of self-guided learning. However, multiple students found this format to be disorganized at the outset, with classes cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute at the start of the Autumn term. The transition to unfamiliar online learning environments was particularly challenging for new students who had not yet established their friendship groups and international students for whom English was not their native language. It was also noted that the move to online learning resulted in the loss of potential networking opportunities that might have arisen through the course if it were delivered face-to-face. The immediate challenges for higher education institutions were apparent, with regards to access to technical infrastructure, pedagogies for distance learning, competences (of students and staff), and managing the requirements of specific fields of study (e.g., hands-on learning requirements, field work, assessments) [31] . This rapid transition to online teaching and learning might precipitate enhanced teaching and learning opportunities in the future [32] , by increasing opportunities for flexible learning approaches [31] . However, the requirement to adapt at speed to unfamiliar online e-learning approaches in the context of the pandemic is challenging for some.",

Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the structural, psychological and social barriers to adherence might help reduce the occurrence of regulation breaches and noncompliance. Overall, social interaction is an integral part of students' lives. Universities and colleges should consider the social impact of protective behaviours and offer social outlets for students when appropriate (e.g., providing opportunity for monitored socializing outdoors when it is safe to do so). Given the highlighted structural difficulties some students experienced with their accommodation providers, the university should set out clear guidance for both students and providers on practical, social, and emotional supports for students, on return to campus following national lockdown and during periods of self-isolation. These strategies might improve adherence to self-isolation and reduce fear of self-isolation, which might equally enhance uptake of testing.",

We propose that institutional communications around COVID-19 might need to be more accessible and inclusive, since messaging at the time of the study was not universally understood amongst students, and the needs of certain groups (e.g., postgraduate students, international students, off-campus students) were not being met. It is important to consider these findings in the context of a fast moving and uncertain crisis situation, during which institutional COVID-19 strategies had to be developed and operationalized at speed. This required high responsivity to changes in local and national guidelines and procedures, with rapid communication of changes to university staff and students. It was advocated that organisational communications during the COVID-19 crisis should be succinct, to be read and understood [41] . Our findings might highlight a tension between the need for simplicity and readability of communications by the target audience, particularly students for whom English was not their first language. Additionally, the importance of communications (e.g., clarity, inclusion, and timeliness) in maximizing adherence to protective behaviours should not be underestimated. Given the identified link between desire for social contact and adherence to protective behaviours, messaging should emphasize the desirability of adhering to public health protocols, and signpost activities that minimize the boredom of self-isolation and maximize opportunities for social contact and activity engagement (e.g., virtual social interactions, exercise classes) [42] .",

Ideally, messages for students would be co-created with students [43] , since it is well-established that young people are often more heavily influenced by their peers than by other age groups and are more likely to heed advice from those in similar age groups. Thus, 'using the young person's voice' to deliver messaging would be helpful to reach higher education students in younger age groups. As 'social influence agents' who support or undermine health-related behaviours [44] , peers both model, and influence, healthy and unhealthy behaviours [45] . Therefore, communications could emphasize social norms related to adherence to protective behaviours (e.g., what peers think, what peers do) [34] . Since young people in particular are generally more oriented towards short-term rewards rather than long-term consequences [46] , messaging could emphasize the immediate impacts of COVID-19 such as the risks to loved ones, and young people should be thanked for their contribution to reduction of virus transmission. Communications should not just instruct young people on what to do but should include clear guidelines on how to enact protective behaviours (e.g., how to socialize in a COVIDsafe way, how to socially distance in specific situations, and how to engage with peers who are non-adherent) [34] .",

With regards to the practicalities of testing, no particular problems were raised relating to any of the testing processes or procedures (NHS symptomatic community test-throat swab; University asymptomatic test-saliva). Some students reported that the throat swab test was uncomfortable, yet prior work suggests that students did not raise this as a barrier to the uptake of testing [4] . Studies in other populations suggest that discomfort was relatively low in both throat and nasal swabs, although nasal swabs were less likely to induce nausea or vomiting [47] . There is little published evidence in this area, although unpublished work suggests that saliva tests are a less intrusive approach with university students as compared to nasal swabs [48] . Testing uptake and self-isolation adherence could be low in education settings (e.g., [36] ). Greater student adherence to SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing is associated with their level of satisfaction with university communications [4] . Intrusiveness and convenience of testing procedures should also be considered and balanced alongside test sensitivity, to maximize testing uptake. Overall, our study showed that the availability of testing was seen by students to be an important approach to 'getting control' of the virus, although engagement with testing was more likely to be related to the emotional impacts of self-isolation and its consequences. To maximize uptake of asymptomatic testing, there needs to be significant support in place to manage the impacts of self-isolation on students' social relationships and mental wellbeing. Further, the risk of unintended behavioural consequences of mass testing could not be dismissed, since our findings suggest that for a minority, a negative test result might instill a sense of false security and perceived immunity to COVID-19.",

Our study suggests that mental health plays a key role in students' behavioural decision-making about engagement in protective behaviours, not least as a negative impact of self-isolating (e.g., avoidance of self-isolation to avoid emotional impact). For example, we found that students worried about how they would cope if they had to self-isolate, and experience high anxiety, low mood, and loneliness when self-isolating, coupled with a fear of re-experiencing these negative emotions if they were asked to self-isolate again. They also exhibited a strong sense of guilt if household members had to self-isolate because of them and fear the interpersonal conflict this situation might bring. Participants in our study believed that this might be a factor for young adults in decision-making related to COVID-19 testing, particularly for those who are asymptomatic. Students' emotions seem to override their willingness to engage in COVID-19 testing when they are asymptomatic, due to the risk of self-isolation for themselves and others, despite viewing onsite testing as convenient, and seeing testing as an important national and local strategy for controlling the virus. The same pattern occurs with other protective behaviours, since people socialize to avoid feeling lonely, and loneliness is a barrier to social distancing adherence in adult populations [54] . Further, young adults are more likely to report loneliness during COVID-19 restrictive measures than other age groups [55] .",

For communications in a higher education context, 'one-size-does-not-fit-all' and as we observed, some groups of students might feel forgotten. For example, working students (e.g., often international students, self-funded students, students with caregiving responsibilities) might have experienced a loss of income as a result of the COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions, leading to further worry, spiraling debt, uncertainty about the future, and risk of 'falling through the cracks in the system', all impacting on mental health [57] . The UK government 'COVID-19 Mental Health and Wellbeing Surveillance Report' shows that marginalised or disadvantaged groups might be disproportionally affected by the wider implications of the pandemic [58] . COVID-19 had an impact on equity and inclusion in educational settings, with young people from diverse backgrounds being at greater risk of increased vulnerability and less likely to receive the support and extra services they need [59] . Further research might be needed to explore the experiences and support needs of particular groups known to be at risk for mental health concerns, such as students with financial hardship, LGBTQI+ students, and students with special educational needs.",

This study sits in the context of a national debate around the implementation of mass asymptomatic testing programmes in schools and universities, which is divisive [18, 19, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . England's Department for Education advocates weekly testing in educational settings from January 2021 [66] , and despite the potential for transmission from students to other members of the community, there is little evidence of how students interpret and respond to these approaches, and the impacts of mass testing on social behaviour and wellbeing. This study therefore contributes [67] to the wider debate around mass testing and informs mitigation and containment strategies for COVID-19 in educational settings.",

While students in our study were willing to express concerns in this focus group setting and talk about other students' behaviour or compliance to COVID-19 restrictions, there might be some reservations about openly discussing any personal breaches of COVID-19 guidelines, especially given that the focus group moderators were University employees. These data relate to the views of students in a higher education setting, which might vary from that of the general public in terms of personal and attitudinal variables [69] . The frequencies presented in Table 2 do not reflect the contextual or behavioural factors that were considered during analysis, such as nonverbal cues (i.e., nodding) or participant agreement with the statements provided by others. Therefore, the number of students agreeing with the statement contributing towards each theme is likely to be underestimated.

Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low transmission-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. University communications around outbreaks and mental health support need to be timely and inclusive to reach groups of students that currently feel marginalised and are at risk of 'falling through the cracks' in the system.
