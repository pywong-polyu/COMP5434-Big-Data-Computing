A Japanese version of the LIWC2015 dictionary (J-LIWC2015) has been expected in the fields of natural language processing and cross-cultural research. This study aims to create the J-LIWC2015 through systematic investigations of the original dictionary and Japanese corpora. The entire LIWC2015 dictionary was initially subjected to human and machine translation into Japanese. After verifying the frequency of use of the words in large corpora, frequent words and phrases that are unique to Japanese were added to the dictionary, followed by recategorization by psychologists. The updated dictionary indicated good internal consistency, semantic equivalence with the original LIWC2015 dictionary, and good construct validity in each category. The evidence suggests that the J-LIWC2015 dictionary is a powerful research tool in computational social science to scrutinize the psychological processes behind Japanese texts and promote standardized cross-cultural investigations in combination with LIWC dictionaries in different languages.",

            "text": "Understanding how people feel and think in their daily lives is a primary objective of social science. In human society, language is an essential tool for thinking and communicating, thereby comprehending one's own internal state and that of others. From personal diaries to public speeches, informal conversations to social media posts, words reflect the ruminations and emotions of one's mind and heart. Although social scientists have found the systematic quantitative analysis of text-based data challenging because of its complexity, recent advancements in computational linguistics have made it possible to evaluate the psychological meanings of language use. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; pronounced \"Luke;\" Chung and Pennebaker, 2012) is a de facto standard analytic framework to quantify psychological constructs embedded in text data. LIWC is composed of computer software and a dictionary file. The software classifies each word in a given text into multiple linguistic/psychological categories based on the words included in the dictionary file (hereafter referred to as \"target words\") and calculates the proportion of the words in each category to the total number of words in the entire text. The dictionary file defines target words as a collection of frequently used words, each of which is linked to specific categories, such as positive/negative emotions, cognitive and perceptual processes, and personal and social concerns. Although LIWC can be used for simple sentiment analysis to study affective states such as positive and negative, it is not just a sentiment dictionary but rather a general research tool for inferring more complicated psychological states from texts.",

The LIWC dictionary was initially developed in English and translated into German, simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, French, Italian, Portuguese, Serbian, Romanian, and Turkish. The availability of localized dictionaries has led LIWC to become a gold standard for cross-cultural psycholinguistic analysis. However, LIWC has not been translated into Japanese in a publicly available format.",

First, the target words are collected from large corpora in different communication contexts and screened based on their frequency of use. Then, the associations between the target words and the pre-defined psychologically meaningful categories are determined and judged by psychologists. Linguistic categories, such as personal pronouns, are also allocated to some target words. Each target word corresponds to multiple categories, organized both horizontally and hierarchically. For example, the target word \"beauty\" is classified into four categories: \"affect\" (level 1), \"positive emotion\" (level 2 under the affect category), \"perceptual process\" (level 1), and \"see\" (level 2 under the perceptual process category). Some target words include a wildcard character (\" * \") at word endings to match any word that starts with a particular string of characters (e.g., \"enjoy * \" matches \"enjoy, \" \"enjoyable, \" \"enjoyed, \" and \"enjoyment\"). The use of the wildcard expands the concise dictionary to cover a broad range of inflected forms of the target words. As of 2021, the newest dictionary was developed in 2015 (LIWC2015), which includes approximately 6,400 target words and more than 70 linguistic/psychological categories.",

            "text": "Constructing a Japanese version of the English LIWC dictionary is not easy. Linguistic distance (the closeness of language structure) is the farthest between English and Japanese (Chiswick and Miller, 2005) . The complexity of the Japanese language comes from its unique writing system composed of three scripts: hiragana (the Japanese cursive syllabary), katakana (the square Japanese syllabary), and kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese writing). In addition, the word classification system is based on three different origins: wago (or Yamato kotoba; native Japanese words), kango (Chinese-origin words), and gairaigo (words borrowed from foreign, mainly European, language), and their mixture. The multiple origins make the same kanji script have two or more pronunciations called on-yomi (based on kango) and kun-yomi (based on wago), which often have the same meaning. Moreover, the Japanese language has a rich variation of onomatopoeia that describe real sounds (giongo), animal and human sounds (giseigo), and conditions and states (gitaigo) in both hiragana and katakana. Consequently, the average vocabulary size for native Japanese speakers (undergraduates) is between 30,000-50,000 (Sato N. et al., 2017) , whereas it is around 20,000 for native English speakers (Nation and Waring, 1997) . In the process of developing the J-LIWC2015, these complicated issues must be considered; there is no shortcut.",

We added high-frequency Japanese words to the dictionary and associated them with the categories (Step 4), followed by the fine-tuning of the category composition (Step 5). We then calculated the internal consistency of each category in large corpora (Step 6) and reexamined the correspondence between the English and Japanese versions of the dictionary in another dataset (Step 7). Finally, we conducted an online essay-writing experiment that manipulated participants' moods to test the construct validity of each category (Step 8).",

The source-target words with a wildcard were transformed into multiple English words using the online dictionary search tool OneLook 2 before processing in Weblio. Every source-target word was translated into as many single or multiple Japanese words as possible. The Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ; 104 million words) 3 and the Tsukuba Web Corpus (TWC; 1.1 billion words) 4 were used to check the frequency of use of all translated words.

At this stage, the initial candidate words were standardized to written expressions used in daily life. If the source-target words represent abstract meanings or do not correspond directly to a single word in Japanese, the reviewers carefully chose translated expressions that reflect the original connotations. Some source-target words that were rarely used in Japanese, such as culture-specific words, abbreviations, and proper nouns (e.g., \"Yiddish, \" \"DVR, \" and \"Zoloft\"), were directly translated (\"Yiddish\" as it is in Japanese), remained (\"DVR\" as it is), or changed to words with a more general meaning (\"Zoloft\" was translated as \"antidepressant\" in Japanese) in this step. Abbreviated auxiliaries (e.g., \"shouldn't\") were not translated because no direct translation into single words is available in Japanese. For this reason, we were also unable to convert emoticons in the netspeak category (e.g., \":)\") and some source-target words in the informal and netspeak categories (e.g., \"prob\").",

According to Pennebaker et al.

For example, if a person writes a diary in Japanese about their positive experience, multiple words in the positive emotions category in J-LIWC2015, such as \" * \" (fun) and \" * \" (wonderful), would occur in the same text. The expressive pattern is regarded as internally consistent to the extent that a person's positive emotions are consistently high across the text.

The netspeak category also showed low internal consistency, probably due to the difficulty of allocating diverse expressions commonly used on the internet across different platforms and generations into a single category. In response to these results, very low and very high-frequency words were moved to different categories or removed from the dictionary to increase internal consistency. Although the alphas remained relatively low in the personal pronouns category even after the amendments, using pronouns in Japanese is not mandatory in a sentence and is often avoided to reduce redundancy. In particular, first-and second-person pronouns such as \" \" (I) and \" \" (you) are frequently dropped in Japanese in the context of conversations 20 (Kashima and Kashima, 1998) .

(2021) analyzed Twitter posts by a beta version of J-LIWC2015 to examine the patterns of changes in consumers' reactions toward the resell of essential goods (e.g., face masks and hand sanitizers) in Japan during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic from March to August 2020. The longitudinal research showed that the peaks of drive-related category word use on Twitter corresponded to the propagation of news related to reselling, legal sanctions against face mask reselling for profits, and criticisms of those making profiting excessively from the crisis. These findings reflect the utility of validated text-based analytic tools for gauging psychological trends in public opinion on the internet.",

            "text": "The equivalence between the J-LIWC2015 and LIWC2015 dictionaries also facilitates a content analysis of texts written in the same context by speakers of different languages. For example, a cross-cultural study (Lopez et al., 2019) used LIWC2007 to analyze the content of Twitter posts in 2017 with the #MeToo hashtag (a social media hashtag used to confess and share experiences of workplace sexual harassment and other forms of victimization against women) in French and English. The findings revealed that French tweets included more aggressive (swear) expressions than English tweets. The same research design can now be applied to the comparative analysis of Japanese and English texts. However, researchers should keep in mind that it is not always appropriate to use the categories showing low corrected alphas (e.g., personal pronouns and netspeak categories) in cross-linguistic and crosscultural studies. Meanwhile, recent research (Windsor et al., FIGURE 4 | A general framework for quantitative language processing in Japanese by J-LIWC2015 dictionary. Sample scripts for preprocessing and postprocessing can be downloaded from https://github.com/tasukuigarashi/j-liwc2015. 2019) claims that the English-based LIWC2015 is universally applicable for analyzing texts (United Nations documents) machine-translated from several non-English source languages (not including Japanese) to English. Nonetheless, this approach may miss high-frequency words observed only in source languages. At least for the present moment, the coverage of this approach is limited to texts that do not include informal words or culture-specific expressions (see also Boot, 2021 , for further discussion comparing machine-translated and dictionary-based approaches).",

It is often the case in Japanese that the same word can be assigned to a different part of speech according to the context of word use. More broadly, proper nouns and non-dictionary words might be mishandled in both J-LIWC2015 and LIWC2015, as the names in the Bible were regarded as part of the informal language in Step 6. All the issues mentioned above stem from the fact that the LIWC2015 software does not use context information and word co-occurrence patterns for word category classification.",

Since its release in 2006, MeCab with IPADIC has been widely used for natural language processing in Japanese. At the preprocessing stage of the application of J-LIWC2015, MeCab/IPADIC is used for morphological analysis of Japanese text. In addition, the software can provide part of speech information for every word in the text estimated from word occurrence and conjunction costs (the likelihoods of two words to occur and linked calculated based on the part of speech information of frequent words in IPADIC). Upon necessity, researchers can add linguistic category information of the entire text by combining the result of MeCab/IPADIC analysis on the part of speech information with the output of the LIWC2015 software. Figure 4 introduces a general framework for the natural language processing of Japanese texts using the J-LIWC2015 dictionary, MeCab/IPADIC, and the LIWC2015 software. The framework contains the preprocessing, main analysis, and postprocessing stages. In the preprocessing stage, researchers convert Japanese texts to be readable in LIWC2015 software and conduct morphological and part of speech analyses in MeCab/IPADIC (researchers can also utilize part of speech information of each word for filtering non-dictionary proper nouns that may be mislabeled in J-LIWC2015, although this is beyond the scope of the current study). In the main analysis stage, researchers use the output of the morphological analysis in the LIWC2015 software for linguistic/psychological category assignments based on the J-LIWC2015 dictionary. Researchers can complete the analysis at this stage and use the output for extensive analysis. If they need more detailed part of speech information, they can proceed to the postprocessing stage and combine the output of linguistic/psychological categories (obtained at the main analysis stage) with the output of the part of speech information (obtained at the preprocessing stage) for extensive analysis. Postprocessing is optional and dependent on the research purpose. If researchers think integrating the outputs from the J-LIWC2015 dictionary and MeCab/IPADIC can get the best of both worlds, we recommend adopting this option. Supplementary Table 4 presents a case of analysis of postprocessing, showing that MeCab/IPADIC captures more words in the verb, adverb, and auxiliary verb categories than the J-LIWC2015 dictionary. Sample scripts for postprocessing can be downloaded from https://github.com/tasukuigarashi/j-liwc2015.",

For example, when the effectiveness of linguistic/psychological category information assigned by BERT and LIWC2015 was compared in German to predict positive and negative communication behaviors in dyadic conversations, BERT was likely to outperform LIWC2015 (Biggiogera et al., 2021) . There is no doubt that applying data-driven machine learning technology in this field has a promising future. However, one of the biggest drawbacks of the machinelearning approach is the lack of available training data; neural language models such as BERT need large-scale \"labeled\" data for training and fine-tuning, but such data are not often easily available in social science research. Furthermore, we should be careful not about performance but also the transparency and accountability specifications in data processing (Felzmann et al., 2019) .",
