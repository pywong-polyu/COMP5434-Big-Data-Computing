[47] [48] [49] However, this benefit has since questioned by a series of studies, including a large RCT, that showed no benefit to standard of care. 1, 50, 51 There are currently over 25 RCTs underway to fully assess the clinical benefit of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients. The ototoxic effects of chloroquine use are well documented and include symptoms of reversible and irreversible sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), tinnitus, and vertigo. An observational study (n = 74) receiving chloroquine therapy reported abnormal brain stem audiometry (ABR) in 13 patients, although there was no change in hearing by pure tone audiogram. 25 Likewise, a prospective observational study (n = 30) abnormal ABR findings in two patients, both of whom also exhibited bilateral SNHL by pure tone audiometry. 26 In both studies, symptoms resolved after discontinuation of chloroquine treatment. A recent systematic review found evidence of abnormal ABR or SNHL in 10 patients across 6 case reports after chloroquine therapy. 27 Severe permanent bilateral SNHL was reported in two of these patients, the first occurring within hours of chloroquine administration and the later after prolonged chloroquine therapy. Three out of the 10 patients additionally reported vertigo or imbalance occurring concurrently with hearing loss. Reports of tinnitus after chloroquine therapy are much less common, although it has been described in a small percentage of patients. 28, 29 Hydroxychloroquine has likewise been associated both reversable and irreversible hearing loss in a number of case reports in the clinical literature. A systematic review found evidence of mild to severe SNHL occurring in seven patients across six case reports after hydroxychloroquine therapy, with two of these patients experiencing tinnitus concurrent with hearing loss.",

A retrospective study investigating azithromycin use in HIV-related infections (n = 41) reported similar findings, with eight patients experiencing severe ototoxic adverse events including bilateral SNHL, tinnitus, and vertigo. 43 Symptoms were found to resolve in an average of 5 weeks after discontinuation of treatment.",

Lopinavir is an aspartate protease inhibitor administered in combination with the pharmacokinetic booster ritonavir to increase plasma half-life through inhibition of cytochrome P450. Lopinavir has shown effectiveness against both middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the related SARS-CoV coronaviruses, with significantly reduced rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality. [55] [56] [57] Clinical data for the use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients remain limited and RCTs are ongoing. Lopinavir-ritonavir therapy was shown to promote recovery rates in a case series of 10 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. 58 However, a large RCT assessing lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in severe COVID-19 found no benefit compared with standard of care. 59 Data from the research literature have confirmed that ritonavir possesses ototoxic effects in vitro. Ritonavir was shown to significantly reduce the viability of auditory HEI-OC1 cells, with toxicity increasing with length of exposure. 9 However, clinical data are limited. Moderate, bilateral hearing loss was confirmed by audiologic testing in a patient 4 weeks after initiation of lopinavir-ritonavir therapy. Hearing loss was reported to resolve shortly after discontinuation of lopinavirritonavir treatment and audiologic testing revealed borderline normal auditory acuity by 20 weeks after discontinuation. 10 Interferon Interferons (IFNs) are a group of naturally occurring signaling proteins released by numerous cell types in response to inflammation or infection. Type I IFNs, which include interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2), are known to possess robust antiviral and immunomodulatory capabilities. 60 IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 have been studied in previous coronavirus outbreaks, with both demonstrating activity against SARS-CoV in vitro. 61 Recent clinical trials in COVID-19 patients reported that IFN-\u03b1 therapy significantly reduced rates of viral shedding and levels of inflammatory markers, whereas IFN-\u03b2 therapy improved virologic clearance. 62, 63 However, both had small sample sizes and lacked a control group. Over 15 clinical trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, many of these trials utilize IFNs in combination with other therapeutics discussed in this review, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin.",

Of these, unilateral SNHL was far more common, occurring in eight out of the nine patients. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Three cases reported temporary hearing loss that improved with cessation of pegylated (PEG)-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy. 13, 14, 18 SNHL was fully reversible in two cases (after prednisone treatment) and permanent in four cases, even after cessation of treatment. 12, [15] [16] [17] 19, 20 Tinnitus occurred concurrently with hearing loss in one case. 16 These reports suggest that the therapeutic use of (PEG)-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy may mimic the ototoxic effects of non-pegylated interferons alone. Ribavirin in combination with (PEG)-IFN remains the standard of care in many patients with chronic hepatitis-C infections. Minimal data exists on the ototoxic effects of ribavirin alone; therefore, it is difficult to discern whether SNHL is the sole result of IFN therapy or if ribavirin may enhance known ototoxic effects. Interestingly, whereas hearing loss induced by IFN therapy alone is usually reversible, (PEG)-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy has shown higher rates of permanent hearing loss. 21 ",

Additional clinical trials include hydroxychloroquine in combination with IFNs or lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin in combination with ivermectin, as well as a triple combination of IFNs, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin. Minimal data exist on the possible synergistic ototoxic effects of these combination therapies. Of particular concern, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir may increase serum levels of hydroxychloroquine due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which may result in increased risk of ototoxic adverse effects. 66 Various factors are known to increase the risk of drug-induced hearing loss, including old age, underlying hearing impairment, genetics, and reduced drug elimination. 67 Renal failure is of particular concern as the majority of ototoxic drugs are eliminated through the kidneys, including three of six medications discussed in this review: hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and ribavirin. 67 Acute kidney injury occurs in 20% to 40% of critically ill COVID-19 patients, potentially impacting ototoxic effects due to reduced renal elimination. 68 Likewise, reduced renal function puts elderly patients at an increased risk of ototoxicity, especially when combined with other medications they may take for chronic conditions. 69 Lastly, patients with prior SNHL are at an increased risk of additional drug-induced hearing loss. 70 Attention to serum levels of ototoxic therapeutics in these at-risk populations may minimize long-term effects to hearing and balance. When possible, recommendations advise avoidance or replacement with a non-ototoxic drug in older, hearing-impaired patients. 67 The compounding effects of hypoxia and administration of ototoxic medications is an additional concern in COVID-19 patients. Hypoxia induces metabolic changes to electrochemical potentials in the cochlea, resulting decreased hearing thresholds, reduced speech discrimination, and prolongation of I-V waves in ABR. 71 Hypoxia is a defining feature of serious COVID-19 disease and may exacerbate the ototoxic effects of COVID-19 therapeutics in these patients. Furthermore, COVID-19 infection is associated with the development of a hypercoagulable state, which may increase the risk of hearing loss due to microthrombi formation. It may therefore be difficult to separate hearing loss due to microthrombi or hypoxia from ototoxic effects of COVID-19 therapeutics.",

Ideally, patients reporting symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo should be undergo audiologic evaluation. While comprehensive behavioral audiometry in a sound-proof booth remains the gold standard for establishing ototoxicity, urgent cases requiring real-time decision-making may benefit from bedside behavioral or electrophysiologic testing. High-frequency audiometry may be considered when possible, and can detect ototoxic damage at a subclinical level, allowing early intervention to minimize or prevent hearing loss. 2 Guidelines from The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) recommend that all patients administered ototoxic medications should 1) receive routine audiologic monitoring during the treatment course to facilitate early detection of ototoxicity, 2) receive post treatment audiologic evaluations 3 months and 6 months after cessation of the ototoxic medication to detect delayed or residual effects of ototoxicity, 3) receive prompt initiation of aural rehabilitation if ototoxic effects should manifest. 72 For those unable to travel, telemedicine with remote audiometry applications may play a role. 73, 74 Available evidence suggests that ototoxic effects may be improved or mitigated by stopping of the offending agent, suggesting that vigilance regarding symptoms of hearing loss and imbalance is crucial to prevent longterm damage. Evidence suggests that steroids may limit drug-induced ototoxicity of some medications, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, and ribavirin, however additional data is necessary. 15, 16, 27, 42, 75 CONCLUSION Many therapeutics used in COVID-19 have ototoxic effects, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, ribavirin, and ivermectin. Damaging effects may be reversible if identified, therefore, recognition of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance/vertigo remains the frontline of both prevention and treatment. Hospitals should consider the inclusion of audiologic monitoring protocols for patients receiving ototoxic COVID-19 therapeutics, especially in high risk patient groups such as the elderly and hearing impaired.",
