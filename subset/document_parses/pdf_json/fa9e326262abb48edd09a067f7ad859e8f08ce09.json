It encompasses various pedagogical approaches to cater to students' learning preferences. Examples of the module's session topics, learning objectives, and activities are provided in Table 1 .",

These sessions are led by the peer tutors and complemented with workshops from 'doctorpreneurs' [3] -doctors working in various entrepreneurial roles (artificial intelligence, mobile application development, medical simulation etc.) The module culminates in students working in groups of three to four to design a healthcare improvement project that draws on their learning and enables them to pursue an interest further. The assessment for each student is based partly (50%) on a group project presentation that outlines their healthcare challenge and explains how their interventions are implemented and evaluated, and partly (50%) on a 360-degree appraisal and evaluation on their teamwork and leadership dynamics. Near-peer teaching from senior medical students has been shown to lead to greater cognitive and social congruences, with learners being able to better comprehend complex topics and teachers being more in tune with learners' needs and concerns. It also alleviates pressure on the medical faculty and helps peer tutors to further their educational skills. Prior to graduating, the founding group of students selected successors through a written application documenting teaching and medical innovation experiences and an interview process. Successors shadowed peer tutors prior to taking on the module leadership roles, ensuring continuity and opportunities for continual module development. Peer tutors who have been involved in leading the module have universally reported that the process has considerably improved their confidence and teaching and assessment skills.",

            "text": "Five cohorts of students have taken the module thus far from 2019, with approximately 20 learners per cohort. Students' feedback through the university's standardised Student Evaluation Questionnaires has been overwhelmingly positive. Over 90% of students strongly agreed that the module was well-structured and well-organised. Students stated that the peer-tutors were approachable, encouraged collaboration and facilitated discussions well. Students appreciated the useful and relevant feedback from the peer tutors, as the tutors were familiar with learning objectives and understood the challenges from the students' perspectives. Students were intrigued by the problem-based and team-based approaches, but as these were unfamiliar to them and not covered in the main curriculum, they suggested further training on these approaches which has since been included. Overall, students felt empowered and more confident to pursue opportunities to become future entrepreneurs. Near-peer teaching is increasingly recognised as an efficient and effective method of teaching and learning in traditional medical curricular areas. The preliminary positive reception of this module suggests that it could also be further developed and evaluated in emerging curricular areas, like medical entrepreneurship. The use of peer tutors who are passionate about, and have experience in, medical entrepreneurship, was a key factor in the success of this module.",
