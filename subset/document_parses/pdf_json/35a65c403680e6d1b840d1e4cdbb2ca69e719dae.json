In English, diseases that bring the patient to the cusp of death are called \"critical\", from the Greek word for \"crisis\". Older known, but also new medications, have been tried in patients with critical COVID-19, with moderate or equivocal results. In summary, an antiviral agent, Remdesivir, that was developed against the earlier corona virus SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002-2003 epidemic, the virus causing MERS, and the Ebola virus, improved the clinical picture of patients with severe COVID-19, but did not decrease the number of patients that died from it, while other medications with known anti-inflammatory action, such as anti-interleukin-6 or synthetic glucocorticoids, produced similar or positive uncontrolled data and, hence, suggestive, but not definitive results [1] [2] [3] .",

One of the best antiinflammatory medications, and not only, is the natural corticosteroid cortisol, and its synthetic analogs, such as hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone [4, 5] . Having done basic, translational and clinical research on the actions of glucocorticoids in the organism for many years, we were not surprised by the recent report that dexamethasone decreased 28-day mortality of critical COVID-19 by about 30% (RECOVERY Trial) [6] . This means that, for the time being, glucocorticoids are the only effective medication as far as mortality is concerned. Of course, with the accumulating experience that we are gradually gaining, and the progressively improving therapeutic management of COVID-19 with anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant agents, the morbidity and mortality curves of the pandemic have diverged, with the former increasing much faster than the latter. Complex network metanalyses will let us know the varying relative inputs of these and/or other agents in the therapy of severe COVID-19.",

The doses of glucocorticoids employed should be sufficiently large to saturate the ubiquitous glucocorticoid receptors, so that maximum effect is attained. It is questionable whether dexamethasone is more efficacious than other synthetic glucocorticoids when given in equivalent doses [4] . One potential advantage is the almost complete lack of salt-retaining activity of this corticosteroid. As the pleiotropic actions of ascorbic acid, vitamin D, and thiamine include assisting glucocorticoids and mitochondria in the change of the homeostatic immune balance from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory, it is best for the patients to have sufficient reserves of these rapidly depleted micronutrients [5] .

Early diagnosis and correct intensive care, as well as careful and well-informed convalescence, not only ensure survival, but also the return to full somatic and psychological health. In severe/critical COVID-19 disease, there is activation of the \"immune and inflammatory reaction\" and \"the stress response\", two important homeostatic systems that work together to achieve survival. The former consists of 4 programs that unfold in tandem with the stress program: \"sickness behavior\", the \"acute phase reaction\", which includes hemostasis, \"the pain and fatigue afferent system\", as well as the \"tissue reaction\". The latter consists of the \"arousal/autonomic nervous system\" and \"the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\", which act synergistically and/or antithetically to the immune and inflammatory reaction in a highly complex, stochastic way.",

            "text": "Fig 1. In severe/critical COVID-19 disease, there is activation of the \"immune and inflammatory reaction\" and \"the stress response\", two important homeostatic systems that work together to achieve survival. The former consists of 4 programs that unfold in tandem with the stress program: \"sickness behavior\", the \"acute phase reaction\", which includes hemostasis, \"the pain and fatigue afferent system\", as well as the \"tissue reaction\". The latter consists of the \"arousal/autonomic nervous system\" and \"the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\", which act synergistically and/or antithetically to the immune and inflammatory reaction in a highly complex, stochastic way.",
