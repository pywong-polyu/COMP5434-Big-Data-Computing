Setting: Private practice. Design: Open-label, multicenter, prospective study. Methods: Seventy-five patients (75 eyes) who presented for cataract surgery evaluation with signs of dry eye disease were prescribed topical cyclosporine 0.09% for 28 days BID. Corneal curvature measurements, slit lamp exam, and Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire were evaluated at the initial and follow-up visits. Cataract surgery occurred 1 to 3 weeks after the second biometry visit. Refraction and corrected distance visual acuity measurements were performed 1-month post-surgery. The primary outcome was the difference in absolute prediction error of 1-month spherical equivalent refractive outcome before and after cyclosporine treatment. Secondary outcomes included the effect of topical cyclosporine 0.09% on ocular surface irregularity. Results: Sixty-four patients completed the study. The absolute prediction error of 1-month spherical equivalent refractive outcome was 0.39 \u00b1 0.30 D vs 0.33 \u00b1 0.25 D (P < 0.03) before and after treatment, respectively. The proportion of eyes that achieved the target refraction was greater based on measurements after topical cyclosporine 0.09% than would have occurred using pre-treatment measurements. Conclusion: Cataract surgery patients with dry eye who are prescribed topical cyclosporine 0.09% BID for 28 days pre-surgery showed a statistically significant improvement in the prediction error of the spherical equivalent outcome of surgery. Other measures of dry eye severity showed significant improvements after treatment.",

[3] [4] [5] These inconsistent preoperative corneal measurements directly impact the ability of cataract surgeons to choose the proper intraocular lens (IOL) implant. It follows that improving the ocular surface in patients with dry eye disease (DED) preoperatively will lead to greater refractive accuracy in lens selection. [6] [7] [8] This study was designed to determine if prescribing topical cyclosporine 0.09% (Cequa, Sun Pharmaceuticals) in patients presenting for cataract surgery for 28 days presurgery could improve surface regularity and the predictive accuracy of preoperative corneal power measurements. This study also examines the impact of topical cyclosporine 0.09% on irregularity of the ocular surface as measured by higher order aberrations (HOAs), corneal staining, tear breakup time (TBUT), and ocular redness.",

Our study purposely excluded those other treatments to avoid confounding the results. The pivotal study of cyclosporine 0.09% demonstrated superiority of this formulation over vehicle alone in treating DED. 12 It would, therefore, be reasonable to assume that the improvements in refractive accuracy shown in this study from cyclosporine 0.09% would be similarly superior to those of its vehicle. As with DED, corneal HOAs can be influenced by many factors, including seasonality, state of bodily hydration, hormonal changes, and any other factor that affects state of ocular hydration. Each of these can act at random and cause variance in the \"smoothness\" of the ocular surface. This may explain why 28% of cyclosporine 009%treated patients had a worsening of their HOAs in this study. Despite these noteworthy and random variables, a significantly greater proportion of eyes, 44%, showed improvement in this metric.",
