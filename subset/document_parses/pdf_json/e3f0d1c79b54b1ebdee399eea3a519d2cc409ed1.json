The audio data is generated in real time from a variety of RNA motifs that are known to be important in the functioning of RNA. Additionally, metadata relating to RNA translation and transcription has been used to shape the auditory and visual displays. Together these tools provide a unique approach to further understand the metabolism of the viral RNA genome. This audio provides a further means to represent the function of the RNA in addition to traditional written and visual approaches.",

Each auditory motive is derived from the actual RNA sequence or from metadata. This approach has been used to represent transcription or translation of the viral RNA genome. The display highlights the real-time interaction of functional RNA elements. The sonification of codons derived from all three reading frames of the viral RNA sequence in combination with sonified metadata provide the framework for this display. Functional RNA motifs such as transcription regulatory sequences and stem loop regions have also been sonified. Using the tool, audio can be generated in real-time from either genomic or sub-genomic representations of the RNA. Given the large size of the viral genome, a collection of interactive buttons has been provided to navigate to regions of interest, such as cleavage regions in the polyprotein, untranslated regions or each gene. These tools are available through an internet browser and the user can interact with the data display in real time.",

The viral genome of the first patient suffering from COVID-19 was submitted to GenBank [1] on 5 January 2020 some weeks after the first patient had been hospitalised in December 2019 [2] . Within 4 months over 4.7 million people worldwide had tested positive to the virus and the disease referred to as COVID-19 with approximately 315,000 deaths reported by Johns Hopkins University [3] . During this time a large body of evidence has arisen regarding RNA sequence homology to other SARS like virus strains [4, 5] and these studies may help identify targets for immune recognition.",

            "text": "This paper demonstrates that sonification of RNA sequence data may also be useful to understand how the genome functions. The audio is generated using two approaches. The rules governing gene expression have been applied to the process of generating a linear audio stream similar to the expression of a linear sequence of amino acids. These methods are based on our previous approach to sonify DNA sequences [6] . These methods have been improved upon to include multi-layering of related audio tracks, and the inclusion of audio that is representative of sequence metadata. Additionally, a real time animated display (as shown in Fig. 1 ) of both the biological process and the notes being generated has been implemented. These displays are important since the ability to sequence DNA has vastly outpaced tools for their visualisation [7] . The real-time visual animation is an important addition since with sonification data alone is it difficult to relate the auditory display to the underlying sequence information. The combination of the auditory and visual displays is more informative than either display in isolation. In these displays the auditory and visual output are produced by the same events, since the sequence is processed in a linear fashion, and it is thought that the multisensory integration improves the perception of each [8] .",

Another characteristic of nucleic acid sequences which is often used as a metric of genome status is the GC content which is often represented as a ratio. Typically in Coronavirus the count of U is above average and C is below average whereas A is preferred over G [27] leading to a relatively low GC ratio. In our approach two GC ratios were determined within a sliding window of 10 or 100 nucleotides respectively across the entire genome. Each time the GC ratio changed by an increment or decrement of 0.1 a note was generated and these were panned against each other in stereo. When there is no change between two adjacent features in an audio stream, the first instance of the feature was allowed to play for a longer period of time rather than generating another instance of the same note. This approach provides a brief pause in the audio layer and provides an opportunity for another layer to be distinguished in the auditory display. Together these four audio tracks create an audio landscape that can be heard across the entire auditory display of the genome. These RNA features are not specific to either transcription or translation nor are they specific to a particular region of the genome. Other sonified genome features were layered over this sonified landscape.",

Given that there are 7 scale notes in an octave it would require over 9 octaves to accommodate 64 trinucleotides. Using synthesised notes could overcome this limitation but this would entail playing shrill high pitched notes that would be grating to the ear. Therefore, linear mapping of 64 codons to individual notes was avoided. In the transcription display, tri-nucleotides were mapped to 16 individual notes since only the first and third position in each was considered. Since trinucleotides play no functional role in the process of transcription there was no loss of information content using this approach and the audio could be designed to complement the single nucleotides and di-nucleotides in the audio stream and avoid the mapping to shrill notes. Additionally, tri-nucleotides were not mapped to start or stop functionality and these are audible throughout the entire genome. Their occurrence had no further effect in the auditory display.",

The root tone and third note of the scale were played across two octaves with the limited 4 note mono-nucleotide sonification to establish a strong harmonic landscape throughout the playback. The drone generated from the GC content (which is sometimes invariant for periods of time) was also used to reinforce the foundation of the basic scale harmony. The G or C bases, as nucleotide, di-nucleotide or trinucleotides were each matched to higher octaves and A and U were mapped to lower octaves. This was done consistently between these audio streams in an attempt to harmonise the otherwise random note selection based on sequence information.

If a note sequence has identical adjacent notes then the length of the note is extended rather than being repeated. This creates space and clarity for other notes layered in the auditory display. Translation of the genomic RNA leads to expression of a large polyprotein following ribosome binding to the 5\u2032 prime untranslated region. However, from this genomic template the subsequent genes downstream from the polyprotein cannot be directly expressed presumably due to the stop codon at the end of the gene. In the display the sonification also stops at this point, however, play can be resumed to inspect the downstream sequence.

            "text": "One of the more interesting characteristics of the viral genome is the phenomena of discontinuous transcription whereby a template switch occurs during the synthesis of sub-genomic negative-strand RNA's [5] . Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) are involved in the synthesis of positive strand sub-genomic RNA from various negative strand intermediates [34] . TRS sequences are located in the untranslated regions between the genes and one model suggests that these facilitate transcription skipping to the TRS sequence located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region. This process is driven by complementary interactions between TRS regions to add a copy of the leader sequence to form sub-genomic RNA species. In these sub-genomic RNA's the polyprotein sequence has been omitted and ribosome binding at 5\u2032 end can read through and express the contiguous downstream gene sequence [35] . This functional behaviour of the RNA has been built into the auditory and visual display. By default, the process of auditory translation runs from the 5\u2032 end through to the stop codon at the end of the polyprotein, whereas transcription runs the full length of the RNA beginning at the 3\u2032 end. A toggle switch, labelled 'Translate as sub-genomic RNA' has been implemented to change these behaviours. When the toggle switch is selected during the transcription mode, the play-head will skip from any upcoming TRS region to the leader TRS1 located in the 5\u2032 region (mimicking the behaviour of the RNA replicase). Subsequently in translation mode with the toggle activated the play-head will, by way of example, skip from the leader TRS1 (omitting the polyprotein) through to the TRS2 region adjacent to the start of the S protein. Whilst the metadata use to drive this behaviour does not change the characteristics of the sound, it does change the selection which regions are sonified.",

For this run the 'Translate as sub-genomic RNA' checkbox was selected to mimic translation from one of the products of discontinuous transcription, a process upon which viral gene expression is reliant. Sonification of the entire genome in either direction results in an auditory display lasting up to 2 h in duration. Selecting the 'Translate as sub-genomic RNA' checkbox results in a shorter auditory display since shorter regions of RNA are processed. Example 2 again plays from the beginning of the plus strand sequence (as does Example 1), however in this display the play-head skips from TRS1 to TRS2 and immediately into the ORF of the Surface Glycoprotein (skipping a portion of the untranslated region and skipping all of the ~21,000 bp of the polyprotein sequence). The display highlights that the prior discussed uORF is skipped in the 5\u2032 leader of the sub-genomic RNA from which the genes downstream of the polyprotein are translated. The audio diverges from Example 1 after 23 s or so since the layered sound of the Surface Glycoprotein (an open reading frame) begins and continues to play for the rest of the display. Portions of the two stereo waveforms of the display from Example 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 3 . To the left of the cursor both stereo waveforms are essentially the same whereas to the right of the cursor the audio displays have clearly diverged as different sequences were processed beyond TRS1.",

Whilst this may only be an artefact of the analyses rather than an undocumented protein sequence it does demonstrate the auditory display is capable of detecting unusual features in the genome. It is also worth noting that frame shift mutations do occur in the polyprotein sequence through a process that is not fully understood giving rise to a protein sequence that does not follow canonical gene expression patterns. The tool highlights the position of other relatively long open reading frames within the display so that they can be considered in the analysis of genome function. The Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein sequence is followed by the ORF 10 sequence which is about one third the length of this parallel ORF. This analysis also highlights one of the properties of the auditory display which is that data in the three possible reading frames give rise to a triplet note pattern whereas data in two reading frames gives rise to a duplet note pattern (e.g. from 1 min 9 s through to 1 min 17 s). These note patterns make it easier to distinguish the features in the auditory display. In the last 1 min and 30 s of the display the genome alternates between gene sequences, transcription regulatory sequences, ORF10, stem loop structures and untranslated regions. These features have been further annotated in the video file with circles and arrows to emphasise their occurrence in the combined visual and auditory display.",

The tempo and scale patterns used for these displays are distinct from those used to represent translation. Additionally, no attention was paid to the occurrence of open reading frames or codon usage patterns since these pay no role in genome replication or transcription. Metadata relating to SL and TRS elements were sonified, however, cleavage information relating to the polyprotein modification did not seem relevant. The resulting auditory display is therefore simpler than that arising from translation. This can be heard in Example 4 which begins with sonification of the poly-A tail. In this example the play-head skips from TRS10 through to TRS1 which models the behaviour of discontinuous transcription. There is a check box on the page to switch between normal genome replication (whereby the entire genome would be sonified) and discontinuous transcription.",

            "text": "The Additional files 5, 6 and 7: Examples 5 to 7 in the supplementary files include regions already describe in the previous auditory displays. However, in these examples various streams of audio that contribute to the auditory display have been toggled on and off. Checkboxes are provided on the web page to facilitate this on the left-hand side of the note display table. The reason for this is two-fold. It provides a method to delineate how each feature of the RNA genome contributes to the auditory display. For instance, the sound of a TRS element or open reading frames could be highlighted (soled) or excluded (muted) from the overall sound of the translation display. This provides a better understanding of how the auditory displays are constructed. Secondly for those who are less interested in the science of Coronavirus and who are more interested in algorithmic music generation these tools can be used to compose and modify the inherent audio stream. The first of these, example 5 'Remix UTR through to Polyprotein' , highlights the contribution that GC content makes to the audio stream since these features are soloed at the beginning of the display. At one minute into the display audio from the translated amino acids are also toggled on or off to highlight their contribution. Example 6 'Remix ORF10 to the poly-A tail' highlights the off-beat syncopation between the dinucleotides playing every second beat against codons playing every third beat. Lastly Example 7 highlights how important it is to continually sonify individual nucleotides across the sequence, since this provide a sonic landscape to overlay the other features. To emphasise this the individual bases were soloed at the beginning and excluded at the end of the display. All previously mentioned example files have been uploaded as supplementary files.",

A playlist of four tracks has been uploaded to SoundCloud. These audio tracks are to be listened to without reference to the visual display. The intention of this is to engage the non-specialised community with the concept of 'the sound of the Coronavirus genome' and hopefully encourage people to delve a little deeper into the ideas behind the concept. Without the context of the display and without a clear understanding of the molecular biology of RNA virus the audio has to engage purely on its own sonic qualities-as an example of algorithmic music. In translation mode two auditory displays were prepared, the first (Covid-19 Translation polyprotein) plays through to the end of the polyprotein lasting 1 h and 8 min, covering approximately 21,500 nucleotides. The second audio track from a sub-genomic RNA (Covid-19 Translation discontinuous) skips the polyprotein entirely to the untranslated region prior to the Surface glycoprotein and then plays through to the 3\u2032 poly-A tail. This piece covers approximately 8500 nucleotides and lasts 27 min. In addition, two audio tracks were generated representing transcription/ RNA synthesis. The track representing genome replication (Covid-19 Transcription) last 2 h. The track representing discontinuous transcription (Covid-19 Transcription discontinuous) skips between TRS10 and TRS1 lasts only 1 min and 47 s.",

Previously an individual algorithm was used to produce an individual stream of audio from either a nucleotide, a di-nucleotide or codons and it was concluded that the sonification of codons was the most useful to identify mutations in repetitive DNA or to distinguish coding regions from non-coding regions [6] . Here we layer up to 12 layers of audio, each relating to an RNA feature of interest. These include metadata to layer RNA features such as consensus sequences in TRS regions, SL regions, cleavage sites in the polyprotein and interspersed untranslated regions between characterised ORF's. This approach produces a more detailed and rich auditory display which acts as a viable complement to an animated visual display.",

The polyprotein is the only product to be translated from the genomic RNA since this is thought to be the only ORF that has access to the ribosomal binding site in the 5\u2032 untranslated region. To mimic this the default behaviour of the tool is to stop at the in-frame stop codon at the end of the polyprotein. The tool can be restarted at the adjacent untranslated region or elsewhere using the navigation buttons. The default behaviour in transcription mode is to read through the entire genome sequence from end to end to mimic genome replication to produce",

A toggle switch has been implemented to mimic discontinuous transcription and in the first instance the polymerase will jump from TRS10 to TRS1 in the 5\u2032 leader region. This can be overridden using the navigation buttons but if another TRS region is encountered by the play-head it will also jump to the TRS1 in the leader region. In translation mode the same toggle causes the ribosome play-head to skip the polyprotein and skip from TRS1 to TRS2 and into the Surface Glycoprotein sequence. From this point the play-head will continue to the 3\u2032 end reading through the remainder of the genome. All other stop codons will be sonified but they will not influence the progression of the play-head. The auditory display in combination with realtime animation provide a unique insight into the large body of evidence describing the metabolism of the RNA genome. This provides another useful tool in the domain of genome browsers to further understand the complex function of the viral genome.",
