Systematic review was also performed on the available literature on the experience with HFNC in COVID-19 patients outside of ICU settings using the MEDLINE, Web of Science and Embase databases.

Twenty-one (68%) patients successfully tolerated HFNC and were subsequently discharged from the wards, while 10 (32%) patients had to be shifted to ICU for non-invasive or invasive ventilation, implying HFNC failure. Patients with HFNC failure had higher median D-dimer values at baseline (2.2 mcg/ml vs 0.6 mcg/ml, p=0.001) and lower initial SpO2 on room air at admission (70% vs 80%, p=0.026) as compared to those in whom HFNC was successful .A cut-off value of 1.7 mg/L carried a high specificity (90.5%) and moderate sensitivity (80%) for the occurrence of HFNC failure. Radiographic severity scoring as per the BRIXIA score was comparable in both the groups(11 vs 10.5 out of 18, p=0.78 ). After screening 98 articles, total of seven studies were included for synthesis in the systematic review with a total of 820 patients, with mean age of the studies ranging from 44 to 83 years and including 62% males. After excluding 2 studies from the analysis, the pooled rates of HFNC failure were 36.3% (95% CI 31.1% -41.5%) with no significant heterogeneity (I 2 =0%, p=0.55).",

The mortality rates among the critically ill have been found to be as high as 50-80% despite the highest level of care. [3] Given the spate of COVID-19 cases faced by nations such as India, the total number of critically ill cases, especially during the peaks, has overwhelmed its healthcare infrastructure. Maintaining oxygenation and adequate respiratory support with the help of non-invasive devices like nasal cannula, face mask, non-rebreathing mask, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) have been the pillars of management of this deadly disease.

In case of disagreements in study selection between the two reviewers, a third reviewer was consulted (AM). Although the included studies depicted cohorts of patients, they lacked control arm without exposure to HFNC, and thus we utilized the Joanna Briggs Institutes' (JBI) inventory for case series to assess risk of bias in these studies. [6] Continuous variables were summarized as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges, depending on the normality of distribution. Categorical variables were represented by frequencies and percentages. Analysis was done using a two-sample t-test for parametric variables, Wilcoxon rank-sum test for nonparametric variables, and Fisher exact test for categorical variables . A two-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. For meta-analysis, probability of HFNC success were pooled using a binary random effects model for proportions.

Helmet NIV is sparsely available in resource-poor settings and often needs more intensive monitoring. HFNC devices are comfortable, do not interfere with meals and speech, or cause pressure ulcers like face mask NIVs. On the other hand, they are unable to measure tidal volumes, deliver higher levels of PEEP or pressure support during inspiration. All major society guidelines deliberating on the use of oxygenation and ventilation devices in COVID-19 have advised use of HFNC in preference to NIV masks.

Also, inflammatory markers including CRP and D-dimer have been found to be more frequently elevated in severe COVID pneumonia, correlating inversely with respiratory function at presentation, and predicting mortality in COVID ARDS. [17] Similarly, retrospective cohorts studying patients in ICU [18] from Japan have found higher levels of D-dimer in those with HFNC failure compared with HFNC success [4.8 mg/L vs. 2.6 mg/L, p = 0.02], as well as ward settings such as Calligaro et al (1.03 mg/L vs 0.56 mg/L, p =0.002). [9] We found a D-dimer level of \u22651.7 mg/L to correctly classify 87% of HFNC failure cases and thus may help to triage patients at high likelihood of HFNC failure to early ICU transfer and a lower threshold for endotracheal intubation. Interestingly, D-dimer value of 2 mg/L was found to be an optimal cut-off of judging death in a Chinese cohort of COVID-19 patients from Wuhan. [19] Our present study reinforces the importance of D-dimer in predicting poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, albeit in the backdrop of HFNC failure.",

Several other tools have been used to predict failure of HFNC particularly the ROX index which has shown promise as its role has been replicated in several studies in diverse settings.

Thus, the review authors conclude that HFNC is a viable option with failure rates similar to those of ICU settings in such patients. The review was limited by the retrospective nature of the included studies as well as the small number of patients in the majority of them. The included patients among the studies differed with regards to the age, severity of hypoxemia at presentation, medical treatment protocol, intubation thresholds, as well ethical constraints (such as DNI order).A multicentric retrospective cohort reviewed 324 patients from ICUs in Wuhan, China and found relatively high HFNC failure rates of 55%, which was associated with age > 60 years, ROX index <5.31, thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 values. [26] Calligaro et al compared outcomes of HFNC in wards vis-a-vis ICU and found that the HFNC failure rate experienced in ICU (44/105, 41.9%) was lower than in wards (76/188, 59.6%). [9] In another study from an Intermediate Respiratory Centre in Madrid (Spain) using HFNC in COVID-19 associated ARDS, a failure rate of 52.5% was noted with overall mortality rate of 22.5% . [27] The higher rate of HFNC failure in ward settings reiterates that HFNC use, like all high flow oxygen therapy, has better outcomes in an intensive setup. Their conclusion that patients could be managed effectively with HFNC in the ward was borne out of necessity due to a major uptick in COVID-19 cases they experienced, similar to what India has faced in April -May 2021.",

In this study we found HFNC use outside ICU settings to be feasible, with a failure rate of approximately 32% in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia which is similar to the failure rate found in the systematic review (36%). HFNC failure in our cohort was predicted well by D-dimer at presentation, with a cut-off of 1.7 mg/L having a positive predictive value of 80%. HFNC use is ideally to be applied in ICU settings, however in these unprecedented times of overwhelming influx of patients in hospitals, HFNC use in wards could be a glimmer of hope for the patients awaiting ICU admissions.",
