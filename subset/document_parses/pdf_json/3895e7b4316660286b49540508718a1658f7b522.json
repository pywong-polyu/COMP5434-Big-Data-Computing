Computing Education Research (CER) is critical to help the computing education community and policy makers support the increasing population of students who need to learn computing skills for future careers. For a community to systematically advance knowledge about a topic, the members must be able to understand published work thoroughly enough to perform replications, conduct meta-analyses, and build theories. There is a need to understand whether published research allows the CER community to systematically advance knowledge and build theories.",

The goal of this study is to characterize the reporting of empiricism in Computing Education Research literature by identifying whether publications include content necessary for researchers to perform replications, meta-analyses, and theory building.

RQ2) Of the papers that have empirical evaluation, what are the characteristics of the empirical evaluation? RQ3) Of the papers that have empirical evaluation, do they follow norms (both for inclusion and for labeling of information needed for replication, meta-analysis, and, eventually, theory-building) for reporting empirical work?",

There was a split in papers that had some type of comparison between an intervention and some other data set or baseline. Most papers reported related work, following the expectations for doing so in the SIGCSE and CER community. However, many papers were lacking properly reported research objectives, goals, research questions, or hypotheses; description of participants; study design; data collection; and threats to validity.

We chose these years because they were the most recent editions of the conference when we began our research. In addition, these years coincide with ten years after the first ICER [1, 2] , a conference focused on empirical CER and just as the number of empirical research papers published at the SIGCSE TS began to increase. Therefore, the results of this analysis will serve as a baseline against which we can compare the results of a similar analysis in subsequent years.",

Their categorization considered eight categories based on a three-layered didactic structure including students, teachers, and goals/context at a classroom, organization, and societal level. Expanding their corpus of reviewed papers by 13 and considering venues beyond ICER (e.g., ACE, SIGCSE TS, PPIG, ITiCSE, ITiCSE WGR, CSE, Comput. Small Coll.), they found papers reported results at the course-level and focused on student characteristics and process. Eight papers included additional focus areas of students' conceptions on and actions to achieve course goals and content. The literature at that time did not provide adequate coverage of categories around content/goals and teachers. others (2007-2020) have conducted extensive classification studies of computing education literature for ACE [64, 65] , ICER [66] , ITiCSE [67] , Koli [63] , and NACCQ [68] . The classification scheme considers the context (e.g., subject matter or course); theme (e.g., what the paper is about like teaching technique); scope (e.g., extent of collaboration and work); and nature (e.g., distinction between research and practice) [62] . A recent classification of ITiCSE papers in 2020 found an increase in reported research over experience reports and that teaching and learning techniques remain a common theme in published work [67] .",

WWC focuses on four types of research: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental design, regression discontinuity design, and single-case design.

For example, quasi-experimental designs which lack randomization can only achieve the category \"meets WWC Design Standards with reservations\" due to the lack of randomization in the process.

Schmidt suggests five functions of replication: \"to control for sampling error, to control for artifacts, to control for fraud, to generalize results to a larger or to a different population, and to verify the underlying hypothesis of the earlier experiment. \" While Schmidt [59] provides a framework for replications and reproductions, he additionally provides a pragmatic reflection on practical publications of reflections given community biases towards original work by using follow-up studies and systematic replications. Follow-up studies may include direct replication of earlier work and additional experimental conditions that either provide generalizability or novelty beyond the replicative piece. Systematic replications provide a way of exploring the variation around a research replication modeled as a data matrix.

Specifically, the rubric was focused on aspects of a research paper that are essential for others to understand and potentially replicate the experiment, as evidenced by prior work [56, 72] and supported by guidelines in educational research [12, 19, 59, 60] . Randolph et al. 's rubric, however, incorporated more granular details in its categories. For example, Randolph et al. 's rubric took into account the computing domain from which the research intervention originated, including categories such as \"Visualization\" and \"Simulation\" as discrete options [56] . Our rubric takes a more high-level approach, focusing more on the general role of the intervention in how it relates to computing education. In this example, instead of noting whether the intervention incorporated \"Visualization\" or \"Simulation, \" we focused on whether the intervention was an assignment, a tool, a curricular innovation, etc.",

Further, we streamlined our evaluation methodology to make the application of the rubric to a large set of papers more feasible, while still maintaining the quality of our evaluation by examining the inter-rater reliability. Finally, we discovered some papers that exposed corner cases that we needed to address, such as papers that purported to be empirical studies, but reported no number of actual participants in the study.",

After resolving any discrepancies, this process resulted in a consensus on the type of research present in each paper.

            "text": "We classify a paper as empirical if its Evaluation Method is Descriptive, Survey, Qualitative, or Quantitative such that it contains empirical evidence addressing a research goal, question, or hypothesis. As shown in Table 3 , 351 of the 427 papers (82%) contained some type of empirical evaluation. While this number is quite high, note that we did not assess the quality or correctness of the empirical evaluation, just the presence of it. When considering specific venues, we found that TOCE had a lower percentage of empirical papers. This result is likely due to the fact that a portion of the TOCE papers were editorials and opinion papers, which we would not expect to contain empirical evaluation. On the other end of the spectrum, 24 out of 25 papers in ICER 2015 had some sort of empirical evaluation. When comparing these results with those from earlier literature reviews, we see an increase in the percentage of papers containing empirical evaluation over time. Valentine [72] found 21% of papers discussing CS1 and CS2 topics had \"experimental\" evaluation and Randolph et al. [56] found 35% of papers with behavioral, quantitative, or empirical research from a broader set of CS education venues from 2000-2005 contained empirical evaluation. Early surveys of ICER papers between 2005-2009 found 86% of papers had an evaluative purpose, appropriate for a conference focused on CER [40] . Lishinski et al. [36] 's analysis considered ICER and CSE papers between 2012 and 2015 and found that 71% of CSE papers and 87% of ICER papers reported empirical results. These numbers are lower than some of our results but consider a larger time frame. A review of SIGCSE TS papers from 2014 and 2015 found that 70% of papers had some form of empirical evaluation [5] . Our definition of empirical evaluation is more broad resulting in higher numbers during the same time period. When looking at data mining and automated learning research across venues, Ihantola et al. [29] found that 78% of papers reported on a study in a natural (e.g., empirical) setting. Our findings, along with complementary work, suggest an increase in the amount of empirical work since the early surveys by Valentine [72] and Randolph et al. [56] , which in turn should lead to an increase of CER in the SIGCSE community. The remaining research questions investigate the state-of-the-practice for reporting empirical studies to further understand the concerns raised in our previous work [5] . To answer this question, we characterize the papers using the CER Empiricism Assessment Rubric -Base Rubric. For each characteristic, we provide a table that reports the raw number of papers with that characteristic type followed by the percentage of the total empirical papers for the venue (based on the last column of Table 3 ). We gave some papers multiple values for a characteristic. In those cases, the percentages may total more than 100%. Additionally, we summarize the characteristic items in the total column as the percentage of all 351 empirical papers. (Table 4 ). The CER Empiricism Assessment Rubric describes each evaluation method in detail. However, for clarity we highlight the Survey and Descriptive/Persuasive evaluation methods more carefully here to describe their specific usage as an evaluation method. We coded papers as Survey when they described a community survey with the goal of describing the current state of that community (i.e. the paper does not involve any interventions). Qualitative and Quantitative evaluation methods may have surveys as one of their Data Sources in the study. We coded papers as Descriptive/Persuasive if its focus was to describe a current situation or to persuade the reader about a position. These papers do not test relationships among variables (statistically or otherwise).",

Papers that reuse an evaluation subject from a previous study by another author demonstrate replication and sharing within the broader community [19, 59] . In some cases, the authors conducted a study on an evaluation source that they utilized in earlier work, which we coded as Authors Elsewhere. Overall, ICER had the highest percentage of papers in which authors utilized evaluation subjects from other researchers (e.g. Other Modified and Other Not Modified). Comparison (Table 7) . By comparing the results from an intervention to the results from a baseline approach, a paper can provide additional support to strengthen a conclusion that the intervention caused the observed effect. The lack of Comparison leaves open the possibility of confounding factors influencing the observed result. However, when papers report a case study (i.e. an in-depth analysis of a single case), the lack of comparison is expected (e.g., None). Case studies can provide valuable findings that other researchers can attempt to replicate in their own environments, using more experimental approaches. Approximately half of the papers in each venue did provide some type of Comparison between two or more groups of participants. To promote comparisons between researchers, Margulieux et al. [41] suggest utilizing common, standardized, measurements. Participants (Table 8 & Table 9 ). The number of Participants in published studies can provide some insight into the strength of the conclusions drawn. Of concern are the papers that did not provide any numbers when discussing the participants in the study. Of the 349 empirical papers that should report subject data 3 , 98% of papers reported subjects in some form. This percentage is higher than the 83.7% of articles reporting subjects in McGill et al. [45] . We additionally report summary statistics for the number of participants by venue and across all venues. Since we are considering all publications in the venues rather than a subset based on an inclusion criteria, the mean and median number of participants is higher than the mean of 328 and median of 45 reported by McGill et al., likely due to the K-12 focus [45] . Type of Study (Table 10 ). An Observational study is performed in a natural setting in which the researcher collects data via observation without manipulation of the situation. Conversely, an Interventional study is performed by assigning participants into groups (e.g., control and experimental) and applying the treatment to the experimental group to measure its effect. Our use of observational and interventional are not intended as a direct relationship to qualitative and quantitative methods, but are instead a way of describing the setting. Observational studies are similar to Fincher's and Petre's [16] definition on in situ -the normal or natural setting. Interventional studies correspond to Fincher's and Petre's [16] settings of under constraints and in a laboratory where there is some direct intervention to the environment. There is a fairly even split between the two types of studies across all venues. This result indicates a nice balance in CER work. However, when looking at Quantitative work only, we do see an increase in the proportion of Interventional studies. These results suggest that there is a gap in using Qualitative methods to assess CER interventions.",

Overall, the most common data sources utilized in Quantitative, Qualitative, and Survey work were Surveys, Assessment Data, and Automated Data. In addition, the Qualitative studies frequently featured Interviews, Focus Groups, and Observations. Our categorization of data sources has some overlap with related work, but our focus was identifying high-level data sources. That means that categories in other studies, like attitudinal data described in Randolph et al. [56] was typically grouped in a larger category of \"Survey\". The analysis showed that 76% of the papers utilized only one type of data source, even if they collected multiple samples. By only utilizing a single data source, authors limit their understanding of the phenomena under study because they cannot triangulate the results to clarify or understand [16, 41] . The analysis also showed that 30% of all papers used Surveys as the sole data source. While surveys are an excellent tool for collecting attitudinal and self-report data, as the only source of data, they may not be robust enough to provide strong evidence to answer a research question. We did not collect data on the use of validated survey instruments as described in Decker and McGill [15] .",

These papers either did not highlight the summative statement in a meaningful way, through text attributes (e.g., italics or bold), callouts (e.g., boxes or bullets), or clear labeling (e.g., RQ1, Goal, etc.), or did not clearly label the goal of the paper, thereby requiring the reader to infer the context of the paper through other statements in the paper.

However, over half of the papers fell into the Weakly Supports Replication category because they lacked either full details about the participants or a clear label for the section of the paper describing the participants. A description of participants should contain demographic information to provide context for the results [6, 7, 19, 45, 60] . For example, when papers include student populations, the demographics should include: the number of participants, age groups, education levels, gender, race/ethnicity, region or area of the world, and prior computing experience [45] . Other student demographics that may be of interest depending on the study include student disabilities, socioeconomic status, family history (e.g., first generation college student), and veteran status. Demographics may vary based on the populations under study and the research questions. In addition to lacking demographics, papers often lacked a description of the recruitment process for the participants. Classroom research may lack the formal control and treatments present in laboratory or controlled studies. By clarifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, an author clarifies the participant pool and research context [6, 7, 19, 60] . Papers should also include a statement about how the authors recruited participants and obtained consent to participate in the study. This statement demonstrates ethical treatment of research participants and assure readers that authors are following standards for human subject research in their context. Study Design. Most papers contained a discussion about study design. We found a split between Strongly Supports Replication and Weakly Supports Replication. There were a number of papers that lacked a clear study design or methods section. In many of these cases, the study design information may have been integrated with the results, rather than as a separate independent section. By providing the study design information in a separate section, the authors help readers more easily extract important information about the design to support replication. In addition to not being labeled, some study designs sections omitted key information. One key piece of information is identification of the dependent and independent variables [7, 60] , which could be as simple as identifying the key item under observation or providing overview of an intervention.",

Most papers reported results and tied the results back to the research question, goal, or hypothesis (which may have been inferred if not explicitly stated). A large percentage of ICER and TOCE reached the level of Strongly Supports Replication. Papers with Weakly Supports Replication tended to have partial reporting of results, usually by not tying the results back to the research questions, goals, or hypotheses as suggested by APA JARS [7] .

A threats to validity section provides context to the study design and provides details on how readers should interpret the work in a broader context and potential biases that might impact the result [5, 7, 60] . Because CER is complex work, threats to validity describe how the authors controlled that complexity (or not) [5, 29] .

Utilizing standards can support this goal [6, 7, 12, 19, 60] .",

We encourage researchers to utilize multiple data sources to provide more robust insight to the phenomena under study and stronger answers to research questions. In addition, 29% of the papers used surveys as the only data source. There are many situations where surveys are an excellent form of data collection (i.e., understanding a community); however, in classroom studies, researchers should supplement surveys with additional information to provide stronger evidence to answer a research question. For example, a research question about how an intervention impacts student learning should not rely solely on student's self-report of their learning. Margulieux et al. [41] argues that collecting both process (e.g., progress or experience) and product (e.g., performance or outcome) data can increase the applicability of the results to a larger group of educators. Study Design. We observed a number of papers that lacked a clear study design or methods section. A study design section should tie the observation or intervention to the research question(s) and provide justification that the observation or intervention will support answering the research question(s). The study design section should clearly describe the steps of the study so others could replicate the study in their own environments. For subjective measures, the paper should contain a discussion of the coding process and the method for obtaining agreement or consensus among multiple raters. These items are important for determining how to properly interpret the results. In addition, citing seminal work and standards about the study methods strengthens the methods discussion and can help build the community's knowledge about CER methods [6-8, 12, 16, 60] .",

However, two of authors have been members of the program committee of SIGCSE TS for multiple years, including years volunteering as program and symposium chairs, so we believe that we do have the needed background. During the creation of the CER Empiricism Assessment Rubric, we did not explicitly review or reference other validated rubrics. Therefore, it is possible that we omitted some aspects of educational research project design. To address this threat to validity, after we completed our work, we compared our rubric to other guidelines for reporting and assessing empirical research study quality, such as APA JARS [7] , the What Works Clearinghouse Standards Handbook [12] and CONSORT [60] , as discussed in Section 2.2. We found that there was significant overlap in the core concepts of these other guidelines and rubrics with our own, indicating that our rubric captures many of the same reporting values.",

Further, some other venues accepted papers based solely on the abstract, rather than the entire paper, which we believe does not accurately represent the current state of empiricism. We chose the particular set of years to create a baseline on empirical work before more recent changes to paper tracks and reviewing guidelines at SIGCSE TS and other venues.

We do not consider the broader context of computing education during 2014 and 2015 and how that may impact the types of papers accepted. However, we minimize this limitation by focusing on characterizing empirical elements independent of the specific topic of the work (e.g., K-12 or CS1).

We all need to contribute: authors and researchers need to create and report well-designed, high-quality research studies or well-documented and supported experience reports; reviewers need to provide feedback not only on the novelty of the idea, but the quality of presentation; and the community needs to support replications and meta-analyses so we can grow our understanding of how to share computing education with the world.

Only 15.3% of the studies used qualitative methods and 10.4% of studies used mixed methods. The authors found that 44 of the 352 papers reviewed used some form of inferential statistics. Additionally, 120 of the 123 of the behavioral, quantitative, and empirical studies reported effect size.Sheard et al.[61] (2009) conducted a review of papers on the teaching and learning of programming, published in various CER venues between 2005 and 2008, which they classified as empirical.Of the 164 papers reviewed, 37% reported quantitative results, 21% reported qualitative results, and 45% utilized mixed methods.",
