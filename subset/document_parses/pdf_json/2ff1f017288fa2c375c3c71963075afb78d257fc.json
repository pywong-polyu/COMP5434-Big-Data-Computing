Social distancing is a core feature of these measures, even though it is widely known that social isolation can lead to loneliness, and both are strongly associated with anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide attempts in the general population (Elovainio et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2019) . In most countries, all non-essential businesses have been closed for several weeks to months, which will have a significant and long-term socioeconomic effect, including an increase in unemployment, financial insecurity and poverty (Barr et al., 2012; Brooks et al., 2020; Frasquilho et al., 2016) , which in turn will inevitably have serious effects on mental health. Concerns about one's own health or that of loved ones, as well as uncertainty about the future, can also generate or exacerbate fear, depression and anxiety (Fiorillo and Gorwood, 2020) . Overall, the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent measures are expected to be followed by a surge in mental health issues.",

Even though this population is expected to be more vulnerable to the mental health effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, only a small proportion of studies focus on patients with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses. Two studies in psychiatric populations in Spain and Denmark, and one study in the US including people with self-reported mental disorders, reported predominantly increased anxiety symptoms (Gonz\u00e1lez-Blanco et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Rohde et al., 2020) as well as depression and a two-fold likelihood for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Liu et al., 2020) .",

The perceived increase in social support is larger for patients with psychotic disorder compared to those with affective disorder (p=0.012).

However, affective disorder patients did experience a larger deterioration in general health compared to patients with a psychotic disorder, suggesting a larger (negative) impact on overall wellbeing. This finding may be closely related to our results on perceived social support and loneliness; whereas patients with psychotic disorder experienced an increase in perceived social support, this remained unchanged relative to pre-COVID in affective disorder patients. While 20% of the psychotic disorder patients indicated to be quite or severely lonely, this proportion was almost double for patients with affective disorder (36%). Past research demonstrates that, for affective disorder as well as psychotic disorder, higher levels of perceived social support are associated with better outcomes; patients with psychotic disorder were less likely to relapse within 6 and 12-month follow-up periods when their relatives were rated high on 'expressed emotion warmth', or when they perceived more positive affect from their family, which sustained after controlling for baseline symptoms, substance use and employment status (Lee et al., 2014) . Patients with depression who perceive their social support as poorer have worse outcomes in terms of symptoms, recovery and social functioning (Wang et al., 2018) . Loneliness has been investigated less extensively compared to perceived social support; the available evidence suggests that greater loneliness predicts poorer depression outcome, while a review on the effect of loneliness in psychotic disorders demonstrated a significant positive association between loneliness and psychotic symptom severely and it was suggested that a decrease in loneliness may aid subsequent recovery (Michalska da Rocha et al., 2018) . While social support and loneliness are exactly the most challenging aspects of the current pandemic, where social distancing is a key feature, healthcare professionals could consider involving family members in their contact with affective disorder patients more extensively and focus on the importance of social support and loneliness during the current pandemic.",

This conflicts with the only study available focusing on personality disorder, where 55 patients with a borderline personality disorder did not seem to be impacted by the outbreak or measures.

One important limitation of the current study is the absence of healthy controls, especially given that the COVID-19 outbreak and the restrictive measures appears to have a significant effect on mental wellbeing of the general population as well. Additionally, patients answered the questionnaires only once during the pandemic and were asked to provide information since the start of the pandemic and restrictive measures were instigated; unfortunately, data on symptom severity pre-pandemic were not available. Another limitation is the setting of the study; as UMCU is an academic hospital, our patient population may present with more complex symptomatology, which could affect generalizability of our findings. Also, although the size of the affective disorder and psychotic disorder subgroups was reasonable, this was not the case for the subgroups, preventing any clear conclusions to be drawn for personality disorders, developmental disorders and any other psychiatric diagnosis. Finally, our one-time assessment provided little information on the pre-COVID symptomatology of our participants. Despite these limitations, our findings indicate that COVID has had a substantial impact on mental wellbeing in this particular population; more robust studies are urgently needed to explore this further. Given the extended presence of COVID in societies worldwide, and the repeated re-introduction of measures to contain the spread, long-term mental health effects on the general population and in particular the vulnerable population of psychiatric patients should be continuously measured and monitored throughout the pandemic.",
