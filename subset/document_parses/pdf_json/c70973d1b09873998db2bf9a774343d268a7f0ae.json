In fact, HCWs represent the first-line fighters treating patients with COVID-19, and every day, they face a high risk of being infected and, consequently, of spreading the virus to other people [1] [2] [3] . HCWs are thus facing critical situations that increase their risk of suffering from the psychological impact of dealing with several unfavorable conditions, with consequences that might extend from psychological distress to mental health symptoms [4] . A body of evidence highlights that past infectious disease outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1), were associated with mental health issues among HCWs [5, 6] , mostly post-traumatic stress symptoms 2 of 16 (PTSS) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In particular, research by Xiao et al. [7] revealed that HCWs working in settings exposed to a high risk of SARS were 2-3 times more likely to have high PTSS levels than those not exposed. Therefore, consistent with Dutheil et al. [8] , the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is highly likely to also promote stress disorders in HCWs, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD, as has already occurred in past outbreaks.",

In 2013, the DSM-5 [10] encoded important changes for what concerns post-traumatic stress conditions, particularly PTSD. In addition to changes in the symptomatologic diagnostic criteria, the current edition of the DSM better specified Criterion A about the trauma, eliminating the need of q person's response to the event involving intense fear, helplessness, or horror (criterion A2) and better clarifying the characteristics of the potentially traumatic experiences including, for the first time, a repeated or extreme indirect exposure to aversive details of the event(s), usually in the course of professional duties (criterion A4). Given the current concern with the COVID-19 pandemic, a summary of the evidence is required to allow policy makers to enact guidance for protecting HCWs. In urgent circumstances such as the ongoing pandemic, rapid reviews are recommended by the WHO [11] . We conducted a review of the literature on PTSS in HCWs employed in hospital settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of the critical revision were to evaluate the related (1) risk assessment, (2) risk management, and (3) occurrence rate.",

Selected keywords were used to identify articles for this review of literature. The keywords were: \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", \"PTSD\", \"post-traumatic stress symptoms\", \"PTSS\", \"COVID-19\", \"Sars-CoV-2\", \"healthcare worker\", \"hospital\", \"assessment\", \"management\", \"occurrence\", and \"prevalence\". The keywords were systematically combined in order to conduct the literature search. For example, \"PTSD\" AND \"healthcare 2orker\" AND \"hospital\" was one combination. We aimed to identify original articles (i.e., non-reviews) using the abovementioned keywords with the following exclusion criteria: (1) not written in English; (2) studies focused on PTSS not related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) qualitative studies.",

In particular, 11 papers analyzed the pre-trauma risk factors and detected predictors of PTSS at individual level, 5 articles focused on post-traumatic risk factors of PTSS at both organizational and individual level, and 3 papers focused on both the pre-and posttraumatic risk factors. Regarding the individual pre-trauma risk factors, female gender, young age, low work experience, not living with a partner, and lack of training were found to be related to a high risk of PTSS. Most of the selected articles showed female gender at a higher risk than male, consistent with existing studies on PTSS in the general population and in HCWs before the COVID-19 outbreak [30, 31] ; given this gender susceptibility to PTSS, Gonzalez-Sanguino et al. [26] hypothesized that during the current pandemic, women tend to take on a caregiving role at home and, because of the need to balance this with healthcare work, are consequently at increased risk and more vulnerable in this situation of overload. By contrast, Song et al. [19] , in a cross-sectional study conducted in China, found increased occurrence of PTSS in male medical staff compared to female and concluded that this difference may be due to the timing of their study, which was conducted later than the comparative studies, when the psychological impact of stressors may have been minimized and the mental status of female medical staff may have gradually improved over time. Moreover, women tend to pay gradually more attention to their experiences and feelings and are more willing to express their emotions; this behavior leads to the selfregulation of emotions and, therefore, may defuse the impact of stressors over time [16, 32] . A convergence was found on the increased risk of PTSS in medical staff who are unmarried, divorced, or widowed; based on this finding, Song et al. [19] speculated that such HCWs receive less care and/or communication from their partner and may experience less family support, as highlighted by other studies that showed increased risk of PTSS in workers lacking social support.",

It is also possible that older HCWs are more experienced and better equipped both professionally and psychologically to deal with the stress of the pandemic. Consistent with this hypothesis, an Italian report [35] aimed at the organizational changes and management challenges presented by the pandemic found that the difficulties in patient care were likely greatest for the newer, lesser-skilled nurses. These results lead us to conclude that nurse managers should increase training and support related to COVID-19 care for younger, less experienced nurses in order to mitigate mental health problems, including PTSS [14] .",

Considering that the healthcare system has operated under the most challenging conditions during the period of pandemic, the related emotional and physical exhaustion in HCWs represents a major concern. Work-related consequences of this condition, called burnout, include poorer quality of care, professional mistakes, probably reduced attention to individual protection procedures, and increased risk of contagion in the workplace [36] . The impacts of burnout on the safety of HCWs and patients highlight the need for early identification of this health condition in the work environment and preventive interventions. In particular, management should be proactive in and supportive of improving working conditions to avoid burnout risks: implementation of training and technical updates on COVID-19 for HCWs, adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), ban of prolonged working hours, and availability of counseling services have been proposed as possible responses [18, 36] .",

[14] found a reverse dose-response relationship between lack of PPE provision and PTSS scores: the severity of PTSS was significantly lower as PPE provision frequency increased (PTSS scores decreased from 14.0 (9.0-18.0) to 9.0 (7.0-13.0), p < 0.001); moreover, working in potentially lethal settings but lacking PPE was found to be a worse factor impacting the mental health of HCWs and leading to depression and anxiety other than PTSS. Actually, PPI shortages are still a real problem for many health professionals, especially in areas with less prosperous economies or poor health services. The availability of effective barrier devices whose quality inspires trust is crucial to reduce the perception of danger of HCVs in the setting of transmissible diseases. In fact, even more than preventive behaviors, barrier devices are perceived as an extension of the body's ability to defend itself against external aggression, a sort of shield or armor able to physically stop the virus; in this sense, their continued availability is essential to fueling the resilience of HCWs [39] .",

            "text": "The articles focused on risk management showed the ways to moderate the occurrence of PTSS through HCWs' occupational training and the improvement of social support at work. Convergence was found about the need of occupational training targeted at pandemic and infectious control measures. Interestingly, Chew et al. [16] observed that passive training through educational pamphlets, emails, or websites was effective in minimizing PTSS in HCWs experiencing psychological distress. In particular, education on the natural history of the virus and the appropriate use of infection control measures, especially for non-medically trained HCWs, was a predictor of lower risk of PTSS compared to that for non-trained HCWs who received no such education. Moreover, brief passive psychoeducational interventions targeting high-risk groups were shown to be effective during the peak of the pandemic, although to date, the extent of their benefit remains unknown. Consistent with these studies, Caillet et al. [28] showed lack of medical training as an independent factor for PTSS in HCWs employed in COVID-19-intensive care units (OR = 2.155 (95% CI, 1.047-4.440), p = 0.04); given this finding, the authors suggested the need for training and re-training HCWs continuously exposed to the risk of both acquiring the disease and spreading SARS-CoV-2 to their family, friends, and colleagues. Regarding the protective role of training, interesting research was conducted by Tan et al. [17] evaluating, among others, traumatic stress among medical workers (doctors and nurses) and non-medical workers (caregivers, pharmacists, technicians. administration, office workers, and cleaners) in Singapore. The authors observed a lower mean PTSS score among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the SARS epidemic, when the severity of PTSS was three times higher than in the current pandemic. These findings led the authors to infer that respondents were more prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic, and they implemented infection control procedures following experiences from the previous SARS epidemic.",

A study by Zhang et al. [3] showed that simple standardized questionnaires can be used, which should be supplemented with a brief questionnaire assessing work conditions (demands, decision latitude, and support). A description of a protective program has been published by Cao et al. [41] based upon hands-on recent experience in China.

Supervisors should also be involved in monitoring the health of their staff. Finally, with regard to the coping strategies adopted by HCWs to minimize their stress levels, Vagni et al. [24] , in a cross-sectional study, showed that blocking negative or unpleasant emotions and thoughts reduced the arousal and intrusion levels of the trauma during the emergency phase of the pandemic, unlike problem-focused strategies. Based on this finding, the authors hypothesized that HCWs, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, frequently incur a lack of a cognitive process of emotions, thus failing to identify their emotional reactions, which tends to be associated with maladaptive behaviors leading to increased risk of PTSS. Moreover, problem-focused coping strategies were not found to be effective in protecting HCWs in the first wave of the pandemic, probably due to a lack of scientific knowledge about therapeutic and treatment procedures effective for COVID-19.",

In line with this finding, the study by Rossi et al. [25] , performed in Italy between 27 and 31 March, during the peak of the outbreak in Italy, showed a higher occurrence of HCWs being affected by PTSS, compared to studies conducted later, when the pandemic was controlled. Regarding healthcare settings, increased rates of PTSS were found in inpatient settings (up to 70%), particularly among HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients or employed in emergency hospital wards [14] .",

A body of evidence has been found about the following predictors of increased risk of suffering from PTSS: young age, female gender, not being a graduate, heavy workload, low medical training, not living with a partner, and low social support. Therefore, healthcare organizations should focus on the supportive resources available for HCWs in order to prevent the heavy psychological impairment related to PTSS in HCWs dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. In fact, PTSS involve chronic severe anxiety with re-experiencing of the traumatic event, flashbacks, nightmares, increased arousal, and reduced social life and could lead to PTSD. As people suffering from PTSD are more at risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death by suicide in huge proportions (2-5 times) [44] , the prevention of PTSD is a special concern for HCWs, considering that they are already in occupations which are at increased risk [45] , and people suffering from PTSS are prone to not seeking care because of barriers such as lack of information, being afraid of stigmatization, or the belief that symptoms may decrease with time [46] . Presently, a special effort is required to prevent PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic among HCWs facing COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare policies need to take into account preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, as soon as possible, including policies to implement regular screening of PTSS in HCWs. There is also a need for urgent intervention to identify and treat HCWs with PTSD, as such an approach can reduce the risk of chronic psychological impairment.",

Secondly, the cross-sectional profile of all the selected studies limits the possibility of drawing strong conclusions; therefore, caution should be taken in generalizing the findings. Moreover, the findings could have been influenced by organizational factors intrinsic to the local occupational context of each study and, consequently, not be true for all healthcare workers: in particular, the different (a) geographical contexts, (b) cultural variables, and (c) chronological periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in which the aforementioned studies were carried out may have influenced the different types of psychological responses to the same stressor among HCWs. Interestingly, the totality of the selected works was produced mainly in South East Asia and China and in Western Europe, and only two in the United States and Mexico. This evidence can obviously constitute a bias and somehow orient the reading of the topic on the basis of specific cultural backgrounds.
