In the realm of tourism, academia has researched the vital implications of transportation for tourism in the early time and concluded that transportation exists as a cross-domain behavior of tourists to get rid of the spatial constraints posed by geographical locations, which can meet their demands such as the needs for entertainment, consumption, experience, and learning (Ho et al., 2020) and facilitate the effective connection between points of tourist psychological perception. Specifically, the research on the connection of transportation covers a wide range of subjects, including the research on leisure and mobility-oriented use of railway transportation (Li et al., 2021) , bus competitiveness based on a comparative assessment of the experience (Altieri et al., 2021) , and the impact imposed by the accessibility of air transport on the development of tourism (Papatheodorou, 2021) . Previous studies have carried out numerous attempts on the regularity of impact imposed by the special incident of the COVID-19 pandemic, and elaborated on the new situation of COVID-19 with the current measures of pandemic prevention and control, in addition to the resource planning related to the demand preferences of tourists (Florido-Benitez, 2021) .",

Therefore, the tourist psychological perception could determine the planning of tour routes, whereas the planning of tour routes will also impose an impact on the tourist psychological perception in turn, which further influences the cognitions and sentiments of tourists. While elaborating on the relationship between the two factors, previous studies tend to focus on the direct connection of A\u2192B, which seems to be lopsided. Moreover, a paradox seems to exist between tourism and transportation, and there could be a potential impact of the tourism economy on transportation management (Scuttari et al., 2019) . In other words, the tourism behavior of the tourist themselves is either a positive or a negative choice of consumption. This perspective has presented a more reasonable intermediary variable, namely, the behavior of tourist flow, existing between tourist psychological perception and tour routes.",

            "text": "The population flow refers to a geographical phenomenon caused by tourist activities from one place to another. As evidenced from numerous studies, such phenomena as population flow and migration can be interpreted by Pushpull Theory. Specifically, the internal thrust serves as a physical expression of tourism motivation which is generally recognized by academia and constitutes a driving force caused by psychological imbalance or tension. In essence, it is deemed as the central value generated by tourist behavior that leads to human flow due to tourists' seeking mental novelty, and getting away from routine life . By leveraging the internal pushing force, researchers can systematically elaborate the causes of tourism behavior, and the objective of the tourism experience the tourists desire to obtain. From the academic perspective of the external pulling force, it is represented as the attraction of landscape attributes; such attributes are generally embodied by the cultural ambiance, accommodation, and transportation (Lee and Han, 2020) . Based on these analyses, academia has proposed the attribution model of loyalty to the tourism destination, and it is recognized that the tourists' perception of the external pulling force, which is derived from the destination, is generally embodied by the factors such as safety, expression of hospitality, and features of scenic areas (Suhartanto et al., 2021) . The application of the theories on both pushing and pulling has constantly been perceived as separate from each other, whereas the respective research has been carried out on the regularity of mental satisfaction and attraction of the destination. However, it shall be noted that the one-way understanding of a specific aspect would be a lopsided perception. In general, while the internal pushing force promotes people to engage in tourism activities, the external pulling force derived from tourism destinations will also work in tandem and lead to the chain reaction of individual mentality and behavior. Such regularity has further revealed the potential correlation between tourist psychological perception and tour routes. Therefore, this study aims to enrich the literature of tourist psychological perception, tour destination, and the behavior of tourist flow in the social communication perspective and further consolidate the research foundation.",

The status quo of the performance of both factors could better reflect the orientation of the tourism development at present. At the critical juncture where the tourism economy is facing a global crisis, it has become a topic worth pondering over in this era which concerns how to apply the tour route (line) and how to connect it with the tourist psychological perception (point). Based upon the above analysis, the tourism destinations in Jiangxi Province are chosen as the subject of this research to explore the mechanism of the relationship between point and line through an empirical analysis. Subsequently, the keywords on the tourist psychological perception for national 5A-level scenic areas are extracted by grasping, sorting, and analysis of online traveling posts. Integrated with the emotional response, the psychological picture on the tourist perception is illustrated for the space of tourism destinations. Furthermore, based on the latest map on the geographical distribution of arterial highways and express railways, the effective mechanism of the connected relationship between point and line is illustrated through observation. Therefore, the study has come to the conclusions on the logic of point-line in the space of tourism destinations and expects to be of great significance for the subsequent exploration of the developmental law of tourism and transportation.",

Previous studies on social communication of transportation combined cultural anthropology and human geography address the physical space influences on the social culture structure, e.g., traffic roads and routes can rebuild the tourist's transportation flow and shift the tourism culture into the psychological perception in terms of space, time, and social consciousness. Therefore, it is necessary to outbreak the single recognition of geographic space and explore a multi-dimensional perspective to interpret the social communication process and extend individual's psychological perception into the social structure change, for instance, the intensive geographic routes accelerate the flowing directions and scales of tourists, which produces more opportunities and social communications to bridge the tourism destination and the tourists' psychological perception.",

It is an activity that newly emerged after the advancement of human society to a certain extent, which is of self-evident industrial value. According to the definition of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (2019), tourism destination refers to \"physical spaces with or without administrative and/or analytical boundaries in which a visitor can spend an overnight\". It is the unit of product and service, and activity and experience along the tourism value chain, and a basic cluster of analysis of tourism. As a result, tourism has constantly drawn interest from the global academia and the tourist psychological perception constitutes the focus of academic research particularly. Judging from numerous studies, practical activities are generally guided by tourist emotions. From the perspective of modern psychology, the individual considers as a system of transferring and processing information. Considering the features of varying matters, the information can be coded and stored in consciousness before being effectively expressed through sound, shape, and text; such mode of experience is referred to as perceptual psychology (Skavronskaya et al., 2017) . Originated from the emerging theory of cognitive psychology in the mid-1950s, perceptual psychology has gradually become a separate subject of systematic research as the role of cognitive psychology is increasingly recognized by scholars with a systematic concept (Goldhaber, 2021) . Perceptual psychology constitutes the abstract expression of human emotion, which is subject to the influence of space and time. Specifically, during the investigative research conducted by scholars from Fairmount University, it is verified for the first time that the geographical space could impose a positive impact on the changes to human emotion (Fridgen, 1984) , thus pioneering the research on the relationship between environmental psychology and tourism. Subsequently, with the gradual advancement made in such research, the scope of perceptual psychology is constantly extended to form a new hot spot for studies on tourism at present.",

The forecasted perceived risks of destination, which have taken a holistic view on the relationship among the image of the destination, satisfaction of tourists, and risks, whereas analysis is carried out on the impact imposed by risks and safety on the tourism destinations. It has been widely recognized in the new era, covering such topics as the perception of risks related to health, economy, equipment, society, time, and opportunity (Jonas et al., 2011; Papilaya, 2018; Xie et al., 2020) . The environmental perception of tourist experience has been studied, which focuses on the level of satisfaction of tourists' demands related to the environment; He et al. (2018) has elaborated on the implications and value of tourists' environmental responsibilities and commitment. In addition, there was research on the recognition of local image, which has elaborated on the reputation of the tourism destination itself at the micro-level (Volgger et al., 2021) . At a higher level, the research is conducted concerning the perception of a nation and certain scholars found that the perception of tourism destinations is related to the shaping of national image to a certain extent (Dedeoglu, 2019) . Therefore, it shall be noted that regardless of the content perceived by tourists, the tourist psychological perception is originated from the mentality of tourists in essence, which is an organic component of life experience capable of triggering emotions and memories, thereby forming a collection of point distribution in time and space (Pearce, 2020) .",

On the other hand, the planning of tour routes shall focus on the rich architectural, cultural, and scenic values and interpret them based on the interests of tourists (Barzegar et al., 2019) . Although few scholars have proposed the opinions that the planning of tour routes shall focus on the psychological features of tourists, it is an integral part of almost all relevant explorations. While the tour transportation exists at the physical level and the tourist perception exists at the psychological level separately, the two factors can virtually have a strong correlation with each other.

Such behaviors are not only regarded as the outcome of tourist perception of their psychological needs but also the contributing factors to build the tour transportation, which exists as the trajectory of space and time for tourists to meet their needs of tourism (Davis et al., 2018) . According to the analysis, the behavior of tourist flow is subject to the influence of two major factors, the subjective psychological factor, and the objective environmental factor. These two factors are correlated with each other, thereby forming a distinct pattern of behavior on tourist flow. However, the integrated studies on the two factors are not common in current research. Instead, studies are carried out separately, revealing two distinct directions. The behavior of tourist flow is affected by the subjective psychological factor, the subjective cognition and psychological building of tourists constitute the major factors determining their decision-making on flow behaviors (Zahari et al., 2020) . The value perceived by tourists in terms of landscape display, infrastructure facilities, traveling costs, and the natural environment imposes a direct impact on their willingness to engage in tourism flow (Kim and Thapa, 2018) . Such perceived value will further affect the sensory image of tourism destinations and even the willingness of other tourists on a broader scale . The behavior of tourist flow is also affected by the objective psychological factor, such as geographical surrounding, spatial distance, and cultural connotation of tourism destinations, which will impose an impact on the decision-making by tourist behavior (Li and Katsumata, 2020) , can lead to the flow of tourists. In general, both sorts of studies are based on scientific reasoning. Although seemingly the two factors do not exist in the same space and time, the causal relationship is significant in this chain of connection: objective factors for destination \u2192 behaviors of tourist flow \u2192 subjective factors for meeting demand, \" which ought to be interpreted in the same theoretical framework. Therefore, this study put forward the point-line theoretical framework in the space and time of tourism destinations and attempts to regard the behavior of tourist flow as an intermediary between tourists and destinations, thereby forming research literature that considers the development law of both subjective and objective factors related with tourism destinations. In this study, we put forward the Hypotheses H2 and H3: H2: The optimization of tour routes can impose a positive impact on the generation of the behavior of tourist flow.",

In particular, the research on constructing the trajectory of space and time is of great significance to the marketing and management of tourism destinations, holds the key to enhancing environmental and exhibition design. It can improve the forecast of tourist flow as well as the distribution and allocation of such flow. Therefore, scholars have carried out studies on the behavior of tourist flow from numerous aspects. For instance, Li and Katsumata (2020) report the mutual correlation among the behaviors of decision-making on entrance transfer by tourists in inbound tourism, the time of entry at the crowded entrance and the time saved at the diversion entrance, and elaborated on the design rules of the schemes of controlling tourist flow. Du et al. (2020) study tourist flow driven by film broadcast, elaborated on the regularity from the perspectives of total tourism volume, the structure of tourism flow network as well as the mode of space and time of tourists, thereby identifying the mechanism of the behavior of tourist flow in the film-induced tourism. Caldeira and Kastenholz (2020) studied the regularity of tourist behaviors in varying spaces and times, elaborated on the necessity and feasibility of tracing tourist activities in a precise manner, and concluded on the vital implications of valuing the behavior of tourist flow in tourism to urban destinations. The extant literature examined the role of tourist flow during resource allocation by leveraging the data on digital footprint collected in the tourism diaries available online and concluded on the significance imposed by the attenuation of distance and the popularity of scenic areas on the spatial pattern of tourism flow, the uneven distribution of core nodes of tourism, the existence of structural holes, and the forming mechanism of core areas of tourism. Numerous studies have been carried out on the behavior of tourist flow, which contains in-depth explanations on the significance of research on such behavior. Based on the insights into the regularity behind, scientific policy recommendations can be provided for regional planning at the macro level. Based on the relevant research on tourist psychological perception, tour routes, and the behavior of tourist flow, it is found that the behavior of tourist flow could potentially connect the tourist psychological perception with tour routes.

Jiangxi Province has rich tourism resources and short-distance traveling to neighboring regions, thus, it is a place with huge potential for growth in the tourism industry. In total, there are 11 scenic areas with 5A grade recognized by the Scenic Area in Shangrao City. Specifically, these 11 scenic areas consist of natural and cultural landscapes, which offer an optimal choice for tourists. Moreover, Jiangxi Province has built convenient transportation networks of highway and railway in all scenic areas, facilitating a large influx of tourists. However, the provincial authorities have neither clearly planned the routes for tourism guidance, nor have they set up a provincial platform for big data incurring in tourism. Given this deficiency, this study attempts to verify the connection between tourist psychological perception and tour transportation in the tourism destinations located in Jiangxi Province. With the use of quantitative data of tourist psychological perception, this study focuses on the internal relationship between tourist psychological perception and tour routes and elaborated on the points and lines in the space and time of tourism destinations. The research findings are expected to free the Jiangxi Province from the shackles constraining the local tourism development, close the loopholes due to the absence of scientific guidance, and facilitate the growth driven by the regional tourism economy. Eventually, the study can lay a theoretical foundation for the point-line logic in the space and time of tourism destinations.",

To achieve the stated goals, five tourist groups from the same region with the same age (between 30 and Part two served as an extension of Part one, which provided a content analysis based on the regularity of the point-line interaction in the space and time perspectives, and this part included six steps. First, keywords of \"5A scenic areas in Jiangxi Province\" and \"tour transportation\" were searched at Chinese biggest social media platform of Weibo resulting in a total of 97,648 online traveling posts on the 5A Scenic Areas in the online data extracted from January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021. Second, keywords were summarized and sorted out by the frequency of these words based on the analysis of the collected online traveling posts. Third, we identified the emotional bias among the online traveling posts with the adoption of semantic analysis logic, which sorts out the regularity of expression of positive, neutral, and negative emotions. Fourth, we illustrate the diagrams of mentioned frequency and emotional distribution based on online traveling posts with the analytical software of Arcgis10.2 (Esri, Inc., United States) and holistically sort out the categorization of tourist psychological perception. Fifth, traffic lines of both railway and highway located in Jiangxi Province were proposed to illustrate a diagram of comparative observation on the tourist psychological perception and tour routes. Finally, we provide policy suggestions on the mechanism and thinking on the pointline connections in the space and time of tourism destinations, which located in Jiangxi Province. Therefore, based on the above observation, we proposed theoretical concepts which have practical implications driven by sound research findings.",

Regarding measuring the behaviors of tourist flow, the destination brand experience scale (DBE) is adopted including a subjective will, touring will on the demands of landscape features, touring will on the demands of landscape experience, and consumer rights as the 5 indicators of measuring the behavior of tourist flow (Zeng and He, 2019) . Regarding the measurement of the tourist psychological perception, the risk perception scale and satisfaction measurement scale on tourist perception (Pellicer and Camprubi, 2021 ) are adopted to set up three measurement indicators, which are environmental perception, risk perception, and feedback perception.

In the 1970s, the Swedish econometrician Wold (1975) proposed a partial least-squares regression method, which later evolved to partial least squares structural equation modeling (Mateos-Aparicio, 2011). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) estimates the parameters of a set of equations in a structural equation model by combining principal component analysis with regression-based path analysis (Hair et al., 2012) . Since the PLS-SEM method can effectively overcome the collinearity between observed variables, eliminate the effect imposed by the noise that is inconducive to regression, and provide the PLS-SEM model with good robustness (Sarstedt et al., 2020) , PLS-SEM is adopted as an effective tool in this study. Specifically, a single-dimensional examination is carried out on the second-level indicators of three first-level indicators. Based on the analysis results, the eigenvalue of the first principal component of each dimension is found to be greater than 1 and the rest of the eigenvalues are smaller than 1. Moreover, the results indicate that each dimension has passed the examination. Subsequently, based on the reflective measurement, the model validation of the point-line relationship in the space and time of tourism destinations (refer to Figure 2 ) is set up with the use of the PLS algorithm, and the software of Smart PLS 3.3 (SmartPLS GmbH, Germany) was applied. Based on the analysis results, the normed fit index (NFI) amounts to.846, which is consistent with the requirements of model fitting.",

Based on the preliminary analysis, among all data, 70,749 items revealed positive emotions (72.08%), 16,160 items revealed neutral emotions (16.46%), and 11,239 items revealed negative emotions (11.45%) (refer to Table 6 ). The research findings indicate that the tourism resources in Jiangxi Province have drawn extensive interest from tourists and in turn, the tourists have optimal experience feedback overall. However, there are still negative emotions that need to be alleviated through the improvement by customtailored schemes. It is also verified that the texts of 97,648 online traveling posts have significant features of emotion carrier and can serve as scientific and effective data for further analysis. Based on the datasets of cognitive vocabulary and word mentioned frequency, an analytical diagram on the semantic network of national 5A grade scenic areas in Jiangxi Province is established with the keywords of 5A scenic areas in Jiangxi Province and transportation, looking at the potential connection of the high-frequency words mentioned in the texts, tourists tend to focus on the city where the scenic area is located as well as the name and features of the scenic area, revealing the focus of tourists' assessment on tour transportation in Jiangxi Province. Specifically, the city where the scenic area is located will determine how tourists arrange their accommodation, traveling, and means of transportation, thereby forming a circle of tourism radiation with the city as the core. All the scenic areas located in the circle will become the preferential options for tourists, thereby forming a differentiated model of tour transportation and leading to the transport radiation-oriented tourism behaviors. In addition, from the outset of traveling, tourists generally establish a psychological presupposition for the intended destination to clarify their goals for tourism. Under such circumstances, the tour transportation will drive tourists to generate their traveling preferences, leading to target-oriented tourism. Destination selection is largely guided by perceptual psychology, especially the features of tourism destinations such as folk customs and expositions. Moreover, to design demand-oriented tourism tour transportation can connect the features of scenic areas in a circle-shaped manner. In the nutshell, there are three patterns of point-line interaction in the space and time of tourism destinations, such as transportation radiation-oriented tourism, target-oriented tourism, and demand-oriented tourism. These patterns correspond to three kinds of relationships, which are psychological preference and tour transportation radiation, psychological presupposition and tour transportation planning, and psychological inclination and interaction with the tour transportation circle.",

First, tourist flow represents the point-line connection in the space and time of tourism destinations. Previous studies have been carried out on the tourist psychological perception and tour routes, which is generally taken for granted that both factors are directly related despite the lack of logical reasoning. Therefore, this study has applied tourists' psychological perception as the point and tour routes as the line to elaborate their relationships. Based on our findings, although the point and the line do not exist in the same physical space, while there is a connection between the two factors. Specifically, tourist flow is initiated from the tourist psychological perception and the optimization of tour routes can impose a positive impact on the tourist psychological perception as well as the behavior of tourist flow. Furthermore, tourist flow can impose a positive impact on the satisfaction of tourists' demands of psychological perception and in turn, serves as the intermediary variable between tourist psychological perception and tour routes.",

The findings of this research are derived from the GIS observation and the analysis of the online traveling textual posts, which have integrated the subjective understanding with the objective perception of the image of tourism destinations. Moreover, the study has further empirically examined the role of tourist flow in connecting tourist psychological perception and tour routes and presented the logic of the point-line connection in the space and time of tourism destinations located in Jiangxi Province.",

Specifically, tourists tend to focus on the city where the scenic area is located as well as the name and features of the scenic area, which reflects the overall image, objective, and demand of tourists. The finding of this research has specified the psychological dimension of tourists' perception of the tourism destinations located in Jiangxi Province and pointed out the future orientation for the publicity of tourism destinations. In addition, the practical features of the tour routes located in Jiangxi Province are clarified in this study. Due to the features of mountainous areas, the means of transport in Jiangxi Province is primarily railways and highways, and thus, the connection between tourism destinations depends on such means of transportation. Judging from the GIS observation, the distribution of railways and highways in northern Jiangxi Province is denser than that in the southern part of the province, depending on the impact of scenic areas or the distribution of cities to a certain extent. Therefore, the planning and optimizing of tour routes shall focus on the effective connection among scenic areas, which is based on the extension and expansion of existing tour routes. The features of tourist flow in Jiangxi Province are primarily the connection between objectives and demands. Thus, it is necessary to monitor tourist flow and identify its regularity timelier and more accurately for future planning of tour transportation, and further enhance the system of tour transportation in Jiangxi Province.",
