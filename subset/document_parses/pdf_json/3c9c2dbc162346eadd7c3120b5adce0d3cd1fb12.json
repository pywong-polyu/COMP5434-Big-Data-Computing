Smart healthcare systems can be used for analysis and summarization of the huge amount of data and correlation between the analysis of patients' medical data and the other factors such as age, gender, the environment of patients. For example; in [4] , it is introduced that remote healthcare monitoring systems (RHMS) which are all in all three levels of design where the first level uses astute wearable sensors to accumulate physiological signs. Most wearable sensors constructors marketed detecting gadgets with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) correspondence interfaces, which lead to the advancement of different remote healthcare monitoring systems sending BLE correspondence interfaces for physiological patient information gathering. In many cases, due to their basic status, now and then chronic patients' well-being goes unnoticed until the infections form into an emergency stage and smart healthcare systems can provide instant diagnosis and rapid treatment. In [5] , it is proposed that a self-adaptative early admonition scores framework that regards a hazard assessment approach. It gives a manual and self-adaptative setup of the crucial signs observing cycle contingent upon the patient well-being status variety and the clinical staff choices. Some chronic diseases and critical conditions of the patients are being monitored at their homes and it may be needed to make decisions quickly and give emergency alerts at instant changes in the patients' health status. The authors proposed a novel system for coordinating outfit profound learning in Edge registering gadgets and conveyed it for genuine use of programmed Heart Disease examination [6] . This novel system conveys medical care as a haze administration utilizing IoT gadgets and proficiently deals with the information of heart patients, which comes as client demands. By employing AI and machine learning algorithms, IoT has explicitly made it achievable to anticipate the beginning of deadly episodes. For example, an armband with the sensors for the discovery of the surface electromyography signal (sEMG) is planned in [7] and the information gathered by these factors is handled by ML-based classification estimating algorithms and principal component analysis. This framework can distinguish the motions from the sEMG signals with a precision of around 97%.",

It is achieved by virtualization of network device functions to suit the requirements of the network in real-time such as efficient energy utilization, improved resource allocation and management, and enhanced security and privacy. Network slicing can separate the main physical layer into an unattached logical network for controlling the subject to network slice to accomplish the functions for the particular wearable gadgets [14] . SDN architecture is a key solution to make the traditional network structures less complex. SDN provides a global view of the network and a central control mechanism by separating the SDN control plane and data plane. Therefore, applications and services can be more programmable, manageable, flexible and more precise with the tools and mechanisms provided by SDN [31] . Thereafter; by using NFV, network resources can be efficiently allocated to virtual networks, and adding, removing, or updating a function for all or subset of end-users becomes much more manageable. NFV guarantees the improvement of asset provisioning to the end-users with high QoS and ensures the exhibition of virtual organization activities including least latency and failure rate [30] . In [32] , an SDN based smart healthcare framework with a lightweight authentication scheme is proposed. The proposed framework uses SDN technology to cope with load balancing and insufficient utilization of network resources. First, each IoT device transmits its measured sensor data to edge servers by a secured channel which is protected by hash functions and secret keys. After that, edge servers communicates an SDN controller to obtain an intelligent decision for load balancing and network resource utilization. By the centralized and intelligent control mechanism of SDN, the proposed framework can manage an efficient load distribution mechanism on the edge servers to ensure a low delayed and high-rated communication.

Due to the content of the patients' medical data, the privacy and the integrity of the data is a major concern that must be reassured for the patients. By the decentralized and encrypted data blocks that the blockchain can provide, it can offer upgrades in decentralized capacity, circulated record, interoperability, confirmation, dependable, changelessness just as the chance to encourage secure and astoundingly successful associations between nodes such as patients, medical care suppliers, providers on the smart healthcare systems. Besides, such nodes could be dynamically and proficiently increased and managed which means blockchain technology can handle the constantly increasing number of IoT devices that can be used. In [33] , a blockchain framework for smart healthcare is proposed to improve encryption and smart healthcare access control techniques and enhance the security and interoperability components to help privacy preservation. The proposed system utilizes a private blockchain swell chain to build up reliable correspondence by approving nodes dependent on their operable construction. So that, controlled correspondence needed to settle combination and coordination issues are encouraged through various nodes of smart healthcare infrastructure. Due to the nature of Blockchain technology, each newly generated block is added to the blockchain and that can be impractical considering the amount of medical data in smart healthcare systems. In [34] , A system based on blockchain named Healthchain is proposed. In this model, symmetric keys are used for decryption and encryption of the medical data and diagnosis on the user node and doctor node respectively. The medical data which is generated by the user node is stored on the various servers to reduce the amount of the data in the blockchain and only the hash strings of the medical data is added to the blockchain. Besides, traditional security schemes update the privacy of the user each time a user makes adjustments to the medical data. Instead of that, the proposed model offers users an opportunity of updating their keys independently with the medical data. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model beats the traditional security schemes at providing low communication and storage costs and a more reliable and secured system for their users.",

Applications 1) Electrocardiogram Monitoring (ECG): An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a straightforward test that records the heart's electrical action. A standard heart's movement checking by a handheld ECG gadget is both compelling and gives long-term cost investment funds to heart patients. Non-contact, capacitivecoupled anodes are likewise usually utilized for ECG signal securing as they don't require direct contact with the skin, empowering their utilization as wearable sensors implanted in dress [35] .

In [37] , the blood pressure measurement and calibration system are proposed. The proposed system has two ends namely as sensingend and server-end. The sensing end consists of wearable sensors which can monitor blood pressure and Internal Measurement Unit (IMU) that can provide a correlation between sensed data and its physical movement. The server-end provides management of network function, processing and analyzing the raw sensed data. The sensed blood pressure data and IMU data can be calibrated by extracting features and constructing matrix vectors of these features. The system utilizes a regressing algorithm such as KNN, SVM, Bayesian, DT respectively to predict the future values of blood pressure measurements. The regression process submits a root means square error of the raw data. At the same time, users and doctors can access the visualization of data analysis and working status of the system on the web application of the server system. Simulation results show that the root mean square values of the original blood pressure data is increased by the SVM regression model and Decision Tree regression model.

Doctors can provide more effective treatment in case of getting instant and accurate alerts by real-time monitoring and body sensors when the body temperature of patients get out of a certain range. 4) Rehabilitation system: Physical medication and restoration can upgrade, what's more, reestablish the practical capacity and personal satisfaction of those with some physical weakness or handicap. The IoT helps all viable remote meetings in exhaustive rehabilitation. Therefore, a smart rehabilitation system fills a crucial part of medication. For example, \u0131n this paper [38] , a smart framework for home rehabilitation of poststroke patients is proposed. In this framework called SmartPants, four biosensors are attached to the patient's body with plastic bands and a pressure sensor attached to the patient's feet to understand the distribution of patients weights. With these sensors, the framework can monitor that a patient does the exercises accurately and gives an alert sign to the patients for inaccurate exercising. The proposed system can measure and process the sensed raw data in the context of five of the most common exercise types for post-stroke patients. After that, the framework can classify the 64 features that are obtained from the sensors by the ML algorithms such as Random Forest, Random Tree, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron. The simulation results show that the recognition and classification of complex movements cause more inaccuracy than simple movements. On the other hand, the framework can provide good overall accuracy of around 96.5 percent independent of the ML classifier. is a smart healthcare service for elderly people who need continuous care in their homes. The main purpose of AAL is to expand the self-sufficient presence of more seasoned individuals in the homes favourably and securely. AAL can provide an independent lifestyle for elderly patients. Although the current home-based AAL care systems for elderly people offer very sufficient results, most of these systems have little contribution to providing mobility for their users. One of main causes of the above-mentioned issue can be considered as the turned off mobile phones because elderly people may forget to charge their mobile phones. Another cause is that if communication is lost between an IoT device and its assigned gateway, a short-range protocol cannot establish a new communication and transmit the medical data to an unknown gateway. In [39] , an emergency situation detection system for AAL is proposed. A BLE-based IoT sensor can monitor the heart-rate data and fall detection to transmit to a third party mobile relay. a mobile device which is called a donor in this system must be located in proximity to transmit the sensed data to a cloud server. Mobile relays, which are selected based on their Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values, are not responsible for processing the sensed data but only transmitted to a cloud server. Each IoT sensor can store the measured data in their storage module for the amount of this space. After the processing part, a server can send an SMS or e-mail to carers who are responsible for the patients if an abnormality has detected from the sensed data.",

The proposed model collects the individual's medical data related to temperature, heartbeat rate, blood pressure and transmits it to a healthcare expert for the betterment of the rural communities. Community healthcare means the utilization of medical data and analysis from a broadband perspective. Especially in crisis such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, and epidemic breakouts, there is a huge need for an overall analysis of individuals to take specific and efficient actions.

According to researches, many security attacks may occur at any layer of communication protocol. In [52] , the security threats such as confidentiality, authentication, privacy, access control, trust, and policy enforcement of IoT systems are analyzed and the existing security algorithms and techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard, Data Encryption Standard, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman are compared for addressing the security challenges. If medication information of patients is accessed by hackers and falls into the wrong hands, the treatment of patients can be influenced badly. In [53] , it is introduced that the noise-aware biometric quantization framework (NA-IOMBA) capable of generating unique, reliable, and high entropy keys with low enrollment times and costs with several experiments. In [54] , it is proposed that a reinforcement learning-based offloading algorithm for an IoT device achieves the optimal offloading policy via trial-and-error without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption, and edge computation model. In [55] , the authors propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. Besides all of these, the blockchain is contributing to securing these systems by providing a transparent system of data storage and leveraging smart contracts to secure the services. In the blockchain technique, every patient has the power to conceal their own data from different substances or individuals. The patient has the power to allow different people to see their reports whatever the patient needs to show them. Inside the blockchain innovation, at whatever point exchange or a test, for example, medication is prescribed to a patient, different elements may approve the test, medication cost or generally cost of treatment relating to specific infections has been reflected into the chain. The specialist or some other middle of the road or outsider may not profit the patient relating to pointless tests proposal to cover rock-solid bills of medicines, undesirable medication costs. In [56] , it is given that a security structure of medical services media information through blockchain procedure by creating the hash value that is provided to the entities databases so that any change or adjustment in information or breaking of drugs might be reflected in whole blockchain network clients. The proposed system uses blockchain technology for guaranteeing the security and transparency of the patient's record, report accessibility, and shipment process among supplier and client.",

Critical situations such as reduced blood pressure or rapid changing of heart rate or just simply fall of an elderly person remote monitoring healthcare devices must alarm the patients' doctor or their caretaker. In [57] , this paper presents a truthful and efficient mechanism that can prevent gateways from strategically misreporting the priority levels of medical packets, while incentivizing the base station to manage the transmission scheduling according to the desired manner. In [58] , a reduced variable neighbourhood search-based sensor data processing framework is proposed to enhance the reliability of data transmission and processing speed. This reliable transmission mechanism can recollect lost or inaccurate data automatically. According to the simulation results, this mechanism can improve the successfully delivered ratio as well as optimize the resource allocation. Providing an understandable, simple inference of healthcare status can be difficult because of the amount and the variation of the medical data. In [59] , authors present an IoT based smart edge framework for remote monitoring, in which wearable sensors send information into a novel programming motor that changes voluminous sensor information into clinically important results. the proposed architecture can provide a low-latency transmission and readable data visualization. The implementation occurs in a super-speciality hospital and a rural region that is 300 km far away from the hospital. The collected data by body sensors are transmitted to the edge servers or the cloud. After the normalization, the results are specified by the patient's medical records and the target disease. The outcomes of this proposed work are compared to the diagnosis of the real doctors and health workers and the proposed smart healthcare system has very efficient outcomes on providing readable visualization of medical information. In [60] , authors submit an android based framework that consists of data collection and data visualization modules, and the application development used in this system is to build a user-friendly interface to know the status of a patient by a medical expert.",

In particular, the computerized observing at the medical services place would be upheld by universAAL, while the physical activity checking in versatility would be empowered by the BodyCloud versatile administrations. At last, a particular programming application, comprising of a professional web tool (PWT), is additionally coordinated inside the correspondence design all together to give all the wellbeing administrations in an easy to understand route to the specialists.

The proposed model has three main stages such as pre-processing, feature selection and image classification respectively. In the pre-processing stage, the algorithm process the raw medical image data to utilizable data for the later stages. In the feature selection process, the algorithm selects only the features that are necessary for diagnosing specific above-mentioned diseases. In the image classification stage, the algorithm decides that if the outcomes of the previous stages indicates are malignant or benign.

Besides, there is a huge necessity of the large amount of the medical data which may be related to Covid-19 disease and DL algorithms and blockchain technology can be easily implementable solutions to the current systems. In [74] , a smart healthcare framework based on DL and blockchain technology with the utilization of beyond 5g and 6g communication is proposed. The proposed framework has three stages namely user stage, edge stage and cloud stage respectively. The medical information collected by body sensors or in-home gadgets at the user stage such as cough signals, eye signals, body temperature signals, etc., can be transmitted to edge servers which is close to the hospitals or medical centres. The edge nodes process the various kind of gathered medical data of users and the data which is collected by CT scans and X-rays. After that, edge nodes use DL algorithms such as ResNet50, deep tree, and Inception v3 to make classification and predictions for a low-latency diagnosis and alerts for their users. At the cloud stage, DL algorithms and blockchain technology is utilized to make accurate decisions on the large data which is collected and stored from different regions and countries. In this framework, it is also enabled that a mass surveillance system and a smartphone app for their users to make decisions on social distancing, mask-wearing and risky areas for Covid-19 disease. This framework indicates that the utilization of beyond 5g and 6g communication systems, DL algorithms and blockchain technology can be very useful weapons in the battle to pandemics such as Covid-19 pandemic and the hardware suppliers and the software designers which work on smart healthcare systems should develop and enhance frameworks and schemes such as this proposed one.",
