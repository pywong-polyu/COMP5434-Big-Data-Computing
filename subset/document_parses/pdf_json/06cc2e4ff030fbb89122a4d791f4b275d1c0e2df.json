Given its maladaptive nature, studies have investigated the antecedents of work avoidance, such as the role of personal characteristics and socialcontextual factors. The influence of one's classmates, however, remains under-explored. Drawing from social contagion research, we examined whether work avoidance goals spread among classmates. Questionnaires were administered to 1524 adolescent students nested within 50 classes. Two waves of data were collected one semester apart. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the data. Results showed that a student's work avoidance in Time 2 was predicted by his/her classmates' work avoidance in Time 1. These results held even after controlling for one's own Time 1 work avoidance. Moreover, work avoidance goals led to higher levels of disengagement and lower levels of engagement. The findings demonstrate that work avoidance goals are socially contagious and that they have negative consequences for students' engagement. This study extends our theoretical understanding of work avoidance by highlighting the vital role played by one's classmates in shaping students' avoidance of schoolwork and the deleterious consequences that come with it.",

Aside from these personal characteristics, social-contextual factors such as one's teachers can also influence students' tendency to adopt work avoidance goals (Seifert and O'Keefe 2001; Urdan and Schoenfelder 2006) . However, the role of classmates has seldom been explored. This is a crucial gap because there is a substantial body of literature showing that classmates and peers influence one's attitudes towards school and other learning-related outcomes (Li et al. 2011; Urdan 1997 Urdan , 2004 Wentzel et al. 2017) .",

While mastery-oriented students define success in terms of doing well relative to self-set standards and performance-oriented students define success in terms of outperforming their classmates, work avoidant students define success as doing the bare minimum or avoiding schoolwork entirely McInerney 2001, 2003) .

When students sense a lack of control over their learning (i.e., alienation), have a low need for achievement, and perceive that their need for competence is not being met, they are likely to pursue work avoidant goals (Jagacinski et al. 2019) . Emotions like boredom and helplessness (Jarvis and Seifert 2002) , as well as the lack of confidence, control, and task meaning (Seifert and O'Keefe 2001) , are also key predictors of work avoidance goals. The increasing difficulty of tasks that could lead to lower perceived competence could also foster work avoidance goals (Kumar and Jagacinski 2011 ; see also Legault et al. 2006 ). However, aside from these individual-level and psychological antecedents, not much has been done to explore potential social-contextual factors that contribute to work avoidance goals, specifically, the role of peers.",

            "text": "The early work of Levy (1992) has provided empirical explanations on the social contagion of approach-goals and avoidance-goals. In several experiments, Levy (1992) demonstrated that when an individual is deciding on whether to approach or to avoid a task, one's immediate social environment can influence such decisions. When students, for instance, see their classmates avoid schoolwork, this could prompt them to adopt the same avoidant behavior. The social contagion of avoidance is also reflected in behavioral studies. Broeren et al. (2011) found that when children are exposed to videos of their peers avoiding a novel animal, they tend to increase their fear beliefs and avoidance of the previously neutral animal. This demonstrates how avoidance behaviors could be modeled vicariously from peers. More recent experimental findings suggest that goal-directed behaviors, such as delaying or avoiding tasks, can be inferred from others' biases and influence one's behaviors, demonstrating social contagion (Devaine and Daunizeau 2017) . Despite existing research on the social contagion of avoidance goals in the laboratory setting, past studies have not attempted to empirically examine whether social contagion also applies to students' work avoidance goals in the real ecologies of the classroom. This study attempts to address this gap by examining how classmates influence one's work avoidance goals in actual classroom settings, and if so, what implications does the social contagion of work avoidance goal have on student outcomes like disengagement and engagement.",

Work avoidance goals can be contagious in the classroom due to observational or vicarious learning (Hatfield et al. 2009 ; see also Broeren et al. 2011 ). If people unconsciously mimic various emotions or behaviors from those around them (Hatfield et al. 2009; B. Wild et al. 2001) , it is also possible for students to imitate their classmates' work avoidance goals. Exposure to emotions and attitudes toward tasks often ripples to one's own behaviors (e.g., Barsade 2002) , which could also explain the spread of work avoidance goals. Hence, merely seeing or observing other students avoid their schoolwork can trigger the same goal in oneself by way of mimicry.",

            "text": "From a psychological perspective, a more specific type of social contagion called \"disinhibitory contagion\" can also shed light on how work avoidance goals are transmitted. Disinhibitory contagion (Levy 1992 ) explains how a person who has an approach-avoidance conflict (e.g., unsure whether to do schoolwork or not) can be freed from such conflict as a result of observing the decision of others (see also Levy and Nail 1993) . While similar to conformity, disinhibitory contagion is different as it begins with an internal conflict followed by the influence of the social environment to conform (Nail et al. 2000) , whereas conformity may not include the element of internal conflict. Given that work avoidance goals are not normative, students may feel a sense of doubt or dissonance before pursuing work avoidance goals. However, while in a current state of internal conflict as to whether to pursue a task or not, the presence of others who are already avoiding schoolwork can influence one to adopt the same detrimental goal. In short, when a student contemplates whether to tackle a task or not, observing one's classmates defer or avoid tasks can facilitate the pursuit of work avoidance.",

Group polarization pertains to the tendency for a group to create a stronger response tendency or behavior after members interact with each other (McGarty et al. 1992) . This means that when students interact with their classmates who pursue work avoidance goals, their own tendency to engage in work avoidance could magnify. This could also be further enhanced by the psychological core value of oneness (i.e., kapwa) among Filipinos, which emphasizes social harmony and the need to fit in with others (Enriquez 1986 ). There is the possibility that students who see their classmates pursuing work avoidance goals might also be more likely to pursue the same goal in order to fit in with their social group (Bond and Smith 1996) .",

This adds to the growing literature on work avoidance goals (e.g., Dowson and McInerney 2001; King 2014; King and McInerney 2014) by broadening the perspective from personal factors to social and contextual factors such as classmates. Understanding that work avoidance goals inferred from classmates can make one less engaged underscores the importance of early and effective classroom interventions. Engagement and disengagement are core pillars of student achievement and motivation (Skinner et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2017) ; hence, factors that influence both should be given due attention.",

This finding opens up potential areas of intervention on a classroom-level. Traditionally, when a student exhibits work avoidant behaviors, the tendency might be to put the onus on the student and to design interventions at the individual level. However, our work suggests that classmates may play an essential role in this process. Hence, interventions may also need to target the social environment, particularly one's peers. Mitigating the harmful effects of student work avoidance goals is crucial because if left neglected, work avoidance could lead to maladaptive school outcomes.",

First, although our finding was able to demonstrate the social contagion of work avoidance goals using the aggregate work avoidance scores of the class, a more precise analysis of ties and networks can provide more nuance to these results. Future work can benefit from collecting information on whom students spend the most time with and examining these ties using social network analysis. Second, we did not collect and hence cannot control teacher-related variables in our study. Teachers are also critical social agents and may play a role in whether and how work avoidance goals are transmitted among their students. Future studies can collect teacher-relevant data to control for such factors. Third, our study is limited by an over-reliance on self-reported data. Teacher-reported data on students' work avoidance goals or having more objective measures of engagement (e.g., progress reports) can strengthen the study findings. Finally, our study only focused on work avoidance goal, a maladaptive type of goal. Future research can consider investigating more positive school constructs (e.g., self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, growth mindset, engagement), and how such constructs could also be influenced by social contagion processes.",
