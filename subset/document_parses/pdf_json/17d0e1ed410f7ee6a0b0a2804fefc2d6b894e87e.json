            "text": "The medical use of oxygen has been widely and frequently proposed for patients, especially those under critical care; however, its benefit and drawbacks remain controversial for certain conditions. The induction of oxygen therapy is commonly considered for either treating or preventing hypoxia. Therefore, the concept of different types of hypoxia should be understood, particularly in terms of their mechanism, as the effect of oxygen therapy principally varies by the physiological characteristics of hypoxia. Oxygen molecules must be constantly delivered to all cells throughout the human body and utilized effectively in the process of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which is necessary for generating energy through the formation of adenosine triphosphate. If the oxygen availability at the cellular level is inadequate for sustaining the metabolism, the condition of hypoxia which is characterized as heterogeneity in tissue oxygen tension may develop, which is called dysoxia, a more physiological concept that is related to hypoxia. In such hypoxic patients, repetitive measurements of the lactate level in blood are generally recommended in order to select the adequate therapeutic strategy targeting a reduction in lactate production. Excessive oxygen, however, may actually induce a hyperoxic condition which thus can lead to harmful oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, possibly resulting in cellular dysfunction or death. In contrast, the human body has several oxygen-sensing mechanisms for preventing both hypoxia and hyperoxia that are employed to ensure a proper balance between the oxygen supply and demand and prevent organs and cells from suffering hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. Thus, while the concept of hyperoxia is known to have possible adverse effects on the lung, the heart, the brain, or other organs in various pathological conditions of critically ill patients, and no obvious evidence has yet been proposed to totally support liberal oxygen supplementation in any subset of critically ill patients, relatively conservative oxygen therapy with cautious monitoring appears to be safe and may improve the outcome by preventing harmful oxidative stress resulting from excessive oxygen administration. Given the biological effects of oxygen molecules, although the optimal target levels remain controversial, unnecessary oxygen administration should be avoided, and exposure to hyperoxemia should be minimized in critically ill patients.",

Interestingly, oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, including the air, sea, and land. In addition, oxygen gas is recognized as the second-most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, accounting for 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass. Supplemental oxygen as a medical treatment became common early in the twentieth century for patients who suffered discomfort or difficulty breathing, mainly helping them recover from a hypoxic state and relieve dyspnea. When the indications for oxygen therapy are considered, hypoxia, or hypoxemia is the most important pathophysiological state which needs to be appropriately treated and fully understood by medical healthcare providers.",

However, oxygen therapy can be extremely beneficial for treating atmospheric hypoxia by correcting the depressed oxygen level in the inspired gases and it is also markedly effective for treating hypoventilation hypoxia by facilitating the inspiration of more oxygen into the alveoli on each breath than with normal air. In cases of hypoventilation hypoxia, however, oxygen therapy provides no beneficial effects for resolving the simultaneous carbon dioxide retention often caused by hypoventilation.",

These chemoreceptors, most of which are located in the carotid bodies in the bilateral carotid arteries and a few in the aortic bodies along the aortic arch, are especially important for detecting changes in the oxygen concentration in the arterial blood. Once the oxygen concentration in the arterial blood falls below normal, the chemoreceptors become strongly stimulated and act as a systemic oxygen-sensing system, sending signals to the respiratory center to promote the respiration function.",

In addition to the various adaptive responses, maladaptive (pathophysiological) responses, including cardiovascular pathology, can be evoked due to persistent oxidative stress induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia associated with recurrent apnea in sleep-disordered breathing; these responses are reported to also be mediated by HIF-1 and HIF-2 in the carotid bodies [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

The strategy of targeting supra-normal levels of systemic oxygen delivery impressively proposed by Shoemaker et al. [13] in the 1990s based on the notion that a relative shortage of delivered oxygen causes a deficit in tissue oxygenation was not found to be a valid strategy based on the findings of several clinical trials showing no marked differences in mortality or morbidity in patients with sepsis compared with that of targeting normal levels of systemic oxygen delivery. As an underlying reason for this fact, the deficit in oxygen extraction was thus proposed to not be caused by insufficient systemic oxygen delivery, but rather by pathological heterogeneity of microvascular perfusion, thus resulting in the functional shunting of the microcirculation which clinically manifests as a reduction in oxygen extraction [14, 15] .",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the PO 2 in the interstitial fluid that surrounds the tissue cells averages only 40 mmHg, and the intracellular PO 2 further decreases to an average 23 mmHg, ranging between 5 and 40 mmHg by diffusion of oxygen molecules into cells.

However, the metabolic use of oxygen by cells to produce ATP with oxidative phosphorylation will theoretically remain constant until the intracellular PO 2 decreases to a level of 1 mmHg (Fig. 4) . Progressive lactate production would thus not occur until extremely hypoxic conditions (< 1 mmHg of PO 2 ) appeared.

Interestingly, lactate production, possibly via glycolytic flux, can be reduced by \u03b22-antagonists such as esmolol in septic patients despite reduced oxygen delivery [24] and by sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors in microdialized fluid obtained from the quadriceps muscles of septic patients [25] and in the animal skeletal muscle of induced glycolysis by epinephrine [26, 27] . Thiamin is also expected to exert some beneficial effects on septic patients and is thus considered a component of combination treatment with hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and thiamin (HAT therapy) [28] . However, a recent prospective randomized clinical trial [29] evaluating the efficacy and safety of HAT therapy for patients with sepsis and septic shock unfortunately failed to show a significant reduction in mortality and no marked improvement in any other secondary outcomes, which is consistent with the results of the retrospective study by Litwak et al. [30] . The combined treatment of such components could not fundamentally resolve cellular hypoxia in patients with sepsis, probably because it is not just a simple case of oxygen shortage.",

However, these phenomena would likely have little effect on the systemic condition in critically ill patients except for patients who have congenital heart disease complicated with intracardiac shunt or a postoperative status with Fontan circulation, wherein the pulmonary blood flow is easily affected by pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition to that, it is important to elucidate how the oxygen levels may affect to the inflammatory response. High oxygen concentrations may indirectly ameliorate the inflammatory response by reducing the degree of tissue hypoxia and, as a consequence, the levels of HIF [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , a key regulatory molecule of both hypoxia and the inflammatory response [43] . More importantly in clinical situations, if patients with chronic hypercapnia, such as moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or neuromuscular disease with ventilatory failure, are given uncontrolled excessive oxygen therapy, they may develop worsening hypercapnic (type II) respiratory failure and suffer severe respiratory acidosis, falling unconscious In the process of the stepwise reduction from oxygen to water, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. Both hydroxy radical and peroxynitrite are the most reactive agents among the species [44] . It should also be noted that resorption atelectasis frequently occurs after breathing high oxygen concentrations, even in normal subjects, by removing nitrogen from the alveoli and thus causing the more rapid diffusion of inspired oxygen into the blood, leading to alveolar collapse [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

The mechanisms underlying oxygen toxicity can primarily be explained by the formation of ROS including oxygen free radicals and biochemically based on the effects of hyperoxia. Oxygen free radicals have one or more unpaired electrons, which makes them very unstable. The most biologically significant agents among these ROS are hydroxyl radical (OH \u2022 ) and peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ) (Fig. 5) , both of which are oxygen free radicals. Peroxynitrite, the product of the reaction between superoxide anion (O 2 \u2212\u2022 ) and nitric oxide (NO), interacts with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids directly through oxidative stress [34] or indirectly through radicalmediated mechanisms [49] . These reactions trigger cellular responses ranging from the subtle modulation of cellular signaling to overwhelming oxidative stress that can induce cells to undergo necrosis or apoptosis [49] . The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying both hypoxia and hyperoxia is still developing [35, 43, 49, 50] .",

Mitochondria have a variety of anti-oxidant systems that promote the detoxification of ROS generated during aerobic metabolism [34, 52] . Superoxide dismutase (SOD), a family of metalloenzymes, exerts an anti-oxidant effect by enzymatically converting superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) (Fig. 5) . The expression of SOD is further induced by oxidative stress as hyperoxia in a process mediated by the oxidative activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF\u03baB [34] . Since superoxide anion can be a precursor of both hydroxy radical via H 2 O 2 and peroxynitrite (Fig. 5) , it is important to keep its steady-state concentration at the lowest possible level by utilizing such variable mechanisms as different SOD isozymes, reduction of cytochrome c, and lowering the pH [34] . Other anti-oxidant agents that eliminate ROS include catalase and glutathione peroxidase against H 2 O 2 , ubiquinol and coenzyme Q (acting as a reducing agent), vitamin E (interfering with free radical-mediated chain reaction), cytochrome c oxidase (acting as a peroxidase) [34, 52] , glutathione, and bilirubin [52] .

In addition, early exposure to a conservative oxygenation strategy (target PaO 2 55-70 mmHg) for 7 days did not reduce the 28-day mortality, the ICU mortality and the 90-day mortality (34.3% vs. 26.5%, 36.4% vs. 26.5% and 44.4% vs. 30.4%) compared with liberal oxygen therapy (target PaO 2 90-105 mmHg) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [55] .",

In an animal model of sepsis, hyperoxemia for 24 h was associated with elevated serum levels of ROS and inflammatory cytokines, an increased spread of infection and worsening multiple organ dysfunction [56] . From a hemodynamic perspective, hyperoxia induces systemic vasoconstriction, which increases systemic vascular resistance with consequent reductions in the heart rate, stroke index, and cardiac index [57] , while the inspiration of high-concentration oxygen causes pulmonary vasodilation, which directly decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. The oxidative stressinduced reduction in the bioavailability of NO, a crucial intrinsic vasodilator, seems primarily responsible for systemic vasoconstriction [58] . Furthermore, a recent study using isolated microvascular endothelial cells also showed a decrease in the cell viability and proliferation under hyperoxic conditions [59] . Hyperoxia reportedly impaired microvascular perfusion [60] [61] [62] and induced a paradoxical reduction in regional oxygen delivery [63] in various clinical situations, although other experimental reports have suggested a beneficial role of hyperoxemia in hemodynamic stabilization and the redistribution of blood flow to important organs [64, 65] .",

Exposure to 100% oxygen was reported to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in animal lungs, with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and the number of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils-evidence of histological tissue damage [66] [67] [68] . Although the highest concentration of oxygen as F I O 2 1.0 is definitely harmful, an F I O 2 higher than 0.6 instead of 1.0 can cause various degrees of lung injury in animal models [68] . A doseand time-dependent inflammatory pulmonary response was found in mice exposed to several degrees of hyperoxia [69] . The NO pathway, through which increasing NO can be produced in the presence of inducible-NO synthase (i-NOS) in epithelial, endothelial and immune cells, appears to play a key role in the development of pulmonary inflammation. Exposure to hyperoxia by enhancing oxidative stress may also induce the important production of cytokines and ROS [69, 70] , such as peroxynitrite, a cytotoxic oxygen free radical generated from the reaction between superoxide anion and NO (Fig. 5) . Hyperoxia-induced lung injury was also shown in i-NOS knockout mice compared to wild-type mice [71] , indicating that other mechanisms of lung injury aside from NO production by i-NOS exist. Hyperoxia in the lungs can induce both cell death by modulating the expression of specific genes regulating the cellular survival or death [72] and by cell apoptosis, mediated by caspase families [73] . The inhalation of NO as a therapeutic strategy for hyperoxic lung injury is still controversial [74] . The surfactant system may also be impaired by hyperoxia with the downregulation of surfactant-associated protein [72, 75] , alveolar instability and a reduction in lung compliance, especially during ventilation with high tidal volumes [76, 77] .",

However, the potential detrimental effects of hyperoxemia and ROS toxicity have been demonstrated in cases of ischemia reperfusion syndrome [87] . In animal models, the administration of 100% oxygen after resuscitation from cardiac arrest led to worse neurological outcomes than the administration of lower oxygen concentrations [88] . A recent prospective multicenter cohort study showed that early exposure to hyperoxia of more than 300 mmHg of PaO 2 within 6 h after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with a poor neurological function at hospital discharge [89] . Furthermore, a meta-analysis including 16 observational studies with adult post-cardiac arrest patients showed that intraarrest hyperoxia was associated with a lower mortality rate, while post-arrest hyperoxia was associated with a higher mortality rate [90] .",

However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate any protective effect of oxygen therapy in patients with cerebrovascular pathological events. A relationship between hyperoxemia and adverse outcomes was observed in patients with stroke [92] and subarachnoid hemorrhaging [93] , with a higher PaO 2 found to be associated with a greater risk of delayed cerebral ischemia. A metaanalysis showed a minor trend toward benefits with oxygen therapy in patients with stroke. However, controversy persists since various results have been obtained in different studies such as an improvement of the shortterm neurological score and a worsening of both the physical function and mortality after more than 3 months [94] .",

The results of preclinical studies remain controversial, although the use of 100% oxygen was positively proposed by several authors for its potential benefits [64, 65, 96] . In an ovine model of septic shock, hyperoxia was found to improve the hemodynamics and peripheral microvascular flow and to preserve the cerebral metabolism, renal function, and gas exchange [65] . Another similar study described the effects of hyperoxia on improving the organ function and attenuating tissue apoptosis without affecting the lung function and oxidative or nitrosative stress [64] . However, a recently published multicenter randomized control trial that evaluated the effects of hyperoxemia during the first 24 h and hypertonic saline infusion in patients with septic shock was prematurely stopped after 442 patients were recruited and assigned to a treatment group, as it was found that hyperoxemia was associated with an increased mortality (43% vs. 35%) and serious adverse events, such as ICU-acquired weakness and atelectasis [97] . In contrast, a post hoc analysis of 250 patients with sepsis enrolled in ICU-ROX55) revealed that conservative oxygen therapy did not result in a statistically significant reduction in mortality compared with usual oxygen therapy (90-day mortality: 36.2% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.35) [98] .",

Systemic and cellular oxygen-sensing systems based on the mechanisms underlying oxygen homeostasis exist to ensure a proper balance between the oxygen supply and demand. Various adaptive and maladaptive responses mediated by HIF can be evoked by hypoxia in the human body. Despite many clinical trials having been performed, no obvious evidence has yet been put forth to totally support a liberal oxygen supplementation in any subset of critically ill patients. Relatively conservative oxygen therapy with cautious monitoring appears to be safe and may improve the outcome by avoiding harmful oxidative stress resulting from excessive oxygen administration. Given the biological effects of oxygen molecules, although the optimal target levels still remain controversial, unnecessary oxygen administration should be avoided, and exposure to hyperoxemia should be minimized in critically ill patients.
