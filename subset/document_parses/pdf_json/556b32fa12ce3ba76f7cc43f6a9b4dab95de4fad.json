The SARS-CoV-2 spike, a surface-anchored trimeric class-I fusion glycoprotein essential for viral entry, represents a key target for developing vaccines and therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect vaccine efficacy highlights the need to identify novel antiviral strategies for COVID-19 therapy. Here, we demonstrate that nitazoxanide, an antiprotozoal agent with recognized broad-spectrum antiviral activity, interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike maturation, hampering its terminal glycosylation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage. Engineering multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant-pseudoviruses and utilizing quantitative cell-cell fusion assays, we show that nitazoxanideinduced spike modifications hinder progeny virion infectivity as well as spike-driven pulmonary cell-cell fusion, a critical feature of COVID-19 pathology. Nitazoxanide, being equally effective against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-spike and different emerging variants, including the Delta variant of concern, may represent a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 infections.",

The spike protein assembles into an inactive homotrimer, which is endoproteolytically cleaved by cellular proteases giving rise to a metastable complex of two functional subunits: S1 (bulb) containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) responsible for recognition and attachment to the host hACE2 receptor, and the membraneanchored S2 (stalk) that contains the fusion machinery (Fig. 1B) . S2 harbors the fusion peptide (FP), a short segment of 15-20 conserved mainly hydrophobic amino acids, which anchors to target membranes and plays an essential role in mediating membrane fusion by disrupting and connecting lipid bilayers of host cells. The FP is followed by two heptapeptide repeat sequences HR1 and HR2, the transmembrane anchor domain (TM), and a short cytoplasmic tail (CT) (Fig. 1B) [9] .",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 an unexpected polybasic furin-like cleavage site (FCS), harboring multiple arginine residues, located at the S1/S2 boundary was shown to be processed during S protein biogenesis for S protein \"priming\" [7, 15, 16] . Similar cleavage sites have been found in MERS-CoV, but not in other lineage B \u03b2CoVs, including SARS-CoV; importantly, the acquisition of similar cleavage sites is associated with increased pathogenicity in other viruses such as avian influenza viruses [17] , and it is suggested to be responsible for SARS-CoV-2 high infectivity and transmissibility [7, 15] .",

C, D Detection of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (\u03b1-spike) levels by immunoblot (IB) in whole-cell extracts (WCE) from human lung A549 epithelial cells (C) or MRC-5 fibroblasts (D) transiently transfected with the SARS-CoV-2 spike construct (SARS-2 S) or empty vector (Mock) at different times (C) or at 20 h (D) after transfection. E A549 cells were transiently transfected with the C-terminal Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike construct (SARS-2 S-CF) or empty vector and, at different times, WCE were analyzed for S protein levels by IB using anti-spike or anti-Flag antibodies. F, G Levels of S protein determined by IB using anti-spike or anti-Flag antibodies in WCE from A549 cells transiently transfected with the SARS-2 S (F) or SARS-2 S-CF (G) constructs, or empty vector for 4 h and treated with different concentrations (F) or 50 \u00b5M (G) of furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-CMK (RVKR) or vehicle (Control) for 16 h. H Oligomeric status of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in A549 cells. Gel electrophoresis (4% polyacrylamide) of WCE from A549 cells transfected with SARS-2 S construct or empty vector for 4 h and treated with different concentrations of RVKR or vehicle for 16 h. The different forms of the S protein were visualized by IB with the anti-spike antibody (top). Dimers and trimers are indicated. In parallel, S protein and S1 subunit levels in the same samples (8% polyacrylamide gels) are shown (bottom). I A549 cells were transfected with C-terminal Flag-tagged MERS-CoV spike (MERS S) or SARS-CoV spike (SARS S) constructs or empty vector and, after 4 h, were treated with RVKR (50 \u00b5M) or vehicle (Control). After 16 h, WCE were analyzed for levels of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S proteins by IB using anti-Flag antibodies. C-I Black arrows indicate bands corresponding to uncleaved S proteins (S0), whereas gray arrows indicate bands corresponding to the S1 or S2 subunits \u25c2 several SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations that, providing fitness advantages, facilitate a rapid spread of the virus, also creating great concern on whether some variants may affect the efficacy of recently developed vaccines [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

While the molecular mechanism of its broad-spectrum antiviral activity has not been fully elucidated, NTZ was shown to inhibit the replication of influenza and parainfluenza viruses by a novel mechanism, impairing terminal glycosylation and intracellular trafficking of the class-I viral fusion glycoproteins influenza hemagglutinin and paramyxovirus F spike proteins [28, 29] . We, therefore, explored the possibility that NTZ may also affect SARS-CoV-2 spike maturation, which is critical for SARS-CoV-2 host recognition, penetration and pathogenesis [11] . Herein we report that nitazoxanide interferes with SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein biogenesis, hampering its maturation at an endoglycosidase H (Endo-H)-sensitive stage, and hindering fusion and syncytium-forming ability of the original Wuhan-spike, as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta S-variants in human cells.",

To investigate whether NTZ may also affect SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression, human lung (A549 and MRC-5), colon (HCT116), liver (Huh7) and kidney (HEK293T) cells were transiently transfected with the SARS-2 S or SARS-2 S-CF plasmids and, after 4 h, were treated with different concentrations of NTZ (Fig. 2B ). As shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A , NTZ did not inhibit S protein expression and did not interfere with the S1/S2 cleavage; however, treatment with NTZ at concentrations higher than 0.1 \u00b5g/ml caused an evident alteration in the molecular mass of both the S0 precursor and the S1/S2 subunits. This effect persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. S1B ) with no change in cell viability, as shown by MTT assay (NTZ LD 50 > 50 \u00b5g/ ml). Interestingly NTZ treatment provoked a similar alteration of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike glycoproteins exogenously expressed in A549 cells (Fig. 2D) . Notably, the NTZ-mediated spike alteration was not affected by the presence of single and/or multiple mutations in the S protein, including the aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at position 614 (D614G) (Fig. 2E) , an S protein globally predominant mutation that was found to promote SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans [47] , and the N501Y, E484K and K417N mutations (Fig. S2A ) that have been recently described in the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants being monitored (VBMs) (https:// www. cdc. gov/ coron avirus/ 2019-ncov/ varia nts/ varia nt-info. html).",

The thiazolide-induced SARS-2 spike alteration was then compared to the effect of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Interestingly, non-glycosylated spike protein was not detected in the soluble fraction of tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. S4A, top) , an effect that could not be rescued by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib [48] , suggesting that non-glycosylated proteins are not promptly degraded via ERAD (ER-associated degradation), a sophisticated process for ER-to-cytosol dislocation and ubiquitin/ proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins [49] . In fact, immunomicroscopy studies revealed the formation of large S protein aggregates in tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig.  S4B ); in addition, the presence of a low-molecular weight band, corresponding to the non-glycosylated spike protein (\u223c 130 kDa), was detected in the insoluble fractions of tunicamycin-treated cell lysates (Fig. S4A, bottom) . Similar results were previously reported for the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) CoV [50] .",

            "text": "We have previously shown that nitazoxanide blocks the maturation of the influenza virus hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to digestion by endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), an enzyme that removes N-linked carbohydrate chains that have not been terminally glycosylated (Fig. 3D ) [52] , thus impairing HA intracellular trafficking [28] . To obtain insights on the effect of NTZ on SARS-2 S maturation, we, therefore, investigated whether nitazoxanide could affect S protein terminal glycosylation. SARS-CoV-2 S protein aliquots from NTZ-treated or control cells were subjected to digestion with Endo-H or with PNGase-F, an enzyme that removes all N-glycans [53] , up to 6 h after cycloheximide treatment and then analyzed by immunoblot. As expected, S proteins from both untreated and NTZtreated cells were sensitive to PNGase-F digestion (Fig. 3E ). On the other hand, a fraction (approximately 42-43% between 1 and 6 h after cycloheximide treatment) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was found to be terminally glycosylated becoming Endo-H-resistant in control cells under the conditions described; notably, S protein from NTZ-treated cells remained instead sensitive to digestion with the glycosidase up to 22 h after synthesis (Fig. 3E ). Since acquisition of Endo-H resistance is a marker for transport into the cis and middle Golgi compartments [52] , these results indicate that nitazoxanide, as in the case of influenza HA [28] , may impair S protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi complex. Confocal immunomicroscopy analysis using the ER-resident molecular chaperone calnexin as the ER-marker in fact revealed that the spike protein was largely localized in the ER of NTZ-treated cells (Fig. 3B ). Of note, treatment with nitazoxanide did not significantly alter the expression of calnexin or other ER proteins, including calreticulin, ERp57, ERp72 and the ER-stress regulated protein GRP78, suggesting that the drug is not triggering the host ER-stress response (Fig. 3F ). It should also be noted that, at the effective concentration, nitazoxanide does not alter the expression of the other SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins N, M and E when expressed alone (Fig. S5A ) or in combination (Fig. S5B ). It is important to note that the presence of large amounts of the nucleocapsid, envelope and in particular the membrane protein, which is known to interact with the S glycoprotein [54] , did not prevent the NTZ-induced spike alteration (Fig. S5B) .",

As these cells are known to possess low levels of ACE2 [8] , we generated A549 cells stably expressing the human ACE2 receptor (A549 hACE2 cells) for these studies. As shown in Fig. 6A , exogenous ACE2 expression resulted in a dramatic increase in SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusion between adjacent lung cells, confirming the important role of ACE2 in virus-directed syncytia formation.

Given the proportion of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in the associated global death toll, major efforts have been directed over the past months towards a global vaccination plan (https:// cdn. who. int/ media/ docs/ defau lt-source/ immun izati on/ covid-19/ strat egy-to-achie ve-global-covid-19-vacci nation-by-mid-2022. pdf? sfvrsn= 5a684 33c_5). At the same time, the emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 spike variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect the efficacy of recently developed vaccines [20] [21] [22] [23] , together with the short-lasting protective immunity typical of HCoV [65] , creates great concern and highlights the importance of identifying antiviral drugs to reduce SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality. Considerable efforts have been directed over the past months towards the concept of repurposing FDAapproved drugs that have the potential to greatly accelerate clinical availability by eliminating extensive safety testing required for novel drugs. So far, only the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir has been approved by health authorities for coronavirus infections [66] , whereas a different RdRp inhibitor, molnupinavir [67] , was approved by MHRA (Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) in the UK (https:// www. gov. uk/ gover nment/ news/ first-oral-antiv iral-for-covid-19-lagev rio-molnu pirav ir-appro ved-by-mhra).

More importantly several studies have recently shown an antiviral activity and clinical benefits of nitazoxanide in COVID-19 patients [39] [40] [41] [42] . In particular, a recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial has shown that a 5-day oral treatment with nitazoxanide (600 mg twice daily) prevents the progression to severe respiratory symptoms and hospitalization when administered to patients in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection [42] .",

This is in line with the cell-mediated mechanism of action previously reported for NTZ [26] [27] [28] [29] , and represents an advantage as compared to virus-targeted drugs, considering the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the CoV ability to undergo recombination events [63] .

This process, known as 'fusion from within', is mediated by newly synthesized S protein reaching the cell surface, fusing with receptor-positive adjacent cells, and causing the formation of giant multi-nucleated cells (syncytia).

In particular, fused pneumocytes expressing SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S proteins were observed post-mortem in lung tissues of 20 out of 41 COVID-19-infected patients, indicating that productive infection leads to syncytia formation [58] . Notably SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated syncytia were suggested to increase viral pathogenicity by destabilizing airway epithelia and creating lesions that may be difficult to repair [75] . Interestingly, it has also been recently shown that, whereas neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients inhibited SARS-CoV-2 particle-cell fusion with high efficiency, cell-cell fusion was only moderately inhibited, suggesting that syncytia formation during COVID-19 may not be effectively prevented by antibodies [68] .",

Briefly, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with an antibody recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GeneTex GTX632604). The primary antibody was detected with an Alexa-488 conjugate secondary antibody (Life Technologies, A11001), and nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Images were acquired on an Opera Phenix high content confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer) using a 10X objective (9 images per well, covering approx. 2/3 of the well), and percentages of infection were calculated using Columbus software (infected cells/total cells \u00d7 100). The percentage of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection was normalized to the internal controls (100% inhibition is derived from the average of the untreated uninfected control and 0% inhibition is derived from the average of the untreated infected control). Cell viability was determined by MTT assay [29] . Cytotoxicity values were normalized to the internal control (untreated cells, 100% viability). Tizoxanide antiviral activity assays against SARS-CoV-2 were performed by Virology Research Services Ltd (UK).",

After 16 h, cycloheximide (CHX, 100 \u00b5g/ml) was added (time 0), and WCE were analyzed for S protein levels at different times after CHX addition by IB using anti-spike antibodies (top) and quantitated by scanning densitometry. Relative amounts of S protein were determined after normalizing to \u03b2-actin (bottom). The plot of percentage of initial S protein levels in control (blue) and NTZ-treated (red) cells versus time is shown.
