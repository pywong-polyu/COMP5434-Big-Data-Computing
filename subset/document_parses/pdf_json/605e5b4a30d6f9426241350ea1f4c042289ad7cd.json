In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female teachers (n = 66, age: 51.5 \u00b1 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality profiles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality profiles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR, n = 32) and a high-resilience (HR, n = 26) group. The LR and HR groups differed at baseline in most of the self-report measures. Pre-post MOM significant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, affective empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can effectively mitigate the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.",

Individual adaptive or non-adaptive responses to adverse events depend on a variety of biological, cultural, social and psychological components, which can be encompassed in the concept of psychological resilience [43] . Past research found that resilience is directly related, on the one hand, to secure attachment [44, 45] , mental health [46, 47] , psychological well-being [48] , empathy [49] , mindfulness [50] and interoceptive awareness [51] , and, on the other hand, inversely related to childhood trauma [45] , anxiety, depression [52] and burnout [53] . Many studies have shown the link between measures of resilience and personality traits, such as harm avoidance, self-directedness, persistence and neuroticism [45, [54] [55] [56] [57] . The sample of teachers who received the MBI were studied here in terms of their resilience profile, generated on the basis of temperamental (i.e., mainly innate) and characterological (i.e., mainly due to personal experiences and education) measures taken at baseline with the Temperament and Character Inventory [58, 59] .",

In its structure it is similar to an MBSR course (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), the most common mindfulness meditation program developed by Kabat-Zinn [65] . Each MOM meeting is divided into three parts: a 15/30 min teaching on topics related to meditative practice, a 30 min guided MOM practice and a final phase during which participants can share their experiences and ask questions to the instructor. These are the topics covered in the teachings [64] : historical introduction to mindfulness meditation, what is mindfulness meditation and how to practice it, facing pain with a mindful attitude, attention and awareness, being in the here and now, disidentification, deautomatization, and letting go. The MOM practice, which is the same throughout the course, entails a 10 min session of paying attention to one's breathing (anapanasati meditation), 10 min dedicated to heeding one's bodily sensations (body scan meditation) and 10 min dedicated to being aware of one's emotional and mental phenomena (vipassana meditation). The main reference for these practices within the Buddhist context, from which mindfulness meditation was adapted, is the Satipatth\u0101na discourse [66] , although the instructions given to participants during the meditations do not refer to Buddhism. The same three practices are part of other contemporary, secular and psychologically-oriented mindfulness meditation courses, such as MBSR. After the first meeting, participants are provided with a 30 min audio recording containing a guided MOM practice (http://www.medita-mom.it/materiale), as an aid for home meditation practice. Participants are provided with articles and book suggestions on the topics covered in the course based on personal requests.",

It provides separate scores for anxiety, depression and global emotional distress. In a review of the literature, HADS showed a high internal consistency across studies for both anxiety (mean Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.83) and depression measures (mean Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.82) [80] .",

This analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regressions, separately for each question, using Group membership (LR, HR) and responses (properly dichotomized into two levels) to the question as predictor variables, and changes in the test scores from before to after the MOM course as outcome variables. A significant result was found only for question Q9 (\"How do you think you would have lived this period without the practice?\"), the responses to which were dichotomized with '0' for \"much worse\" responses and '1' for responses from \"somewhat worse\" to \"much better\", in relationship with the HADS Anxiety change scores. The pre/post MOM change in the Anxiety scores was predicted, by Q9 responses, differently in the two groups (b = \u22120.81, p = 0.02): in the LR group the changes in the Anxiety scores were not related to Q9 responses (r = 0.10, p = 0.57), while in the HR group these changes were negatively related to Q9 responses (r = \u22120.53, p = 0.005).

For this purpose, many scholars suggested the use of mindfulness interventions [94] [95] [96] [97] . However, studies assessing the impact of interventions that supported mental health in the early stages of the Covid-19 related crisis are very limited. Although the improvements reported in the present study cannot be attributed to the MOM course given the absence of a control group, the results seem remarkable, as we are not aware of any studies reporting improved psychological well-being when comparing persons during the Covid-19 outbreak with their precedent condition. Various studies instead reported a deterioration of people's mental health [5, 6, 98, 99] . At the same time, it should be recognized that our research focused on a specific population, namely state school teachers, who might have been less impacted by the emergency than other workers, as their jobs were not at risk and they were not professionally exposed to the risk of the infection (as were, for example, health care workers). Although a recent meta-analysis on the psychological impact of Covid-19 on medical staff and the general public found that the prevalence of anxiety and depression was similar in these two groups [100] , there is evidence that certain occupations, such as front-line nurses, were indeed more psychologically affected by Covid-19 than others [101, 102] .",

Since the two groups were different at baseline in most of the measurements, the final data generally showed that the low-resilience and the high-resilience groups were still different after the MOM course in the dimensions in which they differed at baseline (mindfulness skills, affective empathy, harm avoidance, the self-regulation scale of interoceptive awareness, the autonomy and environmental mastery scales of psychological well-being, anxiety and emotional exhaustion) and still similar in the dimensions for which they were comparable at baseline (the noticing, attention regulation, emotional awareness, body listening and trusting scales of interoceptive awareness). This pattern was different in the \"positive relation with others\" (PR) scale of psychological well-being, in character traits, in depression scores and in the total score of emotional distress, wherein the low-resilience individuals showed greater improvement than the high-resilience individuals (see the Time X Group interactions reported in Table 3 ). LR individuals therefore made better progresses than HR participants, although both groups reported the same amount of home meditation practice. This could be due, at least in part, to ceiling effects, because highly resilient individuals already showed healthy profiles at baseline for these measures. The findings could also be linked to different levels of motivation, across HR and LR participants, to commit themselves to the mindfulness intervention, which is usually presented as a way to alleviate one's psychological suffering [103] ; as described in our previous research [36] and similarly to the reactive control negative feedback process proposed in many theories of self-regulation [104] , participants who are in a worse condition (i.e., the LR group in our study) could be more motivated to engage for their own recovery.",

Although teachers generally appreciated the course and actively engaged in it, those in the low-resilience group reported significantly lower scores than their colleagues in the high-resilience group when asked about the usefulness of the course. This is quite surprising, because both groups equally benefited from the course, and the low-resilience group even had greater improvements in the emotional distress and character traits scores. Moreover, for the question on how one would have lived during the Covid-19 lockdown period without practicing mindfulness meditation, only teachers in the high-resilience group gave answers that appeared to be coherent with their self-reported decrease in anxiety levels: the more the anxiety scores decreased after vs. before the MOM course, the more the participants reported that the same period would have been much worse without the meditation practice. Both aspects that emerged from the answers to these questions suggest that less resilient individuals could have been less able to explicitly recognize the positive changes following the MOM training during the emergency situation. This should be taken into account in future mindfulness interventions in this type of context, in particular to motivate people to continue to use the learned technique even after the end of the intervention.",

First, both LR and HR groups received the same intervention; for the generalizability of our findings, a control group should have been employed. Second, again in relation to the issue of generalizability, future studies should include samples with younger participants than those included in our study, because younger teachers may react to states of emergency, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, differently than older teachers. Third, only self-report measures were used, which can be susceptible to socially desirable responding. Moreover, the questions about the evaluation of the MOM course were not taken from a validated instrument: in order to further explore how participants find and accept psychological/behavioral interventions, future studies could benefit from using instruments such as the theoretical framework of acceptability [110] . A final issue concerns individuals' spirituality. In different contexts and with different participants, past studies showed, on the one hand, that MOM practice may contribute to enhancing individuals' levels of implicit and explicit spirituality, [62] and, on the other hand, that spirituality is an important mediator of the positive health effects of mindfulness meditation [111] . Considering the strong connections between spirituality and healthcare (e.g., [112] ), it might have been useful to explicitly test spirituality in our study (beyond the self-transcendence scale included in the TCI measuring the predisposition of human beings toward spiritual feeling, thinking and behaviors), and it might be important that future studies investigating the psychological impact of health emergencies, and the effectiveness of related interventions, include the dimension of people's spirituality (e.g., [113] ).",

The solution found was stable (i.e., the same classification was invariably obtained by repeating the clustering procedure).
