Specimens were collected from esophageal lesions and peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. The tissue specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with lymphocytic infiltration typical of viral esophagitis. The remainder of the examination was normal. This confirmed that the esophageal lesions and upper gastrointestinal bleeding were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the esophagus.",

We found multiple round herpetic erosions and superficial ulcers in the esophagus, with lymphocytic infiltration, which is consistent with the endoscopic and histopathologic characteristics of viral esophagitis (5). Our findings indicate that when patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop upper gastrointestinal bleeding, infectious esophagitis from SARS-CoV-2 needs to be considered in addition to other potential etiologies of bleeding (5) . It is unknown whether other parts of the gastrointestinal tract can be similarly involved with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Instead, we continued intravenous octreotide and proton pump inhibitor therapy, and we infused a topical mucosal protective agent (aluminum phosphate gel) and iced thrombin solution through a nasogastric tube positioned at the level of the esophageal lesions. Thrombin can promote platelet aggregation and can generate stable fibrin through the coagulation cascade to promote coagulation, which we have found useful when endoscopic hemostasis is not possible. Therefore, although supportive management can be of value, endoscopic therapy may not be possible.",
