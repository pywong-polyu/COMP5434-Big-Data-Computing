They range in severity from benign to malignant, and treatment options vary from simple observation to mastectomy. As healthcare facilities are overburdened with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, properly triaging patients diagnosed with breast disorders is necessary for the optimal use of limited resources in developing countries. We are proposing a concise triage system for timely intervention among patients with breast disorders during the havoc of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Governing bodies worldwide have come up with guidelines on triaging patients during this pandemic (2, 3). As India is different from its counterparts with respect to patient load, availability of healthcare facilities and socioeconomic background of patients, it needs to adopt these guidelines with modifications to suit its population. Hence, we recommend triaging patients into the following three categories. Breast disorders are common among all age groups of females. Patients with breast disorders are often apprehensive due to fear of malignancy, which results in them seeking medical attention. All patients with breast complaints should be evaluated thoroughly and diagnosed in a healthcare setting. Currently, India is experiencing rapid growth in the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases postlockdown. Consequently, intensive care units and wards are filled with COVID-19 patients, leading to a scarcity of resources for managing non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, patients undergoing surgical procedures during this pandemic are at an increased risk of contracting the virus from the healthcare facilities (1). Therefore, decisions must be taken considering the risk-benefit ratio.",
