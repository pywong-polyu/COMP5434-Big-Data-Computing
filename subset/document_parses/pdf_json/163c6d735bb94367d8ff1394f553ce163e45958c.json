A critical unknown for policy planning is the number of people who have been infected and are no longer susceptible [3] . Tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibody presence can provide an indication, but both are prone to selection bias, under-representative population sampling and insufficient reliability [4, 5] . Here, we present an alternative to determine residual susceptibilities based on the analysis of observed population-wide disease dynamics data. For four highly-affected countries, we directly compared the dynamics in the largest metropolitan regions with the rest of the countries. We show that substantial susceptibility reductions are measurable in the metropolitan regions, which all continued in a phase of exponential growth of case numbers for a relatively longer time before public health interventions were introduced. Compared to these interventions, the reduction in metropolitan region susceptibility had a substantial role in the post-growth decline in infection rates. Reduced population susceptibility has far reaching consequences on future policy responses and disease forecasts including vaccine trial planning and, in the case of a second epidemic wave, higher population-normalised mortality rates for non-metropolitan regions.",

Yet, while SARS-CoV-2 has an extensive global reach, the portion of populations currently and previously infected remains unclear. Viral assays only capture recent infections, and even then can be unreliable. Serologic antibody testing to ascertain levels of prior exposure is burdensome, with unreliable testing validity and the potential to lead to systematic under-counting [13, 14] . Tracking epidemic data across populations and evaluating the time evolution of key markers such as death rates provides a powerful alternative devoid of these shortcomings. We utilise this approach to estimate the fraction of populations remaining susceptible to infection, which is a key parameter governing the course of an epidemic.",

            "text": "Generally, when a fully susceptible population is exposed to a new and contagious pathogen, an epidemic starts with an initial seeding phase when a small number of individuals are infected. Unconnected local outbreaks with unpredictable spread can occur due to variability in individual behaviour, the effects of potential 'super-spreading' events, and the non-uniform success of containment measures. This is followed by a phase of free exponential growth, during which 'track and trace' based containment is no longer feasible. Exponential spread of infections I(t) = e (\u03b2\u2212\u03b3)t over time t happens at a rate 1/\u03c4 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 > 0, when the average rate of new secondary infections caused by each primary infectious individual (\u03b2) exceeds the rate of recovery (\u03b3). 1 By reported daily death counts [15] , the disease dynamics of COVID-19 have fulfilled the condition of exponential growth in nearly all parts of the world. While onset of the exponential phase varies due to different seeding times, we find that the time constant of exponential growth is very similar over a wide geographical range. Fig. 1a illustrates this using data from four highly-affected countries: Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States [16] . The exponential growth is sustained as long as S, defined as ratio of susceptible individuals to the whole population, is close to 100%, and \u03b2 and \u03b3 are kept constant. Slowing spread and ultimately reversal to an exponential decline can be driven by Observed impact of susceptibility reduction on infection dynamics Variability in the nature and timing of public health interventions and resulting population behaviours are eventually reflected in variations across countries in the slowdown and exponential decline of the daily death counts. Fig. 1b illustrates, for the specific example of the United Kingdom and London, the timelines of public awareness (measured through frequencies of relevant internet search queries [18] ), government restriction stringency (measured as aggregate 'Oxford' stringency index [19] ), and visits to public meeting places (restaurants [20] , grocery stores, pharmacies, and public transit stations [21] ). Qualitatively, all measures correlate with one another, with both voluntary behavioural changes and the stringency of public health interventions resulting in reduced frequency of visits to locations of high infection risk.",

The difference in the effect of S for all eight geographic areas is shown in Fig. 3 , where the peak number of daily deaths is plotted against the time delay between when visits to public meeting places are reduced and when death rates begin to slow (see Methods). The country-level data cluster around a common delay time that is similar to the reported average time between viral exposure and death [25, 26] . This suggests that the main Figure 3 : The peak daily death counts plotted against the days between public behaviour change and the end of exponential growth leading to a peak rate. A correction factor from excess death data was applied to the reported rates (open circles) to derive the expected rates (solid circles), which are linked. The 4 countries exclude the corresponding metropolitan regions. The inset illustrates, for the example of England, a death count calibration by comparing reported COVID-19 deaths to the all-cause excess death data.",

While excess deaths statistics include deaths indirectly related to COVID-19 (for example, 'collateral' deaths due to healthcare systems being overwhelmed, or reduced visits to emergency departments), and the baseline value for expected deaths may not exactly reflect the current situation [17] (for example, in lockdown conditions the number of road traffic accidents will be lower than typical historical values), the number of excess deaths is nevertheless widely agreed to be the most reliable indicator to reflect the state of the epidemic, and alleviates some of the shortcomings associated with the reported daily deaths data [15, 18] .",

Figure 4 shows the result for the example of England and London. To evaluate the effect of initial public health measures on S, we only include the death counts until mid-May 2020, to avoid any effects of the relaxation of restrictions on the data. Public policy interventions helped cap the death counts in both cases, but the model demonstrates that a reduction of S is also a significant driver, particularly in London. We consistently find a comparatively smaller reduction in S outside metropolitan regions (see Extended Data). Without relaxation of initial interventions, containable infection levels (set at 10 new daily cases per million population 5 ) would be projected to occur in mid-July and mid-August in London and the rest of England, respectively (solid lines c in Fig. 4). In reality, a relaxation of restrictions (early-June 2020) and easing of travel restrictions have been initiated. As a result, \u03b2 increased, and slowed down the decline in death rates. In a forward projection based on a continuation of these new conditions with no further changes to \u03b2, containable infection levels in London and the rest of England could be reached in mid-August and the end of 2020, respectively (dash-dotted lines d2).

It is possible that technological improvements will allow a successful track-and-trace strategy at higher infection levels.

Methods Extraction of epidemic parameter values The key parameters of an epidemic can be extracted from epidemiological data (infection, hospitalisation or death rates), as long as populations are sufficiently large for demographic variations to average out, reported data are reliable, and interventions are relatively uniformly implemented. The similar observed exponential growth illustrates that this condition is fulfilled for the four countries of our study (the United States is an exception in some respects due to the heterogeneity of interventions and population behaviour). A key quantity is the time evolution of number of infected individuals. Due to insufficient quantity and quality of testing however, reported daily deaths D(t) are likely a more reliable measure of COVID-19 pandemic dynamics than the number of confirmed cases. The infection fatality rate (IFR) \u00b5, assumed to be a constant with time, is the probability that an infected individual dies from the disease and therefore validates D(t) as a proportional measure of infections, and our main findings do not depend on knowing the exact value of \u00b5.For our investigated areas, D(t) is obtained from[1,2]. Data for metropolitan regions is directly extracted from these sources, whereas data for the remainder of the country is derived as the national minus metropolitan data. Normalisation to the populations is based on the figures reported in Ref.[3].The mean time constant \u03c4i characterising the initial exponential infection growth, when the population is assumed to be fully susceptible, across the four countries is measured to be \u03c4i = (3.4 \u00b1 0.2) days. Using the clinically determined serial time Ts = (4.0 \u00b1 0.4) days[4,5], i.e. the average time between primary and secondary infections, we obtain the basic reproduction number R0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 = exp(Ts/\u03c4i) = 3.2 \u00b1 0.3, which is consistent with the literature[6][7][8]. It follows that the contact rate is \u03b2 = (0.43 \u00b1 0.02) d \u22121 in an unconstrained population, and",

The remaining fitting parameters characterise the magnitude of the response (TS l ), the time (t0) when the public behaviour change happened and time duration (TSw) over which the change occurred. As a comparable measure of the time when a significant reduction of \u03b2 is expected to occur, we choose the time t 50% when TS(t) is reduced by 50% from normal use as determined by the fit for each area, with the error determined as the one standard deviation functional prediction interval. As the time evolution of D(t) follows exponential trajectories (growth or decline) during periods of (near) constant parameters \u03b2, \u03b3 and S, we display D(t) on a logarithmic scale and apply fit functions to D log (t) = log[D(t)] to avoid heteroscedastic bias. For fitting, we restrict data to a time window starting with exponential growth and ending just before the introduction of the first relaxation in PHIs where an uptick in TS(t) is observed (mid-May 2020). As a model function for fitting we use D log (t) = Du \u00b7 t + (D l \u2212 Du) \u00b7 Dw \u00b7 log e t/Dw + e t 0 /Dw + C, (5) which represents an interpolation between two linear functions, and corresponds to an integrated sigmoid.

Findings outside the this range with potential country to country variations may still occur and be meaningful as effective average figures. Possible changes of \u00b5(t) with time during the course of the epidemic have not been considered here, but are not likely to be important in the light of the high quality of exponential fits to the D(t) data.Since S is generally time-dependent over the course of the epidemic, we use a standard Runge-Kutta iterative algorithm to calculate numerical solutions of the system of differential equations [Eqs.(6) to(8)], and incorporate a time dependence to \u03b2(t) using Eq.9. A cost function is generated, derived from the mean-squared deviation between the numerical solutions for the epidemic trajectory and the observed data D log (t), in each geographical area considered. The individual cost functions for the metropolitan region and corresponding country are combined (with equal weighting) to simultaneously respect both sets of data in each pair, and a Nelder-Mead based optimisation method is then used to minimise this total cost function.

This is supported by the observation that the time constants for initial exponential growth and the public behaviour changes (in timing and magnitude) are very similar for countries and their metropolitan regions following nationally homogeneously-imposed public health interventions, with the exception of the United States as already noted.

Then, rather than constrain our model by exactly these determined IFR values (which may be prone to systematic bias in the clinical data), we instead couple the fitting procedure between metropolitan region and rest of country by prescribing the ratio \u00b5 m /\u00b5 c in each case. The obtained ratios used as constraints for each fit were 0.664 (London/England), 0.985 (Lombardy/Italy), 0.887 (Madrid/Spain), and 0.854 (New York/US), and so the metropolitan regions have a generally younger population structure (and therefore lower effective infection fatality rate). Finally, the absolute values of \u00b5 are then returned as fit parameters (see Extended Data), and are consistent with those reported in the literature [29]. An exception is the higher value obtained for Italy of \u00b5 = 1.95%, which may be attributed in part to a comparably older population structure, and potentially the increased impact on healthcare capacities. The model can be extended by incorporating further changes in \u03b2(t) as public policy interventions and/or compliance and public behaviour change. For the example of England and London we note that a slight increase of \u03b2 c = \u03b2 m = 0.134 d \u22121 is consistent with the observations of D(t) from mid-May until the end of June 2020.
