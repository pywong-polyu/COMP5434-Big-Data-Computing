            "text": "F or the past decade, school-based health centers (SBHCs) have become one important solution for increasing access to care for children from disadvantaged backgrounds in the United States. 1, 2 This is especially critical given that children in underserved communities have higher rates of asthma, obesity, mental health disorders, and are less likely to receive routine care from community providers. 1 With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant nationwide K-12 school closures, SBHCs have had to adopt alternate strategies to continue providing care to school children in need, with some not having the capacity to remain open at all. 3 With the uncertainty regarding how schools will operate during 2021 and beyond, compounded with a \u223c7% unemployment rate nationally and loss of employer-based health insurance for thousands of families, there likely will be an even greater need for school-based health services during the current, and possibly, the next academic year. Furthermore, during school closures, many students have not been accessing health services previously received either in the school setting or even in the community. For example, there has been a 21.5% decrease in immunizations for children age 18 or younger compared to last year. 4 As schools re-open, they will need to be prepared for a surge in demand due to delayed care. In addition, there likely will be other services that SBHCs will be called on to provide, including mental health services and helping to facilitate testing and care for potential COVID-19 cases.",

Not only is the school prominently featured as the location of care, but also the parent is not routinely present during clinical encounters. This poses a challenge of how providers and parents engage. Parental engagement is crucial to ensuring student adherence with health care recommendations. 6 In the past, decreased parental engagement and poor SBHC-parental communication have ben notable problems in SBHCs, leading to challenges with implementing care plans. 7 As schools re-open, SBHCs must consider robust methods for increasing parental engagement and effective parent-school communication. A multimodal approach to communication that involves phone calls, virtual school meetings, sending information home with children, along with email, may enhance parental communication and knowledge about their child's health. Encouraging parent involvement, when possible, during a clinical encounter also may help.",

Additionally, families may be uncertain about how and where to access care when SBHCs are closed. Because many parents that rely solely on SBHCs are often uninsured, 8 this may lead to an increase in utilization of urgent care and emergency services, at a time when COVID-19 is already straining our health care centers, or not obtaining necessary care at all.",

Contingency plans should be made for students who have acute or subacute needs that are routinely managed in the school setting. One option to explore is allowing SBHCs to remain open, even if the school is closed.

This could have significant benefits for increasing access to health care in both urban and rural school communities. School districts have made notable strides in increasing Internet and device access for students during school closures, although a notable disparity in access to digital technology remains an ongoing challenge. SBHCs should take advantage of these online platforms, when available, to engage with families and offer remote health care access. One additional benefit of offering telehealth services is the option of having direct contact between the parent and provider, which will help strengthen understanding and compliance with treatment plans, as well as overall satisfaction in the family-provider partnership. 10 SBHCs also should learn from the experiences of community providers in how to optimize delivery of telehealth services and maintain student privacy.",
