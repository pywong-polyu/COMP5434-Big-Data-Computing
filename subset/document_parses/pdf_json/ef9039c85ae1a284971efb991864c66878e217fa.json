We identified transient M1 and M2 markers, including the main transcription factors that underlie polarization, and subpopulations of naive, transitional, and terminally polarized macrophages. We built bulk and single-cell polarization GRNs to compare the recovered interactions and found that each technology recovered only a subset of known interactions.

The controlled spatiotemporal expression of specific transcription factors (TFs) is at the core of these regulatory events and are hallmarks of cellular differentiation. Each TF interacts transiently with downstream targets that can be described as a dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) (Peter & Davidson, 2015) . The links that make up such networks dictate patterns of gene expression during development and differentiation (Gnanakkumaar et al., 2019; Peter & Davidson, 2011) . However, how GRNs apply in the context of cellular maturation in response to microenvironmental stimuli is less clear than in the context of cellular differentiation. While robust GRNs can be built by identifying temporal changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility using bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (Duren et al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2017) , whether current single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATACseq are able to recapitulate or improve bulk-derived GRN connections is unclear. Thus, a side-by-side analysis of GRNs derived using bulk and single-cell techniques in the same model system allows us to quantify the relative strengths of bulk vs single-cell.",

Macrophages are innate immune cells that reside in almost all tissues in the body and play key roles in maintenance of tissue homeostasis and clearance of apoptotic cells (Gordon & Pl\u00fcddemann, 2018) . While heterogeneous, most naive macrophages, termed M0, have the ability to polarize into two main activated states, M1 and M2, based on microenvironmental stimuli (Mills et al., 2000) . The ratio of M1:M2 is highly regulated and synchronized in homeostatic tissues (Fujisaka et al., 2009 ). M1 polarization is induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and/or the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and is therefore generally associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype, bacterial phagocytosis and antitumorigenic activity (Orecchioni et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018) . M2 polarization is induced by interleukins 4 (IL-4) and 13 (IL-13), and is linked to an anti-inflammatory phenotype, helminth resistance and pro-tumorigenic activity (Shaked, 2019; Gordon & Martinez, 2010; Reece et al., 2006) . While the M1/M2 framework has been useful to identify major polarization regulatory elements, macrophages in vivo may present more complex transcriptional signatures. Multiple M2-like subtypes with different gene expression profiles have been described such as M2a, M2b, M2c and M2d, which are determined by distinct inducing stimuli (R\u0151szer, 2015) . Nonetheless, the M1/M2 dogma of polarization is still a useful conceptual framework to illustrate the main functions as well as the regulatory mechanisms of both major groups (Budhu et al., 2021; Leonard et al., 2020; Bok et al., 2018) .",

For example, M1 plays an important role in promoting potentially fatal cytokine storms in high risk patients with COVID19 (Lara et al., 2020) . Also, prolonged activation of resident macrophages of the brain (microglia) increases both amyloid and tau pathology and may be linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis (Kinney et al., 2018) . The potential role of activated macrophages in disease has motivated the search for drugs to control polarization (Zhang et al., 2019; Guerriero, 2018) . One cancer treatment in development attempts to switch the phenotype of M2-like tumor associated macrophages to an anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype, highlighting M2's ability to repolarize towards M1 . However, little is known about the transcriptome profile of M2 repolarized towards M1. Although progress has been made in understanding gene expression in terminally polarized M1 and M2 subtypes (Orecchioni et al., 2019) , temporal transcriptional changes that drive polarization and repolarization remain poorly understood. Thus, reliable transient polarization markers are needed (Walentynowicz et al., 2018) . Recent studies demonstrated that the TFs STAT1 and IRF7 are upregulated in M1, whereas STAT6 is upregulated in M2 both in vivo and in vitro (Orecchioni et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019) . Albeit relevant, most of the current polarization studies focus mainly on changes in the STAT family of TFs, perhaps overlooking other transcriptional regulators (Ding et al., 2019) . Furthermore, no single-cell study to date has clearly captured the heterogeneity of the spectrum of cells that undergo M0 to M1 or M2 activation.",

A useful framework to study macrophage differentiation is the HL-60-derived human macrophage model induced with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (Dao et al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2017; Murao et al., 1983) . A considerable amount of gene expression and chromatin accessibility data has been generated using the HL-60 model system (Wenzel et al., 2020; Antwi et al., 2020; Cusanovich et al., 2015; Poplutz et al., 2014) . We have previously used bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to build GRNs of HL-60 differentiation into M0s (Ramirez et al., 2017) . Thus, profiling mRNA expression and chromatin accessibility during the transition from HL-60-derived-M0 to M1 or M2 with fine time resolution is a valuable approach to identify the genomic mechanisms that drive macrophage polarization (Chistiakov et al., 2018) . Last but not least, with the increasing adoption and throughput of single-cell techniques, we can now compare in a well-defined setting the quality of the networks derived using bulk or single-cell techniques.",

We identified 7,601 genes (alpha < 0.05, FDR < 0.05%) whose expressions vary in a time-specific fashion using maSigPro. These genes grouped into 18 distinct clusters from which we selected 11 clusters (4,760 genes) representing four major patterns of expression for HL-60-, M0-, M1-, and M2specific responses ( Figure 1B ). Each cluster contains distinct subtype-specific signaling molecules and TFs ( Figure 1B) . We identified 1,269 genes whose expression is higher in M1 (clusters Rc2, Rc5, Rc6 and Rc15) and 1,462 genes whose expression is higher in M2 (clusters Rc1, Rc7 and Rc13). We used an UpSet plot of maSigPro detected genes to identify a subset of 1,194 genes that had a similarly increased expression in both M1 and M2, and another subset of 149 genes that had a higher expression in HL-60 and M2 only ( Figure 1C ). These subtype specific genes showed distinct temporal expression patterns ( Figures 1D & S1B) . Canonical M1 polarization markers such as CXCL10, CXCL11 and GBP4 Mantovani et al., 2006) increased expression rapidly by 3 hours post-stimuli and peaked expression around 6 hours ( Figure 1D Upper). Canonical M2-associated genes CCL24 and CLEC4A (Makita et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2017) were also induced at 3 hours post-stimuli and reached peak expression around 6 hours ( Figure 1D Lower). M2 also showed higher expression of signaling molecule CSF2 that was recently shown to promote macrophages transition into an M2 phenotype (Li et al., 2020) . Therefore, important expression changes leading to terminal polarization of macrophage subtypes were established within the first 6 hours following addition of stimuli. We also identified a subset of pro-inflammatory chemokines present in M1-specific clusters, such as CCL7, CCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Gurvich et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2018) (Figure S1C ). M2 clusters showed higher expression of chemokines CCL24, which is upregulated in macrophages stimulated with IL-4 and CKLF, which has been associated with decreasing inflammation in dermal disorders . Overall, we found substantial and rapid differences in gene expression as the result of macrophage polarization.",

Pro-inflammatory TFs NFkB, STAT1, STAT5, and IRF1, which are known to control M1 polarization (Chauhan et al., 2018; Platanitis & Decker, 2018) , showed binding motifs enriched in M1 clusters ( Figure 2C ). JUND, an early target of LPS activation (Srivastava et al., 2013) , also showed binding motifs enriched in M1 clusters. In M2 clusters, RAR, STAT6, RUNX and MEF2 motifs were enriched ( Figure 2C ). While RAR and STAT6 are known to be essential TFs in M2 macrophage activation (Lee et al., 2016) , the RUNX and the MEF2 families of TFs are less welldescribed. RUNX2 has been implicated in the promotion of osteogenic events in both M1 and M2 (Dube et al., 2017; and MEF2 was shown to be repressed by IFN-g signaling (Kang et al., 2017 from scanning for motifs in clusters of regions identified as M1-or M2-specific seen in Figure 2C . Again, the NFkB, JUND, STAT1, and STAT5 TFs had more footprints in M1 than M2; RUNX and MEF2 families of TFs had more footprints in M2 than M1 ( Figure S2C ). The PU.1-IRF (CGGAAGTGAAAC) and the IRF1 (GAAAGTGAAAGT) motifs were enriched in the M1 subtype ( Figure S2C ). PU.1-IRF play important roles in macrophage transcriptional response to IFN-g (Langlais et al., 2016) . In summary, we found that distinct subsets of TF are associated with M1 and M2 polarization in our model.",

At the 3-hour time point, we detected 173 genes more open in M1 than M2, and 114 genes more open in M2 than M1 (log2FC > 1, FDR < 0.05), indicating some early changes in gene accessibility in response to polarization stimuli ( Figure 2D ). While gene expression changes leading to polarization were established rapidly within the first 6 hours, important chromatin changes occurred later in the time course, after 12 hours ( Figures S1D & 2D ). M1 stimuli led to increased IRF1 accessibility (as early as 3 hours of polarization) that was sustained along the time course. IRF1 is known to induce interferon transcription to drive M1 polarization (Platanitis & Decker, 2018) . The core macrophage signature gene MYO7A (Puranik et al., 2018) became more accessible in M2 at 3 hours and maintained higher accessibility throughout M2 polarization ( Figure 2D ). TFs MAFF and REL, both induced by LPS signaling (Baillie et al., 2017) , became more accessible in M1 than M2 later in the polarization process, at 12 and 24 hours, respectively ( Figure 2D ). TFs ID2 and STAT3 became more accessible in M2 than M1 at 12 and 24 hours post-stimuli, respectively. ID2 expression increased greatly and its genomic region became more accessible during M2 polarization (Figures 2D & 2E) . Thus, ID2 is a possible new M2 marker identified in our model.",

These footprintings were used to build subtype-specific GRNs (see Methods) focused on our 23 genes of interest represented as circuit diagrams ( Figure 3C ). At the \"genome view\" level we identified 141 interactions, which includes 48 total detected in M0 (6 specific (Table S1 ). We decided to also incorporate ID2, which is an inhibitor of some basic helix-loop-helix-containing transcription factors such as TCF3 (E2A) and TCF12 (HEB) even though it does not bind directly to DNA and thus does not have a motif (Rautela et al., 2019) . Interestingly, MEF2A binds to ID2 during M2 polarization, but not during M1 ( Figure 3C ). Three out of the five TFs targeting PU.1 in our model (PU.1, RUNX1, and RELB) have been confirmed in previous studies (Table S1 ) and their links to PU.1 are detected in both M1 and M2 GRNs. The targeting of PU.1 by NFkB2 was M1-specific. The binding motifs for NFkB1 and NFkB2 are nearly identical and we selected NFkB2 in our networks because it is expressed ~15fold higher than NFkB1 in M1. Moreover, NFkB2 expression is ~18-fold higher in M1 than in M2 and is therefore an M1-specific TF. This indicates that in our system, the NFkB pathway is upregulated specifically in the M1 subtype and plays a key role in regulating other transcription factors such as PU.1. In addition, the binding partner of NFkB2 (p100), RELB, is expressed ~1.5-fold higher than RELA in M1 and RELB expression is ~10-fold higher in M1 than M2. This indicates that in our system, the noncanonical NFkB pathway is upregulated specifically in the M1 subtype and plays a key role in regulating other transcription factors such as PU.1 ( Figure 3C ).",

We built separate SOMs and performed metaclustering for each of the scRNA and scATAC datasets separately ( Figure S4A ). Metaclusters were linked by finding the closest gene within 1Mb for each genome region to create a multiclustering (see Methods). These linked metaclusters were each searched for motifs via FIMO (q-value < 0.05) and the motifs were filtered by linked metacluster enrichment (p value < 0.05). This provided a total of ~500,000 unique network connections of which ~36,000 were TF-TF interactions. We identified 135 connections between the 23 genes of our core network ( Figure 6A ). We recovered previously studied interactions including E2F4 regulation of PU.1/SPI1 (Lachmann et al., 2010) , PU.1 regulation of CSF1 (Smith et al., 1996) , as well as IRF7's and MEF2A's auto-regulatory loops (Ning et al., 2005; Ramachandran et al., 2008) (Table   S1 ). The predicted auto-regulatory loop for IRF1 was also an interesting finding considering the wellknown feed-forward loop behavior seen in the IRF1-STAT1 regulatory system (Michalska et al., 2018) .",

MEF2A expression significantly decreased in our IRF1 KD in M2, thus potentially explaining PU.1 expression changes. Also, IRF7 KD led to changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in IL10RA, which is not a direct IRF7 target. However, STAT1 is a potential IRF7 target whose expression and chromatin accessibility change in IRF7 KD and therefore likely explains the expression changes of the STAT1 predicted target IL10RA ( Figure 7F ).

The bulk footprinting method we used is known to show high efficiency, but it relies on protein occupancy, which may not detect TFs with short-lived binding. Hence, important polarization TFs such as NFkB, which are very dynamic, do not always leave footprints in bulk chromatin (Sung et al., 2016) . In contrast, single-cell assays face technical challenges, including resolution, sparsity and number of genes detected. This last limitation is present in our analysis due to 3' tagmentation methods that produce dropouts. For example, we were unable to detect PU.1 reliably in our scRNA-seq experiments, which severely restricted our ability to detect its connections in the single-cell GRN. Therefore, neither method alone was able to predict all known interactions, and more complete results were obtained by a combination of both bulk and single-cell GRNs.",

We identified transient polarization markers and found that ID2 is a novel M2 TF. We constructed de novo GRNs containing both known and novel interactions that underlie M1 and M2 polarization. It will be interesting to investigate how much of this polarization network is conserved across heterogeneous tissue-resident macrophages in health and disease, especially in the context of microglial polarization in AD. In conclusion, we believe that despite the revolution and the great potential of single-cell biology, bulk results are still needed for building more comprehensive and accurate GRNs where practical, i.e., where we can isolate relatively pure cell types for bulk assays. We expect that insights gained from this work will provide experimental and computational guidelines for building GRNs of cellular maturation in response to microenvironmental stimuli.",

For two sets of biological replicates with two technical replicates each (4 libraries) of M1, we recovered 3,860 nuclei and 8,102 unique fragments per cell on average. For two sets of biological replicates with two technical replicates of M2, we recovered 4,404 nuclei and 8,839 unique fragments on average. Raw sequencing data were primarily processed using the Bio-Rad ATAC-seq Analysis Toolkit (version 1.0.0) in order to generate mapped reads. We installed the Bio-Rad Docker containers on our lab's server and followed the steps to perform fastq QC, debarcoding of fastq files, alignment to hg38 using BWA with blacklist regions removed, and alignment QC using Picard Tools (Li & Durbin, 2009 ). Next, the Bio-Rad Toolkit used Jaccard indexing to determine bead duplicates and remove cell-free droplets, then BAP to \"deconvolute\" or merge bead duplicates. The mapped reads for UMI-passing cells and the peaks called by MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008) were used in a custom python script (found here:",

Similarly, we built a 40x60 map on the scRNA data with the same options and received 52 RNA metaclusters. Then, these 2 sets of metaclusters were linked, generating 5928 (114 x 52) linked metaclusters. The regions in these linked metaclusters were sent through the same network analysis pipeline as our previous work (above) using the HOCOMOCOv11 motif database (p value < 0.05, q-value < 0.05). The pipeline can be found here: https://github.com/csjansen/SOMatic-Network-Analysis. This generated a total of 8,904,925 potential network connections or 833,114 TF-TF interactions.",
