The demographic features, clinical symptoms, laboratory results, comorbidities, co-infections, treatments, illness severities and chest CT scan results of 267 patients were collected from 1st January to 15th February 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed by RT-PCR. Clinical symptoms and nucleic acid test results were collected during the 14 days post-hospitalization quarantine. 30 out of 267 COVID-19 patients were detected re-positive during the post-hospitalization quarantine. Re-positive patients could not be distinguished by demographic features, clinical symptoms, laboratory results, comorbidities, co-infections, treatments, chest CT scan results or subsequent clinical symptoms. However, re-positive rate was found to be correlated to illness severity, according the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) severity-of-disease classification system, and the confusion, urea, respiratory rate and blood pressure (CURB-65) score. Common clinical characteristics were not able to distinguish re-positive patients. However, severe and critical cases classified high according APACHE II and CURB-65 scores, were more likely to become re-positive after discharge.",

Specifically, Wuhan was the first city with COVID-19 outbreak, with the largest cases patients in the country. To increase medical care efficiency, many Fangcang shelter hospitals were created for mild COVID-19 cases 16 . Therefore, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, as a large general hospital, mainly dealt with patients ranging from moderate to critical. Additionally, at the beginning of COVID-9 outbreak in Wuhan, every large general hospital was overloaded, which may have resulted in an imperfect quality control of sample collection and delivery. Consequently, patients enrolled in this study are different to previous published result by Lan, which may lead to bias. Moreover, in Lan's study, the severity of their enrolled patients were different from ours, as most of the COVID-19 patient in their study are general cases which may also cause bias. Additionally, a novel pathogen as SARS-CoV-2 is, it is currently not certain that what, the virus itself or the excessive immune reaction, account for the severity of patients. Therefore, it remains possible that severe and critical patients may have higher viral loads and longer clearance time. More research is necessary.",
