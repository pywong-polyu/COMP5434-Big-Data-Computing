However, innovation and knowledge creation seem to be facilitated by the personal knowledge and life experiences of people, which appear to be dynamic. The tensions between Dynamic and Static Knowledge in facilitating the transfer and sharing of knowledge arise as compelling research as well as practical topic for organizations. Our paper aims to investigate such tensions by employing a case study. We decided to deepen such dynamics in the healthcare field, given its importance for business and society. In more detail, we analyzed one Emergency Room (ER) department through a series of interviews. Our findings highlight the importance of the right balance between Static and Dynamic Knowledge. On the one hand, the healthcare organization recognized the need to incorporate knowledge into practical and tangible instruments. On the other hand, the flows of Dynamic Knowledge must be fostered through a culture of knowledge translation and sharing, and the development of soft skills.",

Healthcare is essential due to its contribution to the wellbeing of society [8, 9] . At the same time, the healthcare sector is undergoing a relevant change [10] , due to the introduction of always-new technologies [11] , and protocols in surgery and care [12] [13] [14] , the requests for more inpatient and outpatient services by an ageing population [15] , and the need for accountability and transparency with a reduced budget [16] . In particular, we decided to examine how knowledge flows in the Emergency Room (ER), probably the most hectic department in hospitals [17] . At the ER, healthcare professionals need to cope with patients with a variety of different conditions, deciding whom they should assist first, which other departments to involve, which people to hospitalize or send home, and what to do in case of a global emergency (like the case of Covid-19) [18] . Using a case study approach, we carried on some interviews to map and deepen the knowledge dynamics, following the framework of Lopes at al. [19] .",

This first phase of the study's purpose is to identify the current processes and competencies, to define practical implications on the definition of new strategies for health professional management in terms of their future development, aiming at more efficient and agile management practices in health institutions. The article will also contribute to the knowledge management theory in terms of addressing more robust concepts of Dynamic and Static Knowledge, emerging from the field.",

This idea is expressed in the research of Argote and Ingram [23] , who conclude that knowledge sharing among workers represents a competitive advantage for organizations. They highlight that knowledge sharing is \"the process through which the experience of one unit affects another\" and argue that interactions involving workers allow more excellent knowledge sharing within organizations. They conclude that knowledge embedded in the interactions of workers and tasks potentiates the organization's capability to innovate and be more competitive. Hansen et al. [24] , Massaro et al. [25] , and Jacquinet et al. [26] also emphasize the importance of the worker's role in knowledge sharing activities. They consider the balance between the uses of technologies for knowledge sharing and transition activities versus relying on people to share knowledge through more traditional means. The transition process means codification through, i.e., information systems, opening up the possibility of large-scale reuse for organizations.",

However, a primary aspect of knowledge sharing among individuals in organizations is trust, and Levin and Cross [28] pointed out its importance when they referred to the competence and trust among individuals in an organization that influences the link between them and the effective use of knowledge. Lee and Choi [29] also note that the lack of trust among employees is another critical barrier to knowledge sharing activities and posterior transition into organizational knowledge. To overcome such obstacles, organizational studies point out the importance of democratic and participative leadership as the main factor to enable a culture of knowledge sharing [30] [31] [32] . In a culture of knowledge sharing, the transition process of individual knowledge into organizational knowledge may be facilitated with the use of a common and shared vocabulary. Cummings [33] reinforces that idea, considering the influence of structural diversity on work group performance, meaning that, when members of diverse workgroups are capable of sharing external knowledge to the group, their performance improves, and the organizations become more innovative.",

A similar distinction, in the literature, refers to explicit and tacit knowledge [37] . While explicit knowledge is the most basic form of knowledge, when data is stored, processed, organized, and structured, allowing sharing in an easier way, tacit knowledge is possessed by people, and it is garnered from personal experience and contexts [38] .

Applying this to our study we can state that to translate knowledge as rules, procedures, and routines, several techniques can be applied, like procedures sheets; knowledge databases for emergency problems and solutions, and others repositories where information and documents are stored. Such documents can be reused and shared, for example, regarding operational specifications, manuals, and other information about medical procedures.

Future research avenues may deepen such aspects, conducting the analysis in other sectors or locations.
