            "text": "The job search process can be divided broadly into four stages: 1. Preparing, searching, and applying for positions; 2. Pre-interviews; 3. Interviews; and 4. Post-interview processes. In Table 1 , we provide candidates with a breakdown of each stage of the job search process. We include short descriptions, the estimated timeline, recommendations drawn from our experiences on the 2020-2021 job market, and resources we found to be helpful. In the era of COVID-19, a vast majority of institutions turned to virtual formats to conduct interviews. While virtual interviews offer some benefits (e.g., no travel), challenges can also arise [5] . Therefore, in Table 1 , we also provide additional considerations for the \"virtual\" job search. Note that the advice and resources cited in Table 1 are not exhaustive but should serve as a solid foundation to get candidates started. In addition, we focus on searching for a position at an R1 institution. Approaches will vary for small liberal arts colleges, which place more weight on teaching and conducting research with undergraduates (For more information, see Table 1 \"Different types of academic jobs\" resource).",

We recommend applying early and broadly. The early bird gets the worm! 2. Do the research. There are numerous resources available that outline the academic job search process (e.g., articles, books, webinars, social media platforms). Here, we provide a starting point (Table 1 ), but highly recommend that candidates use their scientific skills to identify additional resources. In addition, we also encourage applicants to seek advice from the experts, including those who have successfully navigated the job market recently as well as those who have served on hiring committees. 3. Prepare, strategize, and organize. Once candidates have done their research and identified job opportunities, we recommend they consider the following:",

Remaining organized. Use a spreadsheet to keep track of job advertisements, deadlines, and specific requirements for each job packet (i.e., statements, copies of publications, etc.). In addition, candidates should make plans for how each application will be tailored for each specific job posting with a particular focus on how the candidate 'fits' in the department and institution [2] (see 7 below). c. Keeping track of reference letters. Candidates should keep their referees constantly updated by sharing their job spreadsheet (as suggested in 3b) and sending them information about job descriptions and deadlines soon after applying.",

For example, advice from peers who recently secured a position may be more useful than advice from those who are less abreast of current practices. However, a good rule of thumb is that if multiple sources offer similar advice, it is most likely worth taking. 6. Be part of a scientific community. Form a support group of peers who are also on the job market to share advice, approaches, support, and celebrations. Future PI Slack also provides an anonymous group of peers on the job market that can support those embarking on the journey alone. In addition, it is beneficial to form a virtual or in-person job/ chalk talk \"club\" with other senior postdocs to practice with and receive feedback on delivering these talks. 7. Network. A significant contributor to the hiring decision is whether the candidate is a good 'fit' and if it is clear that they will be successful in the department [1, 2, 9] . However, this information is usually not widely available. It is therefore critical to build connections through networking with colleagues to gain insights in that regard. Networking can be done both virtually and in person at meetings/courses, on social media (e.g., science Twitter), and through professional societies (e.g., Women in Learning). Candidates may also leverage the networks of previous and current mentors.",
