The most frequently cited criteria for measuring satisfaction with hospitals include particular health condition and type of treatment availed, hospital environment, quality of hospital services, overall behavior of the staff, cost of hospitalization, and post-discharge (follow up) facilities (1) . However, factors such as age, income, communication, employment status, gender, and education of the patient can also affect the perception of satisfaction. Therefore, it becomes important to understand the scope of construct of 'patient of health (2) from patients' perspective. Patients carry certain expectations before their visit to the hospital and the resultant satisfaction or dissatisfaction is the outcome of their actual experience (3) . All such information can be utilized effectively to identify barriers, address treatment gaps, enhance patient turnover, and build more sustainable health care services.",

As people's understanding and response to Covid-19 varied, the health care providers across the globe also struggled to make sense of their patient's expectation from the existing healthcare services. Symptoms of Covid-19 disease and treatment outcomes along with patient engagement in the treatment process became important aspects of patient satisfaction during the Covid-19 pandemic (4, 5) . Though it is understandable that isolation services can cause much inconvenience not only for the patients and the hospital service providers, the mechanism of how it affects patient satisfaction is less studied. For instance, dealing with isolation, adjusting to the PPE kits and masks while communicating, following rigorous hygiene schedule, personal human touch in treatment practicing social distancing rules, and providing basic psychological support could be key factors impacting patient satisfaction of patients hospitalized for Covid-19. E.g., few studies during SARS reported that patients in general felt alienated by doctors wearing goggles, gown and masks, felt less secure without relatives present, and be dissatisfied with the changing duty schedule of the treating doctors due to week-on, week-off roster (6) .",

And many of these are often silent about the psychometric information concerning those measures. It is imperative to measure the patients' satisfaction in the changed health care delivery system during Covid-19. And outlining these parameters in patient satisfaction may help hospitals in better quality of health care service delivery. We conducted a systematic study to review the existing scales on patients' satisfaction used for hospitalized patients and their application in Covid-19 situation. We also reviewed the methodology and the tools used in the recent studies that investigated patients' satisfaction of the patients hospitalized for treatment of Covid-19 to identify the gaps and needs in this field.",

In Covid-19 cases, this may become an important parameter as there is no out-patient treatment and discharge protocol at least 11 days \u00b1 3days in case of mild-moderate but longer stay of 21-30 days is average for severe patients. Patient satisfaction during initial months of Covid-19 (especially before September 2020) could be different as compared to patients admitted after that due to many reasons such as clarity in discharge protocol, more information on fomite contamination, information about vaccine, and better sensitization among the health care staffs and treatment team to enhance communication with the patients admitted.",

And due to increased demands on hospitals during Covid-19 peak periods, quality of care (particulary as perceived by the patients) may get affevted and in turn the perceived cost-benefit analysis by the patient can play a significant role in patient satisfaction regarding hospital care. Quality can be a significant predictor of cost and vice versa (33) . Cost of hospitalisation and patients' satisfaction can have inverse relationship, especially due to economic slowdown during pandemic. In case of low-cost treatment or free treatment, in the context of Covid-19, when there are financial difficulties at almost all levels, can in fact be a more important parameter of increased patient satisfaction. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 (and the long version with 55 items) is the only scale that includes financial aspects of patient satisfaction. One possibility is that) Doctor-patient interaction in the presence of Covid-19 specific safety measures such as masks, goggles, head gear, PPE the quality of communication can be obstructed. In addition, these precautionary measures found to affect the perception of empathy in the patient satisfaction with Doctor-Patient Interaction Scale during SARS (18) .",
