            "text": "Recent analysis of COVID-19 data from China showed that the number of confirmed cases followed a subexponential power-law increase, with a growth exponent of around 2.2. The power-law behavior was attributed to a combination of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as well as behavioral changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Social distancing is incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each step in the random walk process. The step size l is taken to be a multiple of r , which is the average separation between individuals. Three temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For l = r , we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for smaller step sizes l r /2, while for large l the growth is found to be exponential. Together with available data, these results suggest that the early containment of the disease within China was close to optimal. We further performed a comparative case study of data from three other countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement with these data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections in our simulations.",

            "text": "Introduction Following its outbreak in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus disease has reignited efforts to better understand infection spread and mortality rates during the pandemic. Significant emphasis was placed on modeling the spatio-temporal spread [1] [2] [3] of the disease, in order to make reliable predictions. A key statistic in such epidemiological analysis is the basic reproduction number R 0 , which defines the expected number of secondary cases from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. Data from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak showed good agreement with models that assumed an exponential growth of infections in time (t), with a mean R 0 ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [4, 5] . However, subsequent laboratory confirmed cases in Hubei showed that soon after the initial stage, the temporal growth in the cumulative number of infections (N ) was instead subexponential and agreed reasonably well with a power-law scaling N \u221d t \u03b1 [6] . This was consistent with data from other affected regions in mainland China (with \u03b1 = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3) and was attributed to a depletion of the susceptible population due to effective containment and mitigation strategies that were put in place and followed after the initial unhindered outbreak [6] .",

In such a scenario one can alternatively examine the number of reported deaths (due to COVID-19 complications) as a function * striambak@uwc.ac.za \u2020 dpm.iopb@gmail.com of time. This is justified, as the number of deaths are generally more accurately recorded and are always a fraction of the total infected population. Indeed, mortality data from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Health Commission of the Hubei Province showed similar power-law behavior, with an exponent \u03b1 \u2248 2.2 [7] that agreed with the observations in Ref. [6] . Independently, it has been proposed that the near-quadratic power-law scaling of the cumulative number of deaths (infections) in China can be explained with an extended epidemiological model that allows 'peripheral spreading' [8] . In this model, once infections are identified in a location (labeled as a 'hotspot'), and the subpopulation from the region is isolated, the growth of infections within this confined local community rises exponentially until no further infections are possible. Once this saturation is reached, further spread of the disease to outside the region is inevitable, due to interactions at the periphery of the confined population. The growth of infections due to such peripheral spreading is shown to be quadratic in time and agrees piecewise with the data from China [8] .",

They are initially represented by uniformly distributed points in a given isolated region. The simulations begin with an initial condition of one infected walker, assuming all other points are 'normal', yet 100% susceptible. As the simulation progresses, each walker takes steps in random directions, defined by a suitable step size described below. The 'spread' of the disease is said to occur whenever an infected point comes within a 'touching' distance from a 'normal' point, thereby passing on the disease. This assumption includes indirect transmissions through infected surfaces, etc 1 . An important aspect of the simulations is that in addition to their spatial mobility, the incremental number of simultaneous discrete steps taken by all random walkers quantifies time progression. This allowed us to track the evolution of the infection spread, in terms of growth in the number of infected points with respect to the number of 'time-steps' (t).",

Effectively, l quantifies the social distancing aspect in the simulation. The l = r condition ensured that the infection could only spread through 'nearest neighbor' interactions and that each random walker is on average confined within a local neighborhood. We performed three such simulations for a fixed density of 10k/unit area and three population sizes 10k, 6k and 2.5k respectively. Simulation set II (Fixed population and density, different step lengths): In the next step we probed the dependence on both population density and l in five separate simulations.

[6, 7] . In simulation set II, for step length r , we determine almost identical power-law growth as in Fig. 1 , again in agreement with the observations of Refs. [6, 7] . This is shown 3 in Fig. 2 . Additionally, we also find that our extracted power-law exponents are consistently similar for this step size, regardless of the population density used. In comparison, if all members of the sample population were to take larger random steps of length 5 r , on average interacting with points located much further away than their nearest neighbors, we find that the number of infected individuals blows up rapidly, showing near exponential behavior. This would be similar to a scenario where no control interventions are in place or being followed. Not surprisingly, unlike the more constrained random walk, the slope for exponential growth is found to strongly depend on the population density, and is larger at higher densities. Figure 2 also shows the other extreme in terms of the temporal growth, obtained using step sizes smaller than r . As apparent in the figure, the results from these simulations showed quadratic growth, for all step sizes less than a threshold value of around r /2. This effectively implies a lowerbound on the growth exponent (\u03b1 = 2), exactly as in the case of peripheral spreading [8] . Furthermore, the effect of social-distancing is clearly evident from the observed delay in reaching the saturation value. A few important takeaway points from the above analysis are: i) A steplength parameter of size r reproduces the growth curves from China reported in Refs. [6, 7] . ii) Under such condition, the growth exponent is found to be independent of the population density. iii) On further restricting the random walkers' mobility by reducing their step sizes, we observe that the slowest unavoidable temporal growth is quadratic in nature. This is similar to peripheral growth, proposed in Ref. [8] . iv) Since quadratic scaling appears to be a limiting case, it seems unrealistic for a large population to achieve such growth. Therefore, at face value the available data suggest that the containment measures and response in the eight affected Chinese provinces mentioned in [6] were most likely optimal and could not have been significantly improved upon any further.",

These BRICS countries were not arbitrarily chosen, as they present an interesting comparative study for several reasons. They face common challenges in terms of poverty and economic inequality, and are home to some of the most densely populated informal settlements in the world (such as Khayelitsha in Cape Town, Dharavi in Mumbai and the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo). The lack of proper sanitation is a common theme in these impoverished city pockets, where, given the circumstances, expecting the residents to follow strict social-distancing protocols is a tall order [14] [15] [16] . Secondly, the response of the political leadership of Brazil to the COVID-19 crisis was strikingly different from the governments of India and South Africa. While the latter two countries swiftly imposed extended periods of severe lockdown [17] [18] [19] [20] beginning in the month of March, Brazil has thus far not pursued a concerted policy for such containment [21] . As of today Brazil is poised to become the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cumulative death data reported for the three countries, with their corresponding fits are plotted in Fig. 3 . While we do observe power-law growths with exponents of of 2.76 \u00b1 0.02 and 3.00 \u00b1 0.02 for India and Brazil, the growth curve for South Africa is surprisingly much steeper. As shown in its inset, the growth was nearly quadratic for a significant portion of the time, following which there is a steep exponential rise starting around day 50 from March 28. It is worthwhile to note at this point that the most stringent lockdown measures (at Level 5) were imposed in South Africa until May 1 [20] . The restrictions were only slightly relaxed after that, to Level 4 during the month of May. Interestingly, the data show that the exponential growth begins around May 17. Given that the coronavirus has an approximately two week incubation period, the above observation suggests that the two largely different growth exponents for South Africa are most likely due to a modest containment of the disease under Level 4 lockdown.",

Furthermore, the sudden and unprecedented lockdown in India resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of daily wage inter-state migrant workers from the rural hinterland left jobless in the big cities [27] . This led to a large-scale migration back home for thousands of such families, many of them traversing large distances of the country on foot [28, 29] . The exodus has only intensified with the relaxation of restrictions in May. It is widely expected that the cumulative growth of infections in India will continue to increase as the lockdown ended around June 1 [30] .

[31] and references therein) of type N (t) = A(1 + Be \u2212\u00b5t ) 1/(1\u2212m) , that solves the Richards differential equation [32] . We caution that such an approach can lead to inaccuracies, particularly when a containment policy is followed. It is clear that the expression for N (t) does not produce a linear relationship between ln N and ln t, as expected for (contained) powerlaw growth. This is manifest in the results of our simulations and validates our Monte Carlo random walk approach. To illustrate the above, we show in Fig. 5 simulation results for random walkers with both unconstrained and constrained mobility, generated with step lengths l = 5 r and r respectively. While the generalized logistic function provides a reasonable fit for the unconstrained curve (exponential growth), a large discrepancy is observed in the other (power-law) case, with significantly different values for the fit parameters. It is further evident that for t \u03b1 type power-law growth, the infection rate dN/dt should be proportional to \u03b1t \u03b1\u22121 . This is also supported by data. As an example, we show data corresponding to three-day averaged values for the reported daily deaths from India and their corresponding powerlaw fit in the top panel of Fig. 6 . As expected, we obtain a growth exponent of \u03b2 = \u03b1 \u2212 1 (for \u03b1 = 2.8). The bottom panel in the same figure shows a similar analysis performed for our simulated data, obtained for a population of 6k and density of 10k/unit area. These data (which are the same as presented in the central panel of Fig. 1) show exactly the same behavior, with dN/dt following a t \u03b1\u22121 power-law increase. This observed consistency further affirms the validity of our Monte Carlo method. Thus, our general observations suggest that the growth curves from effectively contained scenarios always ought to be fitted accordingly, by including power-law behavior. This supports the contention that constrained growth curves from global COVID-19 data necessarily require epidemiological analyses that incorporate additional mechanisms, similar to those described in Refs. [6, 8] .",

Apart from proximity based contact, our model has no underlying assumptions about the nature of infection spread or its reproduction number, recovery time etc. Three growth regimes, corresponding to different levels of containment are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. Under stringent conditions, so that only nearest-neighbor connections are allowed, our simulation results show a power-law growth in time, with growth exponents \u03b1 = 2.0 \u2212 2.3, similar to initial COVID-19 data from China [6] . Furthermore, the growth appears to be consistent, with no apparent dependence on population size or density. Based on available data, this analysis suggests that the containment and mitigation strategies employed/followed in Chinese provinces after the initial outbreak were near optimal and resulted in growth exponents that were close to the smallest limiting value. On comparison with data from other countries, we observe that reasonable agreement can be attained by introducing small-world-type connections in the simulation model. We anticipate that such a Monte Carlo approach (and its more generalized versions) will be useful for the evaluation of future strategies in the midst of the present pandemic.",

All these cases show a quadratic growth in time. We further observe that a simple logarithmic correction to our quadratic results (so that t 2 \u2192 t 2 ln t) yields a power-law exponent of about 2.5, in rough agreement with the intermediate values for contained growth, both described here and observed in Refs. [6, 7] . Further investigations into this potential connection present an interesting research problem for both epidemiologists and physicists alike.",
