This adjustment has also reduced patient footfall in hospital settings and assisted with social distancing in out-patient waiting areas. 1, [3] [4] [5] Telephone consultation facilities have also helped create a 'triage system', filtering vulnerable patients with stable conditions whilst identifying those who require necessary reviews for acute and urgent oncological conditions. 3 However, this rapid change in practice has presented many clinicians with a steep learning curve, as generally telephone consultations were not widely used in ENT clinics in the UK during the pre-coronavirus era.",

Satisfactory internal reliability was demonstrated for this score, together with discrete overlapping aspects of satisfaction between the subscales. 4 The Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale questionnaire was preferred over the Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire for our project, as the latter had limited evidence of construct validity, together with a perceived time subscale that may be influenced by external factors. A similar study by Roberts and Partridge examining telephone consultations in respiratory clinics also utilised the Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale to good effect. 13 Whilst the initial survey yielded overall positive results, some deficits were highlighted in the departmental meeting. The distress relief subscale (containing questions pertaining to patient's knowledge about their disease) had some concerning responses, with a quarter of patients submitting a mean score of less than 4 out of 7. Other areas, such as the rapport subscale (containing questions regarding the doctor-patient relationship established), showed more promising results. Of the patients, 58.3 per cent submitted a mean score of at least 6 out of 7, whilst 8.1 per cent submitted a mean score of less than 4 out of 7.",

We suggest that use of a structured model (Table 1) ensures an appropriate introduction to the telephone consultation. Such an introduction may be even more useful in the telephone consultation setting than in a face-to-face out-patient clinic, as patients may enter the former consultation in a completely different mind frame if also engaged in other activities. For example, we found that many patients took the call whilst at work and were consequently ill-prepared to discuss their condition. Similarly, use of the model reminds the clinician to summarise the consultation, checking that patient concerns and expectations have been satisfactorily addressed. This was highlighted in our improved scores pertaining to the distress relief subscale.",

Subramanian et al. described a new voice response system implemented by tertiary mental health services in India, 21 whilst Calton et al. denoted increased remote consultation use in their palliative medicine clinics. 2 Our quality improvement project found a substantial increase in telephone consultation preference in the second survey, together with an improvement in patient satisfaction. Five comments cited similar advantages for remote consultations: no need to take time off work, no transport issues and less waiting time in clinics.",
