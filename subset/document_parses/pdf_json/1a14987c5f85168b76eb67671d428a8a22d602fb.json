We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, preprint databases, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to June 1, 2020. From an initial 547 publications and 75 reports, 25 studies provided specific information on COVID-19 patients living with HIV. Studies described 252 patients, 80.9% were male, the mean age was 52.7 years, and 98% were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Co-morbidities in addition to HIV and COVID-19 (multimorbidity) included hypertension (39.3%), obesity or hyperlipidemia (19.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.0%), and diabetes (17.2%). Two-thirds (66.5%) had mild to moderate symptoms, the most common being fever (74.0%) and cough (58.3%). Among patients who died, the majority (90.5%) were over 50 years old, male (85.7%), and had multimorbidity (64.3%). Our findings highlight the importance of identifying co-infections, addressing co-morbidities, and ensuring a secure supply of ART for PLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued health alerts and prevention guidelines for people at increased risk for severe health outcomes and death due to COVID-19 [3, 4] . These guidelines are generally based on the outcomes and characteristics of patients affected early in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging patterns point to elevated risk for older persons, people living in long-term care facilities, men, and racial/ethnic minorities who have long experienced disparities in health outcomes for many chronic diseases [5] . Chronic disease co-morbidities, especially multimorbidity, appear to be driving factors for COVID-19 mortality. Warnings to take extra precautions include persons with asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes, serious cardiovascular conditions, chronic kidney disease, obesity, chronic liver disease, and persons who are immunocompromised, such as people living with HIV (PLHIV) [3] [4] [5] .",

HIV infection is associated with abnormal humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses, resulting in increased susceptibility to numerous opportunistic infections [6] . Under this rationale, particular caution is warranted for PLHIV with low CD4 cell count, advanced disease, high viral load, and those not taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). As PLHIV are living longer with ART, many will also have chronic conditions associated with severe COVID-19 disease [7] . However, there have not been large observational studies specifically measuring symptoms, disease severity, complications, multimorbidity, and the proportion of death in reported COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients. It is also not known if people with HIV who are clinically and virologically stable will experience any greater risk for COVID-19 complications than the population without HIV infection. At present, the available data mainly appear in case reports and case series of COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients.",

The majority of patients with co-infection of HIV and COVID-19 were male. Also, in line with HIV-negative persons [16] [17] [18] [19] , data point to higher morbidity and mortality among male patients and higher mortality when multimorbidity is present. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in PLHIV were cough and fever, and comparable to HIV-negative people, the majority had mild COVID-19 disease [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

            "text": "Nonetheless, the proportion of reported PLHIV with COVID-19 appears to have higher multimorbidity, severity of disease, and a potentially higher proportion of death. Multimorbidity was reported in nearly two-thirds of coinfected patients. The most common co-morbidities among patients with HIV and COVID-19 were hypertension, obesity or hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Results of a cohort study showed that multimorbidity (mostly hypertension and diabetes) was more prevalent in COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients than PLHIV without COVID-19 [20] . When data were available, the proportion of death among reported COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients appears high (14.3%) in our pooled estimate. The result might be confounded by other factors. For example, PLHIV may be at increased risk of mortality or severe illness with COVID-19 based on their age and other medical conditions. Among those who died for whom individual data were recorded, multimorbidity and Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 57)",

Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and multimorbidity, not particular to HIV, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension [21] . Another possible explanation is bias due to the preponderance of publications on hospitalized patients with more severe disease. The observational designs of the available studies and lack of appropriate control do not permit concluding whether ART can prevent the acquisition of COVID-19 or reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. The search for antiviral agents with activity to treat and prevent COVID-19 is an area of active research. For example, a clinical trial in 199 patients showed that ritonavir-boosted lopinavir did not have a benefit over standard care for COVID-19 [15] . A survey in PLHIV in China showed that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus non-nucleoside reverse transfer inhibitors (NNRTI) did not prevent COVID-19 infection [16] . A cohort study showed that there are no differences in previous use of NNRTI, INSTI, or protease inhibitors in individuals with and without COVID-19 diagnosis [17] . Findings of lower morbidity or mortality among persons on ART compared to those not on ART would also need to consider higher CD4 count and better immune status.",

First, while a large proportion of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, all of the patients in this review were symptomatic, and most were admitted to a hospital. This study, therefore, refers only to patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and may overrepresent those with severe COVID-19 disease. Second, the lack of appropriate comparison groups, particularly for the case reports and case series, is a limitation to identifying factors associated with COVID-19-HIV co-infection. Third, many of the studies included in our review had a small sample size. Fourth, without a population-or probability-based survey of PLHIV, the true prevalence of COVID-19 and disease manifestations among PLHIV remain unknown. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet measured COVID-19-HIV co-infection in a wider be divulged, asked for, or recorded and therefore, underassessed among COVID-19 patients.",

The presence of multimorbidity and older age appear to be the important factors for severe morbidity and mortality with COVID-19-HIV co-infection. Results suggest that healthcare providers need to address multimorbidity among PLHIV, ensure their ART supply is secure, and continue to consider PLHIV as a population for whom precautions are needed to prevent the COVID-19. Given the number of PLHIV worldwide, there are likely many more patients with COVID-19-HIV co-infection than suggested by the scant literature to date. Clinicians and researchers could help fill the data gap by being vigilant to patients who may be co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV.",
