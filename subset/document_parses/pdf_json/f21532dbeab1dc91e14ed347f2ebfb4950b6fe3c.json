Our findings do not include the number of women who do not present following assault [29] as well as other forms of abuse such as emotional and economic. In addition, the district has a separate service dealing with sexual assaults and therefore these patients will not always present to the EC. These women may also present to primary care facilities with non-specific symptoms which are difficult to attribute to intimate partner violence [27] . Nevertheless it is likely that staff working in the EC need to remain vigilant and proactive in recognising and assisting women with intimate partner violence [28] .",

These patterns vary considerably between communities, as in neighbouring Khayelitsha use was more equal between own transport and ambulance [18] , while in the city centre most patients were self-presenting [24] . Reasons for these different patterns may Table 2 Non-intentional and intentional trauma by age group and sex (N = 381). relate to the geographic spread of the catchment population. Helderberg Hospital is in a semi-rural community with much longer distances to travel that may make it difficult for poor communities to use their own transport. In addition, the hospital is not easily accessible by public transport. By contrast, the Khayelitsha Hospital serves a geographically dense and closer community with access by public transport. The utilisation of local ambulances to bring patients to Helderberg hospital may also impact on the availability of ambulances to transfer patients to higher levels of care and could potentially affect patient outcomes. This study finds that men were the main perpetrators of community, family and interpersonal violence. Violence has become a normative and acceptable way of resolving conflict, and a way of asserting dominance within interpersonal relationships [1] . Although not evaluated in this study, others have highlighted the association between violence, young males, substance use, and weekends [6, 30] . High inequality and significant unemployment also contribute to high levels of violence [9] . Although not investigated here, it is likely that harmful alcohol use, together with income inequality and unemployment are key underlying factors [6, 9, 16] . The recent alcohol ban as part of the national lockdown for the Corona virus pandemic resulted in an almost 60% reduction in assaults, accidents and other injuries and a 90% reduction in sexual assaults [31] .",
