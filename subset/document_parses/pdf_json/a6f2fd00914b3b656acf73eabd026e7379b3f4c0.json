This study demonstrates the use of market intelligence tools (i.e., lifestyle segments, market segmentation, geodemographic segmentation) to identify a population, determine its lifestyle clusters, and estimate their propensity for various diseases. Throughout this paper, we will use the terms lifestyle segments, lifestyle segmentation, market segmentation, and geodemographic segmentation interchangeably, but they convey the same meaning. Owing to the pandemic, we chose to do our analysis with COVID-19 as a heath outcome. This paper offers a unique spatial and temporal approach proving indispensable for timely and effective ways of analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on American households by their lifestyle characteristics which are summarized as LifeMode groups based on lifestyle and lifestage. We specifically tested two hypotheses: \"Is there a difference in average COVID-19 rate among different LifeModes?\" and \"Which LifeModes have COVID-19 rate that are higher/lower than average?\". We focused on comparing each LifeMode's mean to the nation's mean to see",

Examples of the most common commercial or market segmentation systems available today include MOSAIC, ACORN, ESRI Tapestry and many others [3] [4] [5] [6] . These segmentation systems utilize consumer surveys (e.g., Experian's Consumer View database) and apply traditional customer profiling techniques such as relationships between purchased products and consumers' beliefs and life patterns [7] . We used the ESRI Tapestry segmentation system [3] that is available on an annual basis as population and household counts by Tapestry segment are updated each year.",

ESRI Tapestry Segmentation data were downloaded from ESRI [3] . Our dataset contains a variable denoting the dominant tapestry segment within each U.S. county. Table 1 shows the number of counties within each LifeMode. Supplemental material shows a description of the traits of the LifeModes in a table. To associate lifestyle clusters to COVID-19, we downloaded two datasets: COVID-19 infection and mortality rates from USAFacts.com [11] . One dataset contained the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in each United States county by date. The other dataset contained the number of COVID-19 deaths in each county by date. These datasets covered the period from 22 January 2020, when the first case in the United States was discovered, to 30 June 2020. Using population data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau [12] , we calculated the rate of infections and deaths per 100,000 residents for each county and date and further mapped the COVID-19 cases by county. This facilitated a more fair and accurate analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on different lifestyles.",

Cozy Country Living represents the most rural LifeMode. It is found to be low risk for both infection and death. These are the last communities that the pandemic reached, as these are the most disconnected from urban society and international travel. Senior Styles represents mostly retirement communities, nursing homes, and neighborhoods where the population is predominantly made up of those over 65. Given the elevated risk of COVID-19 to the elderly, these communities generally took extra precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, explaining their low risk of infection. Senior Styles (9) is low risk for infection only, but not for death. Scholars and Patriots communities consist mainly of university towns and military bases. Both universities and military bases took significant steps to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19, with university towns even sending many of their students home. This would have limited opportunities for COVID-19 to affect these LifeModes. Figure 4 is drawn according to the same scheme but represents mortality rates instead. According to Figure 4 , the analysis of mortality rates yields many of the same results as the infection rate analysis. However, Ethnic Enclaves was high risk for infection but low risk for death. This might be observed because Ethnic Enclaves mostly consists of younger families, and COVID-19 is much less likely to cause death in young and middle-aged people. Meanwhile, Senior Styles is low risk for infection but not for death. This occurs because the mortality rate for the elderly is much higher, so even if these populations see fewer than average cases, they can still reach an average rate of deaths.",

Most are renters in older multi-unit structures and live-in crowded homes. Uptown Individuals only exhibited in Chicago and Atlanta, as they are the gateway cities of international travel and represent young successful singles that are also frequent travelers and reside in highly dense cities. This LifeMode represents a younger population in comparison to the prosperous married couple members of Affluent Estates and Upscale Avenues. This pattern continued through to June. Figure 6 shows the shift from no outbreak to low risk to high risk LifeModes quickly spreading and covering the coastal and southern counties of the nation from the beginning of the outbreak in March to July.

GenXUrban was high risk for death only, while Scholars and Patriots was low risk for death only. As states moved to ease lock down restrictions and reopened in May, new LifeModes emerged as being impacted by COVID-19 and the growth subsumed rural areas of California, Texas, and southern states. This time, LifeModes represented poorer households, including Ethnic Enclaves, Rustic Outposts, and Hometown. The members of these LifeModes are more likely to work at essential (blue-collar) jobs, less likely to have the opportunity to work from home and have less access to quality healthcare. Young, Hispanic families, multilingual and multigenerational households of Ethnic Enclaves in Texas and Southern Florida became targets of COVID-19. The Hometown LifeMode was impacted by COVID-19 in Native American communities in New Mexico, Colorado, and Oregon. COVID-19 hit the poor communities of the Mississippi River delta and impacted members of the Hometown LifeMode. Rustic Outposts emerged as a dominant Life Mode in the entire southern United States impacted by COVID-19, and rural areas became high risk.

The index ranges from 0 (no diversity) to 100 (complete diversity). For example, the diversity core for the whole of the U.S. is 64.0, which means there is a 64.0 percent probability that two people randomly chosen from the US population would belong to a different race or ethnic group. Looking at the demographic profile of high-risk LifeModes for COVID-infection, the diversity index is found to be high among high risk LifeModes. For example, the New Wave LifeMode has a diversity index of 89.5, followed by Ethnic Enclaves (82.4) and Midtown Singles (78.4) . These LifeModes are urban neighborhoods in which immigrant groups or ethnic minorities are residentially concentrated. In the COVID-19 literature, people residing in immigrant neighborhoods were less likely to be tested; but the likelihood that a test was positive was larger in those neighborhoods, as well as in neighborhoods with larger households or predominantly Black populations.

With this increased understanding of SDOH and with market intelligence tools, we can target vulnerable populations that could be impacted by COVID-19 for prevention and control strategies. Lifestyle segmentation classifies neighborhoods into unique segments (i.e., 67 segments) and LifeMode groups (i.e., 14 summary groups) based not only on demographics but also socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics. With a greater depth of understanding of these at-risk households based on lifestyle, we can explore the localized households and predict expansion of the geographic spread of the pandemic. These households can be targeted for better social services for COVID-19 at clinical settings. Public health messages and clinical information could be issued to the public and medical practitioners for these at-risk households to provide better assistance in clinical diagnoses and to implement preventive measures such as social distancing and reducing unnecessary travel. This paper makes a unique contribution to the public health literature by associating lifestyle characteristics to COVID-19 infection and mortality rates at the U.S. county level and sequentially mapping the impact of COVID-19 on different lifestyles.",

Index-based approaches are used as proxy methods to quantify SDOH [26] [27] [28] [29] . The area deprivation index (ADI) by Singh et al. [26] [27] [28] , which was extended by Kind et al.

The SDOH index by The Carolinas Health Care system includes additional dimensions such as food accessibility, though these have not yet been validated against actualized health outcomes and cannot reveal the underlying factors involved in differential health out-comes [30] . Kolak et al. [31] modeled SDOH as multivariate indices rather than as a singular deprivation index. Using variables of advantage, isolation, opportunity, mixed immigrant cohesion and accessibility, they imported their findings into seven distinct multidimensional neighborhood typologies.

Large disparities across race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status exist in the prevalence of conditions which are associated with the risk of severe complications from COVID-19 [32, 33] . Counties with higher proportions of Black people have a higher prevalence of comorbidities and had more COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths, after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration [32] . COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally Black rural and small metro counties [32] . Li et al. also found that U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths; however, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in their model [33] .

While vulnerability is highest among older adults regardless of their race-ethnicity or socioeconomic status, the findings suggest particular attention should also be given to the risk of adverse outcomes in midlife for non-Hispanic Blacks, adults with a high school degree or less, and low-income Americans [34] [35] [36] . COVID-19 diagnoses rates were greater in Latino counties nationally. In multivariable analysis, COVID-19 cases were greater in Northeastern and Midwestern Latino counties. COVID-19 deaths were greater in Midwestern Latino counties. COVID-19 diagnoses were associated with counties with greater monolingual Spanish speakers, employment rates, heart disease deaths, less social distancing, and days since the first reported case. COVID-19 deaths were associated with household occupancy density, air pollution, employment, days since the first reported case, and age (fewer <35 y.o.) [21] . Studies modelling and mapping intercounty transmission risk of COVID-19 in New York City merged information on the number of tests and the number of infections at the zip code level with demographic and socioeconomic information from the decennial census and the American Community Surveys. The rate of infection in the population depends on both the frequency of tests and on the fraction of positive tests among those tested. People residing in poor or immigrant neighborhoods were less likely to be tested, but the likelihood that a test was positive was larger in those neighborhoods, as well as in neighborhoods with larger households or predominantly Black populations [22, 23] .",

Rather, Tapestry segmentation is best used as a set of common characteristics among the typical consumer household. LifeMode groups represent markets that share a common experience-born in the same generation or immigration from another country-or a significant demographic trait, such as affluence. All the consumers in the proposed county will not fall into a specific LifeMode summary group but a representative one, composed of a population-a complete set of people with a specialized set of consumer characteristics.

This could be accomplished by identifying a population, determining its lifestyle clusters, and estimating the propensity for various diseases. Targeting key lifestyle modes/segments and their locations enables the health care system to focus on communities that might have been missed when straight demographic criteria were used. ",
