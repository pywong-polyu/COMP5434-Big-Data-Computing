Analyses of convalescent sera provide unique insights into antibody longevity and cross-neutralizing activity induced by variant spike proteins, which are putative vaccine candidates. Using sera from 38 individuals infected in wave 1, we show that cross-neutralizing activity can be detected up to 305 days pos onset of symptoms, although sera were less potent against B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B1.351 (Beta). Over time, despite a reduction in overall neutralization activity, differences in sera neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Beta variants decreased, which suggests that continued antibody maturation improves tolerance to spike mutations. We also compared the cross-neutralizing activity of wave 1 sera with sera from individuals infected with the Alpha, the Beta or the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants up to 79 days post onset of symptoms. While these sera neutralize the infecting VOC and parental virus to similar levels, cross-neutralization of different SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages is reduced. These findings will inform the optimization of vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

An important component of vaccines that protect against COVID-19 is the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies that bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A major challenge in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic will be the elicitation of a durable neutralizing antibody response that also provides protection against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. While the kinetics and correlates of the neutralizing antibody response have been extensively studied in the early phase following SARS-CoV-2 infection 7-12 , information on the durability and long-term cross-reactivity of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 following infection and/ or vaccination is limited due to its recent emergence in the human population and large-scale COVID-19 vaccination only being initiated in December 2020.",

Mutations of particular concern for vaccine immunity are those present in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which is a dominant target for the neutralizing antibody response [19] [20] [21] [22] . Despite B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617. 2 showing increased resistance to neutralization by convalescent and vaccinee sera collected at the peak of the antibody response 20,23-39 , cross-neutralizing activity has been observed. In contrast, complete loss of neutralization has been observed for some monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting specific epitopes on either the amino-terminal domain (NTD) Articles NATURE MICROBIOlOGy or the RBD of the spike protein 20, 25, 27, 28, 40 . Combined, these studies indicate that mutations in the spike protein may be arising in part due to the selective pressure of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma [41] [42] [43] . To counter such mutations and their attendant antigenic changes, vaccines using the spike proteins from these variants of concern (VOCs) are under investigation [44] [45] [46] [47] . Whether the variant spike proteins will elicit a robust neutralizing response with superior cross-neutralizing activity against parental strains and newly emerging variants has not been extensively studied 29, 48, 49 . Natural infection provides an important opportunity to compare the neutralizing antibody titres and cross-neutralizing activity generated from individuals exposed to different spike variants and will give insights into the antigenic distance between spike variants, thereby informing the design of second-generation vaccine candidates based on VOCs.",

Our previous study 8 had shown a decline in neutralizing antibody titre (ID 50 , the serum dilution that inhibits 50% infection) in the first 3 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but whether the titre would reach a steady level was not determined. The neutralization potency of matched longitudinal sera collected at time points up to 305 days POS revealed that the rate of decline in neutralization activity slowed in the subsequent 4-7-month period, and neutralizing activity could readily be detected in 18 out of 19 of the sera tested between 257 and 305 days POS, with a geometric mean titre (GMT) of 640. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) OD values for spike IgG, RBD IgG and nucleoprotein IgG correlated well with the ID 50 (of neutralization) (Extended Data Fig.  1b) . A cross-sectional analysis of all the wave 1 sera showed that the GMT at 145-175, 180-217 and 257-305 days POS decreased from 1,199 to 635 and 640, respectively.

[44] [45] [46] [47] . Studying the immune response to spike variants in natural infection can provide initial insights into the antigenic distance between lineages and their ability to elicit broad protection against emerging viral variants. We showed that infection with B. 1.1.7 29 also showed that B.1.351 infection generated better cross-neutralizing activity against earlier viral variants. These findings contrast with Faulkner et al. 48 , who observed a large decrease in cross-neutralization of WT virus in B.1.1.7-infected individuals. However, Faulkner et al. 48 used sera collected at around 11 days POS and, as discussed above, cross-neutralizing activity probably develops over time. The reduced neutralization potency observed against independent SARS-CoV-2 lineages highlights the antigenic distance between the current VOCs. In agreement with Liu et al. 33 , the greatest antigenic distance appears to be between B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, which do not share common mutations. Importantly, we showed that sera from B.1.617.2 infection has the largest reduction in neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in the acute phase (average 6.8-fold and 14.2-fold reduction in GMT, respectively), which indicates that infection with B.1.617.2, or a vaccine based on B.1.617.2, will probably have lower efficacy against B.1.351 infection. Overall, these data suggest that immunization with the parental WT spike protein will probably give the broadest antibody response against the current VOCs and any newly emerging lineages in COVID-19-vaccine-naive populations.",

As the RBD has been identified as a major target for neutralizing antibodies, the RBD mutations K417T/N, E484K and N501Y are of particular concern for immune evasion, and these mutations lead to neutralization resistance for several RBD-specific mAbs under clinical development 22, 28, [72] [73] [74] . Additionally, mutations in the NTD also lead to neutralization resistance for some NTD-specific mAbs 20, 28, 75 . In contrast, neutralization by some RBD-specific mAbs and NTD-specific mAbs is unaffected by variation in the spike protein, thereby highlighting the presence of cross-neutralizing epitopes on both the RBD and the NTD 20, 27, [30] [31] [32] [33] 40 .

Wave 1 and B.1.1.7 sera showed an average 4.8-fold and 5.7-fold, respectively, ID 50 reduction against B.1.351, which encodes the RBD mutations K417N, E484K and N501Y. Despite P.1 encoding similar RBD mutations (K417T, E484K and N501Y), only a minor decrease in neutralization potency was observed. Therefore, as these two VOCs also encode a different pattern of mutations in the NTD and the S2 domain of the spike protein, these combined data indicate that mutations in the RBD, the NTD and the S2 domain all contribute to the reduced serum neutralization potency and suggests that assessment of mutational profiles throughout all spike domains will be important when considering immune evasion by emerging viral variants 27 . In-depth analysis of the antibody response at the monoclonal level is required to understand this further.",

COVID-19 severity classification. The score, ranging from 0 to 5, was devised to mitigate underestimating disease severity in patients not for escalation above level one (ward-based) care. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified as follows: 0, asymptomatic or no requirement for supplemental oxygen; 1, requirement for supplemental oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen (F i O 2 ) < 0.4) for at least 12 h; 2, requirement for supplemental oxygen (F i O 2 \u2265 0.4) for at least 12 h; 3, requirement for noninvasive ventilation/continuous positive airway not a candidate for escalation above level one (ward-based) care; 4, requirement for intubation and mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (F i O 2 > 0.8) and peripheral oxygen saturations <90% (with no history of type 2 respiratory failure) or <85% (with known type 2 respiratory failure) for at least 12 h; and 5, requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Viral sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing of residual nose-and-throat swabs from SARS-CoV-2 cases was performed using GridION (Oxford Nanopore Technology) and v.3 of the ARTIC protocol and bioinformatics pipeline 76 . From November 2020, all samples from in-patients were assessed for sequencing. Samples were selected for sequencing if the corrected CT value was 32 or below or the Hologic Aptima assay was above 1,000 RLU, and if there was sufficient residual sample. Sequencing was performed under COG-UK ethical approval. Lineage determination was performed using updated versions of pangolin 2.0 (ref. 77 ). Samples were regarded as successfully sequenced if over 50% of the genome was recovered and if lineage assignment by pangolin was given with at least 50% confidence.",
