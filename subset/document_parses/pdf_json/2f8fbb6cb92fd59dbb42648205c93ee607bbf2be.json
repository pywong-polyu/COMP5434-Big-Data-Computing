However, the COVID-19 vaccines may also disrupt immune regulation to cause systemic immune dysregulation and compromise ocular immune privilege and the patient's susceptibility for intraocular inflammation. 3,4",

            "text": "Vaccines, in general, do have rare serious adverse effects, including induction or reactivation of autoimmune diseases. 5 Vaccine-related uveitis is a rare adverse event. However, cases have been reported with many of the vaccines currently employed, including influenza, varicella-zoster, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), hepatitis A and B, brucella, human papilloma virus, pneumococcus, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccines. 6 Post-vaccine uveitis can manifest with a broad spectrum of ocular symptoms, ranging from eye redness, blurred vision and light sensitivity to the presence of floaters. Often, post-vaccine uveitis is anterior, mild, transient and responds promptly to topical corticosteroids. However, severe posterior and panuveitis including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (AMPPE) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) like syndromes, have also been reported following immunization. 7 The mechanism behind vaccine-related uveitis is unclear. Hypotheses have included molecular mimicry between vaccine peptide fragments and uveal self-peptides, immune complex deposition in delayed-type hypersensitivity, and other immune responses in response to vaccine adjuvants. 8 Since February 2021, 46 reports of ocular side-effects linked to the COVID-19 vaccines have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Inflammation of the optic nerve, retina, uveal tract and anterior segment accounted for 9% of VAERS reports. 9 Twelve case reports of intraocular inflammation following COVID-19 vaccination were reviewed and included acute corneal graft rejection (n = 7, 7-21 days post vaccination), choroiditis (n = 1, 7 days post vaccination), uveitis (n = 4, 3-14 days post vaccination) and arteritic A. Achiron and R. Tuuminen anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (n = 1, 2 days post vaccination). 10 A recent retrospective multicenter study reviewed all Comirnaty (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccination related-uveitis cases in Israel. 11 The study found that in twenty-three eyes of 21 patients (38% had a previous history of uveitis with a median of one year of inactivity before the flare-up) the mean time between vaccination and uveitis was 7.5 days (range 1-30). 11 The limitation in our Case Report is that fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) were not documented in the patient's medical history to rule out differential disagnoses e.g., papillophlebitis and the posterior variant of Eales disease. Furthermore, these analyses would have been useful to clarify the presence, or not, of ischemic retina to explain the iris rubeosis.",

Our patient received the Comirnaty (BNT162b2) vaccine, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. 1 Differently from the hepatitis B vaccine, which is most commonly associated with post-vaccine uveitis, Comirnaty (BNT162b2) does not contain aluminum salts as adjuvants in its formulation. However, both vaccines were developed utilizing genetic engineering and express genes in microbial cells from pathogens that encode surface antigens capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in the pathogen-host. It has been speculated that mRNA vaccines induce strong activation of the cellular and humoral immune responses, resulting in molecular mimicry that may lead to immune cross-reactivity, triggering an autoimmune disease like anterior uveitis. 13 The original uveitis and its recurrence were relatively unusual and severe for uveitis as is the association with CRVO and rubeosis. The patient was advised to refrain from the previously scheduled second COVID-19 vaccine shot. Notably, a different vaccine formulation or local prophylactic treatment with re-immunization could have been considered as the risk of contracting COVID-19 also carries morbidity.",
