Over the years, advances in Medicine, Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Network Science, Computer Science, and Technology in general contributed to the development of modern epidemiology. In this chapter, we present a summary of different mathematical and computational approaches aimed at describing, modeling, and forecasting the diffusion of viruses. We start from the basic concepts and models in an unstructured population and gradually increase the realism by adding the effects of realistic contact structures within a population as well as the effects of human mobility coupling different subpopulations. Building on these concepts we present two realistic data-driven epidemiological models able to forecast the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical granularities. We conclude by introducing some recent developments in diseases modeling rooted in the bigdata revolution.",

Since then, and despite some initial lulls [2] , an intense research activity has developed a rigorous formulation of pathogens' spreading. In this chapter, we present different approaches to model and predict the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical resolutions and levels of detail. We focus on airborne illnesses transmitted from human to human. We are the carriers of such diseases. Our contacts and mobility are the crucial ingredients to understand and model their spreading. Interestingly, the access to large-scale data describing these human dynamics is a recent development in epidemiology. Indeed, for many years only the biological roots of transmission were clearly understood, so it is not surprising that classical models in epidemiology neglect realistic human contact structures or mobility in favor of more mathematically tractable and simplified descriptions of unstructured populations. We start our chapter with these modeling approaches that offer us an intuitive way of introducing the basic quantities and concepts in epidemiology.",

The first model is based on the metapopulation framework, a paradigm where the inter-population dynamics is modeled using detailed mobility patterns, while the intra-population dynamics is described by coarse-grained techniques. The other tools are, instead, agent-based model (ABM). This class of tools guarantees a very precise description of the unfolding of diseases, but need to be fed with extremely detailed data and are not computationally scalable. For these reasons their use so far has been limited to the study of disease spread within a limited numbers of countries. In comparison, metapopulation models include a reduced amount of data, while the approximated description of internal dynamics allows scaling the simulations to global scenarios.",

In some illnesses, Susceptible individuals (S) become infected and Infectious when coming in contact with one or more Infectious (I) persons and remain so until their death. In this case the disease is described by the so-called SI (susceptible-infected) model. In other diseases, as is the case for some sexual transmitted diseases, infected individuals recover becoming again Susceptible to the disease. These diseases are described by the SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model. In the case of influenza like illnesses (ILI), on the other hand, infected individuals Recover becoming immune to future infections from the same pathogen. ILIs are described by the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model. These basic compartments provide us with the fundamental description of the progression of an idealized infection in several general circumstances. Further compartments can be added to accurately describe more realistic illnesses such as Smallpox, Chlamydia, Meningitis, and Ebola [2, 9, 10] . Keeping this important observation in mind, here we focus on the SIR model.",

For example, in the transition between S to I, Susceptible individuals become Infected due to the interaction with Infected individuals, i.e. SCI ! 2I. The transition is mediated by individuals in the compartment I, see Fig. 4 But how can we model the infection process? Intuitively we expect that the probability of single individual becoming infected must depend on (1) the number of infected individuals in the population, (2) the probability of infection given a contact with an infectious agent and, (3) the number of such contacts. In this section we neglect the details of who is in contact with whom and consider instead individuals to be part of a homogeneously mixed population where everyone is assumed to be in contact with everyone else (we tackle heterogeneous contacts in Sect. 4.3). In this limit, the per capita rate at which susceptible contract the disease, the force of infection , can be expressed in two forms depending on the type of population. In the first, often called mass-action law, the number of contacts per individual is independent of the total population size, and determined by the transmission rate\u01ce nd the probability of randomly contacting an infected individual, i.e. D\u02c7I=N (where N is the population size). In the second case, often called pseudo massaction law, the number of contacts is assumed to scale with the population size, and the transmission rate\u02c7, i.e. D\u02c7I.

In this approach, individuals are represented by nodes while links represent their interactions. As described in different chapters of the book (see Chaps. 3, 6, and 10), human contacts are not heterogeneous in both number and intensity [12] [13] [14] [15] 17] but also change over time [18] . This framework naturally introduces two timescales, the timescale at which the network connections evolve, G and the inherent timescale, P , of the process taking place over the network. Although the dynamical nature of interactions might have crucial consequences on the disease spreading [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , the large majority of results in the literature deal with one of two limiting regimens [25, 26] . When G P , the evolution of the network of contacts is much slower than the spreading of the disease and the network can be considered as static. On the other hand, when P G , the links are said to be annealed and changes in networks structure are much faster than the spreading of the pathogen. In both cases the two time-scales are well separated allowing for a simpler mathematical description. Here we focus on the annealed approximation ( P G ) that provides a simple stage to model and understand the dynamical properties of epidemic processes. We refer the reader to Chap. 3 Face-to-Face Interactions for recent approaches that relax this time-scale separation assumption.",

Large degree nodes (hubs) facilitate an extremely efficient spreading of the infection by directly connecting many otherwise distant nodes. As soon as the hubs become infected diseases are able to reach a large fraction of the nodes in the network. Real interaction networks are extremely fragile to disease spreading. While this finding is somehow worrisome, it suggests very efficient strategies to control and mitigate the outbreaks. Indeed, hubs are central nodes and play a crucial role in the network connectivity [12] and by vaccinating a small fraction of them one is able to quickly stop the spread of the disease and protect the rest of the population. It is important to mention that in realistic settings the knowledge of the networks' structure is often limited. Hubs might not be easy to easily known and other indirect means must be employed. Interestingly, the same feature of hubs that facilitates the spread of the disease also allows for their easy detection. Since high degree nodes are connected to a large number of smaller degree nodes, one may simply randomly select a node, A, from the network and follow one of its links to reach another node, B. With high probability, node B has higher degree than A and is likely a hub. This effect became popularized as the friend paradox: on average your friends have more friends than you do [12] . Immunizing node B is then much more effective than immunizing node A. Remarkably, as counter-intuitive as this methodology might seem, it works extremely well even in the case of quickly changing networks [30] [31] [32] .",

In general, each outbreak will be different due to stochasticity and by combining all outbreaks generated for a certain parameter set we can calculate the probability distribution of the arrival times. The number of times that an outbreak generated the seeding of a country, say the UK, in the same day as it occurred in reality provides us with a measure of how likely the parameter values used are. By multiplying this probability for all countries with a known arrival time we can determine the overall Likelihood of the simulation:",

The set of parameters that maximizes this quantity is then the one whose values are the most likely to be correct. Using this procedure the team behind GLEAM determined that the mostly likely value of the basic reproductive ratio was R 0 D 1:75 [49] , a value that was later confirmed by independent studies [50, 51] . Armed with an empirical estimate of the basic reproductive ratio for an ongoing pandemic, they then proceeded to use this value to estimate the future progression of the pandemic. Their results predicting that the full peak of the pandemic would hit in October and November 2009 were published in early September 2009 [49] . A comparison between these predictions and the official data published by the health authorities in each country would be published several years later [52] clearly confirming the validity of GLEAM for epidemic forecasting in real time. Indeed, the model predicted, months in advance, the correct peak week in 87 % of countries in the north hemisphere for which real data was accessible. In the rest of cases the maximum error reported has been 2 weeks. GLEAM can also be further extended to include age-structure [53] , interventions and travel reductions.",

One might start by determining the size of the household by extracting from the distribution of household size of the country of interest and selecting the age and gender of the head of the household proportionally to the number of heads of households for that household size that are in each age group. Conditional on this synthetic individual we can then generate the remaining members, if any, of the household. The required conditional probability distributions and correlation tables can be easily generated [54] from high quality census data that can be found for most countries in the world. This process is repeated until enough synthetic households have been generated. Households are then aggregated into neighborhoods by selecting from the households according to the distribution of households in a specific neighborhood. Neighborhoods are similarly aggregated into communities and communities into census tracts.",

Data availability has started a second golden age in epidemic modeling [60] . All models are judged against surveillance data collected by health departments. Unfortunately, due to excessive costs, and other constraints their quality is far from ideal. For example, the influenza surveillance network in the USA, one of the most efficient systems in the world, is constituted of just 2900 providers that operate voluntarily. Surveillance data is imprecise, incomplete, characterized by large backlogs, delays in reporting times, and the result of very small sample sizes. Furthermore, the geographical coverage is not homogeneous across different regions, even within the same country. For these reasons the calibration and test of epidemic models with surveillance data induce strong limitations in the predictive capabilities of such tools. One of the most limiting issues is the geographical granularity of the data. In general, information are aggregated at the country or regional level.

In passive data collection, instead, information about individuals health status is mined from other available sources that do not require the active participation of users. News articles [63] , queries on search engines [74] , posts on online social networks [67, [70] [71] [72] [73] , page view counts on Wikipedia [75, 76] or other online/offline behaviors [77, 78] are typical examples.

The percentage of ILI visits, a typical indicator used by surveillance systems to monitor the unfolding of the seasonal flu, is estimated with a linear model based on search engine queries. This approach is general, and used in many different fields of Science. A quantity of interest, in this case the percentage of ILI visits P, is estimated using a correlated signal, in this case the ILI related queries fraction Q, that acts as surrogate. The fit allows the estimate of P as a function of the value of Q:",

As clear from the expression, the GFT is a simple linear fit, where the unknown parameters are determined considering historical data. The innovation of the system lies on the definition of Q that is evaluated using hundreds of billions of searches on Google. Indeed, GFT scans all the queries we submit to Google, without using information about users' identity, in search of those that ILI related. This is the paradigm of passive data collection in digital epidemiology. In the original model the authors measured the correlation of 50 millions search queries with historic CDC data, finding that 45 of them were enough to ensure the best correlation between the number of searches and the number of ILI cases. The identity of such terms has been kept secret in order to avoid changes in users' behavior. However, the authors provided a list of topics associated with each one of them: 11 were associated with influenza complications, 8 to cold/flu remedies, 5 to general terms for influenza, etc. Although the search for the terms has been performed without prior information, none of the most representative terms were unrelated to the disease. In these settings GFT showed a mean correlation of 0:97 with real data and was able to predict the surveillance value with 1-2 weeks ahead.",

The basic intuition is that Wikipedia is used to learn more about a diseases or a medication. Plus, the website is so popular that is most likely one of the first results of search queries on most search engines. The methods proposed so far monitor a set of pages related to the disease under study. Examples are Influenza, Cold, Fever, Dengue, etc. Page views at the daily or weekly basis are then used a surrogates in linear fitting models. Interestingly, the correlation with surveillance data ranges from 0:02 in the case of Ebola to 0:99 in for ILIs [75, 76] , and allows accurate predictions up to 2 weeks ahead. One important limitation of Wikipedia based methods is the lack of geographical granularity. Indeed, the view counts are reported irrespective of readers' location but the language of the page can be used as a rough proxy for location. Such approximation might be extremely good for localized languages like Italian but it poses strong limitations in the case of global languages like English. Indeed, it is reported that 51 % of pages views for English pages are done in the USA, 11 % in the UK, and the rest in Australia, Canada and other countries [76] . Besides, without making further approximation such methods cannot provide indications at scales smaller than the country level.",

GFT offers a particular clear example of the possible limitations of such tools. Indeed, despite the initial success, it completely failed to forecast the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [61, 83] . The model was updated in September 2009 to increase the number of terms to 160, including the 40 terms present in the original version. Nevertheless, GFT missed high 100 out of 108 weeks in the season 2011-2012.

            "text": "What are the reasons underlying the limitations of GFT and other similar tools? By construction, GFT relies just on simple correlations causing it to detect not only the flu but also things that correlate strongly with the flu such as winter patterns. This is likely one of the reasons why the model was not able to capture the unfolding of an off-season pandemic such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Also, changes in the Google search engine, that can inadvertently modify users' behavior, were not taken into account in GFT. This factor alone possibly explains the large overestimation of the peak height in 2013. Plus, simple auto-regressive models using just CDC data can perform as well or better than GFT [84] . The parable of GFT clearly shows both the potential and the risks of digital tools for epidemic predictions. The limitations of GFT can possibly affect all similar approaches based on digital passive data collection. In particular, the use of simple correlations measures does not guarantee the ability of capturing the phenomena across different scales in space and time with respect to those used in the training. Not to mention that correlations might be completely spurious. In a recent study for example, a linear model based on Twitter simply informed with the timeline of the term zombie was shown to be a good predictor of the seasonal flu [71] .",
