These benefits occur when persons with OUD remain on MOUD, however around half of persons started on MOUD remain retained on treatment through 12 months [11] , although reported ranges vary as wide as 26-91% [12] . There are demographic, clinical, and social factors that affect retention in MOUD treatment, and thus return to opioid use. Some of these factors have been studied more extensively than others, for example, those who are older have better retention on MOUD [11] . Other factors that have been identified to improve retention include stable housing, adequate or higher doses of methadone or buprenorphine, and reductions and cessation in other drug use [13] [14] [15] . Additionally, it has been reported that persons taking methadone often have better retention compared to those taking buprenorphine [11] . Stimulant use, including cocaine and methamphetamine, has been associated with decreased MOUD retention [16] .",

Additionally, mental health diagnoses and physical health status have demonstrated mixed results regarding their effects on MOUD retention [11] . Further, improvements in retention on MOUD have been shown to improve quality of life (QoL), [18] however, few studies examine if QoL can influence MOUD retention. Transportation as defined as motor vehicle services have also been associated with increased retention on MOUD, while use of transportation vouchers or bus passes have not shown an effect on MOUD retention [19] . However, studies evaluating client satisfaction with transportation services, regardless of type of services, have not been conducted. Finally, adults with OUD who seek MOUD after release from carceral settings may have decreased MOUD retention compared to those who initiate MOUD in the community due to barriers affecting recently released persons such as access to insurance, housing difficulties and low social support. MOUD retention measured through six months is a quality measure endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF), the gold standards for healthcare measurements [20] . We therefore sought to examine factors associated with MOUD retention to understand if there are factors that could be influenced to improve OUD treatment and associated outcomes. In this analysis, retention on MOUD through 6 months was analyzed among a cohort of adults with OUD actively seeking methadone and buprenorphine treatment in the community.",

A high dose of MOUD was defined as a methadone dose > 85 mg or [23] ) Since the cohort included both those receiving methadone and buprenorphine, this variable was dichotomized into 'high dose' of MOUD and 'not a high dose' of MOUD. Continuous and ordinal exposures included quality of life (QoL) scores (physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment) from the WHOQoL BREF [24] (scores range from 0 to 100), to examine if baseline QoL scores are associated with retention. OoL was examined to see if baseline QoL is associated with retention, rather than the reverse (retention on MOUD leading to better QoL), that has been examined in other published studies [18] . We also aimed to evaluate what aspects of QoL are associated with MOUD retention. Other exposures included opioid craving (how much participants are currently craving opioids, (Likert scale from 1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most craving), satisfaction with transportation (Likert scale from 1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied), and pain interference (to what extent do you feel that physical pain prevents you from doing what you need to do?).",

            "text": "There are many barriers that persons with OUD have to overcome to not only initiate MOUD, but also to receive adequate dosing of MOUD in the community. Regulations include dispensing at federally regulated opioid treatment programs (OTPs), daily visits to the OTP to receive methadone at the beginning of treatment [29] , and strict rules regarding missed doses and use of drugs [30] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, OTPs were allowed to provide up to 28 days of take-home methadone doses to patients, greatly reducing barriers. During these COVID-19 pandemic-related changes to OTP prescribing, there were no changes in positive urine drug tests for methadone [31] . Allowing these COVID-19 pandemicrelated changes to continue long term may help patients stay retained on methadone with adequate dosing [30] . Additionally, there is evidence that patient participation in methadone dose decisions leads to better perceptions of dose adequacy [32, 33] , and patient-centered models for office-based buprenorphine are preferred by patients [34] . Future work should focus on including patient perceptions in methadone and buprenorphine dosing to determine if this would improve retention in treatment. While our study did not find a statistically significant effect of housing on MOUD retention, there was a strong association between lack of housing and reduced retention on MOUD. Lack of housing remains a significant barrier to accessing treatment and MOUD retention. Individuals without housing often have competing priorities, including finding shelters to stay in, employment, and food. Housing First programs, which prioritize providing housing for unhoused individuals, followed by support services have positive benefits [35, 36] . These include increased housing stability, reductions in criminal justice involvement, and better quality of life [35] . Evidence varies on the effect of Housing First on substance use outcomes, with some studies showing increased MOUD adherence while others show decreased adherence [35] [36] [37] . More research is needed to evaluate if housing first could improve retention on MOUD and reduction in opioid overdoses and other negative consequences of opioid relapse.",

This analysis is a secondary analysis of a study aimed to generate hypotheses about the biological effects of MOUD treatment on persons with HIV and without HIV [21] . Because of the exploratory nature of this study, we accounted for multiple comparisons in our unadjusted analyses. This limited the number of significant differences we were able to report for MOUD retention, but reduced our chances of making any type I errors. However, because of the exploratory nature of this analysis, further studies that can determine causality between these factors and MOUD retention are needed. Individuals in this cohort were all choosing to start MOUD treatment in the community, and thus may be more representative of participants engaging in treatment compared to those enrolled in randomized controlled trials. Additionally, because we only included those with 6 months of study follow-up, selection bias could impact these results.",

Importantly, higher dose of buprenorphine and methadone improved retention as has been shown in other published research [11] . Through improving retention on MOUD, reductions in relapse to opioid use, overdose deaths and HIV and HCV transmission could result. More research is needed to understand and improve provider decisions on form and dose of MOUD, inclusion of patient preferences and pain interference, as well as improvements of housing and other structural determinations of healthcare to improve retention on medication treatment for OUD.
