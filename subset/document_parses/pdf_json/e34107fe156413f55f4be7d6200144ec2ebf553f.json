Using Joinpoint regression analysis, we estimated the expected suicide mortality in 2020 based on suicide mortality from 2011 to 2019, and compared results to the actual suicide mortality in Japan. We found that actual suicide mortality was significantly higher than the expected mortality among both men (excess mortality rate: 107.0%) and women (120.1%). This higher excess suicide mortality rate was particularly notable in women aged in their 20 s (154.0%) and 30s-40 s (130.7%).",

In Japan, around 20,000 people die from suicide every year. Although suicide mortality has been decreasing since 2009, it started to increase in 2020 (National Police Agency, 2021a). The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was a global pandemic in 2020. Many studies have reported that COVID-19 exacerbates multiple factors that may increase suicide mortality, including isolation, anxiety, economic fallout and domestic violence. (Banerjee et al., 2021) Although Japan had a lower cumulative incidence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 than most other developed countries in 2020 (World Health Organization 2020), real GDP decreased 4.5% (Cabinet Office, National Accounts of Japan, 2020) from the previous year. This socioeconomic stagnation might have contributed to the increase in suicide mortality in 2020. To assess the increase in suicide mortality in 2020, it is necessary to take into account the declining trend of the previous years. Here, we aimed to estimate the excess suicidal mortality in 2020 with consideration to the effect of the previous declining trend in Japan.",

Using the suicide mortality data from 2011 to 2019, we determined the best fitting annual percent change (APC) in suicide mortality in this period by Joinpoint regression analysis using the Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.9.0.0, provided by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (National Cancer Institute, 2021) . Joinpoint regression analysis can be applied to analyze trends in events such as cancer incidence. In particular, Joinpoint regression analysis makes it possible to identify the timing of a significant change in the slope of a trend and to calculate the average percentage change with 95% confidence intervals (Kim et al., 2000) .",

A second study from Japan using data from January to November 2020 found that the largest relative increase in suicide mortality rate was observed among women aged younger than 30 years and 30 to 49 years (Sakamoto et al., 2021) . The first COVID-19 wave in Japan began in early March 2020. The government declared a nationwide state of emergency on April 7 and the first epidemic terminated at the end of May. The second and third epidemics occurred in July and November, respectively (National Institute of Infectious Disease, 2021). The higher suicide mortality in July to December 2020 than that reported for the previous year by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, 2021) is considered attributable to these epidemics of COVID-19. Among other countries, elevated levels of adverse mental health conditions and suicidal ideation have been reported in the USA (Czeisler et al., 2020) ; an overall increase in mental distress has been reported in the UK (Pierce et al., 2020) ; and a moderate to high level of anxiety and low well-being have been reported in New Zealand (Every-Palmer et al., 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previous studies in Japan indicated that this effect was amplified among contingent workers, young workers, women and workers engaged in non-flexible jobs (Kikuchi et al., 2020) and that the increase in the number of deaths from suicide since July 2020 was partly explained by a decrease in the number of contingent workers on vector autoregression analysis (Motohshi et al., 2020) . Young and middle-aged Japanese women are more likely to be employed as contingent workers than men of the same age. We consider that the high excess suicide mortality seen in Japanese women aged in their 20 s to 40 s is likely attributable to the suppression of socioeconomic activities due to COVID-19 countermeasures.

The United Nations Development Programme reported that emerging data show that since the outbreak of COVID-19, violence against women and girls, and particularly domestic violence, has intensified, and that affected individuals require emergency shelter and protection services (United Nations Development Programme, 2020) . This increase in domestic violence may be attributable to people refraining from going out to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and to the deterioration in socioeconomic conditions. The increased risk of domestic violence due to the spread of COVID-19 might also have contributed to the excess suicide mortality among women aged 20-49. Our study also found that the EMR was higher than the reference in both men and women aged 70 and over. Since the Japanese pension system provides well for these aged generations, it is difficult to consider that this increased suicide mortality was caused by economic hardship. We suppose that one reason for the elevated suicide mortality is that old people had fewer opportunities to meet their family members or neighbors due to the \"stay home\" announcement of the government, which might have induced prolonged social isolation. In addition, daycare services for older people with physical disabilities were suspended to prevent infections in care facilities, and these individuals might have had fewer opportunities to use in-home care by caregivers.",
