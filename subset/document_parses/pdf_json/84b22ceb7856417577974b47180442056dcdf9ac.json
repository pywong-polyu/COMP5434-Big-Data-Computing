Registries can also be beneficial in quality improvement projects, 2 and for political accountability. Registries on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are of particular interest as a successful outcome depends on a complex chain involving the population, medical dispatch, emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital treatment. 3 For a society to improve survival after OHCA, detailed and reliable data must guide our efforts. Several studies and reviews have compared outcomes across countries and jurisdictions.

Ambulances personnel provide primary care and patient transportation, and a medical vehicle or helicopter carries an emergency physician to the patient location for all cardiac arrest situations. 14 A standard emergency number, 1-1-2, terminates at an Emergency Medical Communications Centres (EMCC).

Participants in the registry enter information from the EMS and may add in-hospital treatment, survival to hospital discharge and 30-day survival if this information is available.

We analysed the Utstein comparator group based on the 2014 definition, 9 including patients with a bystander-witnessed collapse and an initial shockable rhythm. For the cause of arrest, we used the Utstein definition from 2004. 20 During several personal meetings, we reviewed the results and rechecked the analyses.

Patient characteristics in both countries, such as age and gender, confirms previous reports. 6 Using registry data from two different countries, we encountered some challenges. A certain amount of recoding of variables had to be done, notably using survival to hospital discharge in GRR and 30-day survival in NorCAR. Both survival to discharge, and 30-day survival, have been used interchangeably in other international studies, including the latest recommendations for reporting. 9 Also, in a registry, it is not easy to verify the completeness of cases. 21 Most EMS in Europe have a paper-based reporting system, and there are no electronically available patient charts to use as controls. Both GRR and NorCAR are dependent on the attending EMS personnel remembering to submit a form after the event. This form is then manually entered into the registry database by data managers.",

In the latest published update on uniform reporting of Open access cardiac arrest, the Utstein reporting format, the authors stress the importance of reducing missing information. 9 We found that the rate of missing information is overall higher in GRR, and the variable with the highest missing rate is survival (7%). Survival information is mostly missing from entire hospitals, indicating that missing cases include both survivors and non-survivors. Due to GRR being a voluntary registry, information on cardiac arrest cases is not available from the entire country. Results are, however, comparable to overall results in yearly reports from GRR and the data in this study are considered to be representable for all regions reporting to the registry. 17 Reporting the incidence of cardiac arrest is primarily done using the number of patients per 100 000 inhabitants in the population served by the EMS. [6] [7] [8] Survival, however, is often presented as a proportion of the EMS treated patients. Percentages are presumed to be easier to understand and make comparability with already published data more straightforward. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals and the general public have become more used to population incidence as a measurement, and we believe it is time for survival after cardiac arrest to be published in this way. In 1993, Becker et al 22 published an analysis on the relationship between reported incidence and survival rates and advised incidence and not percentages. When there is more than a threefold difference in the incidence of EMS treated patients, as reported in the latest EuReCa study, 6 higher survival rates do not necessarily represent better quality of care. The difference could be that a registry with a low survival percentage is better at identifying all patients resuscitated by the EMS. Our study shows that the incidence of survival is similar in GRR and NorCAR, but the incidence of included patients is not. If we calculate the survival rate based on the number of patients resuscitated by the EMS, Norway seems to have better survival (15%) than Germany (12%).",

Response interval should ideally include the delay until EMS personnel are at the patient side, but the latter time point remains elusive due to manual registration. The extended response interval in Norway provides dispatchers more time to help bystanders start Open access CPR, connect and use a defibrillator, and is associated with a significantly higher number of patients having been successfully resuscitated before EMS arrival. On the downside, it probably also has a negative effect on survival. 25 26 The narrow distribution of response intervals in GRR (25-percentiles and 75-percentiles of 6 and 10 min) compared with the broader distribution found in NorCAR (25-percentiles and 75-percentiles of 6 and 14 min) indicates differences caused by geography and population density. Extended response intervals might also explain the lower incidence of EMS treated patients in Norway as bystanders or EMS personnel perceive resuscitation as futile when the response interval is prolonged. The Utstein comparator group is a subgroup that enables comparison between countries. 9 This subgroup has a more uniform treatment recommendation than the total population of patients with OHCA and does not include cases with unknown delays from collapse. Our results confirm that the differences between our countries also extends to this specific group. Differences between countries in the Utstein comparator group have been shown in several studies previously. 6 10 27 In Norway, all hospitals are state-owned, and the Norwegian Directory of Health issues guidelines for treatment. Results from quality registries are published yearly, naming and shaming hospitals and their adherence to guidelines. 28 There is a bypass protocol for the nearest University Hospital capable of performing PCI for cardiac arrest patients. If transport duration is prolonged, there are guidelines for prehospital treatment, including thrombolysis. In Norway, the in-hospital treatment after OHCA is standardised, but this is not the case in most German hospitals. In 2019, the German Resuscitation Council started an initiative to certify cardiac arrest centres, and GRR extended the benchmarking facilities for cardiac arrest centres. 29 Several factors are associated with increased survival after OHCA; younger age, presumed cardiac cause, shockable first rhythm, witnessed collapse, location of arrest in a public place, bystander CPR, early shock by a defibrillator, a short time from collapse to arrival of EMS and good postresuscitation care including temperature control and PCI. 15 30 Compared with GRR, the patients in NorCAR are younger, witnessed collapse is more common and more than four out of five receive bystander CPR. Compared with NorCAR, the patients in GRR more often have presumed cardiac cause, initial rhythm is shockable, and the EMS's response interval is shorter. There is a mix of factors associated with survival in both countries.",

If cardiac arrest is not a reportable condition, there is a greater risk that EMS systems and hospitals deliberately do not participate because of fear that their level of care is suboptimal.",
