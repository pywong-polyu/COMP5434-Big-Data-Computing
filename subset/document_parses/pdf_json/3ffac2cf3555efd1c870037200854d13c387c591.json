            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 spillback from humans into domestic and wild animals has been well documented, and an accumulating number of studies illustrate that human-to-animal transmission is widespread in cats, mink, deer, and other species. Experimental inoculations of cats, mink, and ferrets have perpetuated transmission cycles. We sequenced full genomes of Vero cell-expanded SARS-CoV-2 inoculum and viruses recovered from cats (n = 6), dogs (n = 3), hamsters (n = 3), and a ferret (n = 1) following experimental exposure. Five nonsynonymous changes relative to the USA-WA1/2020 prototype strain were near fixation in the stock used for inoculation but had reverted to wild-type sequences at these sites in dogs, cats, and hamsters within 1-to 3-d postexposure. A total of 14 emergent variants (six in nonstructural genes, six in spike, and one each in orf8 and nucleocapsid) were detected in viruses recovered from animals. This included substitutions in spike residues H69, N501, and D614, which also vary in human lineages of concern. Even though a live virus was not cultured from dogs, substitutions in replicase genes were detected in amplified sequences. The rapid selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro and in vivo reveals residues with functional significance during host switching. These observations also illustrate the potential for spillback from animal hosts to accelerate the evolution of new viral lineages, findings of particular concern for dogs and cats living in households with COVID-19 patients. More generally, this glimpse into viral host switching reveals the unrealized rapidity and plasticity of viral evolution in experimental animal model systems.",

These evolutionary changes can determine the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus in novel host species (2) . Pathogen host switching resulting in epidemic disease is a rare event that is constrained by the interaction between species (3) . In contrast to most species, humans move globally and regularly come into contact with domestic and peridomestic animals. Thus, when a novel virus spreads through human populations, there is an incidental risk of exposure to potentially susceptible nonhuman species.",

            "text": "This scenario has become evident with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). Originally resulting from viral spillover into humans (4, 5) , likely from an animal reservoir, spillback into a wide range of companion and wild animals has occurred or been shown to be plausible (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) , and an increasing number of studies have indicated a high frequency of human-to-animal SARS-CoV-2 spillback transmission (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Given the short duration of viral shedding, serologic analyses present a more accurate characterization of actual animal exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Such studies conducted in a variety of animal species have illustrated surprisingly high levels of seroconversion in cats and dogs and more recently freeranging deer (SI Appendix, Table S1 ) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) (83) (84) (85) (86) (87) . Other well-documented spillback events include numerous mink farms (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). In one of these reports, multiple feral cats living on a mink farm in the Netherlands during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were seropositive, likely from the direct transmission of the virus from mink to cats, as owned cats on the same farm were seronegative (19) . This further illustrates that cross-species transmission chains are readily achieved. Recent surveys of freeranging white-tailed deer in Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania revealed 33% seropositivity in free-ranging animals (20) . Active SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in a deer in Ohio (21) . Together, these findings suggest the likely establishment of multiple domestic animal and wildlife reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.",

This was demonstrated by reverse zoonosis of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to mink, followed by a selection in mink and zoonotic transmission back to humans (8) . Given that reverse zoonosis has been reported repeatedly in dogs and cats from households where COVID-19 patients reside, and the fact that up to 50% of households worldwide are inhabited by these companion animals, there is potential for similar transmission chains to arise via humans and their pets (22, 23) . Elucidating the viral selection and Significance SARS-CoV-2 emerged because of viral spillover from animals to humans, and spillback to other animal species has been observed with accelerating frequency. Cross-species transmission generally results in the rapid adaptation of the virus to the new host, and repeated transmissions may hasten viral evolution and novel strain emergence. We report the surprisingly rapid selection of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants in cell culture and following infection of nonhuman mammalian hosts, including dogs and cats. These molecular changes in SARS-CoV-2 provide insight into mechanisms of viral host adaptation, lay the groundwork for additional studies assessing dominant variant fitness and phenotype, and highlight the potential for human reinfection with new viral variants arising in species in close and frequent contact with humans.",

Documenting viral evolution following the spillover of SARS-COV-2 into new species is difficult given the unpredictability of timing of these events; therefore, experimental studies can greatly aid the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in animal species.

The default limit of detection for variant calling was set at 3%, but it was possible to observe variants with frequencies down to 0.1%, with possibly reduced quantitative accuracy (28) . There were 564 unique variants detected at 0.1% frequency or greater across all 16 datasets in the study. Of these, 174 were detected in the three cell culture-derived samples, and 390 (69%) were not identified in the viral inoculum at all.

These seven variants were found in cats and hamsters at lower frequency. A single novel amino acid variant (D138Y) was detected in all three hamsters. Cats 1 to 5 were experimentally inoculated; Cat 6 was infected through cohousing with Cat 5 1-d postinfection (6) . Cats were inoculated in two cohorts (Cohort 1 = 1, 2, and 3 and Cohort 2 = 4, 5, and 6). The virus recovered from cats in Cohort 1 had significantly more variants than cats in Cohort 2, but variants were at higher frequency (near fixation) in cats in Cohort 2 (P < 0.02). This observed variation is likely due to the difference in the sample collection timeline between the two experimental cohorts. Two amino acid variants (H69R and D614G) were found at >98% in Cats 5 and 6, and S686G was found in 99% of sequences from Cat 1. Around 6 of the 10 variants detected in Cat 5, including spike variants H69R and D614G, were also detected in Cat 6, which was infected through contact with Cat 5 (SI Appendix, Table S3 ). The single unique variant detected in the contact cat caused a frameshift at D124 in nsp15. The depth of coverage for Cat 5 was <40\u00d7 at this position, so no variants were called. No amino acid variants from SARS-CoV-2 sequences were shared across all six cats.",

            "text": "Cell Culture-Associated Mutation. Variants that reached near fixation in cell culture but reverted to wild type in animal infections suggest a role for these residues in facilitating in vivo versus in vitro infection. The rapid reversion of variants arising in Vero E6 cells (originally derived from African green monkeys) occurred in dogs, cats, and hamsters, suggesting that selective advantages of cell culture variants are due to differences between in vivo and in vitro environments rather than specific host-virus adaptation. Alternatively, changes may reflect hostspecific adaptations to the monkey and not in vitro infections. This explanation is less likely as the variants reverted in multiple species that are more distantly related to humans than African green monkeys, and distinct differences exist between in vivo and in vitro environments. For example, in vivo viral attachment and entry require the circumvention of respiratory epithelial defenses, such as mucus and cilia; residues which play roles in overcoming these physical features would not be highly selected in cell culture. Amino acid R685 is located in the furin cleavage site, a motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV and other SARSrelated coronaviruses (29) . The PRRAR insertion at this location provides a motif for serine proteases to cleave the spike protein into S1 and S2 subunits, a key step to initiating viral entry via membrane fusion. The deletion of the furin cleavage site has been shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in human respiratory cells, hamsters, and hACE2 mice (30) . Previous work has demonstrated the rapid emergence of spike variants at the furin cleavage motif, including R685H, following five passages in type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2)-deficient cells (31) . This explains the emergence of this variant in our study following the propagation in Vero E6 cells, which do not express high levels of TMPRSS2 (32) . The distribution of variants arising in vitro (nsp12, spike, N, and M; Fig. 2 ) indicates functions beyond receptor binding and entry as drivers of selection, which would be predicted to occur in spike.",

The abundance of variants detected in our study is in contrast to the few variants observed in large datasets of SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from humans (33) . Low-frequency variants (<25%) may represent mutations occurring during population expansion, following the infection of a new individual. The majority of variants arising in vivo were in the spike protein, which was under the strongest selective pressure, illustrating the importance of this residue in shaping cross-species transmission events. Variants detected in animals were likely to arise either by the rapid selection of low-frequency inoculum variants with structural features that favored in vivo attachment, entry, and replication or as de novo mutations arising from errors during viral replication.",

These experimental results contrast with widespread global reports of canine companions becoming infected through contact with their SARS-CoV-2-infected owners (35) (36) (37) . Many variants detected in dogs were not found in the inoculum, reached high frequencies (Table 2) , and were under strong selective pressure (Fig. 4) . The majority of canine variants were found in nonstructural replicase genes (Table 2) , providing strong evidence of selective pressure and host-viral molecular interactions in dogs directed toward the selection for viral replication function. The differences between reports of natural reverse zoonotic infections and laboratory exposures in dogs may stem from disparate doses, dose frequency, or strains (human-adapted or cell culture-propagated virus).",

By the end of February 2021, D614G represented 94.8% SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly available in the GISAID database (54) . The growth advantage of this variant is ascribed to replication fitness advantage (26, 55) . We identified D614G in two inoculated cats. This variant was not detectable in the inoculum, and thus likely arose and was under selection in cats. The variant reached fixation in Cat 5 and was transmitted to Cat 6 via contact infection, indicating this variant could become established in a cat-to-cat transmission chain. While it is important to consider each amino acid change in SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with all changes across the viral genome, the detection of specific substitutions in experimentally inoculated animals identical to changes in viral lineages infecting humans may suggest the convergent evolution or the potential for variants to originate in animals followed by spillover back into humans.",

The rapidity of in vitro and in vivo adaptation underscores the extraordinary plasticity and adaptive potential of SARS-CoV-2. Pathogens are under strong selective pressure to propagate in the host environment, while host defenses are aligned to prevent pathogen replication. This host-pathogen arms race results in varied outcomes that can lead to increases or decreases in virulence and transmission (57) .

A mixture of 24 \u03bcL Zymo RNA wash buffer, 3 \u03bcL DNase I buffer, and 3 \u03bcL DNase I (both New England Biolabs) was added to 30 \u03bcL of the mixture and incubated for 22 min at room temperature. Following incubation, columns were spun in collection tubes for 30 s at 9,000 g. RNA prep buffer (400 \u03bcL) was added to each column and centrifuged again. Flow through was discarded and columns washed with 800 \u03bcL RNA wash buffer, followed immediately by a second wash with 400 \u03bcL. Wash buffer was discarded, and samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 16,000 g to dry the membrane. We transferred columns to labeled, sterile microcentrifuge tubes and to elute RNA. Immediately following RNA extraction complementary DNA was generated by adding 1 \u03bcL of 3\u03bcg/\u03bcL of random primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 \u03bcL of 10 mM dNTPs (New England Biolabs) to 10 \u03bcL RNA and incubating at 65\u00b0C for 5 min on a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad), followed by chilling on ice. We added 4 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 First-Strand Buffer, 2 \u03bcL of 0.1 M DTT, and 1 \u03bcL RNase OUT (40 units/\u03bcL) to each sample, pipette mixed, and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 2 min. A total of 1 \u03bcL (200 units) SuperScript II RT was added, pipette mixed, and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 50 min, and 70\u00b0C for 15 min. cDNA was frozen at \u00c020\u00b0C until use in library preparation. The spike protein contained a notably higher proportion of all variants in comparison to its share of genome length. Gray shading represents the 95% CI for the slope of the regression line. (D) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant \"residues of concern\" are in NTD, RBD, and furin cleavage site. Residues described in the main text and Table 1 in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer are highlighted on structure 6VXX. Blue indicates NTD and yellow indicates RBD. The furin cleavage site and adjacent residue 686 are in the indicated loop, which was not resolved in this structure.",

We employed an ampliconbased next-generation sequencing approach using the primers and protocols developed and optimized for SARS-CoV-2 by the ARTIC Network (60, 61). All samples were sequenced with ARTIC version 3 primers except for Cat 5 and one replicate of Cat 4, which were sequenced with the previous version 2 primers. This sequencing method generates high coverage of viral genomes from even low-template samples by utilizing an initial PCR step resulting in \u223c400 bp amplicons and primers that span the coding region (60) . Briefly, two primer pools were used for the initial PCR amplification and then pooled prior to library preparation. We then visualized PCR products on agarose gels and quantified them with the Qubit Broad Range kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). ARTIC primers. PCR amplification was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol for PlatinumTM SuperFiTM PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following primer set: forward, AGGCTGCGTTA-TAGCTTGGA and reverse, CTGTGGATCACGGACAGCAT. Products were visualized on agarose gels and purified using the MEGAquick-spinTM Plus Total Fragment DNA Purification Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology), prior to being ligated into pJET1.2/blunt vectors and cloned using a CloneJet PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasmids were purified from Ferret 2 (n = 6 clones) and Ferret 3 (n = 3 clones) with the DNA-Spin Plasmid Purification Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and direct sequenced in both directions (Psomagen, Inc.). Sequences were aligned to the USA-WA1/2020 reference sequence and interrogated at position 23,064 for the presence of the A > C single-nucleotide change that causes spike N501T.",

Nextflow is a bioinformatics workflow manager that facilitates the development of complex and reproducible computational pipelines (62) . Briefly, data were trimmed for adapters and low quality using Cutadapt (63), followed by aligning reads to the viral reference sequence. Data were preprocessed for quality with GATK (64), prior to calling SNVs and SVs with LoFrEq (65) . SnpEff and SnpSift were used to annotate variants and predict their functional effects (66, 67) . We designed our variant-calling pipeline to ensure that we could differentiate between variants that were not detected because of their absence or presence at a frequency below our detection threshold, as compared to the inadequacy of coverage depth. The outputs of these analyses were tabulated, processed, and visualized in R. University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Chimera software was used to visualize the location of variants in the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (68) . SNPGenie was used to calculate nonsynonymous and synonymous nucleotide diversity (69) . SNPGenie takes a population of sequences and estimates the mean number of pairwise differences per site or the nucleotide diversity. Estimates are weighted by allele frequencies. The SNPGenie snpgenie.pl takes as input variant call information contained in .vcf files, a reference genome and genome annotations, and outputs estimates of nucleotide diversity at nonsynonymous and synonymous coding sites at both a genome/population level and by gene product. One advantage of using the nucleotide diversity statistic (\u03c0) to compare intrahost viral diversity is that it is not biased by variations in sequencing depth (70) .",
