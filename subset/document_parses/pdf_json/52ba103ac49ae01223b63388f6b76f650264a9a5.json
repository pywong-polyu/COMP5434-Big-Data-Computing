The current preregistered study examined purpose in life as a psychological resource that may buffer against loneliness and increase intentions to engage in health-protective behaviors. Research Design and Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 517 adults (mean = 37.71, SD = 11.30; range = 19-73) reported their levels of purpose in life, current and prepandemic levels of loneliness, and degrees to which they intended to engage in behaviors known to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Results: Across age, having a stronger sense of purpose in life was associated with lower loneliness, as well as greater intentions to engage in COVID-protective behaviors. Higher loneliness was associated with lower intentions to maintain social distance and engage in additional health promotion behaviors such as handwashing. However, this link was not present at higher levels of purpose in life. Older age was also associated with less loneliness, but not for individuals with lower levels of purpose in life. Discussion and Implications: Results suggest that psychological resources such as purpose in life are associated with increased protective health behaviors. Furthermore, purpose in life may reduce loneliness and counteract the negative effects of stressors that diminish the willingness to engage in health-protective behaviors. Our data also highlight resilience among older individuals in times of isolation during a global pandemic.",

            "text": "The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 has threatened the health of millions across the globe. Avoiding close contact with others by putting physical distance between people, or \"social distancing,\" is one of the most effective strategies to slow the spread of the virus along with other health-promoting recommendations such as handwashing. While social distancing is critical to stay safe during the pandemic, it also has increased stress associated with social isolation and loneliness. Research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that stay-at-home orders increased loneliness (Tull et al., 2020) , and social isolation exacerbated the negative effect of pandemic-related life changes on well-being Losada-Baltar et al., 2021; Minahan et al., 2021) . Furthermore, people may cope with stress by engaging in unhealthy behaviors (Mezuk et al., 2017) . Stress associated with loneliness and/or loneliness itself as a stressor during a pandemic may diminish people's engagement with protective health behaviors against the COVID-19. Following the call to identify protective fac-tors for at-risk populations during the pandemic (Resnick et al., 2021) , the current study examined whether greater availability of psychological resources would be associated with increased resilience and protection against illness in the face of challenges. Specifically, we tested purpose in life as a psychological resource that may protect individuals from loneliness during social isolation and encourage health-protective behaviors to counteract COVID-19 risk.",

Purpose in life is one of the six components of well-being in the Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being, which identifies psychological resources that contribute to health (Ryff, 1995 (Ryff, , 2014 Ryff & Keyes, 1995) . The conviction to find meaning and purpose even at times when the world seems meaningless and horrific is at the core of human flourishing and eudaimonic well-being (Ryff, 2014; Ryff & Singer, 2003 . In the face of adversity, purpose in life provides an orientation toward goals and motivates actions that are aligned with personal values, thereby promoting resilience and protection against illness (Ryff et al., 1998) . Supporting this framework, purpose in life has been consistently associated with reduced stress, enhanced well-being, and greater openness to health-protective behaviors (Roepke et al., 2014; Ryff & Singer, 1998) . Specifically, having a stronger sense of purpose in life was uniquely associated with increased longevity (Boyle et al., 2010) , reduced risk of age-related conditions such as heart diseases (Cohen et al., 2016) and cognitive impairment (Lewis et al., 2017) , and healthier lifestyles that are key to successful aging, including physical activity (Hooker & Masters, 2016) and the use of preventive health services (Kim et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "In the face of challenges that threaten health and well-being, individuals use various coping strategies based on their appraisal of the stressor and resource availability (e.g., stress and coping model; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) . When resources are scarce, individuals may engage in dysfunctional coping strategies that temporarily relieve but eventually exacerbate the stress (Biggs et al., 2017) . For example, stress may create a trade-off between mental well-being and physical health behaviors (Mezuk et al., 2010) or deprioritize health behaviors (Mezuk et al., 2017) . If, instead, protective resources such as purpose in life are available, individuals are more able to effectively fight off the deleterious effects of stress (Ryff & Singer, 2003) . Some evidence from prepandemic research suggests that purpose in life may benefit individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic: A stronger sense of purpose has been associated with less perceived loneliness among older adults aged 60 and older (Neville et al., 2018) . Furthermore, purpose in life may promote receptivity to health-protective behaviors. For example, individuals with a greater sense of self-transcendent purpose showed lower neural activity associated with defensiveness in response to self-relevant health messages (Kang et al., 2017) and lower conflict-related processing in the brain while exposed to health messages, which in turn predicted the likelihood of endorsing protective health recommendations (Kang et al., 2019) . Taken to the context of a global pandemic, having clear goals that give meaning to life and knowing which actions would bring oneself closer to those goals may reduce the conflict between the stress of loneliness and the need to engage in health behaviors to protect oneself and others (Kang et al., 2019; Ryff & Singer, 1998) .",

In addition to the physical risk, however, it is unclear whether older individuals are also more vulnerable to psychological risks such as loneliness during a pandemic. On the one hand, recent studies highlight remarkable resilience among older populations, such that older compared to younger adults during the COVID-19 pandemic reported lower levels of stress Knepple Carney et al., 2021; Nelson & Bergeman, 2021) and loneliness (Losada-Baltar et al., 2021; Minahan et al., 2021; Polenick et al., 2021) .

Trade-offs between mental well-being and physical health behaviors may further exacerbate physical health risks. The current study tested purpose in life as a component of well-being that can confer protection against illness, increase resilience, and promote protective health behaviors during a health crisis. Specifically, we examined the relationships among purpose in life, loneliness, and intentions to engage in COVID-protective behaviors such as social distancing and handwashing across age, with a specific focus on outcomes among older age groups. We publicly preregistered our prediction that purpose in life would be associated with decreased loneliness and enhanced preventive health intentions (https://osf.io/39vfg/). We also tested whether purpose in life may moderate the links between age and loneliness, as well as the link between loneliness and intentions to engage in COVID-protective behaviors.",

In addition, participants' perceived norms and beliefs regarding COVID-protective behaviors were assessed (Supplementary Material SI2 and SI3). Ten protective behavior items included avoiding social contact, that is, social distancing (n = 4), hand hygiene (n = 4), and staying at home (n = 2). As preregistered, items were averaged to create a single COVID-preventive intention score per participant (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.82). We also conducted exploratory analyses to determine whether effects were driven by specific types of prevention behaviors that are more (e.g., social distancing) or less (e.g., handwashing) directly linked to loneliness versus stress in general. Results suggested that the overall relationships were not specific to the types of protective health behaviors (Supplementary Material SI4) and so we treated them together as a single measure as planned (https://osf.io/39vfg/). Questions were selected based on recommendations made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time of study designing (March 2020), which placed the greatest emphasis on social distancing and handwashing.",

First, we found that age was negatively associated with loneliness, such that older compared to younger individuals reported feeling less lonely currently (B = \u22120.02, t Contrary to our preregistered prediction, we did not detect a significant interaction between purpose in life and age in predicting current levels of loneliness (B = \u22120.01, t (509) = \u22121.07, p = .287, 95% CI [\u22120.02 to 0.01]); rather, the purpose was related to reduced loneliness across age. Although this is consistent with previous evidence linking purpose in life to enhanced well-being (Roepke et al., 2014) , recent work suggests that lower levels of purpose in life are especially harmful to at-risk populations, predictive of increased mortality risk among individuals aged 50 and older (Shiba et al., 2021) . As such, we further explored the relationship between age and loneliness for people with different levels of purpose in life. Simple slopes analyses (Aiken et al., 1991) examined whether age predicted loneliness at 1 SD below the mean (3.3), at the mean (4.3), and 1 SD above the mean (5.3) levels of purpose. Following procedures by Aiken et al. (1991) , all variables were meancentered for simple slopes analyses. Results indicated purpose as a protective factor for older ages, such that older age was associated with less loneliness only at high and mean, but not lower levels of purpose in life (Figure 1) .

This result is consistent with previous studies that linked a stronger sense of purpose to lower loneliness among older populations (Neville et al., 2018) . However, little is known about the relationship between purpose and loneliness among younger age groups, and the current finding is among the first to show that purpose predicted lower loneliness across a wider range of ages. Furthermore, having a stronger sense of purpose was associated with both the current and prepandemic levels of loneliness, suggesting some degree of generalizability of the current findings beyond the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We note, however, that the prepandemic loneliness was measured at the same time point as the current loneliness and represents how lonely participants thought they were, which might not be a correct reflection of how lonely they actually were prior to the pandemic. Purpose in life was also associated with greater intentions to engage in health behaviors (i.e., disease-protective behaviors including social distancing and handwashing) in our data. This result complements previous literature on purpose in life and health, further supporting that having a strong sense of purpose in life can enhance well-being by promoting openness to health-protective behaviors and counteracting stress (Roepke et al., 2014) . The current result also extends previous findings that showed purpose in life increased the use of preventive health care service (Kim et al., 2014) to wider areas of daily life and habits. That is, beyond enhancing individuals' health, purpose in life may promote the health of communities by reducing the preventable infectious diseases burden and may have important public health implications, especially in times of epidemic and pandemic health emergencies.",

This result seemingly contradicts the broader literature on age-related risk for loneliness (Berg-Weger & Morley, 2020; Pinquart & Sorensen, 2001) ; however, it bolsters growing evidence that people may cultivate resilience as they grow older (van Kessel, 2013) . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, at least . However, this relationship weakened at lower levels of purpose, such that age was no longer associated with current loneliness at 1 SD below the mean purpose (B = \u22120.01, t (509) = \u22121.00, p = .319, 95% CI [\u22120.03 to 0.01]). However, the slopes did not significantly differ from one another (ps > .50). (B) Simple slopes analysis showing the relationship between purpose in life and current loneliness across age, at 1 SD below the mean (26.4 years), mean (37.7 years), 1 SD above the mean (49 years), and 2 SD above the mean (60.3 years) ages. The association between purpose and loneliness did not differ significantly by age but was directionally strongest for older individuals (B). six recent studies reported \"unexpected\" findings that older individuals outpaced younger counterparts in terms of their ability to cope with stress and loneliness Knepple Carney et al., 2021; Losada-Baltar et al., 2021; Minahan et al., 2021; Nelson & Bergeman, 2021; Polenick et al., 2021) . Our result continues to highlight extraordinary resilience among older adults and challenges ageism prevalent during a global crisis (Colenda et al., 2020; Vervaecke & Meisner, 2021) , indicating that older adults are not uniformly vulnerable. Instead, the link between age and loneliness differed by purpose in life, suggesting that older individuals with a weaker sense of purpose may not benefit from age-related resilience. Therefore, interventions that enhance purpose in life may be particularly effective for older adults who tend to experience a decline in purpose after 60 years of age (Pinquart, 2002) .",

This result is consistent with prior research that showed stress may prompt individuals to rely on dysfunctional coping strategies (Biggs et al., 2017; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and diminish people's engagement in health behavior (Mezuk et al., 2017) . In the context of a pandemic, the desire to reach out to others, even at the expense of risking health, might be a natural response in times of extreme social isolation and loneliness (Mezuk et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, loneliness was not associated with COVID-19 risk behaviors among individuals with a strong sense of purpose. This suggests that purpose in life may provide additional resources needed to engage in positive coping strategies, even when the health behavior (e.g., social distancing) may temporarily result in increased isolation. By providing a clear sense of long-term goals that are aligned with personal values, purpose in life may protect individuals from illness (Ryff & Singer, 1998) and the deadly threat of social isolation (Pantell et al., 2013) . Furthermore, previous work suggests that highly purposeful individuals may experience less conflict during health decision making (Kang et al., 2019) . When presented with the options to resolve stress associated with loneliness by engaging in COVID-risk behaviors versus to maintain health behaviors that may result in greater isolation but will protect the self and others, individuals with a strong sense of purpose may experience less conflict in choosing the latter, having clear views about one's core values and goals.",

First, the current study was conducted online via MTurk to expedite data collection within the constraints posed by the pandemic that made in-person data collection difficult. Researchers have warned against overgeneralizing MTurk data of older adults as they may differ from the general older adult population across demographics and health status (Ogletree & Katz, 2020) . Please see Supplementary Material SI1 for measures we took to improve MTurk data quality control. Second, we used single-item measures to assess participants' levels of loneliness, which has been used successfully in past studies (Jylh\u00e4, 2004; Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2020) . However, a single-item question cannot distinguish different types of loneliness, which would be important when considering interventions for loneliness (Luanaigh & Lawlor, 2008) . Finally, while we intended to examine age differences across adulthood, our results focused on predictive models based on a sample with only a small number of older adults aged 55 and older (n = 49). Future work may oversample older adults aged 65 and older to match the age distribution of the general population.",

Notwithstanding the physical susceptibility to COVID-19, older, compared to younger, individuals in our study were able to better adapt to the drastic shift in social life during a pandemic. Our results also suggest that purpose in life is a valuable psychological resource that may empower individuals to make life-saving health decisions that protect their own health and those around them. Furthermore, the buffering effects of purpose may particularly protect against loneliness and offset the relationship between loneliness and COVID-protective behaviors. More generally, the current results suggest potential value in testing interventions that foster a sense of purpose in life, which may help buffer negative consequences of stress related to loneliness that diminish people's motivation to engage with health-protective behaviors. That is, the purpose may help at-risk individuals to overcome threats to health and well-being by providing a sense of meaning and connection even in times of extreme isolation and stress.",

Here we sought to consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, and other factors. We obtained the predicted gender of the first and last authors of each reference by using databases that store the probability of a first name being carried by a woman Zhou et al., 2020) . By this measure (and excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper), our references contain 37.14% woman(first)/woman(last), 13.09% man/woman, 31.4% woman/man, and 18.38% man/man. This method is limited in that (a) names, pronouns, and social media profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity, and (b) it cannot account for intersex, nonbinary, or transgender people.",
