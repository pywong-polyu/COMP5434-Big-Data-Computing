Pressures to increase the isolation healthcare facility to cope with the growing number of patients led to an exploration of the use of wearables for vital signs monitoring among stable COVID-19 patients. Vital signs wearables were chosen for use in our facility with the purpose of reducing patient contact and preserving personal protective equipment. The process of deciding on the wearable solution as well as the implementation of the solution brought much insight to the team. This paper presents an overview of factors to consider in implementing a vital signs wearable solution. This includes considerations before deciding on whether or not to use a wearable device, followed by key criteria of the solution to assess. With the use of wearables rising in popularity, this serves as a guide for others who may want to implement it in their institutions.",

Rather, adjustments to work processes should be made to maximize the benefits of technology without increasing the burden on staff. For instance, protocol may require nurses to check the wearables recordings at fixed intervals rather than continuously.",

CIFs isolated patients with very mild symptoms not requiring hospital stay. These patients were provided with vital signs monitoring devices (not wearables) and were required to self-chart their vital signs. Challenges faced were that some patients confused the PR with SpO 2 and entered \"PR = 99 bpm, SpO 2 = 60%, \" instead of the other way round.
