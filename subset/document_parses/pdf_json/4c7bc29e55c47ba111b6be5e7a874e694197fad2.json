The similarity to the anxiety levels of frontline health workers during SARS implies high levels of anxiety among the lay public during the current COVID-19 outbreak.

Therefore, it is important to maintain a moderate amount of perceived susceptibility and severity of disease to promote prevention practices, as overtly high level may adversely result in high anxiety distress among the population. Another clear lesson learned from SARS is that the effect of an infectious disease outbreak alters the economic and social patterns of people's lives, which negatively influences the psychological well-being of the people (26) . Likewise, this study found the increased effect of social and household economic impact associated with COVID-29 was another significant predictor of high anxiety levels.
