Evidence also suggests that rates of COVID-19 vaccination differ by sociodemographic factors, religion, and certain underlying health conditions [6, 7] . However, the evidence for COVID-19 vaccination rates by characteristics has so far focused on older adults and the clinically vulnerable, who were initially prioritised for vaccination. Less is known about COVID-19 vaccination rates in younger adults, or about differences in the impact of sociodemographic factors across different age groups. Understanding which sociodemographic, economic, and cultural factors are associated with lower vaccination rates across the whole adult population has major implications for the design of policies that help to maximise coverage of the vaccination campaign. Achieving a high rate of vaccination in the population and not just in those at the highest risk is critical to slow infection, reduce hospital admissions, and help healthcare systems and countries recover from the pandemic [8] .",

A study of seasonal influenza vaccination in England found that uptake was highest among Asian adults aged 18-64 [4] . While different ethnic categories were used in the current study, we did find high coverage among Indian and younger Chinese adults. Religion was recognised as a potential factor in vaccination behaviour prior to COVID-19 [10] and two recent analyses of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in England found that, after adjusting for geographical and sociodemographic factors, coverage was lowest amongst individuals identifying as Muslim, Buddhist, or Other Religion [6, 11] . Greater area deprivation has been associated with lower rates of vaccination in general, and against COVID-19 specifically, although again evidence for the latter has been limited to older adults [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Few studies have explored COVID-19 vaccination coverage by sex or disability status. One study of adults aged 80 years and over reported no difference in coverage by sex, and slightly higher coverage among those with physical comorbidities [7] . Likewise, a recent study reported slightly higher rates of vaccine coverage among adults aged 70 years and over with a disability compared to those without [6] .",

This sex difference was greatest in the initial months of roll-out of the vaccination programme, which may be due to the greater proportion of women in health and social care roles who were initially prioritised for vaccination. However, this sex difference has not been eliminated over time. Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that vaccination coverage is lower among people with disabilities and in those living in more deprived areas, however we additionally found that the differences in coverage by area deprivation appeared to be greater among younger adults.",

Unlike previous research that has focused on initial months of the vaccination programme in England and is therefore limited to certain groups such as older adults and the clinically vulnerable, our data spans the entire vaccination programme between December 2020 and August 2021 and is therefore more representative of the whole adult population.

We focused primarily on characteristics that are unlikely to change over time, such as ethnicity and religion, but for characteristics that are more likely to change over time, such as disability status, the time difference may introduce some bias. However, we would expect this to dilute any differences observed rather than over-inflate them, because we will be missing new disabilities. Area deprivation was derived from GPES and measured in 2019 and is therefore not subject to the same bias. An additional limitation is that, because the Public Health Data Asset was based on the 2011 Census, it excluded people who were living in England in 2011 but who did not take part in the Census, as well as respondents who could not be linked to the 2011-2013 NHS patient register and recent migrants. As a result, we excluded 19.9% of vaccinated people who could not be linked to the PHDA, therefore our population may not be fully representative of the population living in England. Finally, as our aim was to present differences in vaccination rates in order to identify areas of greatest public health priority, our analyses were descriptive in nature and stratified by, but did not adjust for, likely confounders. A previous study in older adults showed that adjusting for covariates reduced, but did not eliminate, differences in COVID-19 vaccination coverage by ethnic group, religious affiliation, and area deprivation [6] .",
