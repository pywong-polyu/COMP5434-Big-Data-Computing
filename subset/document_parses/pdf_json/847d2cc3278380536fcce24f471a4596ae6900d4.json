Understanding how perceptions about precision medicine differ by background may inform activities to better understand such differences. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Center members and beyond. Data were collected on categories of educational background, current activities, and level of agreement with 20 statements related to genomics and health disparities. Respondents categorized their background and activities as social/behavioral, genetics, both, or neither. Fisher's exact test was used to assess levels of agreement in response to each statement. Statistically significant associations were further analyzed using ordinal logistic regression adjusting for age, self-identified race/ethnicity, and gender. Results: Of 130 respondents, 50 (38%) identified educational backgrounds and current activities as socialbehavioral or genomic 55 (42%). Respondents differed by educational background on the statement ''Lifestyle and other life experiences influence how genes impact disease risk'' ( p = 0.0009). Respondents also differed by current activities on the statement ''Reducing disparities in access to health care will make precision medicine more effective'' ( p = 0.0008), and on ''Racism and discrimination make me concerned about how genetic test results will be used'' ( p = 0.0011). Conclusions: Respondents who differed on prior education and current activities, whether social behavioral science or human genomics, were associated with different perceptions regarding precision medicine and health disparities. These results identify potential barriers and opportunities to strengthen transdisciplinary collaboration. Myers, et al.; Health Equity 2021, 5.1 ",

A description of the sample by age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational background, and research area is provided in Table 1 . The average age was 51.7 years, the sample was 45% female and 51.6% white, non-Hispanic/Latino. Over half the sample indicated neither social-behavioral nor genetics educational backgrounds or current research areas. About equal proportions reported social-behavioral education (21.5%) or genetics education (20.0%). Similar proportions reported current research in these areas (16.9% social-behavioral, 22.3% genetics). A small proportion reported both backgrounds (4.6%) and current research areas.

There seems to be more overall agreement than disagreement among participants despite their differing educational background and research activities. Of the 20 survey statements, only 3 identified significant differences between groups, suggesting that most of the statements that were included in our survey may be independent of educational background and research activity, and may be related to other contextual or cultural factors. This may also indicate that a select few statements in this pilot survey were optimal for identifying topics where perspectives differ substantially between groups. The distribution of responses by educational background showed that answers to the statement, ''Lifestyle and other life experiences influence how genetics impact disease risk,'' were significantly associated with educational background, while for the statement ''Racism and discrimination make me concerned about how genetic test results will be used,'' engagement in genetics research was significantly associated with disagreement. These findings open a window of opportunity to understand and narrow the knowledge and perception gaps that may delay precision medicine success toward reducing health disparities. Consistent with this need is the answer pattern to the statement, ''Reducing disparities in access to health care will make precision medicine more effective,'' where the response pattern was complex with no social behavioral researchers disagreed with the statement, but a larger proportion of individuals engaged in genetics research strongly agreed than overall. The response pattern to this question suggests that the question itself is multifold and should be simplified or more clearly defined for a future study.",
