If the event is deemed uncontrollable, efforts are doomed useless. However, the controllability of a situation might be real or simply perceived; if the patient perceives the pandemic as controllable, a task-centered strategy may be efficient [21] . This finding is consistent with those described by Chew et al. [9] from the general population. In this review of 24 studies, the coping strategies to face emergent infectious diseases focused on task solving and therefore allowed respondents to actively reduce feelings of uncertainty and increase feelings of control over their health. Nevertheless, some respondents favor avoidance strategies. In our series, only seven (11.9%) respondents used avoidance-focused strategies. We did not evidence any clinical or anamnestic characteristics associated with a non-task-focused response. This type of strategy aims at distancing the stressful situation in order to avoid confronting the emotions that may be associated with the event and therefore avoid actions to \"solve\" the situation.",

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were expected to have increased psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression, during the COVID-19 crisis [6] . In our series, half of the LT candidates experienced anxiety or depression symptoms. A high rate in this context is understandable. First, patients with end-stage chronic lung disease awaiting LT are prone to such disorders, with the prevalence of pretransplant depression ranging from 34.3% to 50.0% and prevalence of pretransplant anxiety ranging from 25.1% to 50.0% [5] . Mood, anxiety or adaptation disorders before LT are reported in 67.6% of LT recipients [3] . Indeed, waiting for LT is a stressful situation because of the uncertainty while waiting for the call for transplantation and because of patients' perception of their own physical deterioration. Second, COVID-19 had a significant impact on French hospitals, including ours [22] , particularly on organ procurement and transplantation [23] . LT candidates might have been particularly worried about their ability to receive an LT during the COVID-19 pandemic. In France, the lay press relayed information about the overwhelmed health system during the pandemic and the suspension of surgical procedures, which might have exacerbated the feeling of anxiety for LT candidates.",

Teleconsultations have been assessed, with results not significantly different from face-to-face interviews in terms of patient satisfaction, quality of life, and psychological symptoms [24, 25] . In the absence of face-to-face interviews, teleconsultations help to maintain the relationship between patients and the healthcare team, to provide psychological support, limit isolation, and maintain the trust-based relationship. Maintaining this link also allows the caregiver to remain alert to changes in the patient's mood, to prevent psychological suffering or distress and to provide a response. In our opinion, the family or proxy implication is hardly conceivable in lieu of professional intervention.
