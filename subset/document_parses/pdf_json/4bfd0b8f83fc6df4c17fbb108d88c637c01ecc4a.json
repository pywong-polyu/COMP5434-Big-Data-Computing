            "text": "Since its initial identification in ticks in 2010, Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) has been described in cattle, rodents, and primates. To better understand the diversity, evolution, and transmission of JMTV, we sampled 215 ticks, 104 cattle bloods, 216 bats, and 119 rodents in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province, China as well as 240 bats from Guizhou and Henan Provinces. JMTV was identified in 107 ticks (from two species), 54 bats (eleven species), 8 rodents (three species), and 10 cattle, with prevalence levels of 49.8, 11.8, 6.7, and 9.6 per cent, respectively, suggesting that bats may be a natural reservoir of JMTV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all the newly identified JMTVs were closely related to each other and to previously described viruses. Additionally, all tick and mammalian JMTV sampled in Wenzhou shared a consistent genomic structure, suggesting that the virus can cocirculate between ticks and mammals without observable variation in genome organization. All JMTVs sampled globally could be divided into two phylogenetic groups, Mantel tests suggested that geographic isolation, rather than host species, may be the main driver of JMTV diversity. However, the exact geographical origin of JMTV was difficult to determine, suggesting that this virus has a complex evolutionary history.",

The emergence of these infectious diseases results from the spillover or crossspecies transmission of zoonotic agents from their natural reservoir hosts to humans (Wolfe et al. 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 ). This process is highlighted by the ongoing pandemic of pneumonia (COVID-2019), caused by a novel coronavirus , that is posing a major threat to global public health (WHO, 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020) . Although greater efforts are needed to determine its natural reservoir hosts, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 likely arose in bats and then either passed directly, or via mammalian intermediate hosts, to humans (Lam et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Zhang and Holmes 2020) .",

For example, both patterns are apparent in viruses of the order Bunyavirales. Although these viruses have a broad spectrum of hosts, including different phyla and even different kingdoms (Animalia and Plantae), there are clear host boundaries at either the virus genus or family levels (Guo et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2016a Shi et al. , 2018 . Notably, at the species level, while some viruses (e.g., Seoul virus) appear to infect multiple closely related rodent taxa, no viruses have been found to circulate in both invertebrates and vertebrates or both arthropods and plants. In contrast, viruses of the family Flaviviridae exhibit more complex virus-host relationships (Gaunt et al. 2001; Kitchen et al. 2011; Blitvich and Firth 2015) . For example, some viruses (such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus) are transmitted among mammals by arthropod vectors, whereas others (like hepatitis C virus) have no known vector cycle. As the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans are often due to the spillover or cross-species transmission of zoonotic agents from their natural reservoir hosts, a better understanding of the association between viruses and their hosts may help prevent future emergence events, especially for those viruses that may have pathogenic potential in humans.",

The viral genome comprises four separate segments-denoted S1-S4-of single-stranded positive sense RNA. These segments encode five proteins: the flavivirus NS5-like protein (NSP1), the nonstructural protein resembling the NS2b-NS3 complex of flaviviruses(NSP2), the envelope protein (VP1), the capsid protein (VP2), and the membrane protein (VP3). Although the S1 and S3 segments are closely related to the nonstructural protein genes (NS3 and NS5) of flaviviruses, the remaining two segments (S2 and S4) are unique to this virus and have no known homologs (Qin et al. 2014) .",

Recently, it was suggested that JMTV was associated with febrile disease in China and Kosovo (Emmerich et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2019) , suggesting a possible role in public health. It is therefore of clear importance to better understand the diversity and transmission of JMTV in nature.",

Their genome size is described in Supplementary Table S1 . The viruses newly identified in ticks, cattle, bats, and rodents shared >93 per cent nt identity and >95 per cent aa identity in all four segments. The nt similarity between viruses in ticks, cattle, bats, and rodents from Wenzhou was 93.7-100 per cent. Notably, the identity of some viruses (JMTV/Apodemus agrarius/ Wenzhou/WZAa112/2016 and JMTV/Rhipicephalus microplus/ Fig. 2) . Indeed, all viruses identified in bats, cattle, rodents, and ticks collected in Wenzhou shared the same genomic structure (Table 2 ). However, viruses sampled from different geographic regions exhibited differences in the length of VP1, NSP2, and VP3 genes, with great variation between viruses sampled in China and other countries including Uganda, French Antilles, Turkey, and Kosovo (Fig. 2) . Variation in the length of VP1, NSP2, and VP3 is due to deletions in some regions ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The signal peptide in both Segments 1 and 2 was only found in the primate and tick associated JMTVs (Fig. 2 ). In addition, two open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by Segment 4 have different organizations in JMTVs. Notably, two ORFs are overlapping in JMTVs sampled from China, Turkey, French Antilles, Kosovo, and Uganda, but not so in JMTVs sampled from Brazil, Guinea and Trinidad, and Tobago (Figs 2 and 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). All these data suggest that the overlapping/nonoverlapping ORFs encoded by Segment 4 might have been acquired multiple times during JMTV evolution.",

Interestingly, JMTV_RC27, sampled from a red colobus monkey in east Africa (Uganda) (Ladner et al. 2016 ) fell in the basal position, followed by viruses from southwestern China (Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces) and Lao PDR. In addition, this subgroup contained the viruses identified in ticks sampled from Turkey (Dincer et al. 2019) in the tree based on the Segment 3 sequences ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The second subgroup comprised of the viruses sampled from Brazil. Notably, MK673133-MK673136 identified in ticks sampled from West Africa (Guinea) also fell into this subgroup. Probably as only a few of Guinean JMTV sequences was available, its position was variable in the trees based the four segments (Fig. 3) .",

Specifically, TTP-Pool-19 showed a closer evolutionary relationship to the virus from French Antilles rather than to that sampled in the same locality (TTP-Pool-3b), whereas in the tree based on the Segment 1 TTP-Pool-3b was more closely related to the virus from French Antilles. Remarkably, TTP-Pool-3b showed a closer evolutionary relationship with viruses sampled from Kosovo, suggestive of a possible reassortment event.

Notably, all d N /d S ratio estimates were lower than 1, revealing that purifying selection is the dominant evolutionary pressure acting on the viral genome. However, codonspecific analyses provided evidence of positive selection acting on mammalian JMTVs (Table 5) . Interestingly, one aa-position 892 in NSP1 was identified positively selected codons by three methods (FEL, FUBAR, and MEME). Similarly, two positively selected codons in VP1 (positions 11 and 38) were identified by four methods. The functional importance of these mutations should now be assessed experimentally.

            "text": "China (Yu et al. 2020) . Bats (order Chiroptera) that comprise more than 1,240 species exhibit remarkable diversity and represent more than 20 per cent of living mammalian species (Nowak 1994) . Since the discovery of SARS-related CoV in Rhinolophus horseshoe bats in China in 2005 (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005) , they have received increased attention because of their role in the evolution and transmission of a broad range of viruses (Leroy et al. 2005; Drexler et al. 2012; Holmes and Zhang 2015; Nie et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) . Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 is also believed to have an ultimate bat reservoir (Wu et al. 2020; Zhang and Holmes 2020; Zhou et al. 2020) . In this study, we identified JMTV in two species of ticks, six species of bats, three species of rodents, and cattle in Wenzhou (Zhejiang Province), indicating that JMTV is present in both ticks and mammals from the same location. Additionally, JMTV was found in seven species of bats sampled from both Guizhou and Henan Provinces. Because of their global distribution, abundance, ability to fly long distances and often large population densities, bats may play an important role in the transmission of JMTV. In sum, all these data indicate that JMTV is present in a broad range of hosts, comprising both ticks and various species of mammal. Viruses are characterized by both virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission over evolutionary time scales (Li et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2016a) . Despite their ability to jump species boundaries, many viruses show a specific association with their hosts (Guo et al. 2013; Blitvich and Firth 2015) . Here, we identified JMTV in ticks, cattle, bats, and rodents in Wenzhou city (Table 1) , with the detection rates ranging from 6.7 per cent to 49.8 per cent, again showing that JMTV has the capability to transmit among ticks and mammals. Notably, irrespective of their host species, all viruses circulating in Wenzhou were closely related to each other, with >93 per cent (and sometimes 100%) nt sequence identity. Together, this suggests that no observable variation in genome structure is needed for the transmission of JMTV between ticks and mammals.",

Conversely, on a global scale, viruses exhibit strong geographic clustering (Fig. 3) , a pattern supported by the Mantel tests which revealed that the geographic distance among host sampling locations has a greater impact on JMTV diversity than host genetic distance (Table 3) .",

Although it is notable that both groups of JMTV were found in Turkey, on the currently limited sample of data, it is not possible to determine the exact evolutionary and phylogeographic origin of JMTV, and this virus likely has a complex evolutionary history.",

However, some have a limited host range among vertebrates, whereas others can replicate in a wide array of species. Additionally, arthropods are usually infected when they feed on a vertebrate host during viremia, but non-viremic transmission has also been described for tickborne flaviviruses (Simmonds et al. 2011) . Hence, these data indicate that flaviviruses have complex virus-host relationships (Gaunt et al. 2001; Kitchen et al. 2011; Blitvich and Firth 2015) . Since its initial discovery in 2010 (Qin et al. 2014) , JMTVs have been identified in at least fifteen species of ticks and one species of mosquito (Maruyama et al. 2014; Qin et al. 2014; Souza et al. 2018; Dincer et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2019; Sameroff et al. 2019; Temmam et al. 2019 ) as well as in cattle, rodents, and primates (Qin et al. 2014; Ladner et al. 2016; Emmerich et al. 2018; Souza et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2020) . In this study, we identified JMTV in a broad range of bat species. Notably, they do not cluster according to animal species in phylogenetic analysis, and the viruses sampled from mammals and ticks share high sequence identities, with identical sequences sometimes detected in ticks and rodents. Hence, these data are compatible with the vector-borne transmission cycle of JMTVs in nature. ",
