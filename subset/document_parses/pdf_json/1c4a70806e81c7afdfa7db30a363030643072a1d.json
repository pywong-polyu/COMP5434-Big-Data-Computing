The themes and subthemes were then presented to the primary research team once 50% of coding had taken place, proposing a coding tree along with illustrative examples of first-person quotes. Disagreements with the interpretation were resolved by discussion over a number of meetings until consensus was reached. The final theme and subthemes were presented in the results narrative with illustrative first-person quotes to support and evidence the interpretation.

Overwhelmingly, participants felt they lacked information on accessing assistive products and services due to COVID-19 related changes, as one respondent observed, 'It was difficult to think through what the general restrictions meant for my particular services, and often they didn't know either' (SU61, Australia).

(SU18, Kenya) There was restriction in accessing service centres and I had also fear of getting infected (SU53, Bangladesh) My orthotics need to be renewed because I have grew up a little bit (SU50, Benin) Rehabilitation services . . . were stopped hence no services related to assistive devices and services were rendered (SU45, Tanzania) I was not allowed to go to some services, and many couldn't come to me. Physio, OT students and OT, and masseuse weren't allowed to visit (SU65, Australia) Issues of supply and repair: I can't control on my urine and stool, so I have to use urine bag every time but in COVID time we were face many problem in getting it (SU27, India) The lockdown caused hearing aid centers to close and thus, we can't avail the services and maintenance for our hearing aids. We can't even buy batteries (SU57, Philippines) N's hearing aids couldn't be repaired so she refused to wear it sometimes as the family couldn't adjust in a right way (SU67, Vietnam) I used to go center for repair and maintenance and sometimes as follow up once or twice in a month . . . Due to locked down it was closed for certain times until the service provider got safety measures (SU21, Nepal)",

Our study illuminates additional dimensions of experience which have, to date, not been made explicit in disability inclusion literature, related to life stage.
