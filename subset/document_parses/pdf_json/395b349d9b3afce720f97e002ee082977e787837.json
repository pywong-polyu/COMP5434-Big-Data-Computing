Consequently, the alveoli do not communicate with the airways when the pressure is below the airway opening pressure (AOP). This obstruction can be extrinsic (due to lung compression) or intrinsic (due to liquid-filled bronchi and qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in the surfactant) [4] . Airway closure interferes with the assessment of airway pressure at end-expiration (causing errors in driving pressure measurements) and exhaled tidal volume (causing errors in the interpretation of the recruitment to inflation ratio used to assess lung recruitability) [4] . Moreover, repeated opening and closure movements lead to bronchiolar damage (leading to ventilator-induced lung injury) and promote ventilation-perfusion mismatch [5] . Given that airway closure is common in classical (i.e. non-COVID-19-related) ARDS, we decided to assess this phenomenon in COVID-19-related ARDS [6] .",

At the beginning of the insufflation, airway pressure (P aw ) increases rapidly from 0 cmH 2 O to the inflection point (5.4 cmH 2 O, corresponding to the AOP) while only a small part of tidal volume is delivered (13 mL). The very low compliance of this short period (calculate as the change in volume divided by the change in airway pressure) corresponds to the circuit compliance (generally less than 5 mL/cmH 2 O). In this example, the circuit compliance is 13/5.4 = 2.4 mL/cmH 2 O. When airway pressure exceeds the AOP, compliance suddenly increases in relation with alveolar inflation. ",
