            "text": "Since the innovation of our new half-piece elastometric respirator, this type of filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) has been used widely in Thailand. Decontamination methods including ultraviolet C (UVC) germicidal irradiation and 70% alcohol have been implemented to decontaminate these respirators. We then examined the inactivation potential of different decontamination processes on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and numerous bacterial strains, most of which were skin-derived. To enable rigorous integrity of the masks after repeated decontamination processes, fit tests by the Bitrex test, tensile strength and elongation at break were also evaluated. Our results showed that UVC irradiation at a dose of 3 J/cm 2 can eradicate bacteria after 60 min and viruses after 10 min. No fungi were found on the mask surface before decontamination. The good fit test results, tensile strength and elongation at break were still maintained after multiple cycles of decontamination. No evidence of physical degradation was found by gross visual inspection. Alcohol (70%) is also an easy and effective way to eradicate microorganisms on respirators. As the current pandemic is expected to continue for months to years, the need to supply adequate reserves of personnel protective equipment (PPE) and develop effective PPE reprocessing methods is crucial. Our studies demonstrated that the novel silicone mask can be safely reprocessed and decontaminated for many cycles by UVC irradiation, which will help ameliorate the shortage of important protective devices in the COVID-19 pandemic era.",

The current N95 respirator is composed of filter layers of polypropylene fibers that may be destroyed by decontamination processes. Some of these decontamination methods have been found to be unsuitable for FFR disinfection. As stated by the CDC, the use of autoclaving, 160\u02daC dry heat, 70% alcohol and microwave ovens can degrade FFR filters [5] , resulting in failed fit testing and unacceptable levels exceeding the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) standards. The most significant concern with reuse of FFRs is the persistence of infectious material on the external surface of the respirators, leading to disease transmission. However, reprocessing policies are now widely accepted as an alternative decontamination method given that the procedures meet certain standards set by the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of NIOSH.",

            "text": "The CDC has recommended ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), VHP, moist heat and steam as the most promising methods to safely decontaminate FFRs while still preserving the respirator integrity, filtration efficiency and fit capacity [6] . UVGI is a disinfection method that uses short-wavelength ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation to destroy microorganisms, primarily by cross-linking thymidine nucleotides in DNA and uracil nucleotides in RNA, which alters the DNA/RNA structure and interferes with replication [7] . There are three classifications of ultraviolet light according to wavelength: UVA (320-400 nm), UVB (280-320 nm), and UVC (200-280 nm). Application of UVC is an effective method to decontaminate N95 respirators and is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration, with good activity against H 1 N 1 , MS 2 and Bacillus subtilis [4] [5] [6] . No significant changes in respiratory material strength or particle filtration efficiency were found when using UVC for decontamination purposes. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide requires gas chambers and ventilation hoods for aeration to keep hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure below 1 ppm prior to use [2] . The limitation of this decontamination method is the risk of toxic chemical residues persisting after treatment. Although treatments with moist heat and steam are highly attractive methods to inactivate viruses on FFR surfaces and have demonstrated minimal loss-of-fit performance after three cycles of application to FFRs, some moist heat is not capable of eradicating highly thermostable pathogens [8] and can result in damage to the FFR component [9, 10] . Steam disinfection includes the use of steam from boiling water and steam sterilizer autoclaves or microwaves. These techniques are limited by their inconsistent generation of steam and potential for sparking [5] . Taking this information into consideration, we chose to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination by UVC and 70% alcohol in our study.",

Reductions in bacteria were consistently lower than those in viruses in every area of the masks and filters. A longer UVC decontamination time for as long as 60 min was required to decontaminate most of the bacteria on the mask surfaces. In contrast, 70% alcohol applied on the masks, strap and filters for 10 minutes effectively inactivated the virus and bacteria. No fungi were found at the baseline in the samples. Cadnum et al. [17] found that UVC effectively decontaminated N95 respirators contaminated with Phi6 and MS 2 bacteriophages [18] reported a meta-analysis of the impact of UVC irradiation on mask efficacy and safety. They found that N95 FFR performance is maintained following a single cycle of UVC irradiation. However, at least one study showed a high fit failure rate after reuse of N95 masks [19] . A study by Ozog et al. [20] showed marked differences in the effects of UVGI on fit testing among various N95 FFR models. While one model was unaffected by a total applied UVC dose of 60 J/cm 2 , another model failed fit testing after a single 3 J/cm 2 dose [21] . Therefore, the findings from one model cannot be extrapolated to others. Lindsley et al. [1] reported the cumulative effect of an extremely high dose of UVC (120 J/cm 2 ) on N95 mask bursting strength to be 11-42%, but this treatment had minor effects on filtration efficiency. We therefore studied the physical degradation and tensile strength of the strap, including fit tests after UVC and 70% alcohol treatment. The tensile strength and elongation at break of our straps were well maintained after these decontamination methods. Dry heat and UVC irradiation did not cause degradation of our silicone masks even after 60 cycles of treatment.",

We used UVC doses of 300 \u03bcWatt-sec/cm 2 or 3 J/cm 2 , and the exposure falls off by 1/r 2 from the point source, where r is the distance from the source. The findings in this study are applicable only to the silicone mask and decontamination treatments investigated. Other FFRs may be more easily degraded in terms of physical damage, fitting characteristics and comfort characteristics.

The time to eradicate bacteria was 60 minutes longer due to the tolerance of the bacteria to UVC irradiation. Moreover, 70% alcohol effectively decontaminated the virus and bacteria deposited on the masks and filters. A good level of fit of the masks can be maintained following UVC treatment. The tensile strength of the strap was retained over multiple decontamination cycles using UVC and dry heat for up to 60 cycles of treatment. Given the efficacy of disinfection by UVC and 70% alcohol, these types of decontamination methods could potentially be used for the new type of silicone mask half-piece respirator in the setting of a crisis with inadequate supplies of PPE.
