            "text": "The past decade has seen a rapid increase in social media usage, which has stirred debate on its potential benefits and drawbacks (Panahi et al., 2016; Weinstein, 2018) . According to some research, social media platforms offer multiple benefits: they satisfy the basic human need for belonging, increase life satisfaction, and reduce loneliness (Zhan et al., 2016; McLaughlin and Sillence, 2018) . On the other hand, excessive use of social media has been linked to serious mental health issues such as depression and anxiety Reer et al., 2019; Van der Velden et al., 2019) . This debate on social media as a double-edged sword, is ongoing (Panahi et al., 2016) . However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the negative side of social media by indicating that excessive use is spreading panic, fear, and misinformation regarding COVID-19 among mass populations (Pennycook et al., 2020) . In this study, problematic social media usage is defined as; an excessive use of social media regularly, to the extent that it seems difficult to stay away from it (Andreassen et al., 2012) . A spike in social media use has been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic as more people rely on it to get the latest COVID-19 related updates (Pennycook et al., 2020) . This increase in social media use has enhanced the spread of the so-called COVID-19 \"infodemic\" (Pulido et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 infodemic is defined as an excess of information on COVID-19, some accurate and some fake which makes it difficult for people to find credible sources for guidance and updates (Pulido et al., 2020) .",

Similarly, another study showed that the social media infodemic was related to panic episodes among social media users (Islam et al., 2020) . Fear of COVID-19 can be defined as an unpleasant emotion in which people tend to feel worried that they might get infected by COVID-19 (Ahorsu et al., 2020) . As a result of the spread of fear, misinformation, and mental health issues due to problematic social media use, the World Health Organization has also advised people to spend less time on social media sites (Sohrabi et al., 2020) . In summary, COVID-19 has created new challenges for the world, making it more important than ever to conduct cyberpsychology Guitton, 2020) .",

Depression is defined as a common mental health issue in which the individual feels fatigued as well as sad and loses interest in everything (Kroenke et al., 2001) . A recent study monitored posts shared on social media, reporting that social media is overloaded with terrifying information related to COVID-19, such as details of patients who have either lost their lives due to COVID-19 or are currently fighting the disease (Hua and Shaw, 2020) . Some users make the situation worse by sharing misleading information on social media (Pennycook et al., 2020) . This bombardment of fear-inducing, deceptive information may depress people by spreading waves of fear (Mertens et al., 2020) . Some researchers have also warned that fear of COVID-19 is associated with longterm negative outcomes, which might be an additional issue over and above the disease itself (Ren et al., 2020) . Hence, it is essential to investigate the antecedents and consequences of fear of COVID-19 (Mertens et al., 2020) .",

Multiple studies have highlighted a rapid increase in mental health issues since the pandemic hit; however, the extant literature is silent on the predictors of these issues, which warrants immediate inquiry (Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020) . Some studies have suggested that problematic social media use and fear of COVID-19 are important factors linked to depression (Pennycook et al., 2020) . However, there is still insufficient empirical evidence to support this claim. Thus, based on gaps in the existing literature and the call for research on the negative outcomes of excessive social media use during COVID-19, the current study proposes that problematic social media use during COVID-19 may be related to fear of COVID-19, which is further linked to depression among employees.",

            "text": "Although a wealth of literature on the adverse psychological outcomes of COVID-19 has been generated within a short time (Lauer et al., 2020) , there is a scarcity of research on potential psychological buffers for these outcomes (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . It is time to shift focus from problems to solutions, which the world is looking to the research community to deliver (Zhang and Liu, 2020) . In this regard, some researchers have recommended meditation practices to reduce mental health issues during the pandemic (Behan, 2020) . Similarly, trait mindfulness has also received attention lately due to its extraordinary mental health benefits (H\u00fclsheger et al., 2013) . Mindfulness is defined as an extreme form of self-awareness and situation awareness alongside non-judgmental processing of events (Bishop et al., 2004) . Existing research has already established the role of mindfulness in reducing the negative effect of stressors (Ireland et al., 2017; Burnett-Zeigler et al., 2018; Sagui-Henson et al., 2018; Montani et al., 2019) . However, the role of mindfulness needs to be further explored in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic (Behan, 2020) . Researchers have begun to realize that mindfulness might act as a useful personal resource during a pandemic like COVID-19, which people might use to minimize the fear and negativity associated with COVID-19 (Behan, 2020; Hedderman et al., 2020) . Mindfulness refers to a phenomenon in which an individual deliberately engages in non-judgmental processing with respect to present events (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Creswell, 2017) . Mindfulness allows people to analyze all the available information in a non-judgmental way and promotes a high sense of self-awareness, which might help them in coping with depression and anxiety (Behan, 2020) . People high in trait mindfulness might experience less fear related to COVID-19 than others despite using social media (Hedderman et al., 2020) . Hence, the current study proposes that mindfulness weakens the link between problematic social media use and fear of COVID-19, and ultimately with depression. Figure 1 contains the proposed theoretical framework.",

            "text": "Building upon the conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989) , we believe that excessive social media usage during the current pandemic might act as a stressor and thus be linked to adverse outcomes among employees. Excessive exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 on social media threatens employees' physical resources such as health and life due to the risk of getting the infection, psychological resources such as psychological health by increasing depression and anxiety, social resources such as interpersonal relationships due to social distancing, and financial resources due to the risk of losing one's job during COVID-19 (Shacham et al., 2020) . This threat of resource loss may be associated with stress among employees by developing a fear of catching the infection (Hobfoll et al., 2018; Behan, 2020) . According to COR theory, resource loss is more salient than resource gain, and it increases in magnitude and gains momentum over time. Fear induced by stressors might further deplete employees' resources, resulting in depression (Hobfoll et al., 2018; Majeed and Fatima, 2020; Shacham et al., 2020; van der Velden et al., 2020) . Depression represents the most advanced stage of the resource loss cycle, which develops gradually over time and exhausts one's energy resources (Hobfoll et al., 2018) . However, personal resources such as mindfulness may help employees to overcome fear by enhancing self-awarene8ss and helping them in interpreting situations in a non-judgmental way, which can minimize resource loss resulting from the stressor of problematic social media use during COVID-19. Drawing on the COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989; Hobfoll et al., 2018) , mindfulness might be considered a personal resource that enables individuals to manage external stressors more effectively (Montani et al., 2019) . Furthermore, mindfulness may also help people in gaining further psychological and emotional resources.",

The extant literature suggests that problematic social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with fear (Cinelli et al., 2020; Lum and Tambyah, 2020) . This fear develops due to the spread of horrifying information related to COVID-19 (Cinelli et al., 2020; Lum and Tambyah, 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020) . To combat a rapid increase in mental health problems, researchers have highlighted the importance of meditation and other mental strengthening activities to keep fear of COVID-19 away (Yanyu et al., 2020) . Mindfulness is considered an important personal ability that may help people to avoid experiencing negative emotions (Conversano et al., 2020) . An abundance of studies have highlighted the benefits of mindfulness (Donald et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Pang and Ruch, 2019) . For instance, a metaanalysis found that mindfulness is negatively related to negative emotions and positively associated with mental health among cancer survivors, as it enables them to suspend judgment and accept their current circumstances (Huang et al., 2016; Behan, 2020; Hedderman et al., 2020; Pecore, 2020) . Recent studies have also shown that mindfulness interventions help employees to cope with negative emotions during the pandemic (Behan, 2020; Hedderman et al., 2020; Pecore, 2020) . However, little is known about the benefits of trait mindfulness in minimizing negative emotions related to COVID-19 (Conversano et al., 2020) . Hence, the current study investigates the role of trait mindfulness in reducing fear of COVID-19 due to problematic social media use. From a COR perspective (Hobfoll, 1989; Hobfoll et al., 2018) , trait mindfulness acts as a useful resource that might prevent the depletion of resources due to stressors. Thus, it is proposed that highly mindful employees may experience less fear of COVID-19 due to problematic social media use. Hence, the current study proposes:",

Although no monetary benefit was given to the participants, they were promised that the survey results would be shared with them upon request. The survey was open enrollment; anyone with the survey URL could participate. We used Google Forms to implement the survey. The authors emailed the informed consent form to potential respondents. The informed consent form contained the study's purpose and participation criterion along with the URL for Time 1. Email recipients were invited to participate in the study if they met the inclusion criterion. The researchers emailed the URL for Time 2 after a gap of 7 days to all employees who had responded at Time 1. The researchers emailed the URL for Time 3 to employees who had responded at Times 1 and 2. Respondents were able to review their responses before submitting the questionnaire. In accordance with the instructions provided in the CHEERIES checklist for conducting e-surveys, only one response was allowed per email address. This restriction was applied to avoid receiving more than one response from the same respondent.

The confidentiality of the data was fully maintained. The data file was saved in a password-protected folder to which only researchers had access. We assigned a unique I.D. to each respondent and used it to match responses during all three time lags to ensure the anonymity of respondents. We ensured that their responses would be kept confidential and would only be used for the purposes of the study. Three hundred and fortyseven respondents completed the first wave of the study. At Time 2, the 347 employees were contacted again to provide data about their fear of COVID-19, and 312 respondents provided data at Time 2. Finally, these 312 respondents were asked to fill in the questionnaire about depression at Time 3, and 267 responded. These 267 responses were included in the final analysis of the hypothesized model. Thus, the final response rate was 66.7%. The final sample size for all three waves of data collection contained no missing values. G * Power (version 3.1.9.4) designed by Faul et al. (2009) was employed to assess the sample's adequacy. The G * Power version 3.1.9.4 has a default value of 0.02 for small effect size, 0.15 for medium effect size, and 0.35 for large effect size, in effect size conventions. For calculating sample size, we selected the F test from the test family and selected a statistical test named \"Linear multiple regression: Fixed model R2 deviation from zero\" from the drop-down menu as recommended by Faul et al. (2009) . The number of predictors was set to 3. The default parameters were used (i.e., the medium effect size of 0.15, \u03b1 level = 0.05, high power of 0.95, number of predictors set to 3) as recommended by Faul et al. (2009) . The results revealed an a priori sample size of 117 respondents, which is lower than this study's actual sample size. Subsequently, a post hoc power analysis was computed with the same parameters to calculate the power of the collected data (N = 267). The power value was 0.99, which is greater than the recommended cutoff value of 0.80 (Cohen, 1992) . Based on these a priori and post hoc analyses, our sample size of 267 is appropriate for testing the proposed model. The current study is time-lagged, which has the drawback of a lower response rate, as this design requires researchers to approach respondents more than once and most respondents fail to respond at all time lags. Several other time-lagged studies have also shown a very low response rate. For instance, a study in which data was collected in two waves showed a response rate of 49%, only as 162 out of 320 respondents filled in the survey at both time lags (For reference, see Fallman et al., 2019) . In a similar time-lagged study conducted with nurses, the response rate dropped from 80% at Time 1 to 43% at Time 2 (Laschinger and Finegan, 2008) . The relatively low response rate in the present study is also consistent with the response rate in previous time-lagged studies on COVID-19 in Pakistan (Irshad et al., 2020) .",

The final scale used in this study was a unidimensional scale. Each question was answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very rarely (1) to very often (5). The wording of the items was modified to capture social media use during COVID-19. For example: \"During COVID-19, how often did you feel an urge to use social media more and more?\". The scale's Cronbach's alpha was found to be satisfactory, at 0.83.

We confirmed that the data fulfilled all regression assumptions, including linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, and autocorrelation, before testing the proposed hypotheses. The data was found to be linear, and the error terms were homogenous. Likewise, multicollinearity is not an issue that affects our data because all correlations were well below the cutoff value of 0.70. Additionally, the variance inflation factors (VIF) for all variables were well below the cutoff value of 10 (Myers and Myers, 1990) , and all tolerance values lay above the threshold value of 0.2 (Menard, 1995) . We also conducted a Durbin-Watson test to confirm that there were no issues regarding autocorrelation. The rule of thumb is that a value of less than 3 but greater than 1 indicates no problems concerning independence of error (Field, 2009, p. 221) . In our data, the Durbin-Watson test value is 2.24, which is within the acceptable range. The skewness and kurtosis values for all variables ranged between \u22121 and +1, the cutoff criteria (Blanca et al., 2013) . The skewness values were \u22120.58 for problematic social media use, \u22120.69 for fear of COVID-19, \u22120.22 for depression, and \u22120.35 for mindfulness. The kurtosis values were \u22120.21 for problematic social media use, 0.01 for fear of COVID-19, \u22120.64 for depression, and \u22120.90 for mindfulness. The analysis for regression assumptions, means, standard deviations, analysis of variance, correlations, reliability coefficients, and demographic frequency distributions were all conducted using SPSS. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using AMOS. We used the maximum likelihood method (ML) for estimating parameters in the CFA model.

            "text": "In line with Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) recommendation, several CFA tests were also performed to analyze whether the responses matched the hypothesized four-factor model. The results of the CFA are provided in Table 3 . For this purpose, five different three-factor models were analyzed by loading the items for two variables onto a single factor. Then, two-factor models were analyzed by loading all the items onto two factors. Finally, the one-factor model was tested by loading all the items onto a single factor. Comparing the results of these three, two, and one-factor models to the four-factor model, the four-factor model yielded better fit indexes, \u03c72 = 1064, df = 623, \u03c72/df = 1.70, p < 05, CFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.90, IFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.05, all of which are in the acceptable range of model fitness criteria (Hair et al., 2014) . The standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) value for the four-factor model is 0.05, which is lower than the cutoff value of.08, thus indicating a good fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999) . RMSEA for the four-factor model is.05. Its lower 90% confidence interval (CI) is 0.04 and upper 90% confidence interval (CI) is 0.05, whereas P = 0.30. The p-value for the close-fitting model is insignificant (p > 0.05). The four-factor model yielded better model fit indices compared to the one-factor model. Different alternative models were also tested to check whether the respondents were able to distinguish the different variables from one another. The alternative models showed poorer model fit indices than the hypothesized four-factor model, confirming discriminant validity. Table 4 provides the results for descriptive statistics, average variance extracted (AVE), maximum shared variance (MSV), composite reliabilities (CR), and correlations among the variables of this study. Before computing the correlations, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to check the variance in depression and fear of COVID-19 due to demographic variables, i.e., gender, age, education, and experience. ANOVA results for all the demographic variables were found to be non-significant; thus, the demographics relating to respondents were excluded from all further analyses, except the correlation analysis. The problematic use of social media by employees during COVID-19 is significantly correlated with fear of COVID-19 (r = 0.38, p < 0.01) and depression (r = 0.41, p < 0.01). Fear of COVID-19 also has a significant positive correlation with employee depression (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). The mindfulness of employees was found to be significantly negatively correlated with problematic social media use during COVID-19 (r = \u22120.22, p < 0.01), fear of COVID-19 (r = \u22120.27, p < 0.01), and depression (r = \u22120.12, p < 0.05). AVE scores for all variables were greater than 0.50 and lower than the CR, hence establishing convergent validity. Moreover, the AVE scores for all study variables were greater than the MSV scores, thus establishing discriminant validity. Table 5 provides the results for the direct, mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation hypotheses. Hayes (2017) Model 7 of the PROCESS macro was employed to test the hypothesized model. In line with Hypothesis 1, employees' problematic social media use during COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression (\u03b2 = 0.26, p < 0.01); thus, the H1 of the study was accepted. Furthermore, problematic social media use during COVID-19 was significantly associated with fear of COVID-19 (\u03b2 = 0.37, p < 0.01), and fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression (\u03b2 = 0.34, p < 0.01). The results for the indirect effects confirm the significant mediating role of fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between problematic social media use during COVID-19 and depression (indirect effect = 0.12, 95% CI with LL = 0.07 and UL = 0.20). The lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval both contain non-zero values. Hence, H2 is also accepted. Before testing Hypothesis 3, on problematic social media use during COVID-19 and mindfulness were mean-centered by employing Model 7 of Hayes (2017) Process macro, thus following Aiken et al. (1991) recommendation for testing moderations. The interaction effect of mindfulness and problematic social media use during COVID-19 on fear of COVID-19 was found to be negative and significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.15, p < 0.01). The moderation graph in Figure 2 shows that mindfulness weakens the relationship between problematic social media use during COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19. Hence, H3 is also supported. Table 5 also presents results for the conditional indirect effect of employees' problematic social media use during COVID-19 on depression via fear of COVID-19 at high and low values (\u00b11 SD from mean) of mindfulness. The indirect effect of problematic social media use during COVID-19 on depression through fear of COVID-19 weakened at a high level of mindfulness (+1 SD from the mean; \u03b2 = 0.07, LL 95% CI = 0.02, U.L. 95% CI = 0.16), but grew stronger at a low level of mindfulness (\u22121 SD from the mean; \u03b2 = 0.17, LL 95% CI = 0.10, UL 95% CI = 0.25). Additionally, the negative and significant moderated mediation index (Index = \u22120.05, LL95% CI = \u22120.11, UL95% CI = \u22120.02) indicates that mindfulness significantly moderates the indirect effect of problematic social media use during COVID-19 on employee depression via fear of COVID-19. Hence, H4 of the study was also strongly supported by the results. Table 6 contains a summary of the results for all proposed hypotheses. ",

The current study aimed to extend research on the negative mental health issues related to COVID-19 by testing a moderated mediation model of problematic social media use and its outcomes. The first objective of the study was to test the association between problematic social media use during COVID-19 and depression among employees. The results supported the first hypothesis by showing that problematic social media use during COVID-19 is strongly associated with an increase in depression among employees (Lum and Tambyah, 2020; Ren et al., 2020) . The study's second aim was to investigate the mediating role of fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between excessive social media use and depression. The results supported our hypothesis that excessive use of social media during COVID-19 is related to fear of COVID-19 among employees, and that fear of COVID-19 is associated with depression. Existing studies also support these results (Li et al., 2020) . For instance, several studies found that social media use led to terror and panic during the COVID-19 outbreak . Prior studies have also found an association between social media use and mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression Jasso-Medrano and Lopez-Rosales, 2018; Van der Velden et al., 2019) . Similarly, fear of COVID-19 has been linked to severe mental health issues (Ren et al., 2020 ). This study further tested the moderating role of mindfulness on the relationship between problematic social media use and fear of COVID-19, and the conditional indirect effect of problematic social media use on employee depression via fear of COVID-19 when mindfulness is high vs. low. The data supported the moderation and moderated mediation hypotheses. This shows that employees with a higher level of mindfulness experience less fear of COVID-19 despite excessive social media use. Hence, they also report experiencing a lower level of depression than employees with a lower level of mindfulness. A few existing studies have come to similar results (Hong et al., 2020) . For instance, studies have shown that mindfulness decreases negative emotions experienced during COVID-19 (Conversano et al., 2020) . Similarly, there are an abundance of studies on the benefits of mindfulness for mental health (Donald et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Pang and Ruch, 2019) .",

This study investigated the negative outcomes associated with problematic social media use in the context of a life-threatening pandemic. The study also introduced mindfulness as an important trait to help in dealing with external stressors. This study suggests that employees should refrain from excessive social media use due to its association with negative health outcomes. The study results support the conservation of resources theory in the context of the pandemic by supporting the notion that stressors like excessive and problematic social media use act as a threat to employee resources and are therefore associated with negative outcomes like fear. These negative outcomes then gain momentum and magnitude, and could ultimately take the form of more intense and negative outcomes such as depression. However, personal resources like mindfulness may help employees and protect valuable resources after exposure to such stressors and assist in further resource gains.",

The use of social media has risen since the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, and this study showed that problematic social media use during COVID-19 is linked to negative emotional and mental health outcomes. Thus, this study responds to the call for research on the antecedents and consequences of fear of COVID-19. It further contributes to ongoing scholarly discussion that the fear associated with COVID-19 is linked to mental health issues by studying excessive social media use during COVID-19. Additionally, this study identifies trait mindfulness as a useful personal resource by demonstrating that it may help employees to control their fear of COVID-19. Another contribution of this study is that it shines a spotlight on factors linked to depression among employees during the current pandemic. This needs to be addressed quickly, as mental health issues might impede progress and can adversely affect the overall operations of an organization.",

Managers could recruit a mental health professional to offer free-of-cost consultations to employees. These consultations may also be provided online, as it is still not safe to meet in person due to the high risk of infection. This could help in resolving employees' mental health issues. Managers could also increase employees' awareness about COVID-19, particularly its symptoms and preventive measures so that they are not misled by the misinformation available on social media. One way of doing this is to share research and reports from credible resources on employee email or WhatsApp groups, as accurate information can bust many of the myths linked to COVID-19 and reduce employees' fear of getting COVID-19. Managers could also conduct regular mindfulness training sessions for their employees, as mindfulness is linked to not only reduced fear of COVID-19 but also lower symptoms of depression and various other mental health issues. Mindfulness training experts could be hired to provide online sessions to employees in their homes.",

Future studies may collect data on the use of specific platforms and their comparative impact on the mental health of users, as each platform has a different user base. This study did not investigate differences in fear of COVID-19 between employees working from home and the office during the lockdown. Multiple organizations required their employees to continue working from the office, including banks and telecom firms. It would be worth studying the difference in fear of catching infection among employees working from home and working from the office in future studies. As another limitation, the scale used to measure problematic social media use did not include the option \"Never,\" even though some participants might have never \"felt an urge to use social media more and more.\" Thus, future studies should use a scale containing the \"Never\" option.",

First, respondents' social media use, fear of COVID-19, and depression may vary across different time lags. Future studies may wish to collect data for all the variables at all three time lags to compare variations in social media and depression at different time points. Furthermore, this study only highlighted one mental health outcome linked to problematic social media use and fear of COVID-19, namely depression. Future studies might also test for the association between problematic social media use and other psychological health outcomes, such as anxiety, hypertension, and negative emotions, etc. It would also be fruitful to study the link between mental well-being and problematic social media use during COVID-19. This study identified only one dispositional resource, namely mindfulness, which weakens the negative association between problematic social media use during COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19. Future studies might also introduce other personal and situational resources linked to reduced negativity during COVID-19. For instance, it would be useful to test the moderating role of psychological capital, self-efficacy, and family support.

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale for measuring depression severity makes it possible to calculate the prevalence of minimal to severe depression. The cut-off values for minimal to severe depression for the 5-point Likert scale we used might differ slightly from the original measure.
