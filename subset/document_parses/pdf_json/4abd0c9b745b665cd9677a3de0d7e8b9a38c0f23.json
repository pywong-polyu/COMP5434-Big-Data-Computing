Subsequently, various federal and provincial public safety measures were enacted in order to limit the spread of the COVID-19. Canadians were asked to practise physical distancing (i.e. remain at least 2 m (6 feet) away from others), to self-isolate and only leave their homes for essential errands and to quarantine if they had been exposed to the virus or returned from international travel (Government of Canada, 2020; Ontario Government, 2020) . Other measures included the closure of non-essential businesses (e.g. gyms/recreation centres and non-grocery stores), as well as the closure of public spaces (e.g. parks and hiking trails; Ontario . With over 9,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada by the end of March 2020 and over 90,000 cases by the start of June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial lifestyle changes for many Canadians, especially in regard to stress and mental health (Statistics Canada, 2020c) , physical activity (Ontario and screen-related sedentary behaviour (Statistics Canada, 2020b) .",

Moreover, nearly all participants (88%) reported at least one symptom of anxiety (e.g. depression, grief, panic) in the two weeks prior to completing the survey (Stats Canada, 2020a). One means of combatting poor mental health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, could be through physical activity (Kar et al., 2020; Kecmanovic, 2020; Statistics Canada, 2020c ). Yet, lack of access to public spaces such as parks and hiking trails, as well as temporary closures of gyms/recreation centres, has had inevitable implications for physical activity. Despite the known benefits of physical activity for both physical and mental health, <1 in 5 Canadian adults met the current guidelines of 150 min per week of moderate-to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 2020; Statistics Canada, 2019) prior to COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the potential for even lower physical activity adherence rates (and its associated mental and physical health implications) as a result of a significant and substantial increase in barriers to physical activity during the pandemic is a probable reality (Chen et al., 2020) . For example, a recent study by Rhodes et al. (2020) reported a significant decrease in self-reported perceived moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as a result of pandemic-related restrictions among a sample of just over one thousand Canadian adults. Moreover, using objectively measured physical activity data collected through a national physical activity promotion application, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity dropped significantly as a result of the onset of the pandemic, yet seemed to rebound 6 weeks later (Di Sebastiano et al., 2020) . Lastly, the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series March/April (Statistics Canada, 2020b), which collected data from 29 March to 3 April 2020, reported that 63% and 68% of Canadians were spending more time on the Internet and watching TV, respectively, compared with before the pandemic.",

The social media advertisement was originally shared by the researchers on their personal pages, and they encouraged friends/followers, community organisations and the university to repost and share the advertisement as well. Upon contact, an information letter, a survey link and fillable calendar of the month of March were emailed to prospective participants. If after two days the survey had not been completed and/or the calendar not returned, a reminder email went out to the participants. In total, 167 potential participants emailed the research team.

My classes at the fitness centre have discontinued so now I am exercising at home more. I am trying to get my husband out walking more.

Also, as many Canadians are working the frontlines, adapting to new ways of working, and/or having other significant changes in their day to day life, the COVID-19 pandemic has inherently introduced new stressors to the lives of Canadians (Jones, 2020) . Overall, the findings of this study support those of Statistics Canada (2020a, 2020c), as participants reported significantly higher daily and work stress as a result of COVID-19. In addition, when grouping participants based on their self-reported ratings of physical activity (i.e. decrease, maintain and increase), there were no differences between groups in regard to the change in daily stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, compared with participants who self-reported their physical activity to have maintained or increased within the first month of the pandemic, those who self-reported a decrease in their physical activity had a significantly greater change (increase) in their work stress. Despite significant increases in both daily and work stress across participants, it appears as though greater work-related increases in stress (e.g. working the frontline, change of work environment, working remotely, financial worries) had more significant impacts on participants' abilities to maintain their pre-COVID-19 levels of physical activity as a result of the pandemic. These findings align with research by Stults-Kolehmainen and Sinha (2014) and Weinstein et al. (2017) who suggested that higher stress (in this case work stress) is associated with decreases in physical activity. However, this study provides additional insight that it is particularly work stress at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic that interfered with participants' abilities to maintain their physical activity.",

Specifically, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, participants in the current study, most of whom are women, were accumulating more steps per day (i.e. just over 9,500 steps/day) compared | 11 bs_bs_banner PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND with Canadian women (i.e. 8,400 steps/day) in Colley et al.'s (2011) nationally representative study. However, as a result of the pandemic, average step count in the current study dropped to just under 8,500 steps/day, much closer to the national average previously determined by Colley et al. (2011) . In addition, the current findings support those of P\u00e9pin et al. (2020) who examined physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple countries (including Canada) and reported a decrease in step count relative to the severity of isolation and quarantine orders throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when participants in the current study were asked to subjectively report the number of physical activity minutes they accrued pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic, no statistical differences were reported. Although such contradictory results could be partially related to recall bias and participants inaccurately reporting their physical activity behaviour from the previous month, it appears as though the discrepancy may also be reflective of participants' reduction in incidental physical activity and non-purposeful activity (e.g. chores, basic hygiene, walking to walk; Tremblay et al., 2007) caused by the public safety measures and restrictions put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 among Canadians. For example, although there was no evidence of statistical differences in the number of self-reported physical activity minutes pre-and post-COVID-19 pandemic, many participants did note that working from home, leaving the home only for essential errands and/or having no access to recreation centres/public places decreased the amount of low-intensity or incidental physical activity they typically accrued throughout the day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As incidental physical activity contributes more to total energy expenditure in some people than dedicated periods of physical activity (McGuire & Ross, 2011; Tremblay et al., 2007) , the results of the current study highlight the potential damaging and adverse effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the physical health of Canadians, even if they have maintained pre-COVID-19 pandemic intentional physical activity levels.",

These findings are consistent with results from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (March/April) released by Statistics Canada (2020b), which evaluated levels of screen-related sedentary behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. As screen-related sedentary behaviour is associated with adverse health outcomes (Tremblay et al., 2010; Warren et al., 2010) , public awareness surrounding the risks associated with sedentary behaviour, especially during the current pandemic, is warranted. The current findings stress the importance and necessity of public health interventions to address screen-related sedentary behaviour during a global pandemic. Public health interventions are especially important when, as in the current pandemic, it is uncertain how long stay at home orders and closures will last and, as a consequence, how long the increase in screen-related sedentary behaviour will persist.",

For participants who reported a decrease in physical activity, access to equipment was the most cited reason/barrier. This finding emphasizes the important role of gyms and fitness trainers continuing to offer their services during the pandemic and identifies a key opportunity for those individuals working in the health and fitness industry. Moreover, some participants who identified access/equipment as a reason/barrier to the increase in their levels of physical activity noted that they were able to purchase additional equipment to allow them to continue to exercise from home or were able to continue paying for a gym membership that switched to providing online workouts that could be performed with limited equipment. It should be noted that most participants in the current study were most likely of moderate-to higher socioeconomic status (i.e. 72% of participants had a university certificate, diploma or degree at the bachelor level or above, and all had already purchased wearable activity trackers), which may have provided them means to purchase new gym equipment or access paid-for online fitness classes, affording them the opportunity to continue their fitness regimen at home (Pampel et al., 2010) . The ability to continue a gym membership virtually or to purchase new gym equipment is not available for many Canadians and highlights the potential financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic even further. Time was the second most cited reason/barrier to changes in physical activity and mainly acted as a facilitator for participants who reported increasing their physical activity behaviour. For example, many participants reported that working from home allowed them more flexibility and opportunity to exercise. This finding is unsurprising as lack of time is often noted as a barrier to physical activity (Godin et al., 1994; Hoare et al., 2017) .",

First, the study had a small sample size (N = 121) with the majority of participants being educated, younger adult women living in Ontario, which could be attributed to the nature of data collection of using wearable activity trackers. As such, the results are not generalizable to the Canadian population, but could provide some evidence for how the pandemic is affecting educated, younger adult women living in Ontario.",

Along those lines, not all participants wore the same brand/type of activity tracker, so it is possible that comparisons between people may not be entirely accurate. Yet, there is evidence supporting validity and inter-device reliability of step counts between different types of wearable activity tracker devices (Evenson et al., 2015) . Third, research by Friel and Garber (2020) suggested that individuals wearing activity trackers report greater levels of physical activity compared with those no longer wearing an activity tracker. Therefore, it is likely that our sample population engaged in more physical activity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than the general population and our findings may not translate to those who do not regularly wear an activity tracker.",

Lastly, these findings were contextualized with reasons/barriers to changes in physical activity. Overall, such findings emphasized the importance of promoting and facilitating physical activity and limiting screen-related sedentary behaviour during a pandemic. However, more research is needed to examine the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, physical activity (especially using objective measures) and sedentary behaviours, especially as restrictions are lifted and/or Canadians adapt to the pandemic in the long term.",
