            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an abrupt change in university teacher education, in that most face-to-face courses were replaced by online education, which had a profound impact on students. Pandemic distance learning required students to possess a high degree of self-regulation concerning their learning environment and to find new ways of communicating with their peers and instructors. At the same time, the novel situation offered opportunities to experience new educational applications. To learn more about the possible benefits of distance learning, this study examines how the first online semester during the pandemic contributed to pre-service teachers' intentions to use digital learning materials in the future. Pre-service teachers enrolled in a German university (n = 348) answered an online questionnaire at the end of the summer term of 2020. Findings from structural equation modeling showed that the perceived quality of teacher training during the online semester and self-reported improvements in digital skills predicted significantly students' intentions to use digital learning materials for future teaching. Moreover, results revealed that attentional regulation predicted perceived quality of teacher training and self-reported improvements in digital skills during distance learning. Thus, attentional regulation had a significant indirect effect on pre-service teachers' behavioral intentions. The indirect effects of other resource management strategies (effort and time management) and intrinsic motivation were not significant. Our results show that the quality of online instruction was an important factor in student teachers' learning processes during the pandemic. Based on our results, we discuss implications for the promotion of pre-service teachers' intentions to use digital learning materials for teaching in schools.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that instruction that is delivered entirely online is as effective as face-to-face instruction (Means et al., 2013) . Although universities in many countries have developed teacher training programs for online instruction, digital learning environments are yet to be fully integrated into curricula. For example, a recent survey of higher education in Germany found that just 1.7% of universities rated the digitalization of teaching and learning in their institution as \"well-advanced\" (Gilch et al., 2019) . Moreover, before COVID-19, the amount of teaching which could be conducted online was restricted by law at most German universities (Faller, 2015) . Thus, when lockdown began, many initial teacher education programs were not fully prepared for online instruction by the start of the summer 2020 term (Zawacki-Richter, 2020) . In contrast to planned and well-designed online learning environments, emergency remote teaching during COVID-19 has been characterized by a fast, temporary shift of instruction to an alternate delivery mode (Hodges et al., 2020) . This mode was viewed as a specific form of online instruction in which neither teacher educators nor student teachers participated voluntarily (Hodges et al., 2020; Naujoks et al., 2021) .",

The nature of this new digital learning environment has obstructed the learning process in various ways and thus has affected students' learning experiences. For students, the lack of in-class settings and fewer direct interactions may have required greater self-regulation and self-motivation, with reduced levels of support (Littlejohn et al., 2016; Naujoks et al., 2021) . Pre-service teachers were required to plan, monitor, and control their learning processes more autonomously in order to follow self-study materials, organize participation in asynchronous and synchronous events, and communicate with peers and lecturers (Naujoks et al., 2021) . Thus, the use of adequate self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies can be considered essential to the academic success of such students (Zimmerman, 2002; Naujoks et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Self-regulated learning has three key categories of learning strategies: cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management (Dresel et al., 2015; Panadero, 2017) . Cognitive and metacognitive strategies are important for information processing and monitoring and verifying one's learning outcomes. Resource management is divided into external strategies (e.g., seeking help) or internal strategies, such as regulation of effort and attention, time management, and motivation (Dresel et al., 2015) . SRL is crucial in learning environments that provide low levels of support and guidance (Wong et al., 2019) and in distance learning in particular (Zawacki-Richter, 2020; Naujoks et al., 2021) . Prior studies have demonstrated that SRL strategies are positively correlated with academic success in online learning environments that afford high levels of learner autonomy (Broadbent and Poon, 2015; Broadbent, 2017) . Specifically, internal resource-management strategies have proven to play an important role to achieve learning objectives in online learning (Broadbent and Poon, 2015; Broadbent, 2017; Kizilcec et al., 2017) . Thus, in situations where remote learning, obligatory physical distancing, and a range of online platforms are widespread, internal resourcemanagement strategies may be key to successful autonomous learning characterized by marked reductions in social support (Biwer et al., 2021) .",

However, the students in this study also noted significant obstacles to organizing their learning, keeping track of tasks, managing their time, and adhering to deadlines (Pelikan et al., 2021) . Similarly, Biwer et al. (2021) investigated university students' adaption to emergency remote learning during the pandemic, with particular attention to resource-management strategies. Their findings indicate that students experienced greater difficulties in time management and regulating their attention and efforts. In addition, participants reported being less motivated by online than face-to-face education and also rated their general educational experience lower (Biwer et al., 2021) . Finally, Naujoks et al. (2021) investigated students' use of external resource management strategies (e.g., environment structuring, time management, and help-seeking) during emergency remote teaching and differences between students' intended and actual use of them. They found that HE students were digitally prepared for online learning (e.g., they had access to necessary hardware and applications), but had not applied as many resource regulation strategies as intended before entering the remote learning environment.",

One possible reason is that preservice teachers themselves have limited personal experience of digital learning environments (Lei, 2009; Valtonen et al., 2015) .

Indeed, teacher educators can serve as motivating models of good practice by using digital learning environments effectively themselves (Valtonen et al., 2015) . The intention to use technology is defined \"as the degree to which the user would like to use technology in the future\" (Joo et al., 2018; p. 51) and it is assumed that the intention to use ICT in teaching is closely related to the user's acceptance of technology. In recent years, researchers have presented and tested several models to explain and predict the acceptance and use of IT among users (e.g., Wong, 2016) . For instance, the technology-acceptance model (TAM) describes factors influencing teachers' acceptance and use of technologies (Teo, 2011; Wong, 2016; Scherer and Teo, 2019) .",

In the context of COVID-19, these findings prompt questions of whether and how the acceptance and use of technologies by pre-and in-service teachers depends on their experiences. In line with theoretical models, K\u00f6nig et al. (2020) found that teachers' current ICT skills and opportunities to improve them were significant factors in their adoption of online teaching during school closures in Germany. Moreover, one recent qualitative study reported that online teaching during the pandemic led to a transition in teachers' identity and positively impacted their beliefs about ICT (Nazari and Seyri, 2021) .",

We argue that under the conditions of emergency remote teaching, with traditional learning formats transformed into online provision, pre-service teachers' experience with technology has increased the likelihood that they will use it in their future careers. In Germany, digital learning had not been fully integrated into HE before the pandemic struck (Gilch et al., 2019) . Therefore, the rapid shift to online education has enabled students to gain a deeper understanding of how technology might be integrated into teaching and the benefits this may confer (Lei, 2009; Valtonen et al., 2015) . First, the study investigated the relationship between preservice teachers' intentions to use digital learning materials in their teaching and (a) the perceived quality of teacher training and (b) self-reported improvements in digital skills at a large public university. Our descriptive findings indicate that, despite the sudden shift from the traditional, classroombased education format to a remote format, pre-service teachers evaluated the quality of initial teacher training during the first online semester as equivalent, on average, to the quality of traditional, pre-pandemic initial teacher training. Furthermore, on average, students reported improvements in their digital skills. As expected, our results demonstrate that the perceived quality of teacher training during COVID-19 had a notable and significant impact on students' intentions to use digital learning material in their future work as teachers. Pre-service teachers who perceived the quality of emergency remote teaching to be equivalent to or better than their pre-COVID experiences reported stronger intentions to use ICT in their work. The analyses results support those of previous studies that identified meaningful learning experiences with educational technology as a key factor in the development of such intentions (Valtonen et al., 2015) .",

This finding is in line with other studies whose results suggested that pre-service teachers' self-efficacy and skills predict behavioral intentions (Valtonen et al., 2015; Joo et al., 2018) . However, the effect is very small what may be due to our focus on the improvement of students' digital skills and thus on the effect of online learning in the pandemic. Specifically, pre-service teachers' self-reported digital skills were compared with a prepandemic baseline, meaning that some students may have felt they had already acquired skills which the online semester had not necessarily improved. The assessment of teacher training quality, however, was positively correlated with changes in selfreported digital skills. Thus, pre-service teachers who perceived that the quality of emergency remote teaching exceeded or equaled the traditional instruction they had experienced before the outbreak of COVID-19 reported larger gains in digital skills. From a theoretical perspective, it seems reasonable to suggest that the relationship would be bidirectional: on the one hand, improved online instruction might help to develop students' ICT skills, while on the other hand, improved digital skills might allow for more participation and investment in online courses, thus influencing students' perceptions of quality.",

The results reveal that students who intended to work in elementary school showed, on average, significantly fewer intentions to use digital learning materials in their future work as teachers.

However, the authors only reported bivariate relationships between these factors, whereas our use of structural equation modeling enabled complex relationships to be detected. The findings of the current study may be explained by the fact that demands on students' time management were not particularly severe during this phase of the pandemic since social distancing rules severely restricted leisure opportunities of any sort, thus freeing up additional time for study. This assumption aligns with the finding of Naujoks et al. (2021) that time management strategies were less often used during the online semester than students had previously intended.

Among the intrinsic motivation and resource management strategies investigated in this study, only the regulation of attention was found to indirectly affect pre-service teachers' intention to use digital learning materials for teaching. There were no significant contributions of effort and time management to participants' intention to use digital learning materials for teaching. However, there are substantial relationships between the three internal resource management strategies. Hence, the findings further confirm both the importance of internal resource management to successful online learning during the pandemic and to preservice teachers' willingness to integrate technology into their future teaching profession. The results indicate that students who positively evaluate their experience of distance learning, which is linked to their capacity to regulate their attention, might be more willing to integrate technology in their classroom in their future careers. Overall, the current study contributes to the literature by underlining the importance of well-designed digital learning environments in initial teacher education. It also highlights the positive effects of digitalization in teacher education conferred by the switch to remote distance learning during the pandemic.",

Given that self-regulatory resources were a key area of investigation, the voluntary basis of participation may have skewed the sample toward students with a higher capacity for self-regulation: participants with less of a capacity for self-regulation during the pandemic may have felt unable to take or complete the survey, or may have missed the lectures in which the study was announced. This students may have been unintentionally excluded from our sample, thus potentially biasing the results. However, the composition of the sample was manifold, with pre-service teachers of all school types and with different study durations (i.e., number of semesters student teachers completed in summer term 2020).",

However, the results of the CFA confirmed the factor structures of the latent variables. Further research is needed to verify the psychometric parameters of the reliability and validity of the instruments developed in our study.",

            "text": "A third limitation stems from the study's reliance on selfreport measures, which can elicit socially desirable responses from participants and therefore lead to results that differ markedly from those obtained by other methods such as behavioral observation. Pre-Service teachers' self-reports were compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, meaning that the general level of current digital skills and instructional quality was not taken into account. Various constraints meant that some factors were excluded from the model. For example, data on participants' achievements, individual use of distance learning, such as time spent on courses or number of interactions, general motivational profile, or their personal situation were not analyzed. Multiple additional factors influencing the intention to use digital learning materials remain uninvestigated (e.g., self-efficacy of using educational technologies), but these factors lay beyond the scope of the current study. Future research on the intentions to use digital learning materials for teaching could include more aspects of students' personal resources (e.g., self-efficacy), prior experiences with digital learning environments, and professional knowledge to generate deeper insights. Additionally, a longitudinal design would allow for insights into changes in intentions and provide further information on the underlying mechanisms that influence behavioral intentions concerning technology integration in education. Moreover, further research is needed to examine characteristics of digitalization in initial teacher education under non-pandemic circumstances and its impact on preservice teachers' behavioral intentions concerning educational technology integration.",

While universities will eventually switch back to face-to-face teacher training, online learning and technology integration are likely to remain part of initial teacher training. Online learning settings differ meaningfully from traditional higher education settings, in that the online learning settings require a greater degree of autonomous learning situations. Hence, fostering resource management strategies seems to be a promising approach.",

It demonstrates the value of providing pre-service teachers with meaningful and adaptive opportunities to learn at university. In addition this study shows that effective teaching fosters the readiness and intention of students to deploy a range of ICT resources in their professional lives. As mentioned above, teacher training must confront a particular challenge within the process of digital transformation. Specifically, universities must attend carefully to their role as learning organizations since they are better placed to integrate ICT than institutions of primary and secondary education. Universities must provide pre-service teachers with state-of-the-art models of teaching so they can apply these models to their own professional lives. However, teacher educators are not a homogeneous group (Daumiller et al., 2021; Scherer et al., 2021) and the comprehensive changes to practice imposed by the pandemic have been implemented in a range of different ways. Nonetheless, the challenge of developing the knowledge, competence, and motivation of teacher educators concerning digital teaching must remain a key goal of teacher training education.",
