            "text": "Ever since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (Pak et al., 2020) in 2020, the world has continued to struggle in controlling and containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This has been especially challenging with the rise of the Omicron variant and its subvariants and recombinants, which has led to a significant increase in patients seeking treatment and has put a tremendous burden on hospitals and healthcare systems. A major challenge faced during the pandemic has been the prediction of survival and the risk for additional injuries in individual patients, which requires significant clinical expertise and additional resources to avoid further complications. In this study we propose COVID-Net Biochem, an explainability-driven framework for building machine learning models to predict patient survival and the chance of developing kidney injury during hospitalization from clinical and biochemistry data in a transparent and systematic manner. In the first \"clinician-guided initial design\" phase, we prepared a benchmark dataset of carefully selected clinical and biochemistry data based on clinician assessment, which were curated from a patient cohort of 1366 patients at Stony Brook University. A collection of different machine learning models with a diversity of gradient based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures was designed and trained specifically for survival and kidney injury prediction based on the carefully selected clinical and biochemical markers. In the second \"explainabilitydriven design refinement\" phase, we harnessed explainability methods to not only gain a deeper understanding into the decision-making process of the individual models, but also identify the overall impact of the individual clinical and biochemical markers to identify potential biases. These explainability outcomes are further analyzed by a clinician with over eight years experience to gain a deeper understanding of clinical validity of decisions made. These explainability-driven insights gained alongside the associated clinical feedback are then leveraged to guide and revise the training policies and architectural design in an iterative manner to improve not just prediction performance but also improve clinical validity and trustworthiness of the final machine learning models. Using the proposed explainable-COVID-Net Biochem driven framework, we achieved 98.1% accuracy in survival prediction and 96.7% accuracy in predicting kidney injury complication, with the models made available in an open source manner. While not a production-ready solution, the ultimate goal of this study is to act as a catalyst for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to develop innovative and trust-worthy clinical decision support solutions for helping clinicians around the world manage the continuing pandemic.",

Although the situation has been improved significantly since the declaration of the global pandemic by the World Health Organization (Pak et al., 2020) , the number of infected people and death toll continues to rise regularly when a new COVID variant emerges (Thakur and Kanta Ratho, 2021) . The number of infected patients has a direct impact on the nation's healthcare systems and causes a swift drain of hospital's human and material resources. As an example, the shortage of hospital staff can lead to misdiagnosis and improper treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

More specifically, while significant advances have been made in machine learning, particularly with the introduction of deep learning, much of the design methodologies leveraged in the field rely solely on a small set of performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc.) to evaluate and guide the design process of machine learning models. Such 'black box' design methodologies provide little insight into the decision-making process of the resulting machine learning models, and as such even the designers themselves have few means to guide their design decisions in a clear and transparency manner. This is particularly problematic given the mission-critical nature of clinical decision support in healthcare, and can lead to significant lack of trust and understanding by clinicians in machine learning-driven clinical decision support solutions. Furthermore, the lack of interpretability or understanding in the decision-making process during the design process and during clinical use creates significant accountability and governance issues, particularly if decisions and recommendations made by machine learning models result in negative patient impact in some cases.",

The framework provides a two phase approach in which a diverse set of machine learning models are designed and trained on a curated dataset and then validated using both an automatic explainability technique to identify key features as well as manual clinician validation of the proposed highlighted features. The second phase consists of leveraging the explainability-driven insights to revise the data and design of the models to ensure high detection performance from relevant clinical features. The resulting output from the development process are high-performing, transparent detection models that not only provide both supplementary outcome predictions for clinicians but also quantitatively highlight important factors that could provide new insights beyond standard clinical practices.",

The proposed COVID-Net Biochem framework comprises of two main phases: Clinician-guided initial design phase: The first phase starts with the preparation of a benchmark dataset from carefully selected clinical and biochemical markers based on clinical assessment curated for a patient cohort. While a plethora of clinical and biochemical markers may be collected for the patient cohort, only a selected number of markers are relevant for a given predictive task while others may be not only irrelevant but misleading for the machine learning model when leveraged. Furthermore, certain clinical markers such as age and gender can lead to considerable bias in the resulting model. Therefore, in this phase, we remove clinically irrelevant markers through consultations with clinicians who have the domain knowledge of the task. Next, a collection of different machine learning models with a diversity of gradient based boosting tree architectures and deep transformer architectures is designed and trained on the constructed benchmark dataset.",

In this paper, we leverage a quantitative explainability technique called GSInquire to conduct this evaluation. Next, we analyze and interpret the decision making process of the model through the identified relevant predictive markers and leverage the insights in an iterative design refinement manner to build progressively better and more clinically-relevant machine learning models. More specifically, if all of the clinical and biochemical markers identified by quantitative explainability are driving the decision-making process of a given model and these markers are verified to be clinically sound based on clinical assessment of the explainability results, the model is accepted as the final model; otherwise, we returns to the first phase where the irrelevant markers are discarded for that given model, and a new model architecture is trained and produced via hyperparameter optimization and again tested for phase 2. This iterative approach not only removes the influence of quantitatively and clinically irrelevant clinical and biochemical markers, but it also removes the markers that may dominate the decision-making process when they are insufficient for clinically sound decisions (e.g., the heart rate clinical marker may be clinically relevant but should not be solely leveraged for survival prediction from COVID-19 as a result of its general severity implication). This iterative process is continued until the model heavily leverages clinically sound clinical and biochemical markers to great effect and impact in its decision making process. Figure 3 provides an overview of the complete iterative design process in the proposed framework. In the following sections, we show how we have applied this framework in our study to develop reliable models which leverage only relevant markers for decision making.",

The collection of models we designed and trained on the constructed benchmark dataset are based on the following architecture design patterns: i)TabNet (Arik and Pfister, 2019), ii) TabTransformer (Huang et al., 2020b) , iii) FTTransformer (Gorishniy et al., 2021) , iv) XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) , v) LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017) , and vi) CatBoost (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018) . TabNet focuses on employing sequential attention to score features for decision making and make the model more interpretable compared to previously proposed deep learning models for tabular datasets (Arik and Pfister, 2019). Tab-Transformer and FTTransformer utilize a more recent transformer architecture designed to process Tabular datasets. In practice, transformer models have shown higher performance on most well-known datasets (Huang et al., 2020b; Gorishniy et al., 2021; Vaswani et al., 2017) . The gradient boosting algorithms rely on creating and learning an ensemble of weak prediction models (decision trees) by minimizing an arbitrary differentiable loss function. In the explainability-driven design refinement phase for this particular study, we conduct quantitative explainability validation of model performance and behaviour by leveraging GSInquire (Lin et al., 2019b), a state-of-the-art explainability technique that has been shown to produce explanations that are significantly more reflective of the decision-making process when compared to other well-known explainability techniques in the literature. GSInquire enables the assignment of quantitative importance values to each clinical and biochemical marker representing its impact on the model prediction. Finally, clinical assessment of explainability-driven insights was conducted by a clinician with over eight years of experience.",

After identifying the most quantitatively important markers to the decision-making processes of individual models, we presented these explainability results to the clinician to not only gain valuable clinical insights into the clinical soundness of the machine learning models but also to identify the non-relevant markers among these that the models rely on so that they will be excluded in the next round of model design refinement and training. As an example, after conducting explainability-driven assessment on the machine learning models with LightGBM and CatBoost architectures, we observed that the clinical marker \"Length of Stay\" had the highest quantitative impact on the decision-making process of said models for the AKI prediction (see Figure 7 ). After clinical consultation on this explainability-driven insight, we found out this clinical marker has little clinical value in determining the likelihood of AKI. As a result, in the next phase of model design and training, the \"Length of Stay\" marker was excluded. This process continued until only the relevant markers for our prediction tasks were utilized by the individual models. It is very important to note that explainability-driven assessment was conducted on each model independently, and as such the end result is that each model is uniquely tailored around what clinical and biochemical markers benefits them most from the set of possible markers.

As it can be seen XGBoost had the best performance achieving accuracy of 98.1 % on the test set. Among deep learning models, TabTransformer had the best performance with accuracy of 95.9%. Also, both TabTransformer and XGBoost had above 96% results for recall and precision.",

            "text": "As explained earlier, the trained models from phase one of the development framework were then audited via explainability-driven performance validation to gain insights into their decision-making process that will inform the design modifications in phase two of the process. We leveraged GSInquire (Lin et al., 2019a) scores for each marker based on their influence on the outcome prediction through an inquisitor I within a generator-inquisitor pair {G, I}. These actionable insights were then further validated by a clinician to ensure the clinical relevance and later employed by the framework to make design revisions to the models accordingly. Figures 4 and 5 show the 10 most impactful clinical and biochemical markers relevant to COVID-19 survival and AKI prediction for the highest performing models of TabTransformer, LightGBM, and CatBoost, respectively. Figure 6 provides a summary of the high impact markers across all models by averaging their impact scores and reporting the top 10 highest positive predictive parameters. For COVID-19 patient survival prediction, the marker indicating whether a patient has experienced acute kidney injury during hospitilization provides the highest impact to model predictions which is aligned with our clinician suggestion. In this regard, we observed in figure 1 , that there is a direct correlation between survival and acute kidney injury. Also, it is interesting to see that in figure 4 while two gradient boosting tree has the same high impact marker (AKI), the tabtransformer is looking at two other markers B and Fibrin D Dimer which are also relevant for survival prediction. What we can see here is that as we change the type of learning model from gradient boosting tree to deep neural network, the model considers a different set of relevant clinical and biochemical markers. This also happens in 5 for acute kidney injury prediction. While we can clearly see that both gradient boosting trees are considering the Theraputic Heparin and Creatinine to determine the chance of developing AKI, the TabTransformer is considering a different set of relevant markers such as Ferritin for decision making.",

As a proof of concept, we applied this framework for predicting survival and kidney injury during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients such that only clinically relevant clinical and biochemical markers are leveraged in the decision-making process of the models and to ensure that the decisions made are clinically sound. Experimental results show that the constructed machine learning models were able to not only achieve high predictive performance, but did so in a way that considered clinically-sound clinical and biochemical markers in their decision-making processes. In this regard, we provided a comprehensive examination of the constructed machine learning models' accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, confusion matrix on the benchmark dataset. Furthermore, we interpreted the decision-making process of the models using quantitative explainability via GSInquire. Finally, we showed that the model uses acute kidney injury as the main factor to determine the survival chance of the COVID-19 patient, and leverages Creatinine biochemical markers as the main factor to determine the chance of developing kidney injury which is consistent with clinical interpretation.",
