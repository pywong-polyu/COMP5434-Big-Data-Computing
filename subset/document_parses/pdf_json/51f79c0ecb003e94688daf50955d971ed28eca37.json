In EMRs, the same word can refer to more than one kind of entities, while various words can describe the same entities [7] . Moreover, there are abbreviations or acronyms and multiple variants of same entities in EMRs [8] . These entities rarely or even do not occur in EMRs, but it is still a problem that cannot be ignored. Both of these problems make BioNER a challenging task. The previous BioNER methods were mainly developed for English texts. In recent years, with the Chinese medical information system gained in popularity, BioNER in Chinese clinical texts has also received extensive attention. Due to the lack of Chinese word boundaries and complexity of the form of Chinese, BioNER in Chinese texts is more difficult than that in English texts [9] .",

The fact of heavy clinical overload of COVID-19 for medical facilities without effective treatments in most countries means that well-designed clinical trials would be extremely difficult for concurrent clinical settings. In this case, EMRs become one of the most valuable data sources for clinical studies, which place clinical BioNER as an urgent research task. However, although various benchmark corpus and text mining studies were performed on biomedical literatures, there are few BioNER studies on COVID-19 EMRs. In existing clinical studies of COVID-19, researchers extracted structured patient information either manually or from databases [10, 11] . These methods are time-consuming and laborious, while the structured information in databases lacks detailed symptoms of patients. Studies have shown that accurate symptom information is important for screening and analysis of COVID-19 [12, 13] . Most COVID-19 patients not only have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath but also have digestive symptoms such as anorexia and diarrhea [14, 15] . At present, due to the small number of structured COVID-19 EMRs, these findings are based on small datasets and need to be further studied by a large sample. Therefore, it is urgent to find a method that can automatically extract symptom phenotypes associated with COVID-19 from a large scale of EMR data.",

As a matter of fact, symptoms are subjective indications of disease, and accurately extracting symptoms and their corresponding duration is particularity important for clinical analysis [18] . Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to extract NS and PS in Chinese EMRs, respectively. For example, there is a sentence in EMRs: \"The patient developed fever and cough 9 days age, without chest tightness, chest pain or other discomfort.\" Among them, \"fever\" and \"cough\" are PS, which means that the patient does indeed have these symptoms, and \"without chest tightness, chest pain or other discomfort\" is a chunk with NS, means the patient does not suffer from both \"chest tightness\" and \"chest pain.\" If only symptom-level BioNER was performed, \"fever,\" \"cough,\" \"chest tightness,\" and \"chest pain\" would be extracted and fed to subsequent clinical analysis with errors. Therefore, the fine-grained BioNER is very important to obtain a profile of patient with precise structured phenotypes in clinical text data analysis. Moreover, some clinical studies of COVID-19 also verified our viewpoint [19] [20] [21] . Fang et al. have shown that hypertension or diabetes would lead to deterioration of COVID-19 [19] . Taken together, it is significant to avoid identifying the symptoms and diseases which patients denied, such as fever, diarrhea, diabetes, and hypertension, as their medical histories.",

In our study, Chinese BioNER task was regarded as a character-level sequence labelling task to avoid the error caused by word segmentation, and contextual features were utilized to help recognize clinical named entities. More specifically, we obtained word representations of Chinese characters containing global contextual information and then fed them into the following BiLSTM layer to capture local contextual features. Finally, the dependencies of adjacent labels were captured by using the conditional random field (CRF) to determine the optimal label sequences. Computational results on the COVID-19 dataset show that Phenonizer significantly outperforms character embedding-based methods and hardly increases training time. In addition, we found that fine-grained dataset improved the performance of our method, and models trained on the fine-grained dataset are able to avoid confusing NS and PS. Finally, Phenonizer has excellent generalization ability to extract clinical information from Chinese EMRs quickly and accurately in the event of new disease outbreak.",

Dictionary-based approaches employ expert-approved vocabularies to recognize entities. They are widely used because of their simplicity and performance. Most of the existing entities can be correctly identified by dictionary matching [24, 25] . However, these approaches rely heavily on manual rule bases and dictionaries. As datasets get updated, it takes a lot of manpower to maintain the rules and dictionaries, which is not an easy way.

In the field 4 BioMed Research International of NLP, it needs to be converted into data types that can be understood and processed by neural network. Learning word representations from a large amount of unannotated text has long been a fundamental and important task in NLP field. While previous methods (e.g., Word2Vec [35] and GloVe [36] ) focused on learning word representations independently, recent works have focused on learning word representations from context [37] . For instance, ELMo [38] uses a bidirectional language model, while OpenAI GPT [39] embeds contextual information into word embeddings by a transformer. BERT is a language representation model which uses bidirectional transformers to capture contextual information in text and overcomes the problem that previous language models cannot see future words [34] . BERT learns the characteristics of words from a large number of corpora through unsupervised learning. It has different structures. BERT-base Chinese , which we used in experiment, is a multilayer bidirectional transformer with the number of layers L = 12, the hidden layer parameter H = 768, and the number of self-attention heads A = 12. Different from ELMo, the pretraining task of BERT is not an N-gram language model prediction task, but a masked language model (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) task. For MLM, similar to cloze task, the model randomly screened 15% of tokens for each input sequence and screened predictive tokens. For NSP, the input sequence splits sentence pairs with [SEQ] , and only 50% of the sentence pairs are positive samples.",

In addition, we found that precision of Phenonizer for drug was relatively low, at about 0.6. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the drug prediction results. We found that Phenonizer predicted unlabelled entities in the text.

Moreover, we found similar problems in past history. Since our dataset is symptom-specific, the absence of other entities is inevitable. The performance of Phenonizer in symptom extraction is very excellent, but a few mistakes were caused by complicated description of symptoms, such as \"dissolving watery stools 5 to 6 times per day,\" which brings confusion to symptom extraction.",
