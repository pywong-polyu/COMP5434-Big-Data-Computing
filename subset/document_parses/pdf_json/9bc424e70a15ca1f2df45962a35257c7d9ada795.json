            "text": "Nanopore sequencing and phylodynamic modeling have been used to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of viral epidemics, but their application to bacterial pathogens has remained challenging. Cost-effective bacterial genome sequencing and variant calling on nanopore platforms would greatly enhance surveillance and outbreak response in communities without access to sequencing infrastructure. Here, we adapt random forest models for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) polishing developed by Sanderson and colleagues (2020. High precision Neisseria gonorrhoeae variant and antimicrobial resistance calling from metagenomic nanopore sequencing. Genome Res. 30(9):1354-1363) to estimate divergence and effective reproduction numbers (R e ) of two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks from remote communities in Far North Queensland and Papua New Guinea (PNG; n \u00bc 159). Successive barcoded panels of S. aureus isolates (2 \u00c2 12 per MinION) sequenced at low coverage (>5\u00c2 to 10\u00c2) provided sufficient data to accurately infer genotypes with high recall when compared with Illumina references. Random forest models achieved high resolution on ST93 outbreak sequence types (>90% accuracy and precision) and enabled phylodynamic inference of epidemiological parameters using birth-death skyline models. Our method reproduced phylogenetic topology, origin of the outbreaks, and indications of epidemic growth (R e > 1). Nextflow pipelines implement SNP polisher training, evaluation, and outbreak alignments, enabling reconstruction of within-lineage transmission dynamics for infection control of bacterial disease outbreaks on portable nanopore platforms. Our study shows that nanopore technology can be used for bacterial outbreak reconstruction at competitive costs, providing opportunities for infection control in hospitals and communities without access to sequencing infrastructure, such as in remote northern Australia and PNG.",

Maximumlikelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylodynamic methods are commonly used to date the emergence of lineages, variants, and outbreaks, and to estimate key epidemiological parameters, such as changes in the effective reproduction number over time (R e ; Hodcroft et al. 2021; Volz et al. 2021) . Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing has emerged as viable technology for real-time genomic epidemiology and has been applied across national-scale SARS-CoV-2 surveillance efforts in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia, amongst other countries (da Silva Filipe et al. 2021; du Plessis et al. 2021; Hammer et al. 2021; Nicholls et al. 2021) . Moreover, nanopore sequencing devices can, in theory, be operated in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where local genomics infrastructure may be lacking or is difficult to access (Faria et al. 2017; Giovanetti et al. 2020) , so that a timely outbreak response is not feasible (Gardy and Loman 2018) . Accessible genomics infrastructure is particularly relevant for continuous surveillance at bacterial evolutionary time scales, where outbreak strains may circulate for years, and can persist in human and animal reservoirs or the environment outside their host. Furthermore, viral pathogen genomes, such as Ebola virus or SARS-CoV-2, are often sequenced directly from patient samples using targeted PCR-based enrichment approaches, achieving high-genome coverage and resolution capable of informing phylodynamic models Bull et al. 2020 ). However, nanopore sequencing for bacterial pathogens, coupled to Bayesian phylodynamic models, has so far not been considered for routine epidemiological applications, mainly due the need for sufficiently accurate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling at bacterial whole-genome scales . SNP calls from high-coverage (>30\u00c2) Illumina data are the current standard for accurate SNP calls used in phylogenetic applications, but current generation nanopore SNP calling has suffered from low raw sequence read accuracy (R9.4.1, < Guppy v5.0) and a focus on variant calling in human genomes, with much of the available callers developed specifically for human variants (Luo et al. 2020 ). This problem is further aggravated when attempting to sequence costeffectively, for example, using low-coverage multiplexed runs (<5-10\u00c2) and simple library preparation with ONT sequencing kits (at least R9.4.1 pore architecture, SQK-RBK004 libraries) that can be used in LMICs with large burdens of bacterial disease.",

In addition, on bacterial time scales (years) little sequence variation will have occurred in newly emergent outbreaks, which places a disproportionate emphasis on correctly inferring the few available outbreak-specific SNPs. As a consequence, there is little room for systematic errors introduced by base and variant callers when using (low coverage) nanopore sequencing data to effectively survey bacterial outbreaks. Neural network-based, nanopore-native variant callers in particular can introduce excessive false-positive (FP) SNP calls, complicating transmission inference from ONT sequence data, where accuracy and precision are required . Within-lineage phylodynamic inference for bacterial outbreaks additionally depends on sufficient temporal signal to ascertain a phylodynamic threshold, at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in the sample to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates (Duch\u00eane, Geoghegan et al. 2016; Duchene, Featherstone, et al. 2020; . Due to slower substitution rates in bacteria compared with viruses (Duch\u00eane, Holt et al. 2016) , longitudinal sample collections are optimal for genomic epidemiology and often require multiple years of data to infer transmission dynamics of the sampled population. Requirements for accurate whole-genome SNP calls across a large number of isolates, sequenced cost-effectively at low-genome coverage and over a sufficient interval of time, represent a significant barrier to the implementation of phylodynamic modeling for bacterial pathogens.",

Recently, a six-strain multiplex protocol for the MinION with genome assembly and determination of phylogenetic relationships to identify outbreaks has been tested for Staphylococcus aureus lineages sampled in Norway. However, it remains unclear whether full within-lineage phylodynamic modeling is possible at population-level scale, whether estimates from nanopore data match results obtained using SNP calling with Illumina reads and whether sequencing runs can be conducted cost-effectively (at least 24 isolates per run). In this study, we adapt a variant polishing approach first implemented by Sanderson et al. (2020) on metagenomic sequencing of N. gonorrhoeae using random forest classifiers to filter SNP calls from the nanopore-native variant callers Medaka v1.2.3 and Clair v2.1.1 (Luo et al. 2020) . We use Snippy Illumina variant profiles as reference data and investigate caller performance across reference genomes and outbreak data sets. We show that random forest classifiers sufficiently remove incorrect calls from Clair in outbreak isolates with >5\u00c2 coverage to allow for sequencing of 24 community-associated S. aureus isolates per MinION flow cell (n \u00bc 181) which successfully resolved phylodynamic parameters estimates of two outbreaks of ST93-MRSA-IV in remote Far North Queensland (FNQ) and Papua New Guinea (PNG).",

Compared with Illumina reference assemblies, SNP and indels were frequently occurring in low-coverage uncorrected nanopore assemblies ( fig. 2A, right) . Errors were considerably reduced in high-coverage isolates leading to assembly identities ranging between 0.9993 and 0.9999 in the dnadiff metric (Mar\u00e7ais et al. 2018 ; supplementary tables, Supplementary Material online). Recovery of complete chromosomes and S. aureus specific genotypes from uncorrected long-read assemblies was sufficient for high-coverage isolates in our collection ( fig. 2B , > 80-90%). Assembly genotyping for clinically relevant features such as the presence of mecA or the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), major subtypes of SCCmec elements, resistance genes, and other markers of interest showed high concordance with reference assemblies ( fig. 2B ). In contrast, low-coverage assemblies often failed to call genotypes-recovery was low for mecA and SCCmec types, as well as for PVL and other markers of interest ( fig. 2B , <60%, supplementary tables, Supplementary Material online). Hybrid long-read correction with Pilon did MBE not markedly improve genotype recovery in low-coverage isolate; however, recovery improved in the Unicycler hybrid assemblies ( fig. 2A and B). Lower SCCmec subtyping performance was likely due to remaining insertions or deletions from nanopore data impacting on the large cassette chromosomes (>20 kb). Unicycler produced more accurate hybrid assemblies than correction of long-read assemblies with Pilon alone and performed slightly better in hybrid assemblies of low-coverage nanopore data ( fig. 2B ). For genome assembly and genotyping, our dual-panel sequencing approach recovers nanopore genotypes in high-coverage isolates (>10\u00c2) although some errors remain, particularly in sequence type calling and SCCmec subtyping.",

However, within-outbreak branch lengths were not reconstructed, because novel variation had accumulated since the divergence from the Australian East Coast population in the 1990s. We therefore decided to use a de novo variant calling approach comparing two native nanopore variant callers based on neural network architectures, by default trained on Homo sapiens variant calls (Clair v2.1.1) or a mix of human and microbial data from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and H. sapiens (v1.2.3). Although recall was high, raw basecaller performance was exceedingly low in both Clair and Medaka accuracy and precision, particularly in outbreak isolate calls against the outbreak reference genome (<20%, supplementary fig. S2 , Supplementary Material online). We next adopted SNP polishers using random forest classifiers originally developed by Sanderson and colleagues (2020) 3B-D) ; because there were no considerations of specific training sets used in the original N. gonorrhoeae classifier, we trained S. aureus classifiers on three combinations of isolates including a mixed set of three sequence types (ST93, ST88, ST15; saureus_mixed) and two sets of outbreak sequence type isolates (ST93) from either FNQ (saureus_fnq) or PNG (saureus_png). In combination with the original N. gonorrhoeae classifiers, the different training sets allowed us to evaluate whether SNP polishing was effective using models from a different species entirely (Sanderson) , from the same species but without outbreak-related data (saureus_mixed) or from the same species, but with isolates from the same sequence type or outbreak (saureus_fnq, saureus_png 1B ). Evaluations indicated that all trained SNP polishers increased accuracy and precision with slight reductions in recall ( fig. 4) . However, suboptimal performance was observed in all metrics for the N. gonorrhoeae classifier across outbreak sequence types (<40%) as well as other sequence types (<50%). Performance improved considerably in the mixed S. aureus polisher (saureus_mixed) both among outbreak isolates (69.52% 6 12.48 accuracy, 75.94% 6 14.56 precision) and other sequence types (81.94% 6 14.56 accuracy, 90.11% 6 6.83 precision). However, despite significant baseline improvement, the interspecies and mixed-sequence type models the number of FP SNP calls remained in the range of 100s to 1,000s (right column, fig. 4A and B). Training the models with isolates from the same sequence type (ST93, FNQ) slightly improved performance (ST93: 71.69% 6 13.99 accuracy, 83.33% 6 10.42 precision) but reductions of accuracy and recall in other sequence types were observed ( fig. 4C ). PNG outbreak-derived model (saureus_png) performed best for polishing isolates from the same outbreak across all metrics in the high-coverage isolates (ST93: 69.28% 6 16.78 accuracy, 87.57% 6 9.83 precision) but incurred a steeper cost to accuracy and recall in nonoutbreak isolates ( fig. 4D ). Reductions indicate that the model trained on features specific to the outbreak genotype and became significantly less generalizable to other sequence type applications. We note that the levels of precision and accuracy of the ST93 polishers in absolute numbers translate to 1-10 s of false SNP calls compared with the N. gonorrhoeae and mixed-sequence type model ( fig. 4 ).",

However, there were no major topological inconsistencies that would affect interpretation of the source population. In all topologies, the outbreaks from PNG derived from the East Coast ST93-MRSA-IV clade, and the FNQ outbreak derived from the Northern Territory reintroduction (fig. 5). Regional transmissions into the United Kingdom and Australia within the outbreak clusters remained identifiable (black and red branches in PNG-1 and PNG-2). Introductions into FNQ from other parts of the population are evident from both the reference and the polished alignments (red branches in East Coast, PNG and Northern Territory clades). Branch lengths of the nanopore-sequenced clades were similar to the reference ML tree, but were excessive in the between-species N. gonorrhoeae polished alignments as well as in the mixed The alignment based on SNPs polished using outbreak sequence type (ST93) isolates was most consistent with the Illumina reference phylogeny of ST93.

We ran BEAST2 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains on the outbreak subsets of the full SNP alignment with sufficient isolates (n PNG-1 \u00bc 53; n FNQ \u00bc 32) using a fixed substitution rate of the wholelineage median posterior estimate (3:199 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ). This was necessary as nonrandom sampling (subsetting the alignment to the outbreak clade) removes the temporal signal in the comparatively recent outbreaks, and thus leads to an overestimation of the outbreak MRCA. We note that the models were efficiently run on a standard NVIDIA GTX1080-Ti graphical processing unit (GPU) using BEAST2 with the BEAGLE library at speeds of <3-4 min/million steps in the MCMC (5-7 h per run and GPU) making timely parameter estimation for outbreak responses feasible on low-cost hardware. On an NVIDIA P100 GPU, walltime decreased to <50 s to 1 min/ million steps in the MCMC, around 1-2 h walltime per run and GPU on a distributed system. Estimates were consistent with full lineage-wide analysis (R e > 1.5-2.0) and we observed robust estimates in an exploration of the R e prior (supplementary table S2 and figs. S6 and S7, Supplementary Material online). We therefore demonstrate that SNP polishing enables the use of birth-death skyline models for outbreak parameter estimation, even with low-coverage nanopore sequencing data (5\u00c2 to 10\u00c2). Finally, we implemented training, evaluation, and deployment of SNP polishers for within-lineage transmission modeling in Nextflow.",

A recent pipeline for cluster identification using six strains per MinION flow cell (42 on 7 flow cells) successfully identified clusters in four distinct lineages, using a whole-genome assembly-based phylogeny (Ferreira et al. 2021 ). However, full outbreak reconstruction within the outbreak lineage-allowing for Bayesian model applications to estimate epidemiological parameters within the phylogeny-has so far not been conducted. Here, we show that the application of random forest SNP polishers developed by Sanderson and colleagues (2020) can sufficiently reduce the number of FP SNP calls from neural network variant caller Clair v.2.1.1 (Luo et al. 2020) .

Our genotyping analysis showed that for high-coverage isolates (>10\u00c2) genotyping directly from polished nanopore assembly was comparable to hybrid Illumina-ONT approaches ( fig.  2) . We used the most recent models at the time of writing for base calling (Bonito v0.3.6) followed by polished long-read assembly or hybrid assembly. With the imminent release of R10.3 pores and expected increases in raw-read accuracy the remaining misclassifications in genotypes from assemblies (mostly in MLST and SCCmec subtyping) will be eliminated and produce nanopore assemblies comparable to reference assemblies at >10\u00c2 coverage. We chose here to implement a rapid and minimal protocol to evaluate its application in reference laboratories without local access to sequencing infrastructure, such as at the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine or the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research. Our method requires some context from genomic surveillance at the level of full lineages (e.g., ST93 or ST772) in order to situate nanopore-sequenced outbreaks within the wider lineage context and fix the clade birth-death model substitution rate. Given that substitution rates vary between S. aureus lineages , an estimate from the background data is required to fix substitution rates within the outbreak clusters. For optimal polishing results, it appears to be effective to train the random forest polishers on lineage-specific data, noting that effective polishing was still achieved when training isolates derived from a different part of the tree within the lineage (e.g., FNQ-trained polishers were effective on PNG isolates). In higher-coverage isolates effective polishing was also achieved with the mixed S. aureus and N. gonorrhoeae models; we note that only three isolates with matching Illumina and ONT data are required for training the polishers.",

            "text": "We demonstrate the utility of our method by sequencing novel isolates of community-associated MRSA from a pediatric osteomyelitis outbreak in the highland towns of Kundiawa and Goroka (PNG) and routine surveillance in remote northern Australia (FNQ; fig. 1, n \u00bc 181) . A protocol that minimized cost (without optimization) allowed us to sequence 2 consecutive panels of 12 isolates with rapid barcoded libraries on a MinION flow cell (SQK-RBK004), by using an interspersing nuclease flush (ONT, EXP-WSH-003). We note that spin column extractions resulted in several fragmented barcodes that failed assembly (12/96). Overall, phylodynamic models were mostly affected by very low-coverage isolates (<5\u00c2) whereas even low-medium coverage isolate (!5\u00c2) produced consistent estimates of the effective reproduction number for the PNG and FNQ clades, when compared with the Illumina reference ( fig. 6) . Accurate modeling was possible even with interspecies polishers trained on N. gonorrhoeae in higher-coverage isolates in PNG. Estimates were more variable in the low-coverage FNQ outbreak clade and for optimal performance, some protocol optimization will be required, and may include extraction protocols for long reads, inclusion of a magnetic bead cleanup step (obligatory in the latest iteration of the ONT rapid kit protocols, 2021) or short-read elimination kits. Although we were ultimately unable to use a total of 32 isolates (<5\u00c2 coverage) in the phylodynamic estimation, the cost per S. aureus genome using the 24\u00c2 multiplex protocol ranges between USD $40 (no failures over 181 unique samples) and around USD $50 per genome with two repeat flow cells from already extracted cultures (supplementary material 2, Supplementary Material online). Further optimization would incur small additional cost and can be conducted for bacterial pathogens of interest in sufficiently resourced laboratories. Further improvements in cost for genome selection by first scanning genomes with approximate genomic neighbor typing approaches may also be feasible ). Although we chose S. aureus as a model organism for this work mainly due to our interest in sequencing the outbreaks in PNG and FNQ, as well as because of its relatively small genome (2.8 Mbp), core principles and methods used in this study are immediately applicable to other bacterial pathogens Steinig et al. . https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac040 MBE and all steps of the pipelines are implemented in replicable Nextflow workflows (Materials and Methods).",

We note that within-outbreak patterns of divergence vary between phylogenies ( fig. 5) , and considering the number of remaining FP and false-negative (FN) SNPs after polishing ( fig. 4) , we did not expect within-outbreak transmission chains to be reproducible. Optimization of SNP polishing or variant calling, for example, with species-specific neural networks, remains to be investigated. For this study, we accelerated computation using the BEAGLE library (Ayres et al. 2019) in combination with BEAST2. Moderate acceleration on standard hardware (<5-7 h) and increased acceleration on NVIDIA P100 GPUs (<2 h) were achieved. Nanopore-driven outbreak sequencing and GPU acceleration in BEAST2 thus enable the rapid deployment of phylodynamic models and responsive surveillance of bacterial diseases.",

In particular, the effective cost of monitoring disease transmission is considerably lower on nanopore sequencing platforms than with gold-standard Illumina sequencing, which may facilitate the sustainable integration of genomic surveillance in reference laboratories located in these regions, including in remote northern Australia and the highlands of PNG. Improvements to the sequencing protocol, for example, by further reducing cost of nucleic acid extraction, increasing the number of isolates per flow cell or balancing throughput per barcode using in silico adaptive sequencing (Payne et al. 2021 ) will further enable the adoption of phylodynamic surveillance for bacterial outbreaks on nanopore devices.",

Cell lysis was conducted at 37 C for 2 h with gentle shaking followed by a proteinase K digestion for 30 min at 56 C. DNA was extracted using a simple column protocol from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was eluted in 70 ml of nuclease-free water, quantified on Qubit, and DNA was stored at 4 C until library preparation. Library preparation was done using approximately 420 ng of DNA and the rapid barcoding kit with 12 barcodes (ONT, SQK-RBK004) as per manufacturer's instructions. Basecalling was done using the R9.4.1 high accuracy (HAC, supplementary fig.

Fastp v0.20.1 (Chen et al. 2018 ) was used to trim adapter and low-quality Illumina sequences. We then constructed three types of assemblies: a polished long-read assembly using ONT data only (flye), one with short-read correction of the ONT long-read assembly (pilon) and one that first assembles short reads and scaffolds the assembly with long reads. For the polished longread assembly, Flye v2.8.3 (Kolmogorov et al. 2019 ) was used Phylodynamic Inference of Bacterial Outbreak Parameters . https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac040 MBE in conjunction with four iterations of minimap2 v2.17-r941 (Li 2018) \u00fe Racon 1.4.20 (Vaser et al. 2017 ) and subsequent polishing with Medaka 1.2.3.

Since we used the de novo Snippy calls as reference, true negative (TN) calls (sites called as wild type by ONT and Snippy) were not able to be considered. We combined data from both outbreaks (n ST93 \u00bc 118, n other \u00bc 44) and computed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for each evaluation against Illumina reference data (supplementary tables, Supplementary Material online, fig. 4 ).",

Core SNP sites were defined by polymorphic SNP sites present in genomes of all isolates included in the alignment, excluding any site that in any one isolate falls into a gap, or any site with less than a predefined minimum coverage (default: 1\u00c2). We first polished ONT SNPs from Clair with the trained random forest models, including the N. gonorrhoeae data set from Sanderson et al. (2020) . We then created reference alignments of the Illumina data (ST93 background and outbreaks, n \u00bc 531, >5\u00c2) with Snippy-core, as well as a reference Illumina and polished hybrid alignments with ONT outbreak SNPs in NanoPath ( fig. 5 ).",

We used RAXML-NG with the GTR \u00fe G and Lewi's ascertainment bias correction for SNP alignments. Trees were rooted on SRR115236 (early isolate from 1992), near the root of the phylogeny (van Hal et al. 2018 ) and decorated with metadata of sample origin at state level in ITOL (Letunic and Bork 2019) . Sampling dates in years were provided for each isolate. We next subset the full lineage alignments to the isolates in the large clades of the FNQ (n \u00bc 36) and PNG (n \u00bc 62) outbreaks. We then configured birth-death skyline models in BEAST2 using a custom Python interface (NanoPath Beastling) that stores model configurations of the serially (PNG) and contemporaneously sampled models (FNQ) in YAML files. Birth-death models consider dynamics of a population forward in time using the (transmission) rate k, the death (become uninfectious) rate d, the sampling probability q, and the time of the start of the population (outbreak; also called origin time) T. The effective reproduction number (R e ), can be directly extracted from these parameters by dividing the birth rate by the death rate (k \u00c4 d). We configured the model priors as outlined in table 1. Importantly, we set a lineage-wide fixed substitution rate prior at 3:199 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 to account for the loss of temporal signal in the outbreak subset alignments. NanoPath constructs the BEAST2 XML model files which can be run with the BEAGLE library on GPU. Results were summarized using the bdskytools package in R, where median higher posterior density intervals were computed in custom plotting scripts that can be found along with all other results from the pipelines and model runs at the data repository.
