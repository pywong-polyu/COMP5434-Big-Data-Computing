These cases can reveal themselves to be of difficult management, particularly in peripheral hospitals with complicated access to thoracic surgery. Intrapleural fibrinolytic instillation can be of use and has been widely reported, mostly in the case of empyema. In the literature, the use of fibrinolytics in hemothorax mostly pertained to the older fibrinolytics, such as streptokinase and urokinase. Recent studies describe the use of alteplase in these patients but mostly in the first days after the trauma, when it becomes clear that the first chest tube is not being effective. We report a case of residual traumatic hemothorax that could not be evacuated after multiple chest tubes placements and was finally cleared after instillation of alteplase late in the course of the disease.",

Instillation of a fibrinolytic into the pleural cavity, through the chest tube, in order to dissolve the clotted hemothorax and ease the drainage, has been reported previously in the literature, mainly using older fibrinolytics, like streptokinase [2] .",

A significant amount of blood was still present in the pleural cavity, so the tube was repositioned and drainage resumed. Over the next 4 days, however, it became scarcer, while the chest computed tomography (CT) scan continued to show 1a) , so a second chest tube, this time a 32 Fr, was placed in a posterior position compared to the first one. After an additional liter of blood was drained, drainage subsided 5 days later, and a significant amount of blood persisted (Fig. 1b) . At this time, the patient had various spikes in temperature, as well as elevated inflammatory markers, and septic shock from the infected hemothorax was assumed, complicating weaning from the ventilator. Upon inspection, the chest tube had thick dark blood in it, and blood clots were noted when aspiration was tried. Thoracic surgeons were consulted, but the patient was not fit for surgery, made especially hard given he had to be transferred to our reference hospital situated 300 km away. Hence, we chose to perform alteplase instillation through the chest tube. Twenty milligrams of alteplase were initially instilled, and the chest tube was clamped for 30 min, followed 6 h later by an additional 30 mg. In both applications, alteplase was diluted in 100mL of normal saline. No increase in drainage was noted in the first day, but after applying a pressure suction of \u22128 cmH2O on the tube, an additional 2 L of dark blood were evacuated in the next 3 days. There was a new drop in hemoglobin levels, requiring new transfusion. A followup CT scan showed resolution of the hemothorax (Fig.  1c) , 18 days after the patient had been admitted, and the chest tubes were removed 5 and 8 days later, respectively. Figure 2 shows the trend in drainages throughout this time.",
