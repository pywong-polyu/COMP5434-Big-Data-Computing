The data were critical in terms of uniformity of sampling, number of available samples for the different means of transport, missing data, significance of the available features (attributes), as well as noise of the samples. While the last two characteristics are common to applications that require the use of Machine Learning methods, and motivate its use, the former have required pre-processing operations that include filtering and imputation (replacement of values). The input variables include 3D accelerometers, pressure, proximity, speed, longitude, latitude, roll, pitch, bearing, and lumen. In particular, the pre-processing operations applied to each input variable were the following: (a) uniform resampling at constant 1 s resolution, i.e., 1 Hz; (b) filling of NaN (not available) values using padding with the last valid observation; (c) filtering using moving average over periods of 1 min; and (d) uniform resampling at constant 1 min resolution. Finally, to create the inputs to be provided to the Machine Learning models, for each input sequence we extracted 3 features for each input variable, namely average (avg), standard deviation (std), and maximum value (max). The feature extraction in the considered form has allowed the analysis through a set of Machine Learning approaches for vector data (see Sect. 3.2), in the light of a first evaluation of the involved challenges. The learning problem is configured as a multi-class classification task with 6 classes, one for each transport mode, starting from the streams (traces) of sensors data extracted from the smartphone App (and preprocessed as described above).",

Only 12 samples for motorbike transportation are available (less than 1% of the data). To counteract the effects of this imbalance in the available data, resampling policies (oversampling) have been considered. Also in consideration of these aspects, the assessment of the learning models' performance was conducted by using both multi-class accuracy (on the 6 classes), and macro F1 score, as follows: where tp i indicates the number of true positives for the i-th class, N i is the total number of samples pertaining to the i-th class, precision av and recall av respectively denote the precision and the recall measures, macro-averaged among the classes.",

Overall, the best result is achieved by RF in the case of full features configuration, reaching 0.904 of F1 score on validation, 1.00 accuracy on training, and 0.919 accuracy on test. We can also observe that, in general, the higher performance is obtained in the full features configuration, with a gentle reduction in correspondence of the cases of selected features and ad-hoc features configurations. This indicates that the quality of the estimation does not degrade dramatically when a smaller set of input sources is available to the system.",

The performance is lower in correspondence of the under-sampled classes, i.e. motorbike, car and train which have 1% of the data compared to the bike class alone, and on which therefore also the test estimation is much less statistically significant.",

In addition, confusion matrices of other learning models, such as those based on neural networks, showed a better behavior than RF in some cases confined to specific classes. For example, in Fig. 5 we show the confusion matrix for MLP-1 with full features, from which we can see a gain, in comparison to RF in Fig. 4 , on the transportation modes of foot, bus and motorbike. This consideration puts forward further enhancing potentialities in relation to investigations of the interplay between different learning models. ",

The achieved results were significant. In view of the peculiarities of the data, the overall external test accuracy over 90% represents a positive aspect. The performance scales with the number of samples in the classes, independently of the learning models used. This indicates as a possible line of broadening of the study, the continuation of a data collection, with a focus on the classes that were less sampled so far (i.e., non-cycling vehicles). Finally, the preliminary research presented in this paper opens the way to further studies also from a Machine Learning perspective. In this regard, an interesting direction consists in conducting a more in-depth cross-validation of the learning models. Another relevant line would be to extend the analysis to learning models for time series, e.g. Recurrent Neural Networks [9] (or hybrid neural architectures), enabling to naturally taking into account the temporal nature of the mobility data involved in the predictions. The final aim is that of contributing to the creation of an advanced and reliable human monitoring system for sustainable mobility. Moreover, monitored data, in the future, will be geoprocessed with data coming from other sources (health or metereologicaldata, land use data [10] , data coming from ITS located in the city [11] or data regarding urban and building/activities field) so to extract further important knowledge elements useful for decision support system.",
