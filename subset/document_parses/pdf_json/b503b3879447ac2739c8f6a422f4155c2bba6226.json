Optimizing the layout of tourist toilets is key to both meeting the sanitation demand of the visiting public and building an inclusive and civilised society. Nevertheless, the need for a consistent optimization of tourist toilets is overlooked in developing countries, especially in ethnic regions that are highly dependent on tourism. Taking Dunhua, a city in an ethnic region renowned for tourism on China's border with North Korea as an example, this study enables an optimization framework of a comprehensive tourist toilet layout based on Holling's concept of resilience by constructing an AHP index, obtaining Point of Interest (POI) data through Python, and aided by GIS visual analysis and Location-allocation (LA) modelling, aiming to support scientific planning and decision making of public facilities in tourist destinations like Dunhua. It also serves as a reference for places of tourism in other countries dedicated to promoting ecotourism and public health.",

            "text": "Tourist toilet is an indispensable piece of sanitation infrastructures in tourism activities. As \"the face of tourist places\" and \"the measure of human civilization\", the value it embodies not only lies in the inherent quality of tourist places and their sustainable and healthy development, but also in the reflection of national civilization image and the comprehensive strength of the country. Nowadays, tourist toilets are no longer limited to public toilets serving tourists in tourist attractions [3] , but a comprehensive system including public toilets in various tourism-related places, such as tourism. cities, scenic areas (scenic spots), tourist restaurants and tourist blocks, etc. [4] . However, for a long time, the planning and construction of tourist toilets has been the most prominent weaknesses in sanitation service system and tourism development in many developing countries, especially for ethnic regions (Here, the \"ethnics\" refers to the non-majority ethnic group(s), they can be indigenous peoples in protected areas of developed countries, but more commonly it refers to ethnic minorities in underdeveloped countries and regions). For instance, in China, since ethnic regions are often highly coupled with underdeveloped regions along the border and regions with rich tourism resources, tourism is often a key way they seek to alleviate poverty and generate income. Its contribution to regional cultural communication, ecological restoration, social stability and national unity is also increasingly being recognized [5, 6] . Nevertheless, the serious backward toilet construction is becoming an important factor restricting the development of tourism in ethnic regions, as well as a shortcoming of China's social civilization and public health service system. The \"Tourist Toilet Revolution\" is imperative [7] . Specifically, the tourism industry in China's ethnic region plays an important role in promoting local economic development, but the toilet coverage (Toilet coverage (rate): each toilet location point is taken as the center, and the surrounding circle with certain radius around that location point becomes the coverage area of that toilet. Divide the accumulated coverage area of all toilets in the area by the total area to get the toilet coverage of a given area) is generally low, and the imbalanced spatial layout of toilets is prominent throughout the country (Fig 1) . Tourist toilets should become the focus and breakthrough of tourism infrastructure construction in developing countries, and it should also be an important issue to solve the serious imbalance of social public health services. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to strengthen the research on reasonable layout and optimal configuration of tourist toilets in ethnic regions. Optimal layout of public infrastructure is one of the core issues of public service supply. The earliest study can be traced back to Weber's in 1909 on determining the location of a single warehouse to minimize the total distance from each customer [8] , while its rapid development began with Hakimi's research in 1964 [9] . Previously, the objects of the study were concentrated on parks [10] , schools [11] , industrial zones [12] and places with clean energy charging facilities [13] . Since the beginning of this century, the acceleration of urbanization has exposed the urban problem of the shortage of urban public service supply, making the optimal layout of urban public toilets become an important issue. Sampling surveys, data statistics, and travel population density methods are the most commonly used in quantitative analysis [14] [15] [16] . With the development of operations research and computing science in recent decades, facility optimal layout models are also applied in this field [17] . Recent studies have tried and explored GIS technology to optimize the location of public toilets. Quaye, for instance, used GIS and statistical methods to establish a map and mathematical model of the impact of population growth on health infrastructures in densely populated areas, and analyzed, predicted and visualized the number of public toilets [18] . Edilberto created a timeseries map through GIS to visualize the changes of health services over time in Parana, Brazil [19] . Feng and Long combined quantitative analysis methods with GIS technology to analyze the rationality of existing layout of urban public toilets and predict its demand in the future [20, 21] .",

Since 2000, the concept of resilience began to replace the concept of \"sustainable development\" and became a new theoretical focus. It can be deconstructed into ecological resilience, engineering resilience and social resilience [33] . Sociologists, especially human geographers, widely adopted the resilience theory to discuss how to foster resilience of cities in face of the acceleration of global climate change and urbanization, and how to cope with socioeconomic and political uncertainty risk through the layout of green infrastructure, the construction of models, and rational land use planning, etc. [34, 35] . Nowadays, the concept of resilience becomes a new paradigm in tourism research. Chen et al. proposed the concept and research framework of tourism socio-ecosystem, believing that resilience planning, resilience identification and resilience promotion should be the focus of tourism system research [36, 37] . Tourism activities are a continuous dynamic process with diversity and complexity, changes in the number of tourists will cause different demand for tourist toilets, which objectively requires the layout of tourist toilets should dynamically adapt to the changing needs of tourist destinations, rather than be a product of a one-time rigid planning [38] . The embedding of \"resilience\" is able to meet the demand, so as to promote the effective adaptation and transformation of tourist toilets under dynamic external influences, and avoid extreme phenomenon such as waste of resources or excessive pressure on resources.",

Although the meaning of tourist toilets has been extended, the scope of the research is still confined to toilets in scenic spots, and lacks comprehensive attention to tourist toilet system, and even less concern shown to those in ethnic regions. Among the facility layout models, LA model is the most widely used one, but this kind of analysis and other traditional quantitative methods as well as GIS technology are rarely used in the study of tourist toilets. As a result, these studies are still dominated by qualitative and descriptive methods, and the adjustment of the layout of tourist toilets is mostly a top-down supply-driven planning, so the fairness and operability of the conclusions are insufficient. Furthermore, to our knowledge, so far, resilience theory has not been employed to the study on optimal layout of tourist toilets. Static study focusing on a single time section reduces the overall social benefits of the layout.",

The service scope of these toilets is 2.7km 2 , which covers 46% of the scenic area and 100% of all the scenic spots, indicating that it has a better condition in the number and quality of tourist toilets However, there are a total of 102 scenic spots in the planning area of the LDM, only 19 of these are served by the current tourist toilets, with a coverage rate of 9%, which is far from meeting the needs for future tourism development. At present, there are only 4, 5 and 3 tourist toilets in YML, LBM and HCR scenic areas. Compared with LDM, the tourist toilets are in poor condition (Table 1 ).",

Based on the CJJ-27-2016 standard, it is estimated that 5-10 resilient toilets need to be added. Then, through statistics on the distribution density of POI influence factors, 6 resilient toilets were arranged in the areas with the highest traffic accessibility and population flow density, and they will be opened according to different seasons and time periods. In addition, it is necessary to upgrade or transform 15 toilets in public activity areas of central city, so that the number of tourist toilets of class I, class II and class III reaches 27, 25 and 20 respectively, with the number of class II or above toilets accounting for 72% of the total.

Therefore, in principle, the distance between toilets in dense tourist areas is set at 400m, and in general areas at 600m. By integrating the existing data, the optimal layout schemes for the location selection of tourist toilets in the four key scenic areas were proposed (Fig 10) . The specific scheme of each scenic area is as follows: 1) In LDM, 8 new toilets should be added in current scenic area, increasing the coverage rate from 45% to 68%, which will make up for the gap of toilet service scope in the current area, while 29 new toilets should be set in the planning area, including 4 resilient toilets. Thus, the total number of fixed tourist toilets will reach 53, including 31 class I, 20 class II, 2 class III. The service scope of toilets will reach 14.7km 2 , the coverage rate will increase from 9% to 33%, and the scenic spot coverage of toilets will reach 94%. 2) In YML, 17 new toilets should be added, with 3 resilient toilets, and the total number of fixed toilets will reach 21, including 7 class I, 8 class II and 6 class III. The service scope of toilets will reach 5.75km 2 , the coverage rate will increase from 8% to 53%, and the scenic spot coverage of toilets will reach 89%. 3) In LBM, 31 new toilets should be added, with 2 resilient toilets, and the total fixed toilets will reach 36, including 5 class I 5, 21 class II and 10 class III. The service scope of toilets will reach 19.3km 2 , the toilet coverage will increase from 5% to 40%, and scenic spot coverage of toilets will reach 91%. 4) In HCR, 6 new toilets should be added, with 2 resilient toilets, and the total number of fixed toilets will reach 9, including 3 class I, 3 class II and 3 class III. The service scope will reach 4.1km 2 , the toilet coverage will increase from 30% to 77%, and the scenic spot coverage of toilets will reach 100%. The field survey also found that during the peak tourist season, the queuing time of toilets reached at least 3 minutes at the entrance, exit, parking lots and other crowded areas. Given this, this paper took the load caused by sudden flows of large number of people at certain times of year into consideration, and located resilient toilets near the entrances, parking lots, and popular scenic spots, so as to improve the resilience of tourist toilets, especially during holidays and peak seasons.

This situation fails to meet ordinary demand from citizens and lacks resilience during the tourism season. Additionally, the gaps in the toilet service in important areas have exposed the unreasonable level setting and location of tourist toilets, which brings negative impact on the city's tourism image. Since the areas to the west of the Danjiang district are the main direction of urban expansion, and close to the core scenic area of LDM, the demand for tourist toilet service is increasing gradually. Nevertheless, its planning and construction also fail to keep up with the development pace of the city. For scenic areas, due to the fact that LDM is the only national 5A-level scenic spot in the this ethnic region, a serious tilt in resource input inevitably appeared. This also lead to homogenization phenomenon in the layout of its tourist toilets. The over dense arrangement of Class I toilets can easily lead to a waste of resources, and has a potential impact on the surrounding environment. Compared with LDM, the situation of tourist toilets in YML, LBM and HCR is more problematic, including seriously insufficient quantity, low class, small service scope, unreasonable layout, resulting polarization between scenic areas and uneven distribution of resources.",

We now need to have a certain degree of redundancy and space in this situation where efficiency may not be the highest, but it is sustainable. Equivalent to sustainable development, resilience theory focuses on the comprehensive development of economy, society and the environment. In fact, it is a theoretical model that emphasizes balance between different variables. This is consistent with the goal of paying more attention to fairness in addition to the optimization of facility layout. It helps researchers to have a more comprehensive understanding of the possible future prospects, and it is a bottom-up planning view from the perspective of tourists and residents, rather than simply representing the government and developers.

However, this article has insufficient consideration in this aspect. In the future, it should be improved from the perspective of relevant stakeholders to improve its social resilience.

The schemes also significantly improve the overall service capacity of toilets in scenic areas.

The urban area of Dunhua City is 47.17 km 2 , with a total of 189,806 people and 46 tourist toilets. <Standard of Setting of Environmental Sanitation Facilities (CJJ-27-2012)> regulates that there should generally be set one public toilet in urban areas for every 2500-3000 people [43]. Therefore, 65-76 fully open tourist toilets should be set in the urban area of Dunhua City, and 19-30 public toilets should be added. To be specific, the prescribed number of toilets in Minzhu district should be 11-13, but the actual number is 11. There should be 18 to 22 toilets in Shengli district, but actually there are 16. Bohai district should have 20-23 toilets, actually 15, and Danjiang district should have 16-20 toilets, but actually 4. The results showed that the number of tourist toilets in urban area do not reach the standard except for Minzhu district. Especially in Danjiang district, a new urban area to the south of Mudanjiang, where the number is seriously insufficient (Fig 5). In terms of the class of tourist toilets, <Standards for Planning of Urban Environmental Sanitation Facilities Planning (GBT 50337-2018)> [44] regulates that: (1) In urban built-up area, 65% of toilets should be Class II (AA) or above. (2) In CBDs, parks, squares and other landmark areas, class I (AAA) toilet should be installed. (3) Important roads, large-scale venues, municipal offices and other central city public activity areas should be equipped with class I or class II (AA) toilets. (4) Toilets of class II should mainly be arranged in general roads and residential areas, while class III (A) toilets could be installed appropriately. (5) Secondary and branch roads and sparsely populated areas are mainly set up with class III toilets. However, the Fig 5.
