            "text": "To explore whether the virtual retina clinic (VRC) has been a useful and safe platform for monitoring retinal diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessing patient satisfaction. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted for patients with stable retinal diseases in Donostia University Hospital's Ophthalmology Service during the pandemic. All patients were assessed in the VRC with optical coherence tomography of the macula and widefield retinography, plus visual field tests in hydroxychloroquine retinopathy screenings. The VRC\u00b4s effectiveness was evaluated with repeat blind assessments and patient satisfaction with an adapted SERVQUAL scale. Results: The most common diseases were diabetic retinopathy (30.3%) and age-related macular degeneration (21.8%). Most patients (74%) were eligible to continue in the VRC, 19.3% were referred to face-to-face (F2F) appointments and 6.6% were discharged. Patients underwent repeat blind assessments in F2F appointments to monitor VRC performance in 23.7% of the cases. The sensitivity to detect disease progression was 100%. The specificity was 80.1%. The VRC took half the time. The patient overall satisfaction rating was 9.8/10. Conclusion: The VRC, as an additional platform, supports F2F appointments. Almost three-quarters of patients could continue being safely seen in the VRC. The virtual approach decreases SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Patient satisfaction is very good. Translational Relevance: The VRC enables us to attend patients safely with decreased SARS-CoV-2 exposure.",

In particular, the pressure on healthcare services and need for social distancing to protect staff and patients has motivated efforts to explore new methodologies for ophthalmic evaluation, as well as alternative approaches to coding and billing. 1 Technological advances in retinal imaging have allowed virtual retina clinics (VRCs) to become a reality in the last decade. Especially in this last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed this scenario, some leading telehealth platforms now reporting virtual patient visits having increased by 257% to 700%. 1 The first virtual clinic was implemented in 2011 in Britain, by orthopedic specialists. 2, 3 After that, in ophthalmology, the glaucoma subspecialty set up virtual clinics. 4 Now, during the pandemic, care for other ophthalmological areas, such as the cornea, retina, cataract, and pediatric ophthalmology, as well as glaucoma, has been expanded through virtual clinics. 5, 6 Specifically, in the case of the retina, a VRC is a platform where patients have their medical history taken and undergo ocular tests (including retina images and macular optical coherence tomography (OCT)), without seeing a doctor face-to-face and the ophthalmologist reports the case in a store and forward strategy.",

In addition, as these devices use a scanning laser, they are less affected by pupil size and media opacities such as cataracts than traditional CFP. 22 In our case, images were taken for all patients with a widefield or UWF Clarus ultra-widefield camera (Carl Zeiss Meditec), which provides a resolution of 7.3 \u03bcm. 21 To our knowledge, this is the first report of a VRC series using this equipment and this approach made it possible to keep managing 74% of the patients in the VRC. Furthermore, the percentage of patients deemed suitable for VRC management will likely be higher in consecutive virtual appointments, assuming that unsuitable patients have been excluded from the VRC clinic after triage at the first visit. Notably, Kern et al 7 reported a reduction in F2F referral rate from >30% to 15% at the second virtual visit.",

The VRC at least halved the time that patients spent at the hospital. Furthermore, in the same amount of time, the ophthalmologist reported on twice as many cases in the VRC as in the F2F. In our series, on average, the ophthalmologist reported on 12 cases in 1 hour, while in an F2F clinic, the ophthalmologist saw just 6 patients in 1 hour.

Therefore, these patients were not discharged from the F2F clinic and a subsequent appointment was arranged for macular OCT.

The doctor-patient relationship may be more difficult in some cases. 26 Related to this, our study patients were internal referrals and gave good satisfaction ratings, but satisfaction might be lower if the VRC included newly diagnosed cases where F2F discussion with the patient is crucial. Our VRC showed a sensitivity of 100% to detect retinal disease progression in this context but other findings could be missed. For example, the impact of cataract progression was not specifically studied. Future studies should explore and tackle this issue. Lastly, another limitation that could be addressed in further research is that artificial intelligence systems were not used in our VRC at the time of this study, though they have shown promising results and we are keen to deploy them in our clinic in the future. 27 In conclusion, this study provides evidence that a VRC is a useful platform that supports F2F retina clinics and has certain benefits. In particular, the virtual clinic reduces patients' potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in hospital visits, by minimizing time in the clinic, and under these specific conditions, it seems feasible to keep monitoring a high proportion of patients with selected stable retinal diseases in a VRC, freeing up capacity in F2F retina clinics, while patients' satisfaction with the virtual approach is very high.",
