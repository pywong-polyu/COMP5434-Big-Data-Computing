Trainees in internal medicine routinely diagnose, manage, and treat patients experiencing these infections in the hospital setting as well as screen for and immunize against other comorbid infections in the ambulatory setting. Methods: This 90-minute, case-based, interactive workshop was led by two facilitators, an infectious diseases specialist and a senior internal medicine resident. To evaluate its effectiveness, we used a pre-and postsession survey administered at the beginning and end of the workshop. Learners were asked to rate comfort level in recognizing, managing, and counseling about various IDU-related infections, as well as to answer specific, content-level questions. Result: Thirty of 42 participants who attended the workshop completed the evaluation. There was a statistically significant change in participants' comfort level with diagnosing and managing IDU-associated infections as well as ambulatory standards of care for people who inject drugs (PWID) from pre-to postworkshop. Discussion: Our workshop focused on the management and prevention of infections among PWID in both the inpatient and ambulatory settings. Learners demonstrated increased comfort in managing these conditions.",

            "text": "The rate of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the US has been steadily increasing over the last 2 decades, from 1.7 million in 2002 to 2.2 million in 2010 to a staggering 10.2 million in 2018. [1] [2] [3] [4] Along with increased incidence of injection drug use (IDU) among communities, there has been a concomitant rise in infections related to IDU, resulting in higher utilization of health care: both visits to the emergency department and inpatient admissions for more serious infections. Over a 10-year period, there was a 72% rise in hospitalizations related to OUD and a near doubling of admissions for serious infections (from 3,421 in 2002 to 6,535 in 2012). This included a 1.5-fold increase in infective endocarditis (IE), a 2.2-fold increase in osteomyelitis, and a 2.6-fold increase in spinal epidural abscesses. 5 From 1993 to 2010, the national incidence of skin and soft tissue infections related to opioid use doubled (from fewer than four per 100,000 to over nine per 100,000). 6, 7 From a financial perspective, Medicaid costs associated with the opioid epidemic at large are estimated to have quadrupled from two billion to eight billion dollars between 1999 and 2013. 8 manage in the hospital; additionally, the spectrum and severity of these disease processes can be quite broad. Studies show that more than 60% of internal medicine residents feel unprepared to manage substance use disorders (SUDs) broadly despite the fact that people struggling with these disorders make up over one-quarter of the patients they treat. 9 Many internists are also responsible for continued care of these patients in the ambulatory setting, after they leave the hospital. Thus, discussions surrounding risk reduction, screening tests, and tailored immunizations are crucial to promoting health and reducing morbidity/mortality in people who inject drugs (PWID).",

We have drawn on pertinent guidelines from various medical specialties to support the workshop. Some aspects referenced in the workshop but not covered in detail include initiation of medications for OUD, which was discussed at length in a joint module on HIV and addiction, 16 as well as education on taking a thorough and complete SUD history and harm reduction/infection prevention.",

First, although the content was applicable to our residents given the patient population they cared for, it may not be generalizable to other programs with markedly different patient populations or low incidence of PWID. Second, the session was conducted at a single institution. Third, our postworkshop evaluation tool was administered immediately following completion of the workshop and thus was unable to assess for long-term retention or efficacy. Fourth, our outcomes were all knowledge based, not practice based, making it difficult to assess through the lens of patient outcomes.",
