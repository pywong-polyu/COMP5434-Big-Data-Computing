This cross-sectional, surveybased study collected demographic data, mental health measurements, and stress-related questionnaires from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan, from March 23, 2020, to April 6, 2020. The prevalence rates of general psychological distress and event-related distress were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 22item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 26-item stress-related questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes for workers both at high-and low-risk for infection of COVID-19. A questionnaire was distributed to 4133 hospital workers, and 2697 (65.3%) valid questionnaires were used for analyses.",

Since the media continuously emphasized the effects of COVID-19 infection, the public plunged into anxiety and fear. Hospital workers in Yokohama likely experienced huge psychological stress, despite the fact that the COVID-19 infection had not exploded in Japan yet. Wards for COVID-19 and their staff had particularly limited capacity in hospitals in Yokohama. No hospital closures or quarantine of staff was in place at that time.",

The influence of media exposure on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been reported [15] . Those studies have, however, focused on psychological well-being mostly among health care workers directly exposed to infected patients, and they were conducted after the peak of the outbreak. In addition, most studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic used an online survey format, which might reduce the validity of the assessed data. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have investigated hospital workers' mental health status at the beginning of the pandemic or mentioned psychological symptoms experienced by both high-and low-risk workers [16, 17] .",

Participants were asked whether they worked in the department, such as wards for COVID-19 or ER, where they come into direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Those who responded 'Yes' were defined as high-risk workers, and those who answered 'No' were defined as low-risk workers. We calculated total scores for the GHQ-12 using the GHQ scoring method [18] and subsequently divided our hospital workers into two groups, workers 'with' or 'without' general distress. A threshold of 3/4 was used because the mean score of the GHQ-12 was 3.08 [22] .

A Canadian study demonstrated that 29.0% of the hospital workers experienced severe general psychological distress (evaluated by the GHQ-12 with the threshold of 2/3) during the outbreak of SARS [27] . Another study reported that psychiatric morbidity on the IES and the GHQ-28 were 17.7% and 18.8% among the hospital workers, respectively at six months after the peak of the SARS pandemic in Singapore [28] . It seems difficult to make direct comparisons between our findings of the IES and the GHQ and those of previous studies due to the different evaluation times. However, our results revealed the discrepancy between scores of the IES-R and GHQ-12 among the hospital workers at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In our hospital workers, the severity of general distress, i.e., the scores of the GHQ-12, could reflect pre-existing distress due to hard hospital works and newly added distress due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This discrepancy suggests that the hospital workers had already shown general psychological distress before they had actual contact with infected patients, which might be based on their daily hard work, anxiety and fear of ",

A study from Singapore also reported that 31% of the healthcare workers perceived that \"people avoid my family members because of my job\" during the SARS outbreak [30] . Other studies on SARS have also shown that \"Social isolation and avoidance\" [24] , \"Perceived stigma\" [5] , and \"Being discriminated as high-risk spreader\" [31] could be sources of stress. Similar results have been demonstrated in studies of other disasters where 'Discrimination' was a risk factor for worsened post-disaster mental health among workers at Fukushima nuclear power plants [25] and Vietnam War veterans [32] . The previous and current results suggest that 'Feeling of being isolated and discriminated' could adversely affect the mental health of workers at any point during a disaster (e.g., at the beginning of, during, and after the disaster); thus, it is necessary to establish an educational program to prevent discrimination against hospital staffs working under the threats, such as COVID-19 infection.

Previous studies have been reported repeatedly that nurses experience the highest mental distress among all occupations in hospitals during the outbreak of SARS and H1N1 influenza [5, 7, 33] . However, one study revealed higher levels of anxiety among the support staff as opposed to the medical doctors and the nurses [34] , and this research was conducted relatively early during the outbreak of SARS, similar to our current study. We assume that office workers, clinical clerks, and others might have had insufficient protective equipment and information about COVID-19 infection because of their low-risk work environment. Thus, they continued to be scared of the mysterious COVID-19 infection, resulting in high IES-R scores at the beginning of the outbreak. The 'Increase of exposure to TV and internet media' was also associated with increased IES-R scores among the low-risk workers. In general, watching more TV has been generally associated with more severe mental distress, as watching TV before going to bed might disrupt sleep quality and trigger mental dysfunction [35, 36] . In the case of COVID-19, TV and Internet media featured the Diamond Princess and the increasing number of infected people daily; thus, all the hospital workers might have felt increased anxiety and fear of admitting patients with COVID-19 in addition to the infection itself at the beginning of the outbreak [37] . The high-risk workers encountered real patients while the low-risk workers did not; therefore, they had limited access to actual and concrete information, which could have increased their anxiety. Therefore, watching TV programs about the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Diamond Princess could be a risk factor for developing trauma-like responses among the low-risk workers.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations worth noting. First, the response rate in our research was 66.9%, which is relatively good for paper-based, self-administered, anonymous questionnaires. However, response bias may still have been present if the non-respondents were either too stressed to respond or not stressed at all and, therefore, not interested in this survey. Second, this study was unable to distinguish pre-existing mental health symptoms from new symptoms. We are designing a further study that will be conducted after the pandemic in the same hospitals to evaluate longitudinal changes in mental health status in our hospital workers. Third, the validity of the questions assessing COVID-19 related stress has not been adequately established, since they are partly original questions, which is another limitation. Fourth, this study was carried out from March 23 to April 6, and the COVID-19 situation in Japan changed to worse during the subsequent 15 days. Hence, the mental situation might have changed from the beginning to the end of this period. However, we believe that we could evaluate the mental health status of our hospital workers just at the beginning of the pandemic, and we think this report is important in this regard.",

The daily hard work may have contributed to their general distress, which could become the risk factor of event-related distress. We found that isolation and discrimination were independent risk factors for worse mental health outcomes among the hospital workers, regardless of their working risks. Thus, it is necessary to prevent discrimination against hospital staffs from the early stage of the pandemic. Special mental health support for not only high-risk workers but also low-risk workers, especially with increased exposure to TV and Internet media, needed to be promptly implemented from the beginning of the outbreak.",
