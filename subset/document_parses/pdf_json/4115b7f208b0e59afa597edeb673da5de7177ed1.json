Several factors served as the motivation to perform this study, including established variation in the knowledge levels regarding COVID-19, but without an understanding if socioeconomic inequality contributes to this variation. Proper knowledge regarding an epidemic/pandemic is important in the management of any disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess socioeconomic inequality in knowledge regarding COVID-19 in a quantitative manner using concentration indices and concentration curves.",

The questionnaire was originally designed in English and translated into Arabic. The questionnaire was translated then back to English to ensure the meaning of the content. The Arabic text was used to administer the study. The survey was administered online to comply with government restrictions put in place to limit human contact so as to minimize COVID-19 transmission. Participants were provided with a questionnaire administered using modern survey techniques, including use of the SurveyMonkey Inc. (San Mateo, CA, USA) distributed to the respondents via Twitter (San Francisco, CA, USA) and WhatsApp Inc. (Mountain View, CA, USA). Participants were recruited using a simplified snowball sampling technique, where the invited participants were requested to pass on the invitations to their contacts. This online survey approach was feasible owing to the high rate of digital adoption in the KSA (4).",

The age variable was divided into five categories: 18-29 (reference category), 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and \u226560 years. This categorization was used to investigate whether there was any difference in the knowledge related to COVID-19 according to age group. With respect to marital status, individuals were assigned a value of 1 if they reported being married and were assigned a value of 0 for unmarried (including single, widowed, and divorced). Education level was categorized as high school or below (reference category), college/university degree, and postgraduate degree. Employment status was classified as government employee (reference category), non-government employee, retired, self-employed, and unemployed. Monthly income (Saudi Riyal, SR 1 = USD 0.27) was grouped into eight categories: < SR 3,000 (reference category), SR 3,000 to <5,000, SR 5,000 to <7,000, SR 7,000 to <10,000, SR 10,000 to <15,000, SR 15,000 to <20,000, SR 20,000 to < 30,000, and SR 30,000 or more.

With the spread of COVID-19, numerous countries, including Saudi Arabia, declared a state of emergency, instituting stay-at-home orders, closing schools, and suspending flights. Although these unprecedented policies may help to curb the spread of the virus, having better knowledge impacts how people relate to the disease and behave. Indeed, knowledge has been shown to contribute to an individual's health-related decision-making (28) . For instance, in Saudi Arabia, vulnerable groups such as those with a low SES reported lower adoption of preventive measures (29) , which may be partly attributed to lower levels of knowledge about the disease. Previous research on infectious diseases has shown that knowledge and beliefs are significant predictors of the adoption of preventive behaviors (30) (31) (32) . Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19related knowledge among the Saudi population during the early stages of the pandemic. Understanding the extent of COVID-19 knowledge among different SES groups can help to enhance the public health emergency response to infectious diseases. This is necessary given that a society's response to an emergency crisis largely depends on meeting the needs of all population subgroups, especially those who are vulnerable and subject to diversity (28) . In this study, knowledge was evaluated by elucidating participants' knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and knowledge of actions that can be taken to minimize exposure to COVID-19. The results reveal that the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 17.96 (SD = 2.24, range: [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This indicates that most study participants demonstrated good knowledge about COVID-19. This finding is consistent with findings from other studies conducted in the KSA (14, 33) . Nevertheless, inequality in knowledge was observed in this study.",

Knowledge regarding COVID-19 was significantly concentrated among people with higher SES. The significant positive Erreygers concentration index suggests that the richer have a better advantage in terms of knowledge than the poorer. Although these results cannot be directly compared to other studies since this is the first study to use concentration indices to determine inequalities in this regard, the findings closely mimic some related research from Saudi Arabia (10, 14, 15) , showing a positive relationship between COVID-19 knowledge and income. Moreover, our findings of high-income earners having more knowledge regarding COVID-19 than low-income earners is in line with other studies conducted in the USA (34), Northern Thailand (35) , and Ethiopia (36) . Inequality in COVID-19related knowledge between low-and high-income groups might be due to greater amounts of exposure to misinformation for the former group with greater access to reliable sources of information for the latter group (37) .",

            "text": "This study also showed that another SES factor, level of educational attainment, is strongly associated with inequalities in knowledge about COVID-19, which was consistent with an earlier study (38) . The results of this study showed that proper knowledge about COVID-19 is concentrated among highly educated individuals. In previous studies, level of education was identified as an important predictor of knowledge for other communicable diseases such as influenza H1N1 (28) . Taken together, these findings suggest that an increased level of educational attainment can enhance an individual's readiness to receive and process complex information, even under uncertain conditions that might complicate the message (28) . The association between level of education and knowledge about COVID-19 found in this study indicates that in the early stages of the pandemic, communication strategies about the virus did not reach those with lower educational attainment. Although this may have changed later on, these data suggest that public health authorities should consider differences among population subgroups when developing and designing public communication strategies. Tools and strategies testing their effectiveness and evaluating their impact on the population should also be developed. Moreover, regional inequalities were also found. The incomebased concentration indices and education-based concentration indices were positive and significant for some regions. This indicates inequality related COVID-19 across regions. For example, the income-based concentration indices were positive and significant for Aseer, Haiel, Riyadh and the Western Region. This indicates that residents of Haiel, Riyadh and the Western Region had more knowledge than those of other regions in the country. Although the reason behind this regional variability is unclear, differences in knowledge between different regions in the country can be attributed to the average income between regions. Moreover, this may be due to variation in the circumstances surrounding the opportunities brought about by the respective provincial economies. After decomposition, of the Erreygers index, we found that a large share of the inequality is explained by the income inequality. Not only that, age, also played a significant role, in addition to the education related inequalities. All these put together may be assumed to affect inequality and incomes probably being the transmission route through which they are playing. Since these factors always reinforce each other, they may indeed push the inequality through some sort of a vicious circle. However, despite these being the major factors, it doesn't rule out the impact of the other factors, although they are somehow smaller in terms of the contribution.",

The construction of our dependent variable is based on a well-known study (10) but is also different from the variables used in other studies (39, 40) . Therefore, the difference in the type of measure used may have an impact on assessing the inequality for the variable. Moreover, the nature of our analysis does not permit making inferences related to causality. Endogeneity may be present because the variable of interest is constructed from recall, which may suffer from reporting bias. We could not find an appropriate instrument variable from the data that could appropriately deal with the potential endogeneity issue. Because of the highlighted shortfalls, the implication for future research is that using quasi-experimental identification methods such as instrumental variable matching or synthetic cohort analysis (41, 42) may be better to control for reverse causality. Furthermore, it may also be important to use different measures of the knowledge score that would enable comparisons of the outcome. Lastly, our study did not use a complex sample survey that appropriately stratifies the KSA population. In the absence of a complex sample survey this result may only apply to the sample collected.",
