Different policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus could affect anxiety in various ways. We built an ad hoc web-based survey, administered to the student population of three Italian universities at the beginning of the pandemic and at one year's distance, to collect information on retrospective and current anxiety levels and the underlining reasons. The survey also included questions concerning sociodemographic, economic, labor, lifestyle, academic career, and on-line teaching features, which prevents students from identifying the main survey topic to be anxiety. This research aims at assessing the change in anxiety levels between the analyzed periods and the main determinants of such change, focusing on students' economic expectancies. Results from a Poisson regression model show that anxiety has increased compared to both the pre-pandemic level and the one quantified during the first lockdown. This increase is revealed to be mostly driven by economic and career-related uncertainties, rather than by job loss and proximity to COVID-19. Thus, policymakers should take action to provide certainties both in terms of economic prospects and reopening strategies, especially to avoid that the resulting increase in anxiety translates into an amplified suicide risk.",

Economic anxiety particularly affects young adults and women, which constitute the highest-risk categories in this respect (Fetzer et al., 2021) . Daniele et al.

This result, referred to young age, is confirmed by studies specifically performed in Italy (Busetta et al., 2021; Mazza et al., 2020) and it is most probably associated with the greater access of young individuals to information and news through social media, which could induce an increase in their stress level.",

Involving an appropriate control group is quite complicated to do because most of the lockdowns took place at a national level at the same time (Prati and Mancini, 2021) . As stated by Meda and Slongo (2020) , it is dangerous to infer conclusions on the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-sectional data which are not supported by a control group. A longitudinal analysis is the other possibility to solve this problem, as it can provide a baseline of pre-pandemic data that allows assessing whether the increase in anxiety is strictly COVID-19-related. However, such a procedure is difficult to perform due to the limited time passed since the onset of the pandemic. In this respect, following the main literature (see Prati and Mancini, 1 3 2021 for a review), \"longitudinal studies that examine within-person change before and after lockdowns provide important information on the psychological impact of lockdowns\". Rogers et al. (2020) found a small but significant effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on mental health, most probably because they were not able to consider the effects of long enough pandemic lockdown policies, as we instead do. In particular, the idea is that lockdowns impact selectively and modestly on mental health with no effects on the positive functioning of individuals (Keyes, 2005) .",

The COVID-19-related non-pharmaceutical interventions have impacted on the already existing socio-economic inequalities (Davillas and Jones, 2021; Perugini and Vladisavljevic, 2021) . Indeed, some jobs are more flexible than others as regards the possibility to be performed remotely: those requiring lower skills or education are usually the most affected by the closures and, thus, vulnerable economic groups such as females (Alon et al., 2020) and young people (Brunori et al., 2021) will be ones suffering the most by the economic risks brought about by COVID-19 and, in particular, the most exposed to the prospect of unemployment. Furthermore, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020), studying the situation in the USA, find that older and more stable workers perceive a lower likelihood of losing their jobs.",

All these results are confirmed by a study conducted in Rome and performed on individuals aged 18 years and over living in Italy (Mazza et al., 2020) . This specific study shows, in particular, that a greater share of people is currently affected by high levels of anxiety, compared to the pre-pandemic average measured by European epidemiological statistics (Jacobi et al., 2014; Wittchen et al., 2011) . This increase in anxiety level is in line with the main literature (see Brooks et al. , 2020 for a review) and could be interpreted as COVID-19-related. Moreover, the medical history of mental health problems influences more pronounced levels of anxiety (Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . This result is motivated by the higher probability of re-emergence of past symptoms of psychological distress during periods of uncertainty such as pandemic outbreaks. Moreover, individuals affected by medical problems could perceive their health to be poor and potentially more exposed to new possibilities of contagion. The dependence of anxiety levels from individuals' mental health history is one of the reasons why we decided to use a psychological anxiety test, which returns both a stable pre-pandemic measure of anxiety and a temporary measure referred to the current moment. Indeed, anxiety can be distinguished into the one connected to a personal trait and the one representing an emotional state (Cattell, 1966) . The STAI-Y (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) test (Spielberger, 1983) , included in the survey, is a self-report test that provides two measures of anxiety: the State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety), which evaluates the current state of anxiety with items referring to how the people feel \"right now\"; and the Trait Anxiety Scale (T-Anxiety), which refers to a stable measure of anxiety.",

As the outcome variable is bounded above and below and its distribution is skewed to the left (see Fig. 1 ), it ought not to be modeled by means of a Normal-based regression model. Indeed, a logarithmic regression would be suitable for such a distribution. Therefore, we decided to regress a Poisson model, which provides better results than log-linear regressions (Wooldridge, 2010) . A property of the Poisson regression model is that the mean and the variance must be equal. However, our data are over-dispersed (i.e., the variance is greater than the mean). To avoid modeling issues, we used the robust estimator of variance (Sandwich linearized estimator): in so doing, we obtain robust standard errors for the parameter estimates to control for mild violation of underlying assumptions (Cameron and Trivedi, 2009) .",

            "text": "Our results show that anxiety has hugely worsened since the beginning of the pandemic and during the course of it, especially for women. State anxiety underwent a higher increase for individuals who were already characterized by a high level of state anxiety at the beginning of the pandemic and who originally had a high level of trait anxiety. This result is particularly dangerous because high levels of anxiety are usually associated with social isolation and loneliness, which, in turn, are connected with increased suicide risk (e.g., Calati et al., 2019 , Van Orden et al., 2010 . In support of the harmfulness of this element, French President Emmanuel Macron declared, on April 14th, 2021: \"We are seeing the rise of something that we did not experience during the first confinement, an anxiety and 1 3 anguish among the youngest people, which is reflected in the figures\" 1 . For such a reason, he promised free psychological counseling during the COVID-19 crisis for children aged between 3 and 17. Our results, as the chosen universities are located in the three Italian macroareas (South, Center, and North), confirm the need to extend such policy measure to Italian university students, even by making use of distance tools such as telemedicine (Drago et al., 2021; Romani et al., 2021) . Moreover, particular attention must be paid to the most vulnerable categories, e.g., by providing gender-specific health-care policies (Gatto et al., 2022; Koch and Park, 2022) . In particular, we believe that policymakers should act in order to avoid the resulting increase in anxiety to translate into an amplified suicide risk, as predicted by the literature (Reger et al., 2020, Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004) .",
