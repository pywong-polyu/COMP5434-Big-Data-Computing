Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agentbased simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that microsimulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings.",

As a disease, it is particularly threatening to patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on intermittent hemodialysis and their care providers. Full compliance with mitigation strategies for reducing infection spread, such as physical distancing and avoidance of highdensity areas including healthcare facilities is usually not feasible. Patients with ESKD who receive in-centre hemodialysis, face unique challenges. They are obligated to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific seating and tended to by dialysis nurses at close proximity. Dialysis patients are already at higher risk of experiencing more severe manifestations of disease due to their poor functional immune status and their increased burden of co-morbidities [1] . Furthermore, ESKD patients who have not been tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 are not able to effectively quarantine and must travel to the hospital for their regular treatments, often using public transportation [2] , hence increasing the risk of viral spread to the population at large, and more specifically to the dialysis unit staff. Not surprisingly, the first COVID-19 associated death in the United States was a hemodialysis patient at the Northwest Kidney Center in the State of Washington [3] .",

MHD patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications because they tend to be older and have multiple comorbidities including hypertension and suppressed immune systems [5] . Hemodialysis patients attend dialysis facilities several times a week each time spending between 3 to 5 hours for their treatment [6] . Home-based dialysis has a clear advantage during a pandemic as patients do not need to travel and maintain physical distancing. The need for frequent trips to dialysis units and unavoidable patient clustering during dialysis shifts, further increase the risk of viral transmission [7] . Transportation to dialysis centres may require interactions with transportation personnel and other passengers in the public transit systems. In addition, MHD unit daily operations incorporate several patient-to-patient and patient-to-caregiver operations that increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This is because synchronous schedules of dialysis that have patients entering and exiting the department at the same time, as well as close contacts with healthcare workers that have a similar type of interaction with other patients. Moreover, because of the unique characteristics of MHD patients and MHD units, it is more difficult to prevent and control infectious diseases in these settings compared to imposing control measure for the general population and in other settings [8] .",

The probability of virus transmission is a function of the number of contacts, average contact duration, and the distance of the subject with the substance [26] . To model disease spread, we recorded agent movements and created contact matrices that includes this information. The contact matrix is one of the mathematical components used for disease modelling among different groups of individuals in an environment. This matrix meets the reciprocity of contacts which makes the contacts rate matrix symmetric [4] . To obtain such a matrix for our case study (the dialysis unit), we simulated the real setting of the dialysis centre and its workflow processes. Agent movements was simulated using the Pedestrian library in AnyLogic \u00ae software. Agents moved according to predefined physical rules for the simulation. They interacted with the surrounding objects, including other agents, walls, and escalators, and avoided potential collisions. The user of the model (hereafter: user) can assign individual properties, preferences, and states to these agents -here, pedestrian agents. Using the pedestrian model, we simulated the movements of staff and patients based on their schedules and workflows. Using this simulation, we found the number of contacts and the duration in which the agents were in proximity. These values are presented as contacts matrices, that can be applied to disease transmission models. In general, we can define active or inactive agents in AnyLogic \u00ae agent-based simulation platform. Active agents (i.e., human agents) in our case are the staff and patients, and inactive agents are dialysis machines, beds/chairs, and furniture in the department (Fig. 2) .

The agents of a certain shift start to attend the centre at the start of their shift. Staff find their shift assignment (number of dialysis stations that should be served during the shift) and go to their locker room based on their gender then going to the nearest station to their assignments. At this location, agents check to find if their assigned station(s) need their service or not. This check is regulated by a virtual event manager every one second. The chain of steps for a dialysis station is: 1) cleaning by a housekeeper; 2) preparing the machine by an assistant; 3) getting a patient; 4) connecting the machine to the patient by a nurse; 5) multiple checkups of the patient by the assigned nurse during the service; and 6) disconnecting the machine from the patient by the nurse, after the treatment is over. Physicians (MRPs) randomly visit patients that need advice. Patients come to the lobby, lineup, get screened at the reception and wait for a message from an assistant declaring that the dialysis station is ready. When patients reach their assigned station, they stay there until the end of the treatment. Once the treatment is over, the patients return to the lobby and wait for a short time and then and leave the environment. There is a breaktime for the staff during their shift, during which the staff who wait in the centre with no assignment leave the area and go to the breakroom for a maximum of 40 minutes. These processes repeat during a workday to serve all incoming patients. Table  IV shows the used parameters in the model. Table III . Weekly Schedule of healthcare providers and patients Table IV . Parameters used in the agent-based simulation By using the Pedestrian library for the active agents in this model, the movement of the patients and staff and their proximity is simulated during each shift in the dialysis centre. We directly calculated close contacts between all people in the centre as well as the time-length of the contacts. In the dialysis model, in total, 486 active agents and 58 inactive agents were defined. Due to the weekly cyclic and random schedule of the active agents, every agent had the probability of contacts with the 485 active agents in the same or different categories. For example, a nurse could come to close contacts with 109 .

We used a modified version of the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) disease transmission model in this study.

Once an individual is infected and arrives in the hospital, it starts contaminating others based on the estimated contact rates that s/he has with other individuals and the probability of infections. These values vary depending on the type of person. If positive disease status is known, the person will be isolated, and the isolated individuals will no longer able to transmit the virus.

In the base model (i.e., normal schedule scenario), all workflow steps in Fig. 3 are done, while in the second scenario, break and gathering in the break room is omitted. Repeating the scenario runs or running the model for a longer time did not change the contacts parameters significantly. Fig. 6 illustrates the duration of close contacts between agents in the same or different categories in terms of cumulative hourly (sum of 3600 seconds) and daily (sum of 24 hours) time series. As can be seen in Fig. 6 , between the time 13:00 and 18:00, as well as between 21:00 and 23:00 every day, when the schedules of staff form different shifts overlap, the time and number of contacts between agents increases. At other times, the hourly parameters of contacts remain slightly constant. At the nocturnal shift, the contacts are reduced due to the limited capacity of overnight patient admission to one unit of the department. At this time, the number of patients, nurses, and assistants is almost cut in half, but it is assumed that the number of clerks remain the same. The hourly length of contacts between clerks and the reduced number of contacts between other categories are well captured by the model. Comparing the assistant-to-assistant contacts and assistant-to-clerk contacts (Fig. 6b) highlights the effect of break time in the connection parameters. If no gathering happens during the break times (13:00 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00, and 00:00 and 1:00), the number of contacts between different categories of staff are reduced. However, if agents do not leave their stations during the break time, the overall contacts between the agents of the same categories or the same station are increased in this time window. Fig. 7 presents the time series of the hourly and daily cumulative time and numbers of connections during a oneweek simulation. Daily charting start from Monday at 7:00 AM, and day 7 of the model simulation represents Sunday, when the unit is closed. As expected, the hourly contact parameters have fluctuations during the day and days of a week due to the randomness of both the staff work and patient treatment schedules. However, the daily averages of the contact parameters have fewer fluctuations. We can calculate matrices of the average time of contact and number of contacts between all agent categories in any desired time span. We call this matrix micro-scale contacts matrix (MSCM) which can be calculated in every arbitrary time span. Assuming the daily values of contact parameters affect disease transmission, we use the daily contact matrix in our transmission model. Table VI summarizes the contact parameter in the normal schedule and without break condition. These contact matrices are symmetric, as expected [4] . As explained above in the methods section, the contact parameters of the same category staff are generally increased when the break is omitted from the workflow. ",

So, they have less probability of infection in the dialysis unit. They also work in different shifts and their connection together rarely happens. Therefore, all physicians are less likely to get infected, and if they are infected but are asymptomatic, their disease affects few individuals, and remains limited to their assigned dialysis unit. The existence of an asymptomatic clerk, housekeeper, assistant, or nurse creates a condition that over 50 percent of staff in the unit would get infected. The time of reaching the maximum number of exposed people is shorter in this scenario. An asymptomatic nurse or assistant brings the riskiest condition of disease spread in the dialysis unit. The time of reaching the maximum number of exposed people is shorter in this case. Comparing the columns Pat.Tes. and Pat. in Table VII shows that random weekly testing of about 0.5% of all individuals can reduce all exposed individuals by 2%. Examining this scenario with more random testing showed that random testing can reduce disease transmission that is in conformance with other studies [34] . It reduces the daily infection rates. Staff in dialysis units are also very more vulnerable. Our results show that asymptomatic staff poses more risk than an asymptomatic patient. These results suggest that testing and disease transmission prevention measures for staff can be even more important and effective than for the patients. Results of the second scenario (no gathering during the breaks) are presented in Table VII. According to these results, if an asymptomatic nurse enters the dialysis unit (column Nur.NoBr.), the number of exposed individuals who are working with the nurse does not increase significantly. However, the results are different for clerks. In the no-break condition, clerks do not go to the break or lounge room, thus they do not experience close contact with other staff. In the case of an asymptomatic patient in the nobreak condition, the number of exposed individuals does not significantly vary. This scenario confirms the importance of measures that reduce disease transmission between staff once more. Table VII .

This is used as an operational definition for contact investigation due to the limited available data. Other parameters such as the type of symptoms of infected individuals and environmental factors (crowding, adequacy of ventilation, whether exposure was indoors or outdoors) can affect these values. In general, in a large population, there is no way or method to define the average number of individuals and infected individual meetings [36] . Sensitivity analysis and calibration of the mathematical models based on the real data are used to define these parameters for large populations. For example, Zeng, Guo, Deng, Luo and Zhang [36] calculated the average number of contacts per exposed individual per day of 20 and 24 for these locations Hubei Province and Outside Hubei Province of China. Also, statistical analysis for closed environments can estimate the contact rate between the individuals. The contact rate among the people who are working or receiving treatments in a hospital varies depending on the type of work and hospitalization. Baek, Lee, Cho, Hyun, Kim, Sohn, Kim, Ahn, Jeong, Ku, Yeom, Lee and Choi [4] used the value of contact duration of about 5 hours for the hospital wards and less than 0.5 hours for the outpatient department and emergency room for physicians, nurses, and other caregivers. Patients and caregivers in the hospital wards have the longest contact time. The contacts between the same category of agents has been assumed to be higher than the other probable contacts. Using the agentbased simulation, we calculated the time series of the number of contacts and time-length that people spend together in the dialysis unit (Table VI) . The simulation showed that individuals who have the same station or are in the same category, have the maximum rate of contact and spend more time together. The contact parameters vary during a day and increase when the schedule of staff is overlapped. Staff who are working in the same station are spending more than 15 minutes during a working shift and based on the CDC [35] definition, they will probably be exposed if one of them is infected.",

As our contacts matrices have been developed based on one dialysis unit with a specific workflow, more simulation of this type in other units need to be developed to examine if the same contacts patterns exist. Having said that our disease transmission model allows for new contacts matrices to be used. Moreover, the contacts matrices generated in this study need to be validated against some real measurements which requires field observations and measurements that were not possible under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic conditions.

Using this time series of contact we can minimize or optimize the workflow of the agents to have the lowest probability of the disease spread in hospitals. It is recommended that new studies on disease transmission consider these variations in contact parameters to find more realistic transmission parameters. The presented results here are based on some sample experiments which need to be expanded to include more variations of parameter values and virus protection measures. The current model does not capture all the complexity of interactions that are affecting disease transmission. During the pandemic, the UHN dialysis unit guidelines for preventing infection have changed several times based on emerging evidence and fortunately, the actual infection rates were low. The contact matrices generated by our simulation provide reasonable results when entered in the disease transmission model. We aim to continue further assessment and validate our model, to use it for policy and scenario analyses in the future. This study provides promising results for using agent-based simulation at a micro-scale to develop various contact matrices that can be used for detailed disease modelling and investigation of various mitigation measures. However, more studies like this and cross-validations are needed.",
