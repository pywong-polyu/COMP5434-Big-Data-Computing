Here we show that the decrease in global fossil CO 2 emissions during the first quarter of 2020 was of 5.8% (542 Mt CO 2 with a 20% 1-\u03c3 uncertainty). Unlike other emerging estimates 1 , ours show the temporal dynamics of emissions based on actual emissions data from power generation (for 29 countries) and industry (for 73 countries), on near real time activity data for road transportation (for 132 countries), aviation and maritime transportation, and on heating degree days for commercial and residential sectors emissions (for 206 countries). These dynamic estimates cover all of the human induced CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. The largest share of COVID-related decreases in emissions are due to decreases in industry (157.9 Mt CO 2 , -7.1% compared to 2019), followed by road transportation (145.7 Mt CO 2 , -8.3%), power generation (131.6 Mt CO 2 , -3.8%), residential (47.8 Mt CO 2 , -3.6%), fishing and maritime transport (35.5Mt CO 2 , -13.3%) and aviation (33.4 Mt CO 2 , -8.0%). Regionally, decreases in emissions from China were the largest and earliest (-10.3%), followed by Europe (EU-27 & UK) (-4.3%) and the U.S. (-4.2%). Relative decreases of regional CO 2 emissions are consistent with regional nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based networks. Despite the unprecedented decreases in CO 2 emissions and comparable decreases in economic activities, we monitored decreases in the carbon intensity (Emission per unit of GDP) in China (3.5%), the U.S. (4.5%) and Europe (5.4%) over the first quarter, suggesting that carbon-intensive activities have been disproportionally impacted.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) 27 published that CO 2 emissions of commercial aviation from international passenger movements totaled 444 Mt in 2018 and implied annual compound growth rate of total emissions from commercial flights, 5.7%, during the past five years from 2013 to 2018 1 . Sub-national CO 2 emissions from international passenger operations based on the location of flights departing airports are provided by ICCT 28 . It is known that total CO 2 emissions from all commercial operations include passenger movement, belly freight, and dedicated freight. ICCT published that passenger transport accounted for 81% of total emissions in 2018, so we use this proportion to estimate the international aviation emissions from commercial flights in 2018. Due to the lack of emissions data after 2018, we used a compound growth rate of commercial aviation emissions, 5.7%, to estimate the international aviation emissions from commercial flights in 2019. Based on the assumption that the number of international commercial flights and the number of total commercial flights including domestic and international flights have the same distribution over time, we collect the number of domestic commercial flights for each week in the first quarter in 2019 and the same week in 2020 from aviation worldwide Limited-OAG (https://www.oag.com/about-oag) to estimate international aviation emissions from commercial flights for each week during this period. Daily tracking statistics about commercial flights and total flights in 2020 are provided by Flightradar24 (https://www.flightradar24.com/51.5,-0.12/8), to estimate all aviation emissions in the first quarter in 2020. As processing such data will require some time, we mix different sources of information to gain a more rapid knowledge into the time evolution of CO2 emissions. For this we use daily statistics from AirNav/RadarBox published daily on their website (2019 and 2020). As these statistics are expressed as number of daily flights grouped by destinations, they are not sufficient to assess CO2 emissions and need to be combined with previous CO2 emission inventories for commercial aviation. Specifically we use the B1 2025 QUANTIFY emission inventory at monthly and 1\u00b0x1\u00b0 resolution 28 26 for year 2018. This includes all commercial traffic (passenger and freight). We take this distribution to be also representative of year 2019. We then define 12 main regions of air traffic upon which we project the AirNav/RadarBox categories. For instance, the US box corresponds to a mix of the \"US <-> US\" and \"US <-> NON US\" categories; the North Atlantic flight corridor corresponds to the \"US <-> Europe\" category, etc. This mapping and the weight attributed to the different categories are somewhat arbitrary but this has limited impact on the results as all categories of traffic decrease sharply albeit with somewhat different timing.

For each country, the residential emissions were split into two parts, i.e., cooking emissions and heating emissions, according to the EDGAR guidelines.
