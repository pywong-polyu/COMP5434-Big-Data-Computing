In the mitigation stage, the questions are focused on non-prophylactic interventions, such as school and work place closures and other social-distancing strategies, determining the demand for healthcare resources. In the suppression stage, the focus shifts to using prophylactic interventions, combined with better testing and tracing. These phases are not linear and overlap with each other. For instance, the acceleration and mitigation stages of the pandemic might overlap spatially, temporally as well as within certain social groups. Different kinds of models are appropriate at different stages, and for addressing different kinds of questions. For instance, statistical and machine learning models are very useful in forecasting and short-term projections. However, they are not very effective for longer term projections, understanding the effects of different kinds of interventions, and counter-factual analysis. Mechanistic models are very useful for such questions. Simple compartmental-type models, and their extensions, namely, structured metapopulation models, are useful for several population-level questions. However, once the outbreak has spread, and complex individual-and community-level behaviors are at play, multi-agent models are most effective, since they allow for a more systematic representation of complex social interactions, individual and collective behavioral adaptation, and public policies.",

These six stages span investigation, recognition, and initiation in the early phase, followed by most of the disease spread occurring during the acceleration and deceleration stages. They also provide indicators for identifying when the pandemic has progressed from one stage to the next 21 . As envisioned, risk evaluation [i.e., using tools like Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) and Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework (PSAF)] and early case identification characterize the first three stages, while non-pharmaceutical 1 3 J.

A similar framework is laid out in WHO's pandemic continuum 2 and phases of pandemic alert 3 .

The most common source of such information is the airline network datasets, from sources such as IATA, OAG, and OpenFlights; Marie Isabelle et al. 30 provides a systematic review of how airline passenger data have been used for infectious disease modeling. These datasets could either capture static measures such as number of seats available or flight schedules, or a dynamic count of passengers per month along each itinerary. Since the latter has intrinsic delays in collection and reporting, for an ongoing pandemic, they may not be representative. During such times, data on ongoing travel restrictions 31 become important to incorporate. Multi-modal traffic will also be important to incorporate for countries that share land borders or have heavy maritime traffic. For diseases such as Zika, where establishment risk is more relevant, data on vector abundance or prevailing weather conditions are appropriate.",

Global metapopulation models (GLEaM) that combine SEIR type dynamics with an airline network have also been used in the past for estimating importation risk. Brockmann and Helbing 32 used a similar framework to quantify effective distance on the network which seemed to be well correlated with time of arrival for multiple pandemics in the past; this has been extended to COVID-19 8, 33 . In Ref. 34 , the authors employ air travel volume obtained through IATA from ten major cities across China to rank various countries along with the IDVI to convey their vulnerability. Wu et al. 35 consider the task of forecasting international and domestic spread of COVID-19 and employ Official Airline Group (OAG) data for determining air traffic to various countries, and De Salazae et al. 36 fit a generalized linear model for observed number of cases in various countries as a function of air traffic volume obtained from OAG data to determine countries with potential risk of under-detection.

While such methods perform reasonably for short-term targets, mechanistic approaches as described earlier can provide better long-term projections.

Different kinds of behaviors relevant to such interventions, including compliance with using PPEs and compliance to social distancing guidelines, need to be incorporated into these models. Since there is a great deal of heterogeneity in such behaviors, it is conceptually easiest to incorporate them into agent-based models, since individual agents are represented. However, calibration, simulation, and analysis of such models pose significant computational challenges. On the other hand, the simulation of metapopulation models is much easier, but such behaviors cannot be directly represented-instead, modelers have to estimate the effect of different behaviors on the disease model parameters, which can pose modeling challenges.",
