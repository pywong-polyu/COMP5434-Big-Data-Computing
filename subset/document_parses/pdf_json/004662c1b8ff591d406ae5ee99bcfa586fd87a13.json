            "text": "This article draws on the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein's 'paranoid-schizoid position' to discuss some exemplary social media posts about the coronavirus. I argue that posts often express experiences, thoughts, and fantasies in a schematic manner. They reproduce a paranoid-schizoid logic by which particular views on the current crisis are articulated and different ones are negated. The Kleinian framework is supplemented with Lacan's notion of the Discourse of the Hysteric. I argue that the examples discussed in this article are instances of hysteric modes of relating to an Other (e.g. the expert) that is allegedly withholding important information from the subject. Splitting is amplified by the technological functioning of social media themselves which split users along a paranoidschizoid dynamic for purposes of surveillance, advertising and profit maximization. I conclude by outlining steps towards the Kleinian 'depressive position' both in relation to how we engage with COVID-19 and social media. The depressive position acknowledges both good and bad aspects of a given situation. I further show how it can be supplemented via the Lacanian Discourse of the Analyst which includes a commitment to the limits of knowledge, certainty, and prediction.",

            "text": "Like many other topics talked about on the internet today the novel coronavirus has been picked up by users who discuss it on social media. The coronavirus pandemic also quickly became an infodemic. Many of those social media discussions include the spreading of exaggerated claims, fake news, and conspiracy theories in relation to COVID-19 (Zarocostas 2020 ). An epidemic of misinformation, inaccuracies, and panic. It is not just fake news, but the sheer amount of information that we are provided with on a daily, minute-by-minute basis on newspaper websites and social media is staggering. It might be harmful and beneficial for us at the same time. Users post, share, and like constantly, and unsurprisingly, all we seem to talk about is the virus. In fact, talking about anything else seems strange, inappropriate, or out of touch. This was particularly the case as the first wave of Covid hit many parts of the world in the spring of 2020. At the time of writing this article, many countries are in the midst of a second wave and the virus has continued to dominate subjects' lives. Reflecting about our times of a global health crisis, it struck me what we post on social media and that our posts not only reveal something fundamental about our psyches (are we calm, scared, in denial, disavowing reality, blaming someone, or hopeful) but about social media themselves. Some have said that the coronavirus has brought out the best in many of us online and that social media are now truly social: we talk to each other, post encouraging messages, send hope, but also give each other strength in times of catastrophe and death everywhere. At the same time, there is so much uncertainty and the unknown: When will this be over? What will the world look like afterwards? In her reflections on the pandemic, the psychoanalyst Jill Gentile (2020) has argued that even before Covid, we were living in strange times, times that were marked by rising right-wing populism and an unfolding climate emergency. Two apparent fundamental pillars of (Western) civilization-democracy and nature itself-had been taken for granted by many and were starting to crumble. As Gentile points out, this act of taking our world and its wider social structures for granted may in itself have been an act of fantasy. In the light of climate change, the election of Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in the UK, such a fantasy of stability and harmony, could no longer be sustained. 'In short, for many of us, reliable psychic defenses against knowing too much, or too well, have grown increasingly feeble. Life is getting weirder, less coherent, more disturbing.' (Gentile 2020, p. 651) . Then came Covid. For many, life was getting even more feeble.",

Covid constitutes a universal intervention of the Real that 'affords us an opportunity to experience a longdeferred breakdown that makes it possible in the now shared space to experience what has not yet been experienced.' (Gentile 2020, p. 657) . Covid may afford us a potential to share a universal traumatic core, but individuals may have already encountered the Real in different forms that to them is similar or worse than the Real of Covid.

We feel, as Sherry Turkle diagnosed about our contemporary technoculture some time ago, truly alone together in such times (Turkle 2011) . In her 2011 book, Turkle argued, based on many interviews with teenagers and young people, that they had become dependent on technology in order to be in constant contact with the world and their peers. Technology facilitates a sense of connection for many, while at the same time they feel alienated, isolated, and lonely. Many people are not only anxious about being alone, but also about how to present themselves online so that they seem most likeable and desirable by others. Balick (2014) , Singh (2019) and Johanssen (2019) have similarly argued that social media are so attractive because they offer relational opportunities for connection and recognition of the individual subject. Such themes have also been explored by clinicians from different perspectives (Russell 2015; Lemma 2017) . The positive sense of coming together via technology is surely present in our current times. However, there are also distances, division, or separation that seem to have come upon us. Kleinian object-relations and Lacanian psychoanalysis can help us analyse them from a conceptual perspective.",

I do not mean to negate the kinds of posts that I am describing, but to offer a particular form of (hesitant) critique and how we may move beyond them. For Klein, the paranoid-schizoid position refers to a universal developmental stage in the infant's life. According to her, children from birth up to 3 to 6 months of age split the world and themselves into binaries, most fundamentally into a binary of bad and good. In this stage of development, splitting is necessary because it protects the good parts (or objects) from the bad. The main anxiety the infant feels is paranoia. Life itself feels under threat. Everything that is disliked is experienced as persecutory. The paranoid-schizoid position also means that everything good is idealized and regarded with love and affection.",

For Klein, the paranoid-schizoid position is a defence mechanism against an existential feeling of threat that the infant may face but also against experiences of early frustration, anxiety, or trauma. It is used as an unconscious way to make sense of the world and may often persist, or momentarily re-emerge, in adult life. 'Paranoid-schizoid mechanisms and relationships may be used in any situation where life and death anxieties abound.' (Segal 2004, p. 35) . Klein believed that all infants go through the paranoid-schizoid position and have an unconscious fear of death from the moment they are born (Allen and Ruti 2019, p. 2). While the paranoid-schizoid position may be momentary, the infant introjects both good and bad elements (Klein discusses this in relation to what she calls the 'good' and 'bad' breast of the mother which the infant comes to experience as either nurturing or destructive).",

They also expressed themselves in discussions of the breaking of lockdown rules by the UK PM's adviser Dominic Cummings. Many British people felt that double standards existed and those in power could get away with breaking the rules or were exempt from them altogether. 'In general, the anxieties in the paranoid-schizoid position are life and death anxieties: you or me; my life or yours.' (Segal 2004, p. 36) . Such anxieties also express themselves in panic buying and stockpiling of toilet paper and other 'essential' goods. Many individuals seem to have become (or always were) egotistical, only thinking about themselves or their families. Some have argued that the state itself has become paranoid and works with a worst-case scenario in order to be fully prepared. Such a form of institutionalized, paranoid anxiety, which is both embodied by the state and many citizens, is probably necessary to some degree, but it similarly operates with a binary vision that only sees an escalating crisis. At the same time, the state can never be fully prepared for a health crisis that is still partially unknowable. It has also been fundamentally unprepared, as the USA and UK show for example, where decades of neoliberalism have wrecked healthcare systems (Giroux 2017) . The virus has exposed a fundamental vulnerability of many who are dependent on governments to make decisions that could determine the life or death of people.",

For Lacan, the subject is always already split. They are born into the Symbolic realm (which we could roughly define as the socio-discursive sphere the subject enters into as they are born) and their whole existence is subsequently marked by a split or rupture. There is always some residual, or originary, part of the subject that cannot be completely assimilated into or by the Symbolic and by the subject themselves. This ontological lack or split always remains at the heart of the subject. This split is also partly constituted by the infant's initial inability to completely control their own body. 'This is why the infant depends on its caretakers to tend to its bodily needs. But this doesn't mean that the child is fused with its mother.' (Allen and Ruti 2019, p. 46), as Mari Ruti points out. For both Lacan and Klein, life is experienced as disorderly and threatening from the beginning-and yet symbolically mediated through the social realm. Additionally, Lacan constructs a view of the subject as always being intersubjectively related to the Other: an abstract fantasy figure shaped by actual other people whom the subject relates to. In that sense, the subject is additionally split between themselves and the Other, constantly trying to close the gap between the two and striving for a harmonious sense of completion or unity with the Other that does not exist (Lacan 1971-72) .",

A Discourse structures subjects' knowledge production, fantasies, and speech. It is beyond the scope of this article, to outline Lacan's theory of the Discourses in more detail. I focus on the Discourse of the Hysteric as it is most applicable to the subject matter at hand. When subjects occupy the position of the Hysteric's Discourse, they are not necessarily pathological or clinically unstable. 'Importantly, the fundamental Lacanian assumption is that every social bond is driven by unconscious force, a repressed \"truth\" that determines how the subject copes with its dividedness.' (Jacobsen 2020, p. 50) . This repressed truth, in the context of the Hysteric's Discourse, animates (unconscious) desire to constantly shift from one object to the next. It is animated by anxiety in relation to what the Other hides or obfuscates from the subject and a constant demand by the subject for the Other to reveal everything (Lacan 2007 ).

Doubt and paranoia become a means of survival for systematically oppressed people or communities, e.g. queers or people of colour, as thinkers such as Eve Sedgewick (2003), who drew on Klein, have argued, because they simply cannot trust the state, the police, or other institutions. Lacan functions as an important addition to Kleinian thinking here, because he reminds us that the subject is always already split and somewhat paranoid when being situated in particular social relations (Allen and Ruti 2019). The hysteric expressions of the paranoidschizoid position on social media which I discuss in the next section are thus neither completely caused or triggered by Covid, nor are they specifically excessive or novel. As they are situated in existing social relations in many parts of the world that preceded Covid: systemic racism, economic exploitation, surveillance, and climate crises, to name but a few (Gentile 2020 ). Yet, there is something about them that is worthy of further reflection.",

Such posts were particularly visible during the peak of the first wave in the UK and other countries. They have reappeared in my timelines and feeds as the second wave started to take hold in the late autumn of 2020. The post discussed here speaks like a Cassandrian prophecy that could be true, might become true, or might be exaggerated. Who knows? All that matters for the individual user who posts is the momentary scale of apocalyptic catastrophe-and they might be absolutely right.

They shun complexity or ambivalence in favour of clarity, and they do so with a verve and passion which I immediately associate with the Discourse of the Hysteric. I also feel as if such posts are attacking those who may not fully agree or point to other perspectives. As another example, I paraphrase one person who wrote on Twitter: 'Those people who were infected last week, will die in the next few weeks.'

It functions as a defence mechanism against an intangible threat. Paranoia is thus a very natural and understandable response to a virus that is so contagious, invisible, untraceable, and to which there is no vaccine yet. We may feel overwhelmed and powerless in the face of such a Real force about which we know relatively little. Nothing seems good, healthy or normal about the state of the world right now as we see so many people suffering and dying. The conspiracy theories that link the spread of the 5G technology to coronavirus for example (Temperton 2020) can thus be seen as attempts, like many conspiracy theories, to make something unknown and threatening knowable and controllable. The ego achieves a mastery over external forces it cannot control by naming them, establishing alleged causalities, reasons, and explanations. It might seem difficult to remain rational and level-headed in times like these. They thus bring a sense of relief to those who (unconsciously) desire clarity, direction and clear knowledge.",

In that sense, the neurotic demand that is articulated in the posts I have discussed is entirely understandable. Yet, the Discourse of the Hysteric is in the context of the pandemic illusionary.

This should be observed in order to protect others against trauma, because they may have encountered masks in traumatic situations (e.g. in medical treatment). A tweet that on the surface seemed to be about protecting those who may be 'triggered' by seeing protective face masks. While the tweet may be understandable, I would argue that it points to the same problematic splitting mechanism we see everywhere today: it named something (masks) as bad for some people and subsequently asked everybody else to banish this bad practice. Additionally, the person asking everyone not to tweet images of masks assumed that many other people would find those traumatic, while it may have been only a few. We may debate whether the tweet could have been actually adhered to by others. The point is its underlying binary of good vs. bad, a binary that is reproduced by the very functioning of social media where users can either see everything or very little. Accounts are either public or private. A more complex working of social media, in this case Twitter, where those who would not want to see photos of masks could restrict or disable them, is not possible. It is not desired by social media. If in times of COVID-19, the choice is only to tweet death or to tweet life, it seems like we are running out of options.",

The image about being productive during a pandemic is another instance of splitting because it disavows, while seemingly being about the opposite, any other responses to the coronavirus pandemic where individuals may feel productive or may tell themselves that they are productive. Being productive is not okay, the image tells us, because we are in the middle of a global pandemic. In its very understandable wish to make space for uncertainty, contradiction, and unproductivity, the image shuts out any other responses at the same time. It wants to be containing and comforting but is consistent with the current social media logic of the paranoid-schizoid. It wants to move beyond the Discourse of the Hysteric but reproduces its basic parameters nonetheless. It is such a logic of monism which is pervasive both in networks and in discourses about coronavirus at the moment that needs to be broken. Even positive posts or ideas, like the ones I have just outlined, follow a seeming logic of care which betrays itself because certain positions are idealized and designated as the only possible ways of thinking in that moment. A kind of dualist thinking or one that allows for more ambivalence is often absent. This is both desired by networks and the companies that run the platforms we use, because they need certainty and clarity, but it is also a characteristic of the current crisis where responses or ways of thinking that go against a kind of common sense understanding seem out of place or inappropriate. It is also for those reasons that I have named my critique in this article 'hesitant', because it feels a little wrong of me to articulate it at this moment. Zooming in on the two types of posts that are discussed in this article does not mean that they would be representative or all-encompassing of subjects' responses to COVID-19 on social media. Many users also show nuanced, balanced, and complex ways of articulating their feelings, anxieties, and desires in light of the present situation. However, those were, at least in my observations, in the minority. This may also have something to do with the technological make-up of social media platforms themselves.",

They point to an underlying, far bigger, problem and dynamic which has to do with the technological workings of social media. The social media critic Geert Lovink has argued that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Weibo, and other platforms have not created real communities or feelings of community (Lovink 2019) . They have isolated users and greedily feed on their individual anxieties, anger, alienation, and hopes for love, care, and communication. Social media are businesses that depend on targeted advertising. They sell individual user data to advertisers so that they can target users with individual ads (Fuchs 2014) . Real, communal characteristics of social media are at best underdeveloped or are lacking altogether, because they are deemed unnecessary by the platforms. Such an interface structure becomes all the more visible in a time of crisis. Our feelings are exploited rather than truly cared for. Social media are not built on community or capaciousness but on the individual. The media theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun (2018) has argued that such splitting according to specific characteristics (that often has commercial goals) is an inherent part of digital networks as such. According to her, networks operate on principles of homophily, whereby individuals are clustered together according to shared and similar principles (friendships, declared interests, likes, location, and other characteristics).",

The very clusterings of networks that Chun describes are also examples of automatic processes that occur without users' explicit knowledge about them. All of this is done based on the principle of homophily which seems inherently benign and like a productive way of managing vast networks: similarity breeds connection. Individuals want to be together with like-minded others, and this is evident in how we generally form friendships and relationships for example (Chun 2018) . However, there is not only a violent splitting inherent to homophily in networks, but such practices also erase the politics of networks, as Chun argues: historical contexts, economic issues, discrimination.

            "text": "At the same time, social media are so attractive to individuals because they address them as such. They are individualising (Johanssen 2019) . Social media work through individual accounts where users can create a sense of (online) identity, get in touch with others and exchange ideas, images, and fantasies. As Balick (2014) and Singh (2019) have both argued, social media promise and respond to the human desire for intersubjective recognition. In being seen as an individual online, the user feels recognized, validated, and reassured that they really do exist. Such feelings may very well exist in many users and I do not mean to outrightly dismiss social media. Social media can enable meaningful and hopeful communication. The promise of recognition is coupled with active signals on the part of social media companies to the user how valued they are. This shows itself, for instance, in how the user is directly addressed, e.g. on Facebook and asked: 'What is on your mind?' In the eyes of Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms, users are only seen and named as good-as long as they log on and engage with the platform. The fact that fundamentally bad things take place beyond the users' awareness (e.g. the Cambridge Analytica scandal; user data being sold to advertisers, or social media data being used for surveillance) is fundamentally split off by tech CEOs themselves. Reflecting on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and fake news epidemic on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg initially simply called it 'a pretty crazy idea' and accused critics of 'a profound lack of empathy' (Healey and Potter, 2018, p. 671) . Zuckerberg has publicly emphasized the positive and caring aspects of Facebook for example and downplayed recent scandals. Social media are themselves split.",

They not least show themselves affectively, because the virus itself and its contagious nature silently affect and infect the body, often without symptoms. The sudden loss of control and bodily autonomy that marks the affective experience in general is also applicable to the particular experience of being infected with COVID-19. This state of affective unpleasure is defended against through splitting, as outlined above. The dangers of a silent, invisible, and still largely unknown virus thus result in particular affective bodily states that users do not understand. Such states need to be 'discharged' (Freud 1981b) , to leave the body, so that the subject can return to a momentary state of relief and calm. Posting on social media 'is an attempt to translate and express something that is intersected by an affective dimension and was first experienced as a bodily state.' (Johanssen 2016, p. 212) . In turning affective states into language (posts on social media), users discharge them as they are able to provide clear narratives which re-establish agency and a sense of reality. Their posts figure as external accounts that everyone else can see and engage with. Posting thus marks a momentary end to the affective experiences and brings back a sense of agency to the individual. In that sense, those posts, even though they reveal a tendency of splitting, are useful for individuals and their mental health-at least momentarily. Given the ongoing pandemic, the uncertainty and anxiety that many feel will return and there is a need for it to be discharged again. However, splitting is only an attempt to symbolically cover over a kind of affective void at the core of individuals. In Lacanian terms, it is an attempt to cover over the lack at the heart of the subject. It is a defence against rather than an acknowledgement of affective states. It is not healthy for the individual, and by extension society, because complex developments and processes are viewed in a reductionist way. It can never successfully bring lasting calmness for the individual. It also operates with a logic where everything that and everyone who are not compatible with someone's schematic worldview are designated as enemies and excluded. A different response than splitting is outlined in the next section.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that we are currently going through grief on a planetary scale (Berinato 2020). We share it online, because that is something one does today. David Kessler, author of many books about grief, argued that grief is the defining moment currently because the world seems to have changed forever. 'The loss of normalcy; the fear of economic toll; the loss of connection. This is hitting us and we're grieving. Collectively. We are not used to this kind of collective grief in the air.' (Kessler cited in Berinato 2020, online). However, elevating grief to a collective feeling is too simplistic. It devalues grief for those who are really grieving because they have lost family members, partners, or friends. Grief implies a feeling in relation to something distinct that has happened, e.g. the death of a loved one and, as Freud (1981a) argued, it involves a process of detachment from someone who is lost. Grief splits the world into a 'before-and after' state. Kessler also claims that we are currently feeling 'anticipatory grief' (Kessler cited in Berinato 2020, online). It is 'that feeling we get about what the future holds when we're uncertain. Usually it centres on death.' (ibid). A kind of grief that anticipates a future that can only be catastrophic and, as Kessler claims, as a result, individuals have lost their sense of safety. I regard such forms of schematic thinking as unhelpful. How can we anticipate grief when we do not know what the future holds? How can we grieve when we do not know what we have lost? The world is changing but not so fundamentally as many argue. There will be a post-Corona world, but will it be so fundamentally different from how our world was just a couple of months ago? Such forms of schematic thinking are particularly evident on social media, as discussed. Nonetheless, the idea of grief is helpful to unpack further because it suggests that we have to let go of some things that we held dear or took for granted in the past. It can be discussed through the Kleinian depressive position (Klein 1988a, b) .",

The world is perceived in a more realistic manner, and others are recognized as separate and as existing in their own right. The other is acknowledged as one who both gratifies and frustrates.

The binary technological foundations of networks and platforms which I have discussed via Chun (2018) would need to change from profit-driven instances of individualism to truly communal spaces of complexity, spaces which can enable and tolerate the depressive position-this point would be subject to more detailed discussion in a future article. Regarding our own responses to the current pandemic, we should first admit that the world is currently truly depressing in a kind of common-sense usage of the term but that this always implies more if we follow Klein. It implies acknowledging anxiety, loss and uncertainty, and seeing a future that will allow survival and hope. In more practical terms, this can for instance mean to intervene when we see the kinds of post I have discussed in this article and to comment on them in a way that makes space for other perspectives.

A psychoanalytic perspective on the type of dynamics that were outlined in this article helps to understand the subjective dynamics which are intertwined with technological ones.

            "text": "The question is rather how individuals can traverse the fantasy and leave behind paranoid-schizoid splitting and the Discourse of the Hysteric. The 'worst that can happen to the hysteric social bond', as Jacobsen points out, 'is if the \"other\" caves to the criticism and gives up its position as the master who produces new solutions. This would force the subject to take responsibility for its own choices and decisions, and ultimately, confront its own desire.' (Jacobsen 2020, p. 51) . This would open up the potential to move towards a depressive position. Those who embody the position of the Master-politicians and experts-should renounce their claims of total knowledge. Instead, we should embrace another possibility that has also been brought about by Covid: 'a break in in the conventional ordering of knowledge, conditioning us to bear and possibly even acquire a taste for the uncertainty, precarity, and tumult of being alive.' (Gentile 2020, p. 652) . This means an absolute and open commitment to the limits of science, knowledge, and data-driven prediction and technology. Experts and ordinary citizens alike can never fully know the novel coronavirus. Some politicians have admitted to having made mistakes in managing the health crisis, others have said that their present knowledge has limits (Devlin 2020) . Those admissions are very important and present reparative efforts. Such articulations are akin to the Lacanian Discourse of the Analyst. For Lacan, the analyst occupies the position of the analysand's Other but their desire remains enigmatic. This animates a therapeutic process, whereby the analysand tries to discover what the analyst wants from them. The analyst commits to the limits of their own knowledge and thereby enables the patient to work through their own desires, conflicts, and fantasies (Lacan 1972) . Both ordinary citizens and 'experts' should assume the position of the analyst. This means acknowledging the limits of knowledge and coming to terms with how their existing paranoid-schizoid and depressive modes of relating inform their response to COVID-19, on social media and beyond. Such modes of relating are possible 'only if we surrender certainty and remain open to the strange and its wildness in a kind of interminable analysis.' (Gentile 2020, p. 663) .",
