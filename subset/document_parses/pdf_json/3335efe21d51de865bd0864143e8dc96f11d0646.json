This virus recognizes its receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), using the receptor binding domain of its spike protein subunit S1. Many missense mutations are reported in various human populations for the ACE2 gene. In the current study, we predict the affinity of many ACE2 variants for binding to S1 protein using different computational approaches. The dissociation process of S1 from some variants of ACE2 is studied in the current work by molecular dynamics approaches. We study the relation between structural dynamics of ACE2 in closed and open states and its affinity for S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2. (1) Weiss, S. R.; Navas-Martin, S.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses. They can cause respiratory, enteric, and nervous system diseases in birds and mammals. 1 SARS-CoV-2 is a \u03b2-coronavirus. Among four genera of coronaviruses, \u03b2-coronaviruses contain species that have caused serious human respiratory tract infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with outbreaks in 2002\u2212 2004 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) with outbreaks from 2012, which were about 10% and 36% lethal, respectively. 2 The main structural proteins of coronaviruses located in the viral envelope are membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins. The S proteins form homo-trimers on the virus surface and are necessary for entrance of the virus into the host cell. They determine the host range and tissue tropism and induce host immune response. Each S glycoprotein consists of the ectodomain, transmembrane, and intracellular regions. The ectodomain consists of S1 and S2 subunits used for attachment to receptor proteins and fusion with the membrane of host cells, respectively. The S1 subunit of the spike protein is composed of a C-terminal domain (CTD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). CTD, which is important in binding of S proteins to protein receptors, is composed of a core region and a receptor binding domain (RBD). 2 The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3\u22126 which is also the target of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 7\u22129 ACE2 is expressed in different organs of the body including lungs, intestines, heart, kidneys, and endothelium. 10\u221213 This protein is a zinc peptidase involved in converting angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9, 14, 15 and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. 11 The ectodomain of ACE2 is composed of a collectrin homology domain and a peptidase domain more distant from the cell membrane. The peptidase domain contains subdomains I and II that contain N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the active site cleft, respectively. 16 Virus-binding motifs of hACE2 are recognized on the outer N-terminal surface away from the catalytic cleft. 17 Similar to that observed for SARS-CoV, 17, 18 the concave RBD of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the convex N-terminal helix of hACE2 mainly through polar interactions. 19\u221221 Changes in coronavirus spike proteins could alter their corresponding host. 22 \u221226 In the same manner, the affinity between SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 in the first step of viral attachment was a determining factor in viral infectivity and host susceptibility and transmissions. 27\u221235 A few variations in critical ACE2 residues caused a lower affinity of SARS-CoV virus to mouse, rat, and Daubenton's bat ACE2 than to human ACE2. 17, 27, 35, 36 Variations in critical amino acids of mammalian ACE2s were predicted to decrease or increase SARS-CoV-2 recognition. 37 Therefore, it is possible that mutations in hACE2 affect the affinity and infection severity of SARS-CoV-2 in human hosts.",

ABF is a history-dependent approach to compute free energy profiles along predefined collective variables. During simulation steps, the free energy surface is smoothed by the adaptive bias so the system behaves along the defined collective variable, the z-axis of the bonded subunits, like when it is able to perform diffusion there. In the current study, the bin size was set to 0.2 \u00c5. We tested 0.2, 0.4, and 2 ps as the simulation time before applying the biasing force by ABF in each bin. Because the standard error of the computed forces and the computed potentials are not so small in long than in short bin-scanning and systems experience some binding/ unbinding during some of simulations, here we set 0.2 ps as the simulation time before applying the biasing force by the ABF algorithm in each bine. We are interested in comparative rather than quantitative affinities. The ABF simulation time varies from 4 to 18.5 ns depending on the considered system. The total time of ABF simulations in the current study reached 248 ns.

The utilized methods in the presented part consider the static structure of the ACE2/S1 complex for predicting changes in affinity.

Because we do not want to unfold the subunits completely, we set the acceptable range of temperature between 300 and 320 K. In this range of temperature, all atoms RMSD of the considered structures are smaller than 5 \u00c5. We detect faint two-state transitions in AT-MD simulations of the complexes (see Methods). The microtransition occurs in the WT complex or complexes of considered mutants within the temperature range of 308\u2212309 K. The observed transitions are detected by considering the potential energies of complexes as a function of the simulation temperature. The transition energy between the folded state of the ACE2/S1 complexes and the locally melted state of the complexes are reported in Figure 2 . We decomposed the amount of complex partial melting by computing the dRMS metric for ACE2 and RBD subunits during AT-MD simulation for pretransition population, i.e., populated stable species ( Figure S2 ). To find which subunit of the considered dimer is affected more by temperature, we calculated the difference of dRMS between ACE2 and S1 in each simulation frame as \u0394dRMS. Defining the \u0394dRMS metric let us determine which subunit is affected more during AT-MD simulations. The 2D density plots of AT-MD potential energy as a function of \u0394dRMS for WT ACE2 and mutant ACE2s in association with S1 are presented in Figure S3 . We map 2D density plots presented in Figure S1 on their corresponding plots in Figure  S3 . It helps us to determine the \u0394dRMS value that corresponds to the highly populated stable complex that has been used for determining the MM/GBSA-based affinity for the desired subunit pair. The obtained \u0394dRMS values define the relative order of the ACE2 subunit structural stability when it is bonded to the S1 subunit. The summary of the procedure and the obtained relative order of ACE2 subunit structural stability are presented in Figure 2 . These results indicate that some mutations stabilize ACE2 monomer and some decrease the structural stability of ACE2. In one subpopulation of Y199C mutant of ACE2, the structural stability of ACE2 is decreased, whereas the affinity of ACE2 for the S1 subunit is increased in that population. The ACE2 structural stability is decreased in Q60R mutation but its MM/GBSA-based affinity for S1 does not change significantly. As the studied mutations of ACE2 are far from the interface region, they modulate the Figure 3 . Dynamics of the ACE2 groove region is measured for AT-MD-generated ensembles of ACE2/S1 complexes. Left panel depicts the schematic position of the Gate and Zip regions in the ACE2 structure. The length of the zip region and the distance between halves of the gate region are presented in middle and right panels, respectively, for different ACE2 variants in association with the S1 protein.

These observations mean it is not necessary for an affinity modulator mutation to appear in the interface region of the complex for exerting its effect. In next steps, we follow how the considered mutations in ACE2 change its affinity to S1 over a distance. Considering variations of ACE2 and S1 protein electrostatic potential (EP) as averaged isopotential surfaces, we find that the large negative electrostatic potential of ACE2 makes the protein an interesting target for proteins with a positive accessible electrostatic potential like S1. The mutations in ACE2 affect the size and integrity of the negative EP in mutant versus WT ACE2 ( Figure S4 ). The changes in EP for mutations at positions 225 and 452 are considerable.

The active site of the enzyme also resides in one side of the groove. The accessibility of the groove to solvent is restricted by two regions assumed as \"Gate\". The halves of the gate are interconnected in one side via a disordered region labeled as the \"Zip\" region ( Figure 3) . We study the dynamics of ACE2 mutants and WT structures during AT-MD simulations by measuring the Euclidian distance between the halves of the gate region and the length of the zip structure. As indicated in Figure 3 , the dynamics of the Gate and Zip regions are different between wild type ACE2 and the mutants of ACE2 in their S1-bonded states. A mutation at the position 452 causes an increment of ACE2 affinity to S1 and simultaneously closes the Gate region. Also, the Zip segment becomes shorter there. The gate is more opened in the T334M mutant of ACE2 in comparison to the WT subunit, whereas the affinity of this mutant of ACE2 for the S1 protein is decreased.

Peaks in Figure 4 indicate which residues are strongly coupled with the sensor, mutated, residues. As it is presented in panel \"All\" of Figure 4 , some of the S1 distal residues (resid: 334, 360\u2212369, 388, 427\u2212430, 518) are highly coupled with the other residues in the complex. This region of S1 is close to recently discovered allosteric modulator region of the S1 protein. 74 Residues at positions 225, 452, and 485 of ACE2 protein are highly coupled with the distal residues of the S1 protein dynamically. Therefore, the mentioned positions of ACE2 play a critical role in information transfer between ACE2 and S1 subunits of the complex. Position 60 of ACE2 shows an odd pattern; this node has no significant coupling with other residues of the complex. Among the ACE2 residue positions that we studied, corresponding to the mutated residues in Iranian ethnic groups, just positions 199 and 225, are strongly coupled with residues of the S1 subunit that are in contact with the ACE2 subunit; so, their perturbations may affect the assembly more than other positions. This analysis indicates that position 199 in ACE2 is also coupled with some residues of ACE2; therefore, a mutation in that position possibly affects the ACE2 structure and the ACE2/S1 interface simultaneously. Position 225 is just sensitive to the signal arrived from the S1 contact site with the ACE2 subunit. This observation may rationalize the higher affinity of ACE2 to S1 resulting from the D225G mutation in ACE2. In brief, perturbations in positions 225, 452, and 485 of ACE2 in complex with S1 provoke a high amount of perturbation in S1; this perturbation response is especially observed for position 225 that is coupled with the interface region of S1. Perturbations in some positions such as 199 induce dynamic changes in both partners of the complex. The PRS-predicted dynamics changes in the interface region of S1 and ACE2 may be another justification for different affinities of ACE2 mutants to S1 of SARS-CoV-2.",

Using the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method, 57 we derive the potential of mean force (PMF) for dissociation of S1 from ACE2 in complexes that contain the WT or a mutant version of ACE2. Before performing ABF simulations, the WT and mutant ACE2 monomers in association with S1 protein pass 2 \u00d7 10 6 steps in AT-MD. Next, the S1 subunit is dissociated from ACE2 slowly along the z-axis of the complex (Supplementary Movie). Considering the standard errors of the ABF-computed dissociation free energies ( Figure S5 ), we find that the ABFcomputed affinities between S1 and ACE2 are increased in many of ACE2 mutations in Iranian ethnic groups in comparison to WT ACE2 ( Figure 5 ). It means that for those mutations we need higher forces to dissociate the S1 subunit from the mutant ACE2 structures than for WT ACE2.

There are some contradictory results in such reports about the effect of such drugs on predisposition to COVID-19. 75, 76 Many of the HPB suppressors affect ACE2 gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. 77\u221279 To the best of our knowledge, no experimental result has been published about the effect of ACE2-specific drugs on the affinity of ACE2 for S1 of SARS-CoV-2. Some studies reported the effect of binding of some molecules to ACE2 in the closed conformation on the affinity of ACE2 for the SARS spike. 80, 81 They proposed such drug\u2212ACE2 interactions may decrease ACE2 affinity for the SARS spike. They also postulated the critical role of the closed, substrate-bonded state of ACE2 in its binding to SARS or the COVID-19 virus spike protein. Recently, researchers reported that the activity of ACE2 increased up to 10 fold by binding to RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. 82 The authors of the mentioned paper suggested that the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein binds to the closed state of ACE2. We report the dynamics of Gate and Zip regions of ACE2 for some ACE2 mutations ( Figure  3 ). Our computations suggest that the closed and open states of ACE2 show a different affinity for the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein ( Figure 5 ). When ACE2 binds to ORE-1001, an ACE2-selective inhibitor, it transits to the closed state. In that state, ACE2 shows a higher affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein than in the open state. These observations suggest that ACE2 possibly fluctuates between closed and open states and the RBD of the SARS-COV-2 S1 protein has a higher affinity toward the closed population of the ACE2 protein. Therefore, it may mean that if some compounds induce the closed state in ACE2, S1 may bind to ACE2 with higher affinity.",

The structural changes resulted from the F452V and S331V mutations in the ACE2 force ACE2 to create a new short-life salt bridge between residue 23 of ACE2 and 458 of S1 (bridge 23\u2212458). The intersubunit salt bridges and aromatic\u2212aromatic contacts indicate that the disruption of the 329\u2212439 bridge is concomitant with tearing aromatic contacts between S1 and ACE2.

We measured the distances between positions of the eight mutated residues in ACE2 structures and the interface region of ACE2 along dissociation simulations ( Figure S7 ). These eight mutations are distributed in different regions of ACE2, and their distances from the interface region vary in different mutations. It means that not only the structure of the interface region is affected during dissociation process but also other regions of ACE2 that are far from the interface are also affected. These observations suggest that the integrity of the ACE2 structure in different mutants control the amount of forces required for dissociating S1 from ACE2. Changes in the integrity of mutants and WT ACE2 structures during the dissociation process of S1 are dynamic.

We find that the ratios change differentially among ACE2 mutants along dissociation steps. The ratios indicate that the first segment of S1 that dissociates from ACE2 is forehand, and in final steps, when S1 protein struggles to dissociate completely from ACE2, the fist segment (residues 470\u2212490 in the S1 protein) will be detached from ACE2. If we suppose in ideal state that the dissociation process is similar to the association process but in reverse direction, we may conclude that in the first stages of its binding, the S1 protein docks its fist section into ACE2.
