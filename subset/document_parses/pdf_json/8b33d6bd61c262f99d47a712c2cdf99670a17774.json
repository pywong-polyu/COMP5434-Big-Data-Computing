There is a paucity of literature surrounding the use of early fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for patients presenting with an initial episode of severe, refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Information on optimal antibiotic dosing and therapy duration surrounding FMT during an acute, initial episode of CDI is also limited. Described here is a case of successful treatment of CDI after 4 FMTs during an acute, initial episode of severe, refractory Clostridioides difficile colitis.",

This complicates clinical decision-making for healthcare providers when patients present acutely with severe, refractory (rather than recurrent) CDI as an initial episode. The objective of this case report is to describe the success of early, repeat FMT as a treatment strategy for an initial episode of severe, refractory CDI and discuss timing of antimicrobial cessation surrounding repeat FMT.",

He had difficulty maintaining fluid and nutrition status due to persistent nausea and emesis (more than 12 times per day consistently for 48 hours). The patient also reported generalized weakness and fatigue. He had an extensive dental cavity and reported that he had scheduled an appointment for tooth extraction for the following week. With regard to the single dental caries, the patient noted that 2 months previously he had completed a prophylactic 10-day course of clindamycin 300 mg 3 times daily (ordered due to a possible penicillin allergy, with questionable localized swelling; the patient reported no history of prior cephalosporin use).

An infectious diseases consult was ordered, and the patient remained in intensive care for 3 days before being transferred to the medical step-down unit for 3 additional days prior to his transfer to another hospital. Before the interhospital transfer, the patient received IV metronidazole and varying doses of oral and rectal vancomycin, as outlined in Table 1 ; vancomycin dosing, which varied from guidelinedirected doses, is reported as a range in Table 1 to reflect variable dosing due to differences in clinical severity classification by the consultant teams. Several dose changes occurred with antimicrobial orders from multiple providers including the critical care team (with pharmacists recommending and intensivists) ordering vancomycin 125 mg orally 4 times daily based on severe CDI. 2 This order was in contrast to the order of an infectious diseases provider, who had empirically increased the vancomycin dosage to 250 mg orally 4 times daily. Although higher vancomycin dosages, ranging from 250 mg to 500 mg 4 times daily, are occasionally recommended for severe rather than fulminant CDI, there is limited clinical evidence to support such dosing. 9 The surgical team added metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours and vancomycin infusion (500 mg/100 mL) per rectum every 6 hours, which was reflective of dosing for fulminant CDI, since there was concern for shock with the presence of hypotension (responsive A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t to fluids), the presence of an ileus, and the risk of the development of toxic megacolon. The lack of consensus on the severity classification may have accounted for the omission of oral vancomycin dose escalation to 500 mg.",

The patient continued to be unable to consume a full liquid diet without experiencing significant abdominal pain and tenderness. He was assessed for total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed on day 6.

Due to the patient's worsening clinical presentation, he received the first nasogastric (NG) FMT on hospitalization day 8. No bowel preparation was administered prior to the FMT due to the acuity of the situation and the continuation of loose, unformed stool production. In contrast to the usual practice of cessation of antimicrobial therapy 12 to 72 hours prior to FMT, based on the unstable clinical course of the patient and high risk of sepsis and rapid deterioration, cautious antimicrobial de-escalation was exercised, as noted in Table   1 . 6, 10 Vancomycin enemas were discontinued 7 hours and IV metronidazole was discontinued 5 hours prior to the initial FMT on day 8, and the oral vancomycin dosage was decreased the following evening (post FMT) to 125 mg every 8 hours in an attempt to allow persistence of newly established gut flora. Two tablets of atropine/diphenoxylate (0.025 mg/2.5 mg) were administered orally 1 hour before and 3 hours after the FMT to enhance the retention of the newly instilled donor stool.

Following the procedure, the patient experienced a temporary reduction in symptoms and a minimal decrease in WBC count (from 17,600 cells/\u00b5L to 15,900 cells/\u00b5L). These developments were followed by a moderate improvement in the abdominal exam findings on day 9 before gastrointestinal symptoms and pain again worsened on day 10, with an increase in the WBC count from 15,000 cells/\u00b5L to 17,900 cells/\u00b5L (Figure 1 ).",

Repeat FMT is typically performed in the event of recurrent diarrhea for 1 week post FMT. 10 The patient was instructed to adhere to a clear liquid diet from the day prior to FMT up until 5 hours prior to the procedure. He completed bowel preparation the day prior to the initial outpatient FMT with bisacodyl 10 mg by mouth taken 21 hours prior to the FMT and polyethylene glycol 238 g taken by mouth 19 hours prior to the FMT, as outlined in Table 1 . The morning of the FMT, the patient consumed magnesium citrate solution (5.2 g/90 mL). Thirty minutes before the procedure, the patient took loperamide 4 mg orally, and following the procedure 4 mg of loperamide was administered in the office to enhance the retention of the newly instilled stool.",

The colonoscopy results demonstrated altered vasculature, erythema, erosions, congestion, inflammation, plaques with contact bleeding, and pseudomembranous mucosa in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon. The patient was determined to still have moderate to severe active C, difficile colitis and therefore was scheduled for a repeat FMT the following day. Given the severity of illness and high morbidity and mortality rates associated with the presence of pseudomembranous colitis, as visualized during the first outpatient colonoscopic FMT, the A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t decision was made to repeat the FMT the following day with the aim of inducing clinical remission, as recommended by the European consensus guidelines. 6 No bowel preparation was completed prior to the second outpatient FMT, since the patient's gut contained newly implanted donor stool. For the second outpatient colonoscopic FMT, 500 mL of emulsified donor stool preparation was instilled into the patient's cecum. Post FMT, the patient was advised to avoid unnecessary antibiotics, follow a high-fiber diet (with the addition of methylcellulose 2 g in 240 mL of water up to 3 times daily for fiber supplementation), take dicyclomine 10 mg 4 times daily before meals as needed for abdominal cramping, and take a once-daily oral probiotic supplement. Although probiotic use is not recommended in the current IDSA/SHEA guidelines and most randomized controlled studies of its use were not adequately powered, based on available data showing trends of reduced CDI recurrence with use of probiotics for secondary prevention, the consulted gastroenterologist advised that the benefits of administration of an oral daily probiotic supplement indefinitely would outweigh the risks. [12] [13] [14] At the time of writing, the patient had been followed for 2 years from the date of initial presentation with severe, refractory CDI. The patient had been continued on the daily probiotic supplement along with dietary and pharmacologic fiber supplementation with calcium polycarbophil 625 mg orally daily and methylcellulose powder 2 g in 240 mL of water orally once daily. He had attended routine follow-up visits with his primary care provider, had returned to his routine activities of daily living, and had avoided antibiotic usage. He was delabeled as having penicillin allergy in the electronic medical record, and he had remained clinically stable without experiencing a recurrence of CDI. As of the time of writing, the patient A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t was deemed to have experienced a clinical cure on basis of the resolution of diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms without the need for additional antimicrobial treatment or repeat FMTs.",

            "text": "FMT has been primarily studied as a treatment for rCDI. Recurrent CDI is more often severe than initial episodes and is associated with higher mortality. 15, 16 Treatment with FMT versus vancomycin may be more effective for rCDI. 17 In contrast, literature regarding early FMT for acute infections during initial episodes of severe, refractory CDI is sparse and mainly includes retrospective or observational reports. 18, 19 The indications for and selection and timing of pre-and post-FMT antimicrobials, bowel preparation protocols, and repeat FMTs, in addition to long-term outcomes of FMT in this population, are not well defined. Also, the burden of treatment failure is significant. Prior literature has revealed that rates of initial CDI antibiotic treatment failure range from 14% to 22% and continue to increase with recurrences. 20 Prior studies have also demonstrated a risk of CDI both during and up to 3 months after antibiotic usage due to disruption of the native gut microbiota. 3 There is an up to 10-fold increase in the risk of CDI occurring within the first month following antimicrobial therapy. 3 Unnecessary exposure, exposure to multiple offending antimicrobials, and prolonged use of antibiotics are known to increase the risk of CDI. 3 Therefore, optimal and timely treatment strategies are needed, but there are several hurdles to overcome. Inpatient formulary restrictions due to cost constraints, guideline recommendations, stewardship initiatives, and pharmacy and therapeutics committee A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t decisions significantly limit the availability of alternative pharmacologic therapies such as fidaxomicin, immune globulin, and bezlotoxumab. These were considered last-line options for the patient described in this report, to be used only if treatment with the preferred formulary agents (vancomycin and metronidazole) failed and if inpatient FMTs were unsuccessful at stabilizing CDI symptoms. For treatment of a potential future recurrence of CDI, fidaxomicin was recommended by the infectious diseases service as an alternative outpatient therapy (instead of oral vancomycin) in order to circumvent inpatient formulary restrictions and incorporate an alternative mechanism of action in addition to providing a first-line IDSA/SHEA guideline-directed treatment strategy. 2 FMT may be a highly effective, cost-reducing alternative to pharmacotherapy alone for CDI for many institutions. Literature suggests that cure rates with administration of FMTs for severe CDI refractory to antibiotics range from 50% to 91%. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] A single FMT may provide transient clinical improvement rather than sustained cure for patients with pseudomembranous colitis, and repeat infusions may be required to sustain cure if it is achieved. [23] [24] [25] [26] The presence of pseudomembranes reflects increased disease severity and a lower likelihood of response to a single FMT. 24 For severe and/or complicated CDI with pseudomembranes, a single FMT might not results in complete resolution of CDI symptoms but could decrease the CDI symptom burden, enabling a response to anti-CDI therapy. 24 For patients with pseudomembranes, a 100% cure rate may be attainable by continuing repeat FMTs until the disappearance of the pseudomembranes. 28 In previous studies a high rate of success was achieved when pseudomembranous colitis was treated with repeat FMTs at 3-to 5-day intervals until the colitis had resolved. 22, 24 Additional data indicates that patients with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t pseudomembranous colitis who receive an average of 4 FMTs (range, 3-6 FMTs) can achieve significantly higher cure rates than those treated with a single FMT. 29 The rationale for repeat FMTs for the patient described in this report was to reduce symptoms, disease burden, and morbidity and mortality associated with CDI and to restore the gut microbiota involved in the pathogen's persistence and colonization. 18, 30, 31 Therefore, based on the deteriorating clinical presentation combined with a worsening of the patient's laboratory markers and vital signs hours prior to FMT for rCDI. 6 Additional literature regarding severe, refractory CDI (as opposed to rCDI) recommends discontinuation of antibiotics 12 to 72 hours before FMT to prevent an antibiotic effect on the transplanted fecal microbiota. 6, 10, 35 De-escalating antibiotics in a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t stepwise approach by discontinuing metronidazole 48 hours prior to FMT and vancomycin 12 to 24 hours prior to FMT has also been demonstrated to promote resolution of severe CDI following FMT. 25 Alternative strategies for antibiotic cessation include treating with oral vancomycin for 5 days, suspending therapy for 12 to 24 hours prior to FMT (unless clinical deterioration is evident), then implementing FMT and, based on FMT response, resuming oral vancomycin 24 to 48 hours post FMT for a minimum of 5 days. This strategy alternates oral vancomycin and FMT every 5 days if pseudomembranes persist and involves withholding vancomycin for 12 to 24 hours prior to FMT. If symptoms resolve, FMT is stopped; if pseudomembranes are absent, vancomycin is also discontinued. 24 Restoring the microbiome is challenging while an active infection is present and is further complicated by the severity of illness requiring antibiotics. Therefore, the decision was made to conservatively de-escalate the vancomycin enema and IV metronidazole regimen 5 to 7 hours prior to the first inpatient NG tube FMT on hospitalization day 8 but continue vancomycin orally due to the clinical instability and the high probability of rapid deterioration of the patient's clinical status. The day after the initial FMT (hospitalization day 9), oral vancomycin was resumed but dosing was reduced from 250 mg every 6 hours to 125 mg every 8 hours over for approximately 24 hours with the aim of promoting anti-CDI therapy efficacy while the CDI burden was decreased during the post-FMT period (Table 1 ). However, due to only transient clinical improvement within 48 hours of the initial FMT (on day 10), vancomycin dosing was increased back to 250 mg every 6 hours (Table 1) . Because CDI symptoms persisted, all antibiotics were discontinued (with close monitoring) 10 hours prior to the second FMT on day 11, and the method of fecal microbiota delivery was changed to the colonoscopic route A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t (Table 1) . Clinical stability was achieved within hours after the second inpatient colonoscopic FMT, so all antibiotics remained on hold at discharge. When gastrointestinal symptoms recurred at 1 week post discharge, consecutive repeat FMTs were completed on days 11 and 12 in the outpatient setting. This treatment approach was based on the patient's clinical deterioration after discharge and the presence of pseudomembranes visualized during colonoscopic FMT. After 2 outpatient FMTs, the patient's symptoms resolved to baseline over the following weeks. His diet was advanced to solid food, his appetite returned, and abdominal cramping, pain, and distention dissipated.",

Upon visualization of pseudomembranous colitis during colonoscopic FMT, the severity and resistance of the active, refractory CDI was evident. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a statement about the risk of serious and life-threatening adverse events related to FMT, with the transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens (enteropathogenic and Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli) detected in donor stool samples used for investigational FMT, 32-34 early repeat FMT with cautious antimicrobial de-escalation and cessation significantly improved the clinical outcome in the case described here. Initial administration of antibiotics may have reduced the efficacy of the FMTs by disrupting the healthy microbiome. Guidance developed at the 2016 European consensus conference on FMT in clinical practice strongly recommends treatment with oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin at least 3 days prior to FMT, with treatment discontinued 12 to 48",
