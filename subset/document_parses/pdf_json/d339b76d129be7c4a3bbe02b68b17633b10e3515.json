We argue that pandemics expose both the vulnerability and resilience of the urban system expansively, from rooftop to the region, but also serve as change agents for the planning of resilient cities and regions globally. The discussion of the urban system and the pandemic is comparative, with the recent coronavirus and climate change, a persistent, long-lasting pandemic. The historical and critical review and synthesis of the durable concepts of the urban system at the kernel of the theories and practices of urbanism is highlighted by place matters, cyberspace, density, access, and the city-region. We note the implications for reconfiguring the resilient urban system of the future effectively with pandemic as change agent and the comprehensive plan and its regulatory zoning ordinance as implementation tool.",

City planning's professional identity is defined as a guardian of \"public interest.\" Standard City Planning Enabling Act (SCPEA, U.S. Department of Commerce 1928) is even more specific, defining municipal planning's promotion of \"health, safety, and general welfare\" of the population. Public health is about identification, control, and prevention of disease. The common references to parks and open spaces with a physiological metaphor-the \"lungs\" of the city-connotes the nexus of public health and the city explicitly. City planning's focus is the physical layout of the city in a manner that promotes health and prevents the occurrence of diseases in the first place. Concomitantly, city and regional planning and design theories, concepts, regulations, and practices emerge historically in response to public health crises, including pandemics, pollution with rapid industrialization, congestion with urbanization, and loss of green space in cities. The origin of modern city planning is aligned with sanitary, housing, and social reforms since the mid-nineteenth century and around the turn of the twentieth century-movements dealing with inadequate sanitation-itself a pandemic response-and limited access to air and sunlight in crowded tenement housing and dilapidated slums.",

A smart planning scenario could not have anticipated and illustrated the wide-ranging, impactful socio-spatial dimensions of the coronavirus pandemic in entirety this vividly, let alone applied standard urban planning tools-the comprehensive plan and zoning regulations-proactively (Banai, 2013a; Kelly, 2010) . It turns out, planning's tool set are disproportionately limited piecemeal or disjointed compared to the magnitude and wide-ranging scope of the better known, durable pandemic of climate change. However, the global experience of the coronavirus pandemic also informs and suggests what kind of planning is commensurate with the dimensions of the challenges posed by climate change. It turns out, pandemics expose the vulnerability and resilience of the urban system, ironically with durable concepts of urbanism, highlighted from the rooftop to the region. The paper is organized by a discussion of durable concepts of urbanism, with implications for reconfiguring the urban system, aided by invoking urban planning's standard tool-the comprehensive plan. The paper concludes with a discussion of planning resilient urban form of the future in the era of climate change.",

A question is immediately raised: which pandemic is more costly-coronavirus or climate change?

Add the mitigation costs of levee, dike, and sea-wall construction in coastal cities globally, like New York City, New Orleans, Amsterdam, Venice, and London. Include droughts that threaten agriculture, causing food insecurity that subsequently threatens employment and national security (even a source of failing states), and induces population migration in search of survival. This is not an exhaustive itemized costs brought about by the silent pandemic of climate change gradually taking its toll on the built and natural environments. The evidence of climate change pandemic and its consequences for cities and regions is compelling. The itemized list in the comparison of pandemics of climate change vs. coronavirus is tentative with respect to consequences of coronavirus. The juxtaposition of the two pandemics, however, is instructive. Ironically, one pandemic has a positive impact on the other (see Fig. 1 ). Images in the media show clearer skylines and iconic, ground-level landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, to be more visible than usual due to quarantines in otherwise congested, polluted, populated, heated-up cities. There are even the images of Venice's canals and waterways looking clearer than ever, as the coronavirus quarantine leaves them undisturbed.",

In the pre-coronavirus era, empty stores and parking lots and desolate public spaces were regarded as indicators of intolerable blight, justification for urban revitalization. Ironically, among the vestiges of blight and sprawl is the drive-in movie theatre, revived because of the pandemic as a safer alternative than the big-box movie theatre.

Much of the discourse of the new urbanism which emerged in the 1980s is about civic places, which disappeared in the private, subdivided spaces of suburbia (Katz, 1994) . The American dream of a house, a yard, and car excluded community, as Hayden (2003) argued (see also Calthorpe, 1993; McHarg, 1969 McHarg, / 1995 . The mainly residential suburbs bereft of civic spaces could not accommodate a social place for the teenage population without the car, with the exception of vacant lots and buildings under construction. Suburbia segregated commercial-residential-public land use, in contradistinction to the historic American Main Street with fine-grained, mixed land use, and an accessible park. The comprehensive (master) design plans of new urbanism aimed to remedy this shortcoming with integrated land use and pedestrian-friendly access, with enhanced public realm elements, which occupy prominent landmark locations with water feature and articulated surficial materials of the sidewalks anchored by gazebos and pocket parks, heeding the pedestrian as well as vehicular circulation.",

The longing for the city's public realm, temporarily off-limits during the pandemic, was expressed through the building balcony, which architecturally transitions between public and private space. The balcony substituted for an inaccessible public realm-from the street, the town square, the park, the waterfront, the cemetery, to places for religious gatherings, church, synagogue, mosque-places that functioned, albeit with some adaptation, aided in cyberspace, and occasionally in defiance of any imposition of control (see also Oldenburg's (1991 Oldenburg's ( /1999 ) notion of the necessity of \"the third place\" where essential human interaction occurs beyond work and home; see also Calthorpe & Fulton's, 2001 , page 37 elaboration). The limit of the experience of physical place via cyberspace is readily revealed if reminded by Lynch's (1960) cognitive mapping of the five elements that makes the city legible or imageable, and the sense of place attributes including ambience, sound, smell, topography (steepness of roads) and the like. If eclipsed in dense theoretical academic writing, commercial and social media alike exemplified the significance, actual experience of and the longing for the city's public realm, particularly during a pandemic.",

Communication theorists widely touted the benefits of interaction at a distance even pre-coronavirus. Among others, Webber (1964) argued the case for \"community without propinquity.\" The coronavirus effectively revived and reminded us of the merits of the arguments for and against more widespread online communication. Arguments in favor of communities of place rather than communities of interest in cyberspace (Calthorpe & Fulton, 2001) , however, suggest plausibility with the experience of communication during pandemic and the longing for interaction in physical space of place and neighborhood, and the (physical) public realm, even in defiance of state control. Economic and urban theorists up the ante by privileging the benefits of interaction with economies of agglomeration in physical space necessary for efficient business transaction (see also Lynch 1984) . Notwithstanding the facility of communication in cyberspace, still an urban form of the future-the aerotropolis-is defined by a physical space that accommodates agglomeration of firms and business transactions in a central location akin to the city's central business district (CBD) (Kasarda, 2006 , Kasarda, 2011 , Kasarda and Lindsay 2011 . The pandemic showed us the inequity of access due to lack of broadband technology-the digital divide-so the comprehensive plan is an ideal tool for enhancing city's resilience by a planning infrastructure that not only includes water, sewer, and roads, but also broadband service (see also Kelly, 2010) . We learned from the pandemic how vital functions are interrupted-education, from pre-school to college; health care; and access to jobs and services. Broadband access is not a luxury but a necessity when in-person access is interrupted or not an option. Parenthetically, a similar logic holds in planning transit-supportive or transit-oriented developments. The urban form, with its land-use mix and proximity to the centrally located retail and office services are desirable features because of walkability, regardless of the availability of transit (Calthorpe, 1993; Calthorpe & Fulton, 2001 ).",

The destruction of St Louis's Pruitt Igoe-designed by a renown modernist architect-demonstrated the unsustainability of the high-rise public housing project. In contrast, modern high-rise buildings could densely accommodate residents in resort towns with a premium view and rent. Their residents could weather the lock-down, shelter in place guidelines during the pandemic. However, public housing, following federal guidelines like Hope VI and Choice Neighborhood, is now lowrise with a front porch that resembles houses in older American city neighborhoods before the suburbanization of businesses and population spurred by post-war national interstate highway system. However, density is still a hard sell in popular discussions of realestate markets. Low-density single family rather than multi-family housing is politically palatable to politicians who count votes with rooftops, even though compact land development is arguably environmentally more sustainable particularly in the face of climate change and demographic shift (immigration) that increase demand for housing and ancillary urban services-water, sewer, and road.",

Density correlates with demography. In the context of the pandemic, still other factors must be added to the 3Ds in deference to public health: demography, disaggregated by racial composition, ethnicity, age, and income. The correlations among the factors are instructive. At risk are residents characterized by compact living and commuting, transit-dependent population, or workplace-residence separation exacerbated by the digital divide. For the purposes of public health during the epidemic, the aforementioned factors require optimization simultaneously. The comprehensive city plan is a logical tool for that optimization.",

Perlman and O'Meara (2007) remind us that the urban poor are likely located in \"ecologically fragile areas of cities,\" without adequate water and sewers. Coronavirus-prevention guidelines include frequent handwashing. How could these hygiene standards be met when there is no access to running water in poor settlements of the global North and South? The Navajo settlement is but one example in the U.S. (see also www.digdeep.org). War-stricken regions of the world whose populations are victimized by global power play, such as Libya, Yemen, Syria, Turkey, and Afghanistan, and refugees in Greek Islands, are among other examples. Once again, pandemics-be they climate change or the coronavirus-reveal the vulnerability of the population in urban, periurban, and rural areas with global inequity of access to the resources fundamental to human survival. The coronavirus pandemic had a positive effect too, with the U.N. Directorate's declaration to halt ongoing wars globally, particularly in the Middle Eastern countries most heavily impacted. The impact of military conflicts on the global population and environment is rarely discussed in the literature of climate change. The advocacy planning argument of the 1960s and 1970s that posed the limit of comprehensive master plans and stressed the necessity of the \"plural plan\" responsive to the underrepresented, marginalized, disenfranchised, colonized population revives the discussions of the equity of access to resources with environmental justice in the twenty-first century, particularly in the face of pandemics (see Davidoff, 1965) .",

For a sustainability assessment of a futuristic concept of urban form anchored by a \"globally networked economy's airport\"-the aerotropolis-see Banai (2017) . Air transportation's contribution to global climate change remains awaiting the development of technologies that economically sequester atmospheric carbon.",

A poplar idiom is aptly invoked. The planet Earth's holding capacity, like the proverbial camel, is finite, continually burdened with harmful human activity, diminishing gradually by each melting glacier, like straw on a camel's back. (Formally, economists use the term \"margin,\" or \"last unit\" to explain concepts, as in the cost of producing one more unit of a product, the marginal cost of production.) The precise tipping point, or better stated, breaking point for the planet Earth beyond any recovery, is in debate. The signs are visible in the built and natural environments, with droughts, fires, floods threatening food security, national security, employment security, rising poverty, inequality, and global diaspora (Brown, 2009 (Brown, , 2011 . Wackernagel and Rees (1996) measure ecological footprint by amount of land needed to sustain human needs for production of food and disposal of waste. Land is a finite resource. By that definition, Wackernagel and Rees (1996) illustrate that if everyone lived like people in the Netherlands, then two additional planet Earths would be needed. Parenthetically, the Netherlands example is ironic, given the compact Dutch urban form integrated with nature and exemplary sustainability practices (see Beatley 2014) . Furthermore, Amsterdam's Schiphol airport is regarded as a model for the \"aerotropolis,\" a futuristic concept of urban form (Kasarda and Lindsay 2011) . There is no literature on the public heath aspects of the aerotropolis; however, comparing it to the exemplary Amsterdam metropolitan region that contains the airport (Schiphol) offers some clues. The region is characterized by the historic structures, integrated urban development and nature, compact, mixed-land use with multi-modal regional mobility architype of European cities (See Beatley, 2009 ). European countries with net zero are the ideal of how we should live next.",

Reconfiguring the urban system in the era of climate change is compelling with the majority of world population living in cities and regions. At the outset of the paper (pages 1-2), we pose the kind of planning that is commensurate with the dimensions of the challenges posed by the pandemic needed for resilient cities. We argue the case for comprehensive planning, and provide specific interventions toward resilience, with place matters, cyberspace, density, access, and the cityregion. The logic of the long-term comprehensive plan is compelling given the interrelated elements of the urban system. The argument is that resilience of the whole is dependent upon the resilience of the individual parts. The paper thus provides specific areas of how the parts are addressed with elements of the urban general or comprehensive plan. For brevity , the discussion of the application of comprehensive planning as a mode to enhance resilient cities is limited. The comprehensive plan with a legal backing is long-term oriented, with parts that account for key physical elements that prepare the urban and regional system to confront the challenges of climate change. The comprehensive plans rarely include physical elements that enhance the urban and regional resilience proactively in the face of climate change. We have identified how the urban system is reconfigured, from the infrastructure of the public realm (the street, town square, park, and open space) to place density with a human-scale, telecommunication, regarded at par with essential infrastructure of water, sewer, and road, to integrated urban and regional economies that enhance efficient, sustainable local production and distribution of resources. Further studies fruitfully build on our comparative, evaluative framework of pandemics as drivers of change toward resilient cities of the future.",
