This study aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 lockdown in patients with obesity treated with intensive residential cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-OB). Methods: This retrospective casecontrol study analyzed 129 patients with severe obesity who experienced COVID-19 lockdown in the 6 months after discharge from intensive residential CBT-OB, comparing their outcomes on weight loss, binge-eating episodes, and general health status with those in a sample of patients matched by gender, age, and body mass index given the same treatment before the COVID-19 outbreak as control. Patients were assessed at baseline and by phone interview 6-month follow-up. Results: Both groups had lost more than 9% of their baseline bodyweight and reported a significant decrease in bingeeating episodes and similar general health status at 6-month follow-up. However, control patients achieved a significantly greater weight loss than those who experienced lockdown, although half of lockdown patients reported persisting with CBT-OB procedures after their discharge. Conclusion: Patients with obesity treated with CBT-OB and exposed to COVID-19 lockdown, despite achieving lower weight loss than non-exposed patients, had a healthy weight loss at 6-month follow-up and comparable reduction in binge-eating behaviors.",

During the lockdown, any medical activity considered non-urgent was suspended, including treatment for obesity. This inevitably caused a high risk of relapse in people with obesity, potentially aggravated by negative emotions associated with concerns related to the severe complications of COVID-19 infection reported in this fragile population. Indeed, several recent published commentaries have highlighted the association between obesity and increased COVID-19 disease severity [1] [2] [3] [4] . This association has been confirmed by a meta-analysis, which identified nine studies, all confirming that patients with obesity had more severe presentation of COVID-19 and worse outcomes [5] .",

Similarly, other papers have commented on the potential role of the COVID-19 pandemic in worsening the obesity \"epidemic\", in particular due to the behavioral changes imposed by the social restrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus. Indeed, home confinement and potential associated mental problems such as anxiety and depression could prompt increases in food intake, especially if people with obesity are exposed to a large amount of food stored at home during lockdown, as well as forced physical inactivity [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] (during the period in question, it was illegal in Italy to leave the house for exercise, except in order to walk one's dog).",

Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical comorbidities and/or were taking drugs influencing bodyweight, and if they had COVID-19 during treatment or in the following 6 months. The sample exposed to COVID-19 lockdown was recruited from patients admitted to the Villa Garda Hospital between 6 November 2019 and 11 March 2020. This decision was based on the consideration that all or part of the 6 months following discharge from intensive residential CBT-OB (up to the 6-month follow-up interview) spanned the lockdown, as a consequence of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Italian government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Finally, 39 (38.6%) respondents reported that they never or rarely exercised, 13 (12.9%) sometimes did, and 49 (48.5%) often or always did. See details in Table 4 . ",

            "text": "This study evaluating the potential impact of COVID-19 lockdown on weight loss, binge-eating episodes, general health status, and mood status in patients with severe obesity treated with intensive residential CBT-OB and re-assessed 6 months after discharge had four main findings. The first is that patients whose post-discharge period coincided with the national lockdown achieved a significantly lower weight loss at 6-month follow-up than those who completed the 6-month follow-up before the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that the COVID-19 lockdown may have played a role in hindering weight loss in patients with obesity and confirms data from previous studies conducted without a control group for comparison [15, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The negative impact of lockdown in patients with obesity also seems to be confirmed by our data showing that a significantly higher percentage of lockdown versus control patients interrupted outpatient treatment after intensive residential CBT-OB, even though a similar percentage of patients in both groups (about 80%) declared having started it. The second finding is that, despite the above difference, both groups achieved a substantial and healthy reduction in bodyweight. Specifically, the mean weight loss among completers after 6 months was 9.4% and 13.0% in lockdown and control patients (9.9% and 12.3% on intention-to-treat analysis), respectively. That being said, among completers, a greater percentage of control patients reported 5% and 10% weight loss at 6 months than lockdown patients (88.3% and 61.0% versus 71.8% and 42.3%, respectively). The weight loss percentages reported by our lockdown patients are similar to the mean 8% weight loss reported in a similar time frame by a recent review of lifestyle modification approaches for the treatment of obesity in adults [31] , although those reported by our control patients were higher. These data seem to indicate that intensive residential CBT-OB, designed to facilitate initial adherence to dietary restriction in a protected environment and address some specific cognitive-behavioral obstacles to weight loss, obtains similar outcomes to standard lifestyle modification of obesity if administered in adverse conditions, but a better outcome when conducted under normal circumstances.",

First, the self-reported bodyweight at 6-month follow-up could have overestimated the amount of weight lost but was a factor common to both groups. Second, the retrospective nature of the COVID-19 interview may have been influenced by recall bias. Third, a longer period of followup would have been desirable for determining the weight change in the longer term. Fourth, the very particular setting, with an initial intensive residential period-rarely used in obesity treatment in the community-makes it difficult to extend the results to the normal outpatient setting. Finally, the relatively small sample size and the absence of specific variables associated with the COVID-19 lockdown do not permit evaluating the mechanisms that hindered the weight management of patients with obesity exposed to the COVID-19 lockdown.",

First, to our knowledge, this is the first study comparing patients with obesity exposed to lockdown with gender-, age-, and BMI-matched patients who received the same treatment. This design is the best source of reliable data on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on weight management in patients treated for obesity. Second, the treatment was a well-validated intervention delivered in a real-world setting and uses some original procedures to personalize the intervention and to address the specific cognitive processes that our previous research has found to be associated with attrition, weight loss, and weight maintenance [34] . Third, the fact that the COVID-19 and 6-month follow-up interviews were conducted by expert clinicians not involved in the treatment, rather than relying on self-report questionnaires, enabled us to screen the responses (subjectively) for unreliable data and better investigate and understand the patients' perspectives.",

Control patients also perceived a better mood status, but a comparable general health status to lockdown patients. Despite these differences, lockdown patients had achieved a significant and healthy mean weight loss at 6 months, similar to that yielded by standard lifestyle modification for obesity in non-pandemic periods. Moreover, they reported a significant reduction in binge-eating episodes, and about half declared continuing to adhere to CBT-OB weight management strategies and procedures. This suggests that even during adverse events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a specific treatment for obesity, namely intensive residential CBT-OB, seems to be able to help patients to maintain successful weight management. Variables associated with COVID-19 lockdown to evaluate in future studies should include anxiety about infection, loss of structure and routine, social isolation, financial stress, childcare pressure, feeling less deserving of therapeutic help, limited availability of \"healthy\" foods, bulk buying and hoarding of foods, and restriction of exercise. Finally, future studies with a robust study design should evaluate the longer-term impact of COVID-19 lockdown in patients with obesity.
