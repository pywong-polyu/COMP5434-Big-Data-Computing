Observations: During the Italian COVID-19 lockdown, a 7-year old boy presented with bilateral vision decline that had started two weeks before. Structural optical coherence tomography revealed pachychoroid and CC bilaterally. Other ocular examinations were negative. The patient had an apprehensive personality and symptoms quickly resolved when he was provided with non-prescription glasses; his visual disturbances were thus considered to be functional and factitious. Conclusions and Importance: Our patient's symptoms remind us that the distress imposed upon psychologically frail subjects by the COVID-19 pandemic may have multifaceted manifestations. The discovery of CC in a pediatric patient with healthy eyes presents us with new questions about the processes of degeneration thought to be the cause for CC. Further studies are needed to estimate the prevalence of CC in the general adult and pediatric populations, as well as in patients with chorioretinal diseases.",

            "text": "Choroidal caverns are void polygonal cavities displayed by structural OCT first described in the choroid of patients with geographic atrophy. 1 They have a prevalence of 12.5% among GA patients; they most commonly occur unilaterally in such patients and have mean greatest linear dimensions of 148 \u00d7 84 \u03bcm. Indocyanine green angiography and OCTA confirm absence of blood flow. Since CC were initially observed inside GA areas, it was proposed that they represent areas of involution of nonperfused ghost vessels, with persistence of stromal pillars. 1 Different authors reported the presence of CC in various diseases, and have advanced further hypotheses on the nature of CC. Dolz-Marco et al. 2 observed that CC tend to present posterior hyperreflective tails, and are also present in eyes with other causes for atrophy, such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration, as well as in healthy eyes. Friedman lipid globules were suggested as a histologic correlate for CC. Although a direct link between CC and Friedman globules was not obtainable, it has been proposed that CC may be storage sites for fatty acids, which may be mobilized to support the metabolic requests of photoreceptors. 2 CC were also observed in patients with diseases of the pachychoroid spectrum (such as central serous chorioretinitis, pachychoroid-related neovasculopathies, and pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy). 3,5 CC were mostly found in areas of vascular hyperpermeability, where pachyvessels were evident; it was also observed that CC were more numerous in eyes with thicker choroids. 3 This has led to the conclusion that CC may be the result of the loss of choroidal stroma in areas of increased choroidal thickness. 3 Interestingly, Corvi et al. reported on a unique case of CC occurring in the context of a choroidal nevus in an eye with pachychoroid. 6 Furthermore, CC have been found in myopic eyes. 4 These eyes showed increased choroidal thickness compared to length-matched eyes that had no evidence of CC. The choroidal stretching phenomena occurring in myopic eyes, together with a reduction in choroidal vascular density, have been thought to originate CC in these patients. 4 Eyes affected by retinal dystrophies may occasionally feature CC. 2 In a case of Best vitelliform dystrophy with CC, Carnevali et al. interpreted the optically void choroidal lesions as the result of Best-related choroidal degeneration. 7 In addition, CC may occur in specific choroidal patterns of Stargardt disease and Retinitis Pigmentosa, in association with reduction in Sattler and Haller layers thickness. 8, 9 The main differential diagnoses for CC are other optically void choroidal spaces, such as choroidal clefts, choroidal rifts, choroidal loculations and peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitations. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] This is the first case report to our knowledge describing choroidal caverns in an otherwise healthy child, whose eyes presented increased choroidal thickness and pachyvessels. We believe that our patient's visual defect was purely functional in nature. It is interesting to note that our young patient exhibited an anxious personality, which along with pachychoroid may pose him at a higher risk for the development of central serous chorioretinopathy in the future. 19 His case testifies to the psychological implications that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have had on subjects still in their formative years, and especially on those prone to anxiety. 20 The finding of CC in such a young subject leaves us with new interrogatives. Even though the nature of the content of CC is debated, it is generally acknowledged that CC constitute a sign of choroidal involution. Given the absence of other causes for choroidal stroma damage, we lean towards attributing CC in our patient to the presence of pachychoroid. If that was the case, it would be quite noteworthy that pachychoroid-related CC may occur so precociously.",
