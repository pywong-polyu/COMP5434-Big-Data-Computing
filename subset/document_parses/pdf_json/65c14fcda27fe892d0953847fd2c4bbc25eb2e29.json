The results, drawing on the experience of a small open European country, suggest the distributed COVID-19 subsidies save non-negligible number of jobs and sustain economic activity during the first wave of the pandemic. General distribution rules designed on the fly may bring close to optimal results in terms of the support allocation, as relatively more productive, privately owned, foreign-demand oriented firms are prioritized and firms with a high environmental footprint or zombie firms record a relatively lower chance of obtaining government funding. By assuming constant cost elasticities to sales, we show that the pandemic deteriorates strongly firm profits and increases significantly the share of illiquid and insolvent firms. Government wage subsidies somewhat mitigate firm losses and have statistically significant effect, but relatively mild compared to the size of the economic shock. Our estimates also confirm that larger firms, receiving smaller relative size of the support, have more space to cover their additional liquidity needs by increasing trade liabilities or liabilities to affiliated entities, while SMEs face higher risk of insolvencies.",

Governments and financial and monetary authorities across the world took action and introduced various fiscal, monetary or financial policy measures. A standard list of policy responses ranges from tax deferrals and public guarantees to direct grants. 1 The speed and the scale of the economic shock associated with the new coronavirus called for immediate action. Preliminary analyses (e.g. Schivardi and Romano 2020) showed that firms, especially the ones operating in the most affected sectors with no or limited revenues, could relatively quickly suffer from insufficient liquidity.

(2020) and Demmou et. al. (2021) investigates the likelihood of corporate insolvency derived from the drop in equity buffers and increase in their leverage ratio. We follow similar methodology to measure the sales shock on firm's revenues and risk of insolvencies. Additionally, we are the first, according to our knowledge, to utilize several public and confidential firm-level datasets of COVID-19 government support. This allows us to identify and analyse the characteristics of firms that received the support and to compare the level of shock with the government support for each firm. For this, we employ a fairly exhaustive sample of non-financial firms from Slovakia -a small, open and pro-export-oriented economy suffering a significant economic downturn during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite low virus incidences.",

In addition, Elgin et al. (2020) develop a Stringency Index covering measures such as school closures and travel restrictions. And they find that the Stringency Index does not predict the level of economic responses. At the same time, Deb et al. (2020) find that while workplace closures and stay-at-home orders are more effective in curbing infections, they are associated with the largest economic costs. C\u00e9spedes et al. (2020) suggest an economic model with two essential components. First, the coronavirus forces firms to shed labour beyond a certain threshold, and productivity suffers. Then, expected productivity determines collateral value; in turn, collateral value can limit borrowing and productivity. As a result, adverse shocks have large magnification effects, in an unemployment and asset price deflation doom loop. The authors conclude that traditional expansionary fiscal policy has no beneficial effects, only several unconventional policies can help. Wage subsidies, helicopter drops of liquid assets, equity injections, and loan guarantees can keep the economy in a full-employment, high-productivity equilibrium.",

These developments can be at least partly explained on the one hand by a relatively high share of housing or food and on the other hand a relatively low share of hotel or restaurants services in the Slovak consumer basket. Following Yilmazkuday (2020), we may hypothesize that the effect of consuming-at-home was stronger (and to a larger extent compensated the drop in consumption of goods and services that cannot be consumed at home) in Slovakia than in other European countries. 15 See Appendix for details. 16 Some countries already had policies in place that could be reused during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was no \"kurzarbeit\"or furlough scheme implemented in Slovakia prior to the corona crisis. 17 These observations do not necessarily hold throughout the next waves of the pandemic. The intensity of the economic impact of the pandemic varied in time and later lockdowns and restrictions had more severe and longer lasting effects for smaller firms and self-employed individuals supplying in-person services. The share of subsidies allocated to self-employed increased from 13% in March 2020 to 44% in June 2021 and the share of supported jobs (of self-employed) increased from 14% to 35% in the same time interval (calculations based on ISP, 2021).",

In contrast to the proportion of supported firms, the size of the subsidy (with respect to total firm-level labour costs or assets) decreases with firm size. As documented in the table below, the Art and recreation and Accommodation and food services, i.e. the two industries most hardly hit by COVID-19 lockdowns, enjoyed the highest relative support. An alternative approach using total assets as denominator leads to similar conclusions. 21 Information on the number of grants or firms per sector does not necessarily inform us regarding the scale and overall impact of the government support. We need to investigate the amount of resources allocated. Following Figure 3 , we can see that the sum of wage subsidies increases with the size of the sector with respect to valued added and employment recorded in the sector. This suggests that the support could potentially have not only a firm-level, but also an aggregate impact. By supporting firms and sectors with higher contribution to the overall value added or employment and by distribution of higher relative subsidies to these firms and sectors we potentially safeguard larger part of the aggregate country value added or employment. For the assessment of the overall effect we may take a closer look at the supported firms in terms of their population, employment or value added. Although supported firms represent about 12% of all firms, they employ more than 30% of all private sector employees and create more than 40% of revenue or value added. This suggests a potentially high impact on the aggregate developments.",

However, COVID-19 triggered layoffs across all main size classes (in the second quarter of 2020). In contrast to previous periods, a higher reduction of employment in relative terms was recorded in smaller size classes. The high proportion of supported firms among the large firms indicates that the government policy measures could save a significant number of jobs. If we assume that supported firms postponed their layoffs, government support could save at least one percent of jobs in the second quarter of 2020. 22 In addition, the significant share of overall revenue and value added produced in the supported firms in year 2019 suggests that the implemented wage subsidies also contributed to a lower decline in GDP recorded in the second quarter of 2020.",

Our results indicate that a relatively small amount of COVID-19 support funds was allocated to financially distressed firms and zombies have more than 0.03 percentage points lower probability of being supported. 26",

In line with the recovery plan for Europe (EC 2020), which supports modern policies and sets a path to a sustainable and resilient recovery, climate action should be mainstreamed in government policies and programmes. By employing one of the very few environmental impact indicators (Trucost score), we find that the COVID-19 support studied should not contribute to excessive subsidizing of businesses representing an environmental burden. A one unit increase in the value of the environmental indicator results in a more than 0.01 percentage point decline in the probability of receiving COVID-19 funding. 27 Table 5 Estimated average marginal effects for the baseline logit model Age squared -0.0002*** -0.0002*** -0.0002*** -0.0002*** -0.0002*** -0. 5.2 Wage support allocation across firm size, age, sector and region Figure 4 shows a graphical representation of marginal effects for the control variables originating from the estimate of our baseline logit model. The results indicate that the probability of receiving government support increases almost linearly with a firm's size. Although standard errors of the estimates rise with the size class, the largest firms tend to have the highest chance of being subsidized. The marginal effect increases also with age, but only up to 30 years of age; older firms have a lower chance of receiving financial help. We take this into account in our further estimates and besides age we control for age squared. 28 Figure 4 Marginal effects of control variables (percentage change with respect to base value) 28 Presented categorical representation of the age variable serves only for the illustration of the nonlinearity in the effect, regression outputs shown in the paper take into consideration continuous version of the age variable. Our estimates suggest that sectoral distribution of wage subsidies broadly follows the intensity of the adverse effects of the containment measures. On the one hand, Accommodation and Food Service Activities (Sector I), followed by Arts, Entertainment and Recreation (Sector R), and Manufacturing of transport equipment (Sector CL) record the highest marginal effect, i.e. highest relative probability of receiving the government support. On the other hand, firms from Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air Conditioning Supply (D) and Information and Communication (J) have the lowest or a low chance of getting the support. The regional division shows a smaller overall dispersion and higher marginal effects for all less developed regions (with respect to the most developed region of the capital city).",

As shown in Figure 7 the entire distribution of profits shifts leftwards and many originally profitable firms record losses. The developments differ across firm characteristics, with somewhat larger distribution shifts within large than small firms, or industries with sizeable and small sales' drops. As shown in Figure 8 , government support only marginally reverts the initial distribution shifts. Besides significant shifts in profits and increases in the mass of loss-making firms, the pandemic increases the risk of illiquidity and insolvency. As shown in Figure 9 , the illiquidity and insolvency issues are closely related and the pandemic shakes even originally sound industries, like the manufacturing of transport equipment. Given the specific Slovak firm size distribution, we can observe that the negative effect of the pandemic on liquidity increases with firm size. The share of illiquid large firms on total number of large firms quadruples. However, the larger the firm the higher space for manoeuvre. Larger firms have easier access to loans or can use other short-term liabilities to fill additional temporary liquidity needs. The available historic levels of loans and short-term liabilities suggest that larger firms can significantly reduce their risk of illiquidity by employing the available additional sources of financing. Our calculations show that temporary pandemic elevation in the risk of illiquidity in medium or large firms can vastly be mitigated by short-term credit lines and current trade liabilities to affiliated entities. 31 Figure 10 Share of firms in the risk of illiquidity (in %) 31 For a robustness test we consider both entire (short-term and long-term) liabilities to affiliated entities and overall short-term trade liabilities.

From policy perspective, a careful monitoring and more targeted support will be needed to enable these firms to survive a longer period of crises and/or exceptional financing should be assured for investments that enable the transition to the new normal, otherwise even a well-meant and efficient support may harm healthy diversification and long-term growth.

            "text": "Baseline estimates shown above suggest a positive marginal effect for exporting firms. Taking advantage of having access to both outward and inward foreign trade flows, we construct and test more trade related variables. We find that not only exporters, but also importers or two-way traders, i.e. firms that export and import at the same time, have a higher probability of receiving wage subsidies during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparison of different types of trading firms with respect to non-trading firms shows the highest effect for two-way traders, sometimes cited as proxies for global value chain participants, that are found to outperform other firms in many aspects (Seker 2012). However, we cannot say much about the role of trade intensity. Coefficients for relative values of exports or imports (with respect to revenue) are found to be statistically insignificant. Note: The table shows average marginal effects from the logit regression for binary dummy representing firms that received COVID-19 government support from priority 1 or 3.
