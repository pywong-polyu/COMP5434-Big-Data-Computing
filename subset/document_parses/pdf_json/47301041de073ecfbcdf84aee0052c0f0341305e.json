Jumageldinov et al. noted that some cultural and historical items demonstrably related to the increase in the rate of adolescent suicides in Kazakhstan [5] . Indeed, suicide is a complex public health issue that exists at the crossroads of social science and medical science. A recent systematic review of medical and social science literature regarding the relationship between childhood maltreatment and non-suicidal self-injury confirmed a direct relationship between the two [12] . Sensory perception is another factor implicated in emotional processes and suicidality, and researchers are coming to understand that sensory processing patterns related to childhood traumatic experiences may be important in the prediction of quality of life [13] .",

Motohashi reported that the suicide rate in Japan was significantly correlated with the country's unemployment rate [14] , noting that this objective marker is an indicator of the number of people experiencing mental stress related to the ongoing economic recession and their personal economic difficulties [14] . Several studies with similar viewpoints reported a correlation between suicide and unemployment in Japan [15] [16] [17] . In major Australian cities, the unemployment rate was reported to be among the key factors influencing suicide [18] . Rates of manufacturing jobs and per capita income were not related to temporal variations in suicide rates within U.S. states, but they were related to differences in suicide rates among the states [19] ; moreover, temporal changes in the unemployment rate were closely related to the overall U.S. suicide rate [19] . A study conducted in Ireland indicated that active labor market programs to address unemployment may play an important role in suicide prevention [20] . Interestingly, a lower unemployment rate was not necessarily related to lower suicide rates in the regions of Hong Kong and Taiwan [21] . Likewise, neither the unemployment rate nor alcohol consumption correlated with the suicide rate in a Swedish study [22] . These findings suggest cultural variation in the response to unemployment. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has cited economic recession, including unemployment and financial loss, as a likely risk factor for suicide [23] .",

In addition, the growth rate of the total amount of cash salaries was significantly negatively related to the suicide rates among the overall population and for males and females specifically [25] , so that trends in the growth rate of the total amount in cash salaries may be useful as specific indicators of the necessity of suicide prevention measures. The value of the Nikkei Stock Average was also significantly related to the suicide rate in the overall population, as well as in males but not in females [26] . The Nikkei Stock Average (\"Nikkei Index\" or \"Nikkei225\") is one of the representative stock price indexes of the Japanese stock market. A report based on data from the economic crisis and recession in Greece showed that interventions for suicide prevention and promotion of mental health were important for austerity-related stress [27] . One study from China utilizing the self-determination framework demonstrated that the linkage between autonomy support (as opposed to control) and lower suicide ideation was mediated by workers' sense of meaning in life [28] .",

Based on opinions from several countries and the WHO, we hypothesized that labor, financial, and economic factors play roles in Kazakhstan's high suicide rate.

We discuss specific prevention measures and planning for these risk factors. During the 20 year study period, the annual suicide rate (per population of 100,000) in the overall population of Kazakhstan varied from a minimum of 17.6 to a maximum of 39.7; the rate for males was 29.0-69.2 and that for females was 6.8-12.4 (Figure 1a ,b). The highest rates were in the first portion of that period, about 10 years after independence (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) , when the overall rate ranged from 38. Table 1 provides the correlation coefficients between the suicide rates in the overall population, for males, and for females and (a) the unemployment rate, (b) the rate of increase in the CPI, (c) total exports, and (d) total imports during the study period. The suicide rates in the overall population, for males, and for females were each significantly correlated with the unemployment rate, total exports, and total imports but not the rate of increase of the consumer price index. The unemployment rate especially was highly correlated with suicide rates in the overall population and for males and females. The results of the multiple regression analysis of the relationship between the suicide rate and the four factors, i.e., (a) the unemployment rate, (b) the rate of increase in the CPI, (c) total exports, and (d) total imports, during the study period are indicated in Table 2a ,b. Based on the results, the suicide rates of the overall population, for males, and for females in Kazakhstan were significantly associated only with the unemployment rate in the present study. Response variable (Y): the suicide rates. Explanatory variable (X): the unemployment rate (X 1 ), the rate of increase in the CPI (X 2 ), total exports (X 3 ), and total imports (X 4 ).",

A network of close collaborations among personnel in these areas is needed, and a practical response manual could be created and followed to provide suicide prevention guidelines. Like Japan, Kazakhstan needs a country-specific approach to preventing suicides due to economic and subsequent life problems. Measures and programs that have been effective in other countries can be studied and imitated when appropriate. Actions that draw upon Kazakhstani culture should be devised, and the advantages of collaboration among professionals in multiple fields could be utilized. Unemployment is clearly a particular risk for suicide in many countries, but not in others; it would be interesting to consider what factors distinguish the two categories. It is possible that specific measures that have been effective in preventing suicide due to unemployment in other countries would work in Kazakhstan. Systems of collaboration to prevent suicide are also needed.",

Worsening mental states (e.g., depression and anxiety) due to COVID-19, mental issues due to the economic impacts of the pandemic, and pessimism brought about by the disease have garnered attention as COVID-19 continues to spread around the world [37, 38] . Among these specific effects, unemployment may be the greatest risk factor for suicide. Like other countries, Kazakhstan locked down the entire country with the continued transmission of COVID-19, and individual regions of the country responded by locking down or instituting self-isolation [39] . The likely economic impacts of these changes [40] will continue to reverberate for several years. It is necessary to perform further research on suicide in Kazakhstan. Suicide prevention is important from a young age, and prevention programs have improved the ability to recognize and to verbally convey emotions while maintaining stable initial characteristics, such as psychological well-being and positive expectations for the future [41] .",

Furthermore, the present study was a discussion about economic-based risk factors for suicide based on statistical analysis of only numerical data without individual information. Analyses of case-based studies of suicide would be important from the viewpoint of clinical and societal interventions. The study did not examine differences between Soviet-era and post-Soviet suicide rates, so it cannot shed light on the effect of a command economy vs. a market economy on suicide. The study did not probe the stark difference between male and female suicide rates in Kazakhstan or compare them to those of other countries and cultures where masculinity may be defined differently. The study did not examine differences between conditions in countries like Japan and the U.S., where unemployment is related to suicide risk, and in Taiwan and Sweden, where it is not. It did not elaborate on what types of prevention programs have worked or examine the data for clues to whether those methods might be applicable to Kazakhstan. However, it is a timely exploration given the current economic conditions worldwide and it opens up these issues as opportunities for further study among researchers in a variety of academic fields.",
