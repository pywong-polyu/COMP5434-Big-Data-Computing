All that is left for them is bankruptcy, layoffs, or the emergency assistance programme for formally registered workers.",

For the bottom half of the social pyramid, the 2015 crisis never ended. Since then, the poorest population has experienced income losses every year. Targeted transfer programmes have had no countercyclical effect (Barbosa et al. 2020b) . Systematic budget cuts in the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia Programme have resulted in a drop in the number of beneficiaries as well as in the average amount transferred. This has led to an increase in the queue for entry to the programme (people who meet the eligibility criteria but are not incorporated). To a large extent, the persistence of poverty results from the dismantling of social policies after 2015.",

In total, there was an increase of 4.9 million in the numbers of unemployed persons. Furthermore, until May 26, working hours and wages were reduced for 8.1 million workers under a special programme for the formal labour market. 1 More than half of these labour agreements were for the complete suspension of employment contracts. The official unemployment rate in May was 10.1%, slightly smaller than in January and February. However, if we also take into account the contingent of people who couldn't search for a job specifically due to the pandemic (and the social distancing policies), 2 that number rises to 25.4%. If there had not been any government assistance whatsoever, household per capita income would have dropped by R$66 (5.0%) and the poverty rate would have risen from 18.7 to 21.9% of the population (Barbosa and Prates 2020).",

It is an unconditional cash transfer of 600 BRL, initially for 3 months, which was instituted in by the federal law No. 13.982/2020. However, situations of poverty involve a multitude of dimensions not fully captured solely by income: bad housing conditions, lack of access to public services, more exposure to violence and crime, insecure jobs, etc. These dimensions are not tackled by a short-term cash transfer. And the money received certainly does not make up for the deaths from COVID-19, greater among the poorest. In other words, poverty rates, measured as income insufficiency, become less correlated to and an inadequate proxy for the real multidimensional poverty. We should also heed warning of the transient or temporary nature of these transfers: after the emergency benefit ends, we immediately return to the desolate scenario created by the pandemic.",
