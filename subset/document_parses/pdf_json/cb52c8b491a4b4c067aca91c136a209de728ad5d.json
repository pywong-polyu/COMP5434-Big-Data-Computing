According to the statistics of the National Health Commission, until 24:00 on February 11, 1716 cases were confirmed by medical staff nationwide, accounting for 3.8% of the confirmed cases nationwide, including 6 deaths. There were 1502 confirmed cases among medical staff in Hubei Province, accounting for 87.5% of the total number of medical staff infections in China. Among them, 1102 cases were in Wuhan, accounting for 73.4% of the total number in the province. Medical staff is the main force to fight against COVID-19. To protect medical staff from infection is the primary basis and premise to maintain the morale of anti-epidemic and ensure the combat effectiveness of the front line. China's novel coronavirus pneumonia Special Committee (http://www.ncme.org.cn/ncmeportal/coronavirus/home) has been required to attend the special topic of Chinese new continuing pneumonia education network (http://www.ncme.org.cn/ncmeportal/coronavirus/home). Everyone is counted by credits on protective knowledge master, protection clothing wearing and hand hygiene. 2 Neurosurgery patients are mostly middle and elderly-aged people in winter and spring, often accompanied by serious basic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, etc. These patients face high risk and risk of infection in the face of COVID-19, and their mortality is also significantly high. Therefore, neurosurgery inpatients are often high-risk groups of COVID-19 infection. 3 After the warning issued by Wuhan health and Health Commission, our department simultaneously carried out lung CT screening for every patient to be admitted to the department. As long as there is image manifestation of viral pulmonary inflammation, it was be treated as a suspected case, and no matter whether the patient had fever and cough symptoms or not, we did not wait for the nucleic acid test report (in the first period of outbreak, the nucleic acid test took a long time and the reagent was seriously insufficient). It is earlier and stricter than the diagnostic standard in Hubei published by the national health and Health Commission on February 5. 4 Among them, the indications may be expanded, and a few patients who are not COVID-19 are refused to enter the department, but the intrusion of an infected person could cause a considerable number of patients and staff in the hospital to be infected. In serious cases, the department could lose its combat effectiveness and be forced to close the department. The lesson of some brother departments is a must learn. In this case, it is right to adhere to the principle of ''better waste than indulgence''.",

On the premise of wearing a mask, it is required to measure the body temperature twice a day, minimize the access to the ward, refuse to visit, advocate video visit, measure the body temperature in and out of the department, and guide the correct implementation of cough etiquette and hand hygiene. 2,5 On February 14, 2020, our hospital conducted chest CT survey for all the family members of the inpatients. Two family members accompanying the patients had imaging diagnosis, and the two were forbidden to leave according to the requirements. The hospital sent a car to bring them to the guidance shelter hospital for isolation. The unaccompanied patients would rather contact volunteers or the hospital to provide accompanying care.",
