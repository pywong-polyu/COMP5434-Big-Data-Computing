The calculation of the results is based on the analysis of all cases of epidemics from the 18th century to the present. The model is related to the scale of epidemic and the decline in income. It is noteworthy that this model also takes into account the specific factors due to which events in developing and developed countries face to different scenarios [51] . In conclusion, some practical recommendations have been developed on the theoretical and methodological research of the issue.

At the same time, the movement of the military has significantly contributed to the global spread of the flu in all parts of the world [37] . However, it was very difficult to separate the impact of the 1918 flu on the economy from the consequences of World War I [52] . According to the economists at the Central Bank of America [29] in cities where strict and urgent measures have been taken; the results of the economic crisis were less negative. Also, after the end of the pandemic, economic growth was faster in these cities too. Without restrictions, there is an epidemic and the economy is still stagnant, so in the post-epidemic era, more difficult economic consequences are emerging [53] . In 1918, after the Spanish flu pandemic, industrial production in the United States fell by about 18% [54] . Although there are no official estimates of BEA GDP until 1929 and there is NBER Macro History Database used to analyze the economic impact of the 1918 pandemic. Specifically, it is meant here goods trade data, retail sales, equity prices, currency demand and consumption of travel services. According to James and Sargent [55] , monthly data on industrial production is an important to understand the impact of the pandemic. To translate this into GNP impacts is based on the annual growth of the Romer [72] real GNP series on annual growth of the NBER index of industrial production and trade. As a result is shown that a 1% change in this index was associated with a 0.26% change in GNP [55] .",

According to the same data, it took less than six months to spread the 2009 pandemic, while in 1918, 1957 and 1968 it took much more than six months, which was facilitated by the factors discussed above. During the 20th Century almost every countries experienced on the one hand a big wave of GDP per capita growth and on the other hand a huge decline in GDP per capita growth. It considers only a particular economic development measure [58] . Most papers analyze the impact of various factors on GDP. However, almost nothing is said about the impact of the global pandemic on the GDP. In summary, economic losses (reduced demand, delayed production, reduced supply, and unemployment) are caused by measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

One of the factors contributing to the decline is the economic shock caused by COVID-19. The amount of remittances decreased from the countries where the pandemic was widespread -Russia (28.32%), Italy (8.66%), Greece (1.81%) and Spain (18.56%). Instead, in March 2020, $ 20.4 million (62.1 million GEL) was sent abroad from Georgia, which is 10.1% more than in March 2019 ($ 18.5 million). All this once again confirms the theoretical provisions of the direction of capital movement during crises. In addition, a significant portion of the population is self-employed. Also, employed in the sector of the economy whose activities have been restricted due to the threat of the spread of the pandemic (e.g., restaurants, aesthetic centers, non-food stores).

Restrictions on economic activity as a result of the coronavirus spread have posed new challenges to countries around the world, including the Black Sea Region. The aim of the research was to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Black Sea Region countries' socio-economic conditions. To better understand the situation, we discussed the pandemics that have taken place over the last hundred years and their economic effects on several states. Accordingly, the study was based on an analysis of domestic and international economic processes in each state described above. In this research is used a model in which growth of GDP is the dependent variable. So, this study analyzed GDP changes on the example of each state in the Black Sea Region. Accordingly, the study compared data on the impact of the current pandemic on the socio-economic situation in the Black Sea Region -before and during the pandemic. Also, the leading industry in GDP by share was analyzed. Conclusions developed in this paper will also play a major role in post-pandemic and future pandemics.",
