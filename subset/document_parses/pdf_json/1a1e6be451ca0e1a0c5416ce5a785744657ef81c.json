For example, in a cohort of patients in Louisiana, Black patients were more likely to have CKD and be hospitalized and die from COVID-19. 4 These disparities stem from social determinants of health, including community context and access to a healthy lifestyle (contributing to CKD), household crowding and inability to work from home (precipitating COVID-19), and structural racism in access to economic opportunity. Furthermore, individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 experience high rates of acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, which may result in eventual residual CKD, potentially exacerbating existing disparities.",

In this perspective, we outline COVID-19-related payment and regulatory changes and their implications for CKD care delivery and AAKH. We then recommend actions for health systems and national professional organizations to achieve optimal, equitable CKD population health in the context of COVID-19 and kidney policy transformation (Table 1) .",

This \"regulatory relief\" has had a positive reception given costs associated with quality reporting, 7 administrative burden, and uncertainty regarding whether some quality measures meaningfully improve care. Others have argued that given substantial quality of care gaps in CKD awareness, goal-directed medical therapy, and transition to kidney replacement therapy, well-designed quality, value, and population health programs are needed to make dramatic, necessary improvements in kidney care delivery. 8 The question remains: how should quality programs for kidney care be reimagined amidst the COVID-19 crisis?",

First, implementing more CKD-specific, nephrology-oriented, and patient-centered measures can shift quality efforts away from solely dialysis-focused measures and enable quality measurement to drive improvements in kidney care. 8 The new Kidney Health Evaluation Measure is being incorporated into the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set for CKD detection in patients with diabetes. 9 Other quality measures, including a standardized mortality ratio, delayed ESKD progression, and home dialysis and transplant rates, are currently under development. 10 In light of the economic impact of COVID-19 on physician practices and hospitals reliant on fee-for-service payments, there will likely be a shift towards more value-based care in the upcoming decade, and these new CKD quality measures will be needed to monitor the effectiveness of care being delivered. Second, creating a Nephrology Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Value Pathway, a more streamlined iteration of the MIPS program, would standardize a set of quality measures that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f nephrology practices report, allowing for cross-regional comparisons. Lastly, it is often challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of quality programs, as they are often implemented uniformly across the nation, while other policies are changing concurrently. Advocating for CMS to re-introduce quality programs differentially across the country, using randomization or staggered implementation, would allow researchers to better evaluate the impact of programs on the quality, utilization, and equity in care delivery and lead to evidence-based policy generation.",

Evidence-based population health tools, including CKD registries, 11 e-consultation, and panel management 12 can facilitate a proactive approach to CKD care and risk stratification, particularly in the context of COVID-19. However, population health strategies for CKD are incompletely implemented due to limited time, resources, and/or local expertise, as well as financial disincentives for CKD care compared with ESKD care. 13 Capitated payments for CKD care in the upcoming Kidney Care Choices model provide built-in reimbursement for CKD population health strategies, but these payment changes are limited to participants in the KCC model. 14 Accordingly, we call for the establishment of a national CKD Quality Collaborative to provide content and programmatic support for nephrology practices and health systems engaging in CKD quality efforts. For example, the American Heart Association's \"Get with the Guidelines\" program partners with hospitals to implement guidelines via consultation, webinars, and workshops, and has demonstrated substantial improvements in process measures of care, and reductions in length of stay and readmissions. 15 A national CKD Quality Collaborative would cultivate clinical champions, support improvement, and provide best practices for rapid-cycle implementation and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f evaluation through pragmatic trials. Funding for such a program is a key constraint and would require investments from national professional societies and/or funding agencies.

Concurrently, outpatient visit volumes dramatically fell, with a nearly 40% cumulative visit deficit between March and June 2020. 16 For patients with late-stage CKD whose transplant evaluations, modality education, and access placements have been delayed due to COVID-19, there is an immediate need to identify and address gaps in care to avoid long-term consequences. It is unknown whether delays in care during this time period led to an increase in \"crash-start\" or unplanned dialysis initiations, which are associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, close monitoring of late-stage CKD is crucial to facilitate transitions to home dialysis, in line with AAKH goals, as evidence indicates that if hemodialysis is started initially, rates of switching to PD are exceedingly low after one month. 17 In sum, continued comprehensive late-stage CKD care during COVID-19, amidst an increased use of telehealth, is central to the second AAKH goal of increasing home dialysis initiation. 5",
