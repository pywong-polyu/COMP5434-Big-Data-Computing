Reactive strength reflects an athlete's explosive neuromuscular capacity utilizing the stretch-shortening cycle (ie, rapid change from eccentric to concentric muscular contraction) and has been quantified using the reactive strength index (RSI) during a drop jump. 13 In athletes with AGP, longer ground contact times (GCTs) have been reported during plyometric actions when compared with uninjured controls, 15 suggesting reduced reactive strength capacity. 29 Interlimb asymmetry has been frequently used during rehabilitation to quantify the difference in strength or performance of 1 limb with respect to the other. 3 Previous research has suggested that athletes with interlimb asymmetries .15% may have an increased risk of lower limb injury and thereby asymmetries can provide important markers for rehabilitation and RTP status. 21 The importance of limb asymmetry in relation to AGP remains unknown. Further to the examination of strength measures (ie, hip strength, reactive strength), the contribution of changes in strength to improvements in HAGOS is unknown. For clinicians rehabilitating athletes with AGP, a greater understanding of how strength is related to recovery of sporting function may help enhance rehabilitation programs.",

In addition, the findings highlighted a number of strength variables in the AGP cohort, including hip adduction strength, that were weaker at baseline testing with large differences in comparison with the CON group and that resolved after the rehabilitation program despite no specifically directed adductor-strengthening exercises.

Notably, as the HAGOS Physical Activity score continued to improve over this period, indicating an increased level of physical activity, HAGOS Symptoms, Pain, and sporting function scores remained constant. This suggests improved capacity to tolerate the demands of sporting activities without reccurrence of pain. Furthermore, from 3 to 6 months after RTP, all HAGOS subscale scores and the Marx score remained constant in the AGP group, indicating that continued sporting participation did not negatively affect self-reported hip and/or groin function. At 6 months after RTP, all 6 HAGOS subscale scores in the AGP cohort had returned to the 95% reference range for hip and groin injury-free soccer players. 48 Although similar to results from previous research, HAGOS remained lower when compared with the uninjured athletes with no history of hip and groin injury despite having made a pain-free RTP. 11, 48 In the current study, the lower HAGOS may be explained by the long duration of pain cited by athletes (mean, 39 weeks), as increased duration of pain (.6 weeks) has been shown to negatively affect all HAGOS outcomes. 51 At baseline testing, athletes with AGP demonstrated large deficits in peak isometric hip torque in 5 of 6 muscle groups (ABD, ADD, FLEX, ER, and EXT torque) and medium deficits in SLDJ RSI when compared with the CON cohort. Previous research has shown comparable weakness of the hip ADD 38, 47, 52 and ABD 43 muscles in athletes with AGP when compared with uninjured controls, while no difference has been reported in hip FLEX, 42, 47, 52 EXT, 33 IR, 30 or ER 30 strength. Triplanar hip strength, particularly the hip extensors, abductors, and flexors, plays an important role in optimizing femoroacetabular control during single-leg activities 17,53 during sports-specific movements. Insufficient strength to control the large external forces during such activities has been suggested to adversely affect movement technique 24 and joint loading, 15 resulting in excessive loading across the pubic symphysis. 7 The lower SLDJ RSI observed in athletes with AGP was primarily due to longer GCT. This may represent reduced capacity to utilize the stretch-shortening cycle via a detraining mechanism 34 attributed to injury, as normal sporting activity (eg, sprinting) can promote the stretchshortening cycle function. 31 Alternatively, the longer GCT may be due to athletes with AGP adopting a movement strategy to reduce the higher peak force and/or rate of loading that can occur with shorter ground contacts per the impulse momentum relationship. 5 The increase in SLDJ RSI observed in the AGP cohort after rehabilitation resulted from a large effect size reduction in GCT. The shorter GCT may have been achieved through increased lower limb vertical stiffness 16 and smaller angular displacements at the hip, knee, and ankle, although further biomechanical analysis is required. In athletes with AGP, training methods (eg, plyometrics) that utilize the stretch-shortening cycle and promote rapid expression of force in minimal times are of potential benefit during rehabilitation.",

            "text": "After successful rehabilitation, large increases were evident in all isometric hip strength variables and a medium increase in SLDJ RSI in the AGP group. No significant differences were evident in any of these variables at RTP when compared with the uninjured athletes. A major finding was that isometric adductor strength increased despite no specific adductor strength exercises being included in the intersegmental control program. Only 1 other AGP intervention study has objectively examined isometric hip strength (with handheld dynamometry) before and after rehabilitation. 57 Yousefzadeh et al 57 reported increased isometric hip adduction and abduction strength after rehabilitation, although the changes observed were larger than in the current study. This may be explained by the different intervention approaches employed, with Yousefzadeh et al utilizing exercises shown to induce high levels of adductor muscle activity (eg, Copenhagen adductor exercise). 46 However, it is worth noting that the increase in hip adductor strength observed in our study was similar to the 35.7% increase in hip adductor strength that has been reported in uninjured soccer players after an 8-week program of targeted adductor muscle training. 23 Two possible mechanisms may explain the increased adductor strength found in our study: first, reduced inhibition of the adductor muscle group as symptoms resolved with rehabilitation 28 ; second, indirect muscle strengthening through the multiplanar action of the hip adductor musculature 36 during the various levels of the rehabilitation program (eg, compound strength, linear run/ change-of-direction exercises). No other study has examined the changes in hip flexion, extension, or external rotation strength after rehabilitation, and our findings (AGP baseline vs AGP RTP vs CON) highlight the potential importance of rehabilitation targeting an increase in triplanar hip strength in athletes with AGP. This is supported by the finding that only 11% of the pre-to postrehabilitation change in HAGOS Sports and Recreation subscale scores could be explained by 2 of the isometric peak torque measures (hip abduction and hip external rotation). This may suggest that factors other than isometric hip strength, such as intersegmental control through dynamic sporting actions (eg, running, change of direction), may play a more important role in explaining the improvements in HAGOS Sports and Recreation subscale scores after rehabilitation for AGP.",

This is consistent with the findings of Thorborg et al, 47 who also reported no significant difference in hip ADD/ABD strength ratios when comparing soccer players with AGP and uninjured controls. Previous research has cited an ADD/ABD strength ratio \\78% as a risk factor for groin injury 52 ; however, we found ADD/ ABD strength ratios .100% in the injured AGP group, indicating stronger adductor muscles relative to abductor muscles in athletes with AGP at baseline testing.

These findings suggest a bilateral reduction in isometric hip strength and reactive strength (given that significantly reduced strength measures were observed on the symptomatic limb); as such, rehabilitation may be enhanced by targeting both limbs rather than treating 1 side as symptomatic. Our hypothesis that there would be greater asymmetries in the injured population was rejected, which was an unexpected finding given our clinical experience and the asymmetries identified in lower limb injuries in other populations. 1, 2, 21, 25 There are a number of potential explanations for these findings. First, in our study 18% of participants with AGP cited bilateral symptoms; therefore, in these individuals there may be no preference to load or off-load a specific limb. Second, participants with AGP may have strength and movement deficits on the nonsymptomatic side that are driving or contributing to overload and pain on the symptomatic side. Last, the average asymmetry across a cohort may mask larger asymmetries in individual athletes. Given that there were strength deficits across all muscle groups at the hip, it is possible that some athletes had asymmetries in certain muscle groups but not in others, which may give the appearance of the absence of asymmetry in the cohort. Future research may be directed toward subgroup analysis of participants with AGP who consistently off-load a particular limb.",
