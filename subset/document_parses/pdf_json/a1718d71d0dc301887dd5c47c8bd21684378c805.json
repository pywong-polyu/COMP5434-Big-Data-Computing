Maximizing vaccination requires that we track vaccination patterns to measure the progress of the vaccination campaign and target locations that may be undervaccinated. To improve efforts to track and characterize COVID-19 vaccination progress in the United States, we integrate CDC and state-provided vaccination data, identifying and rectifying discrepancies between these data sources. We find that COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the US exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity at the county level and statistically identify spatial clusters of undervaccination, all with foci in the southern US. Vaccination progress at the county level is also variable; many counties stalled in vaccination into June 2021 and few recovered by July, with transmission of the Delta variant rapidly rising.

However, vaccine development is but a single step in achieving COVID-19 suppression which requires widespread vaccination. As of August 1, 2021, on average, one in every two Americans has full vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, a highly decentralized approach to mass vaccination led by individual states has created a patchwork of vaccine uptake, leading to a highly heterogeneous landscape of vaccine immunity [1, 2, 3] . Alongside the relaxation of social distancing restrictions and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, the rising prevalence of the highly transmissible Delta (B.1.617.2) variant has significantly raised the threat posed by COVID-19, causing a surge in cases and mortality especially in areas with low vaccination rates [4, 5] . Additionally, while vaccination offers strong protection against serious illness, breakthrough infections associated with the Delta variant can occur in vaccinated individuals [6, 7] , placing even greater urgency on increasing vaccination levels in the US [8, 9] . These factors emphasize the need to closely monitor US vaccination progress and characterize variation in vaccination rates across both geography and time.",

In contrast to the varying metrics used by states, this metric provides a consistent numerator and denominator and so is directly comparable across counties. The numerator-complete vaccination coverage (i.e., one dose of a one-dose schedule or two doses of a two-dose schedule)-is the most epidemiologically-relevant metric in the context of the Delta variant, which severely impairs partial vaccine protection [25] . Likewise, the denominator considers the entire susceptible population, not just those eligible for vaccination, which is the most informative metric for infectious disease transmission. These choices in measurement have important implications for public health; for example, the state of Vermont has been touted as having carried out the most successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign and reached a target of \"80% coverage\" on June 14, 2021 [26] . However, this target was only for partial vaccination coverage in individuals aged 12 years and above, and as of August 1, 2021, only 43-65% of the total populations have complete vaccine protection in Vermont counties.",

Because the Delta variant has increased the risk of infection and subsequent hospitalization (see [28, 29] ), we consider the hypothesis that vaccination rates would increase in response to the increased risk [30] . We consider the county-level average growth rate of vaccination from the week of July 4, 2021 (week 26) to the week of August 1, 2021 (week 30). We find that average growth rate during this period is elevated in about a third of counties ( Figure 4b ).

Indeed, the growth rate in the stalled counties during weeks 26-30 is only 0.0033, on average, meaning that vaccination rates in these communities continue to stall despite increased Delta transmission. Lastly, we fit the observed data on vaccination over time to a simple model of growth and use comparison with this model to identify unusual vaccination dynamics. In particular, we fit county-level vaccination coverage time series to models of logistic growth. We find that the model characterizes the observed data well ( Figure S6 ), with a first stage of rapid growth in vaccination, separated by an inflection point ( Figure S7 ) from a second stage during which growth in vaccination slows. Rather than interpret model coefficients directly, we treat the logistic growth models as null models and examine deviation of observed county-level vaccination rates from these null models. In particular, we focus on deviations from modeled expectations during the second stage of the US vaccination campaign (i.e., week 15 and beyond). Based on these deviations, we find that counties may be grouped into four classes of dynamics ( Figure 5 & Figure S8 ): a) counties that display strong adherence to our logistic growth model (e.g., Allegany County, MD). This is the most common outcome with 73% of all US counties in this class; b) counties in which the observed vaccination coverage begins to overshoot our model predictions in June or July of 2021 (e.g., Cochise County, AZ ); c) counties in which growth rate is faster than expected during the second stage of vaccination, overshooting model expectations (e.g., Durham County, NC); and d) counties in which vaccination grows rapidly in the first stage of the pandemic, and abruptly slows at the end, falling below expectations (e.g., Essex County, VT).",

While states are responsible for allocating federally-allotted vaccination doses as well as tracking and reporting progress, the federal government is responsible for tracking vaccine administration within federally-serviced populations throughout the state. These separately serviced populations create the potential for states' reported vaccination counts to be lower than those at the federal level as not all states integrate the data from these special populations. On the other hand, certain states do not share county-level vaccination data with the CDC due to privacy and other concerns (e.g., for all counties in Texas, and for small counties in Virginia, California and Massachusetts) [32] . These data issues impede efforts to accurately measure and track fine-scale vaccination progress and to identify target locations that may be undervaccinated. COVID-19 vaccination tracking is currently done through a network of immunization information systems designed to be a centralized data repository for vaccination information within each state. However, together they make up a disconnected patchwork of 64 software systems of varying data capacity and data quality [33] . Combined with significant inconsistencies in state policies on vaccination administration and data reporting, this has created a disordered data landscape which undermines planning for the next phase of the pandemic, and erodes an already crumbling public health data infrastructure in the US [34] .",

The most affected states-in terms of daily case counts and hospitalizations-are found in the southern/southeastern US [4] . These hard hit states contain high-risk subpopulations with low vaccination coverage, as identified by our spatial clustering results. Importantly, the undervaccination clusters we identify make up a subset of communities within the states to which they belong, highlighting the need for fine-scale vaccination data and analysis to capture these vulnerabilities. Using metrics such as state averages obscures this county-level heterogeneity, yielding an inaccurate measure of local risk. Surges in these mostly rural areas run the risk of quickly overwhelming the local health care systems, which are often unequipped for a sudden influx of serious COVID-19 hospitalizations, and leading to increases in COVID-19-related mortality [35, 36] . Our clustering results also maintain a similar geographical pattern from May 2021 into August 2021 suggesting a persistence in low vaccination throughout the vaccination campaign. Notably, recent data estimate vaccine hesitancy to be limited to 10-20% of the population in these states (see e.g., [37] ), suggesting that vaccine hesitancy explains only part of the remaining undervaccination.

The structure of the vaccination phases in the US COVID-19 vaccination campaign prioritized individuals at high clinical risk and individuals in high transmission-risk occupations, followed by the general population [40] .

One group of communities surges in vaccination in June after reaching a plateau previously. For these locations, we speculate that the closing of mass vaccination sites in June resulted in a shift of resources towards community vaccination and mobile vaccination sites and the increased access may be responsible for this growth [41] . Another set of counties surges in vaccination in July after previously stalling. We hypothesize that this increase is driven by an increase in COVID-19 risk perception following reports of increased Delta transmission around this time ( Figure S5 ). Other communities, primarily in North Carolina, saw a larger surge in the second stage of vaccination than model expectations. While North Carolina largely adhered to the guidelines of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [42] for vaccine distribution, it did not prioritize adults with high-risk medical conditions or adults over 60 years of age [40] . Thus we hypothesize that this difference in vaccine prioritization led to these vulnerable groups urgently getting vaccinated at the first opportunity, producing a large deviation from the expected dynamics around week 14 (which then persists given the cumulative nature of the data). The last group of communities, primarily in Vermont, plateaus at a lower vaccination rate than the model expectations. This behavior could be due to a more rapid acceleration during the first stage of vaccination than in other states, owing to a strong community effort to reach vaccination goals.

Indeed, systematic issues in data quality have impaired earlier analyses: ignoring federally-serviced populations, missing small counties, or underestimating coverage in entire states. The vaccination heterogeneity we identify not only increases local disease transmission, but also elevates risk across entire geographic regions; persistent clusters of undervaccination in the southeastern United States lead to increased transmission all over the country-including breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. However, undervaccination cannot be solely attributed to vaccine hesitancy. Systematic healthcare inequality has deprived many of the protection afforded by vaccination against COVID-19, and undervaccination continues to persist in the most vulnerable parts of the nation, despite recent surges of transmission and mortality. A sustained commitment to increasing vaccination-including expanded vaccine access and vaccine mandates-are necessary steps on a path toward local suppression of COVID-19. Significant investment in strengthening the US public health data infrastructure is urgently needed to handle the next public health crisis.",

For each county, expected vaccination counts are calculated as the product of the overall vaccination rate and county population, forming the null hypothesis. For each county, a circular spatial window (scanning window) centered at that location is constructed and the expected vaccination case counts are compared to the observed counts. If there is a lower number of cases than expected within the window, the likelihood ratio is calculated (or defined as 1 otherwise). The radius of the scanning window is then incrementally increased, to include neighboring locations, up to a user defined limit (which we set to 1% of the US population size). This process is repeated for all considered counties and window sizes. The reported clusters are chosen to have no geographical overlap with each other. For each cluster, p-values are calculated via Monte Carlo hypothesis testing, generating replicates of the data under the null hypothesis of uniform probability of vaccination across counties.",
