The purpose of this paper is to discuss the direct and indirect effects of social capital on individual health in China. Using cross-sectional data from the China Family Panel Studies 2016, this paper explores the effects of cognitive and structural social capital on individual health from a micro perspective. The results show that both types of social capital have significant positive effects on individual health, and this effect remains after endogeneity is considered. The two types of social capital show obvious heterogeneity in age samples, urban and rural samples and north-south samples. In addition, the mechanism analysis shows that the health promotion effects of the two types of social capital are mainly derived from the effects of informal finance and access to medical resources. Based on the above findings, this paper puts forward policy recommendations.",

As a result, health problems have become an acute focus of concern for all countries in the world. Since health has always been regarded as an important factor that determines the economic growth and development level of a country research related to public health is extensive and deep. Since health is an important component of human capital and national soft power, modern economics has increasingly focused on analysing the factors and mechanisms that influence health by using micro data. From a practical point of view, with the economic development of various countries, public awareness of health issues has been enhanced, which is reflected in the increasing proportions of health consumption expenditure in total personal consumption expenditure and of total health care expenditure in the GDP of various countries. In 2019, China's total spending on health care reached 6.519.5 billion yuan, of which 26.7% was spent on government health care, 44.9% on social health care, and 28.4% on private health care, together accounting for 6.6% of GDP.",

China has a unique urban-rural dual system. There are great differences in income levels and living environments among urban and rural residents. The formation of social capital depends on one's social background, and the social capital developed under different social backgrounds has different forms and functions (Lei, 2019) . Therefore, there may be differences in the deployment of urban and rural social capital. At the same time, economic development in and the history and culture of the northern and southern regions (Pan et al., 2017; Sun & Xu, 2020) also have obvious differences, and social capital in the northern and southern regions may have a heterogeneous influence. In regards to age, considering the degree of individual activity and the time that it takes to accumulate social capital, we hypothesize that the youth period is a time of growth of social capital, that middle age is characterized by stable social capital levels, that old age is characterized by declines in social capital, and that the impact of social capital is heterogeneous by age level. Urban-rural, north-south and age-based heterogeneity in the impact of social capital is further discussed in a later section.",

In this paper, the instrumental variable method is used to solve the endogeneity problem. Instrumental variables are highly correlated with endogenous variables but independent of the error term, allowing a consistent estimate to be obtained. For quite a long time in the future, China will continue to face public health challenges. With the deepening of globalization, the prevention and control of public crises such as those resulting from emerging global diseases has become increasingly difficult. To improve the health of the population, the impact of social capital on individual health and its effect mechanism need to be discussed in detail with consideration of differences in economic and cultural factors.",

            "text": "Sociologists, economists, political scientists, managers and even historians have used the concept of social capital to explain socioeconomic phenomena. In the past 20 years, it has been one of the most prominent and controversial concepts and theories in the social sciences. This debate has mainly been caused by the inconsistency in how the concept is defined. Although there are many controversies, scholars generally agree that social capital is instantiated in social networks (Carpiano & Fitterer, 2014; Putnam, 2000; Woolcock, 1998) , reciprocity (Mazelis 2015) and trust (Song & Feng, 2019) . Social capital as defined by most scholars can be summarized as either structural social capital or cognitive social capital. Structural social capital refers to the externally observable behaviours and modes of participation of network participants and specifically involves social networks, civic activity (Nyqvist et al., 2012) , organization membership (Agampodi et al., 2015) and so on. Cognitive social capital refers to people's perception of the level of interpersonal trust within a group and reciprocal norms. In terms of measurement of social capital, in empirical analysis, variables to measure structural social capital include social tie establishment and frequency of interaction (Levin et al., 2016) , network size and diversity (Lowik et al., 2016) , social ties (Ingold, 2017) , information channel and moral infrastructure (Bharati et al., 2014) and centrality (Castro & Roldan, 2013) , etc. The variables that measure cognitive social capital include shared goals and shared culture (Garc\u00eda-Villaverde et al., 2018) , the shared language, codes and narratives (Lefebvre et al., 2016) , trust (Whiteley, 2000; Rouxel et al., 2015) and so on. Conceptually, there are two differences between the two types of capital. First, structural social capital is more formal than cognitive social capital. Second, forms of structural social capital, such as group institutions, exist objectively and are easy to measure, while cognitive social capital involves more abstract concepts and subjective feelings.",

Traditional Chinese society is a typical acquaintance society with a differential-pattern type of social structure built on the basis of blood relationships, geography and kinship. People who are related by blood or are from the same place have higher levels of mutual trust, engage in emotional communication and information exchange with the facilitation of social capital, and acquiesce to each other's reciprocal rights and obligations. Cultural rites are an important part of Chinese society, ranging from dining etiquette to various etiquette schemes such as seniority etiquette. Etiquette establishes the basic pattern of structural social capital, reflects the position of an individual in the social network, and determines relationship rights and obligations at the organizational level. These societal features are highly consistent with structural and cognitive social capital, which further indicates that it is feasible and meaningful to further study these two types of social capital in China.",

Han (2013) believes that social networks exert influence on health mainly through three aspects of social support, including emotional support, tool support and information support. Huang et al.

In addition, few studies have considered north-south samples in heterogeneity analysis.

Kawachi et al. (2018) find that family support and neighborhood trust are important correlates of self-rated health in adolescents. Pan and Wu (2020) focus on the results of age heterogeneity in the elderly and find that there is no significant relationship between cognitive social capital and self-rated health existed in the young-old group, and trust exhibits a significant correlation with self-rated health in the old-old group. A community-based study of Mayer et al. (2020) finds that trust in supervisors improves self-reported health. Research on structural social capital has reached a similar conclusion. The relationships between community-based structural social capital, family social capital and self-rated health are statistically significant, whereas the relationship between community-based cognitive social capital and self-rated health is statistically nonsignificant (Lu et al., 2021) . Younsi and Chakroun (2017) shows that high levels of social participation can generate better health outcomes for individual and community health. Therefore, we propose Hypothesis 1: Structural social capital and cognitive social capital can promote health. However, through what channels do the two types of social capital affect health?",

This form of financing plays an economic role mainly because of the information advantages, frequent contact between lenders and borrowers, low financing threshold, flexible collateral and low transaction costs that characterize it (Nie, 2012) . The studies on cognitive social capital and informal finance find that creditors with a higher level of social trust are more willing to provide relationship financing and that the influence of social trust on informal financing is mainly concentrated in rural rather than urban areas (Ding & Dong, 2020) . The type of trust has a heterogeneous effect on the type of financing, general trust has a significant positive effect on formal household borrowing, while special trust plays a major role in informal channel selection (Chai & Ye, 2019) . The researches on structural social capital and informal financing find that social network has a significant promoting effect on the possibility of obtaining informal loans (Dai & He, 2018) , and social networks seem to have a greater influence on financing behavior of formal financial institutions than financing behavior through informal channels (Hu & Chen, 2012) . Yan and Liu (2015) further confirm that family social network maintenance and \"relationship\" can help to improve the dilemma of family credit constraints and improve the borrowing capacity of farmers, especially formal financial credit. However, family social network maintenance has a certain \"threshold\" effect on households' private borrowing behavior. The two types of social capital have different effects on informal financing. With the expansion of financing scope, the role of social network in reducing financing risk is weakened, while the incentive and constraint functions of social norms and trust are more conducive to reducing financing risk (Lin & Wang, 2018) . Structural social capital plays a greater role in informal financing, while cognitive social capital plays a promoting role in both formal and informal financing (Qin et al., 2019) .",

In other words, the allocation of medical resources in China is not completely dependent on the market mechanism, and human relationships still strongly intervene in this allocation (Zhou et al., 2014; Liu & Wang, 2017) . There is a significant relationship between social capital and health care behavior, especially in health care expenditure and health insurance. In the studies of cognitive social capital, social interaction and social trust have positive effects on residents' medical insurance participation behavior (Liu & Wu, 2019) . Social interaction can provide a channel for residents to acquire knowledge of medical insurance, contribute to the improvement of residents' subjective satisfaction with medical insurance, and produce a significant \"followup\" effect. Social trust is conducive to promoting information exchange and cooperation among different groups and improving residents' expectation of medical insurance returns. For structural social capital, social network relationships can significantly restrain family medical expenditure and reduce medical risks (Xiao & Li, 2019) . The research of Fu and Kan (2017) shows that with the development of economy, the effect of social network on rural medical risks will gradually weaken. In addition, the stronger the social network, the more likely residents are to buy medical insurance. Lei (2019) believes that although social capital has a promoting effect on the participation of all residents in medical insurance, the influences of social capital are different, and the influences of social capital on insurance participation behavior from high to low are social trust, social norm and social network.",

This database covers 25 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) of China (except Ningxia, Hainan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), including 95% of the national population, so CFPS samples can be regarded as nationally representative. CFPS questionnaire types include village, family, adult and child questionnaires, among which the village questionnaire mainly reflects the living environment of individual families. The family questionnaire covers living conditions, social interactions, housing, household income and expenditure, assets, activities and production. Both the adult and child questionnaires are individual questionnaires that survey social relationships and health, work, education, and financial status and so on. In this paper, data from the family and adult questionnaires for 2016 are combined and matched to obtain effective information. To study the effect of social capital on health, the explanatory variable selected in this paper is self-rated health (Finkelstein et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014) , measured with the question \"What do you think of your health?\" In the questionnaire, interviewees could specify their own physical condition as \"very poor\", \"poor\", \"average\", \"good\" or \"very good\", with corresponding values of 1-5. Based on the literature (Pan et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014) , in this paper, individual and family variables are added as control variables. Individual variables include age, age squared, gender, marriage, education, and smoking and exercise habits, and family variables control for household fuel type, water source and income. Since before the age of 18, personal habits, resources and social networks are restricted by objective factors, the research population of this paper is residents over age 18.",

Although the trust component is one of the most commonly used measures of social capital (Whiteley, 2000; Zhang & Ke, 2002; Rouxel et al., 2015) , we use gift income for two reasons. First, Chinese society attaches great importance to human relations, with gifts given during traditional festivals, birthdays, weddings and funerals as an important way to connect and maintain relationships. The amount of the gift is determined by the relationship: the closer the relationship is, the greater the amount of the gift, and the person who receives the gift carries an obligation to return the gift in the future under corresponding circumstances, consistent with the reciprocity characteristic of cognitive social capital. Second, trust is a subjective feeling, but gift income is a concrete amount that can measure cognitive social capital more accurately. Common indicators used to measure structural social capital include organization membership, social activities and social participation (Agampodi et al., 2015; De Silva et al., 2007; Nyqvist et al., 2014) . This paper uses organization membership because in the Chinese context, it can reflect an individual's social network position. If the respondent is a member of the organization, the variable takes value 1; otherwise, it takes 0.Finally, a dummy variable is added to capture provincial fixed effects. Variable definitionsand descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1 .",

Table 2 presents the OLS and ordered probit full-sample estimates of the impact of social capital on individual health. As seen from the results in the table, both cognitive and structural social capital have a significant positive correlation with health, though structural social capital plays a greater role. One possible explanation is that structural social capital provides more frequent one-to-many connections and wider social networks than cognitive social capital. The results for the control variables show that men have better health than women, that the relationship between age and health is not linear, that exercise can significantly improve one's health, and that the higher the family income, the better is individual health (because people with higher family income are more able to access and afford medical resources), and that people who use tap water in their daily lives have better health.",

Therefore, the full sample regression results may be driven by young individuals. In addition, when social capital drops to a certain level, the marginal impact of a unit of social capital may increase, which would be reflected by effect heterogeneity at the age level. For example, Sun et al. (2016) find that the higher the age, the lower is self-rated health and that the health promotion effect of social capital is significantly higher among middle-aged people than among elderly people. In view the above two points, and based on the age bins of the WHO, this paper divides the respondents into those below 44 years old, those from 45 ~ 59 years old and those above 60 years old, which correspond to young, middle-aged and old individuals, respectively. Due to the weak social resources and decision-making ability of respondents under 18 years old, this part of the sample is excluded in this paper. Table 3 shows that for young people, only cognitive social capital has a significant effect on health. For the elderly population, only structural social capital exerts a significant health promotion effect. For the middle-aged group, both cognitive and structural social capital have a positive effect on health, though the effect of structural social capital is more obvious.",

For example, the more social capital that people have, the better their health may be, and conversely, the healthier they are, the more likely they may be to interact with others and the external environment, thus accumulating more social capital. The usual way to deal with endogeneity is to find suitable instrumental variables and estimate them using two-stage regression. An effective instrumental variable needs to meet two conditions: (1) it must be related to social capital, covZ i SC i \u2260 0 , and (2) it must not be related to the error term, covZ i \u03b5 i \u2260 0 . This paper introduces the average cognitive social capital (RZ) and average structural social capital ownership rate (JG) of other people in the respondent's community in 2016 as instrumental variables for cognitive social capital and structural social capital, respectively. The reasons for this choice are as follows: first, the social capital of others in the community is closely related to personal social capital; second, the social capital of others in the community is not related to individual health. Since the two tools are selected according to the same logic and their number is equal to the number of endogenous variables, it is not necessary to carry out an overidentification test, only to check whether the instrumental variable is weak.

According to the age subsample tests, cognitive social capital has a significant positive effect on the young and middle-aged population, while structural social capital has a more significant health promotion effect on the middle-and old-aged population. Therefore, social capital has different degrees of influence among people of different ages, so young people should focus on the cultivation of cognitive social capital. Both kinds of social capital are very important for middle-aged people, and elderly people should focus on the development of structural social capital. In regards to the urban and rural subsamples, cognitive structural capital has a positive and significant effect on health in both urban and rural areas, while structural social capital has a significant effect on health in urban areas only. The government should promote the development of cognitive social capital in urban and rural areas, cultivate trust among residents, improve the public service infrastructure, especially through construction of public facilities with social attributes, and promote the formation of social capital in the form of mutual aid at the community level. For urban areas, structural social capital is also important. Support should be provided for the formation and development of organizations, social support networks should be built in a planned way, and internal and interorganizational communication mechanisms should be improved. The results for the regional subsamples show that cognitive social capital has a significant positive effect on health in both the northern and southern regions, while structural social capital has a significant impact on health in the southern regions only. Thus, policy needs to be differentiated. In the whole country, a good atmosphere should be created to promote harmonious interpersonal relations and foster cognitive social capital.

First, due to the limitations of the data in the questionnaire, we can select only certain dimensions of cognitive and structural social capital to represent the whole. Second, other channels through which social capital influences health may not have been identified and verified. Third, due to data limitations, we failed to find other appropriate instrumental variables at the individual level. Fourth, results of reliability tests in CFA and the dimensions of mediating variables need to be improved. Therefore, in future studies, we will use more complete databases to optimize and enrich the dimensions of indicators to make the results more reliable, further optimize our instrumental variables, and explore other channels through which social capital influences health.
