In addition to higher COVID-19 infection rates among immigrant communities, other studies have noted various pandemic related challenges among these groups such as higher rates of economic insecurity [12] , lack of access to government supports and healthcare [13] , and negative impacts on mental health and treatment adherence [14] .

However, it is believed that only 45% of Brazilians in the U.S. are citizens, as compared to 83% among other Latino groups [16] , which suggests that Census data may be inaccurate, given that non-citizens may be less likely to respond to the Census than citizens. In 2017, the average age for Brazilians was 33 years, with 74% being foreign-born and, on average, having arrived around 2004 [16] . It is estimated that 49% of Brazilians in the U.S. are female. Although there are no available data on COVID-19 infections or deaths among Brazilians in the US, Brazilian immigrants may experience a heavy toll due to the pandemic since the majority (72%) work in low-wage \"service\" jobs [16] and fears about immigration status may deter many from seeking services [17, 18] .",

The few studies on Brazilians in the U.S. have largely focused on occupational health [17, 21] , maternal feeding practices [22] and mental health [17, 18] . In 2019, we completed a community health assessment among Brazilians in the Greater Boston area [23] . Since the pandemic began shortly after we completed this assessment, we saw a need to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian immigrant health priorities and needs. This is particularly important since previously identified community health needs such as mental health, occupational health and safety, and domestic violence are likely to have shifted and/or been exacerbated by the pandemic [21, 23, 24] .

Impact on Employment, Financial Security, and Ability to Meet Basic Needs All KIs reported that a large proportion of Brazilian immigrants work in public-facing service occupations such as housecleaning, construction, and food services.

KIs described that financial need drove many to continue working during the pandemic, even in unsafe conditions. Although obtaining jobs as \"essential workers\" during lockdown was not possible for many undocumented workers, some took up \"gig\" employment with grocery delivery services or rideshare apps. These gig positions and other jobs commonly assumed by Brazilians (e.g., construction workers, restaurant staff) were also described as high-risk, where it was difficult for workers to follow CDC safety guidelines.",

While the economic impact of the pandemic has been widespread, low-income immigrant communities have been particularly vulnerable due to ineligibility for federal benefits [9, 10] . We found that the CARES Act, for example, was not a significant benefit to Brazilian immigrants, even for those who pay taxes [9] . Inclusion in local, state, and federal aid for all immigrants would likely be an effective step to promoting public health.",

Another important aspect of relief efforts is housing security.

Our findings indicate that the Brazilian community has endured a variety of challenges such as financial insecurity, fears about documentation status, and language barriers, which have left them vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our findings suggest that COVID-19 infections, mental health issues, and domestic violence were prevalent. While we noted numerous needs, we also identified several community strengths, including a reliance on strong and extensive social networks and hygiene practices consistent with CDC recommendations. Aside from immediate efforts to alleviate the burden of COVID-19 on immigrant communities, there is a need for additional research to fully understand the impact of COVID-19 on these marginalized populations. Given that our findings indicate a shortage of adequate government support, capturing the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths among immigrant communities will help demonstrate the need for more resources. Since our findings indicate the influence of language barriers and a lack of awareness about health guidance and legal rights, we recommend the study and implementation of interventions that focus on the dissemination of information sources in Portuguese that specifically target misinformation, health campaigns that emphasize the importance of mask-wearing and social distancing, and Know Your Rights training that emphasizes safe work practices and tenants' rights. It is crucial that this research be conducted in a timely manner in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its devastating impacts on immigrant communities.
