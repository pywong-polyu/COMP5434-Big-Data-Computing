            "text": "In late December 2019, a previously unidentified coronavirus, currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities (1) . Coronaviruses are found in a variety of birds and mammals throughout the world and have a proclivity for emergence. In the past 20 years, three novel SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus that is genetically related to but distinct from SARS-CoV. To gain entry into the host cell, the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (2) . The viral response phase starts during the first days of infection, and flu-like symptoms are common (mild phase). Some patients progress to an inflammatory response phase. During this stage, patients develop viral pneumonia, and dyspnea/hypoxia might appear. A minority of COVID-19 patients transit into the third and most severe stage of the illness that manifests as systemic hyperinflammation syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction (3) . In the respiratory system, the virus targets cells lining the respiratory epithelium, causing from an asymptomatic infection to severe end-stage lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation. Disease severity is likely to be a combination of direct virus-induced pathology and the host inflammatory response to the infection (2) . In the cardiovascular system, there is evidence of myocardial injury with some patients presenting abnormalities similar to myocarditis(4). In the skeletal muscle, some patients showed malaise, muscle soreness, and elevated levels of blood creatine kinase, which is considered an indicator of muscle damage and inflammatory response (5) .",

Based on this, the first EMG breakpoint was assumed to be type IIa fiber activation, and the second EMG breakpoint was assumed to be type IIb fiber activation (Henneman's principle) (12) . The power outputs at the first and second EMG breakpoints were analyzed (figure 1A). For neuromuscular efficiency analysis, EMG data were normalized by the RMS obtained at the maximum effort (%RMS). Neuromuscular efficiency was determined by the relationship between the power output and EMG (watts/%RMS) at each exercise intensity (25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of maximum power output) (figure 1B), while total neuromuscular efficiency (\u0394watts/\u0394%RMS) was determined by the relationship between the variation in power output and EMG from unloaded pedaling to maximum exercise intensity. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
