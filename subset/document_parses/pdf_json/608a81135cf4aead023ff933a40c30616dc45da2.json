            "text": "Background: A favorable model for predicting disease-free survival (DFS) and stratifying prognostic risk in breast cancer (BC) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is lacking. The aim of the current study was to formulate an excellent model specially for predicting prognosis in these patients. Patients and methods: Between January 2012 and December 2015, 749 early-stage BC patients who received NAC in Xijing hospital were included. Patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n \u00bc 563) and an independent cohort (n \u00bc 186). A prognostic model was created and subsequently validated. Predictive performance and discrimination were further measured and compared with other models. Results: Clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, grade, estrogen receptor expression, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and treatment, Ki-67 expression, lymphovascular invasion, and residual cancer burden were identified as independent prognostic variables for BC treated with NAC. The C-index of the model consistently outperformed other available models as well as single independent factors with 0.78, 0.80, 0.75, 0.82, and 0.77 in the training cohort, independent cohort, luminal BC, HER2-positive BC, and triple-negative BC, respectively. With the optimal cut-off values (280 and 360) selected by X-tile, patients were categorized as low-risk (total points 280), moderate-risk (280 < total points 360), and high-risk (total points >360) groups presenting significantly different 5-year DFS of 89.9%, 56.9%, and 27.7%, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with BC, the first model including residual cancer burden index was demonstrated to predict the survival of individuals with favorable performance and discrimination. Furthermore, the risk stratification generated by it could determine the risk level of recurrence in whole early-stage BC cohort and subtype-specific cohorts, help tailor personalized intensive treatment, and select comparable study cohort in clinical trials.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Among these indicators, residual tumor appears especially important not only because it shows a negative correlation with prognosis but also its cancer burden ranges from single cancer cell to large diameters of tumor in these patients, which, in part, could lead to a great degree of heterogeneity in BC population after NAC. Several randomized studies and meta-analysis demonstrated that patients achieving pCR during the NAC have longer diseasefree survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with residual cancer. [23] [24] [25] It is for this reason that almost all prior studies have only focused on patients with pCR or residual cancer. However, since the measurement criteria of residual cancer burden index (RCB) were proposed by Symmans et al. in 2007, 26 RCB score and class were highly sought-after in many studies. 4, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] RCB is based on the measurement of histopathological indicators such as number of positive nodes, diameter of the largest metastatic node, and the size and percent cellularity of the primary tumor bed (www.mdanderson.org/breastcancer_RCB). Recent findings showed that no prognostic difference for OS or relapse-free survival was observed between pCR and low residual cancer burden class (I), 27, 28, 31 which provides rationale to establish a predictive model for all patients (including pCR and non-pCR) who received NAC. However, there is currently no available prognostic model that can be applied for all early-stage BC patients treated with NAC.",

AJCC stage, grade, ER expression, HER2 status and treatment, Ki-67 expression, and LVI have been determined as independent predictors in BC patients who received NAC. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] T stage and N stage, which indicate primary and metastatic lymph node burden, respectively, have been seen as predictors in several studies. 15, 18 The model we constructed incorporated AJCC stage, which takes together these two factors. Specially, ER expression was utilized as a continuous variable similar to several pivotal studies and LVI was classified as no, focal, and diffused by experienced pathologists, 8, 43 which might be more superior than two classifications. Furthermore, several studies consistently confirmed that RCB is the important prognostic indicator and outperforms other predictors. The robust predictor was included in the present study, which partly contributes to the favorable performance of the model. Additionally, it seems a bit paradoxical that post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) appears as an adverse indicator for prognosis in univariable regression analysis, yet shows no significant difference in the multivariable analysis. This is likely due to the fact that patients with PMRT have a higher proportion of high-risk group than that of non-PMRT group (15.4% versus 5.9% of high-risk group in the PMRT cohort and non-PMRT cohort, respectively, P < 0.001). The clinical guideline of PMRT in BC also strongly substantiates this point. 44 The C-index values of the novel model for predicting prognosis are superior to those previously reported in other models (0.73 and 0.67 of training and test cohorts in Colleoni model, respectively; 0.71 and 0.72 of training and test cohorts in Rouzier model, respectively; 0.78 of training in Keam model with only 2 years of follow-up). The possible explanations are that we considered RCB as a predictor and identified rational criteria for the target population in the current study. 45 Recently, Laas et al. reported that Neo-Bioscore had better performance in the overall population compared with RCB, but that RCB showed better performance in subtype-specific groups, especially for luminal BC and TNBC. 16 However, a study conducted by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute showed that RCB is superior to the Neo-Bioscore for stratifying patients into different survival outcomes. 17 Intriguingly, the AUROC values of five models applied to the patients in our center were inferior to those of the model. This is likely because of the distribution difference of heterogeneity in different races, the discrepancy of NAC therapeutic guidelines in different countries, and the predictive improvement of our model after including RCB and LVI. 16, 17 The optimal target population for NAC has been explored and determined in several randomized clinical trials, but verification regarding its prognostic difference is deficient. This may produce unrecognized confounding which might potentially affect the results of these studies, therefore a risk stratification model for discriminating and diminishing heterogeneity is urgently needed. 46 In particular, as is presented in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures S3, S4 , and S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop. 2021.100269, the model can separate BC patients who received NAC into different risk stratums. Especially, median DFS of the high-risk group for BC patients who received NAC is <2 years, which would severely affect the quality of life of patients in this cohort. Fortunately, the model could help clinicians to select potential high-risk cohort of recurrence and conduct clinical trials to decrease the incidence of relapse.",

(ii) Several studies have identified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on residual disease after NAC as an independent prognostic predictor, 27, 40 but tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on residual disease were not evaluated in our study. (iii) Fine-needle aspiration for metastatic axillary nodes before NAC and/or evaluation of fibrosis status in resected specimens were not routinely carried out. We were unable to compare the performance of the risk stratification nomogram with other models (e.g. NRI and NPRI), while the model was compared with most predictive models using the data in our center. (iv) Although our team considered HER2 status and treatment, not all HER2\u00fe BC patients received HER2-targeted therapy. In fact, there do exist cases, where a predictive prognostic estimation of an HER2\u00fe without trastuzumab BC patient is required, particularly in the developing countries. The risk stratification model we developed can also be applied in this population. (v) The newest National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend six to eight cycles of NAC in BC patients (https://www.nccn.org/patients/guide lines/cancers.aspx). However, the study population received a median of four cycles of NAC (range, two to eight cycles) according to the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association guidelines for the treatment of BC in 2012-2015. Shorter cycle of NAC compared to the current guidelines may have an effect on the precise assessment of RCB. Given these drawbacks, the application of risk stratification nomogram needs to be further verified.",

CI, confidence interval; OS, overall survival. independent cohorts of non-pCR patients (SupplementaryFigure S5, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop. 2021.100269), respectively, were obviously higher than those reported in the study by Colleoni et al., mainly because of the continued progress in therapeutic guidelines and fast improvement in drug of NAC in recent years and inclusion of patients with pCR in our study. The German BC Group reported that the 5-year DFS rate varied from 60% to 85% in 2018,42 which was consistent with the present study. Patients within the low-risk group had apparently better prognosis, with an 8-year DFS of 89.4%, compared with a median DFS of 23.67 months and 77.80 months in the high-risk group and moderate-risk group, respectively (SupplementaryFigure S6,available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.esmoop.2021.100269). This further confirms that the survival of BC patients who received NAC varies greatly,",
