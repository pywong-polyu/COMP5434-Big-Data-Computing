A numeric scoring pattern was used to assess the awareness, willingness, and perception levels of respondents to the first phase of the vaccination exercise. The outcome variables (awareness, perception, and willingness) were further categorized as 'satisfactory' or 'unsatisfactory' based on their individual mean scores from a maximum obtainable score which serve as cut-off marks. Scores above the mean scores obtained for these outcome variables were classified as 'satisfactory responses' and vice versa [20] . Inferential statistics (logistic regression model) was used. The logistic regression model was used to identify factors that influence awareness, perception, and willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Univariate associations were ascertained with each demographic variable and the outcome variable (Crude odds ratio; cOR). A multivariable logistic regression model was also created to estimate associations (adjusted odds ratios; aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with significance set at p = 0.05 were used [21] .",

This may be due to efforts made by the government. Before the commencement of the vaccination exercise in Nigeria, the government, in collaboration with UNICEF and other agencies such as the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), embarked on raising awareness to address some of the bottlenecks to COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Sensitisation programs and Stakeholder's engagements with health workers, traditional and community leaders, community youth leaders, market women and those that can influence family and friends were held across the country. There were series of trainings as well as mobilisation and community enlightenment on the safety and importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine [23] . In this study, being a Muslim or a Christian influences awareness of COVID-19 vaccination more than being unaffiliated. The low awareness of the unaffiliated may also be due to the small size of our sample. Gender and age did not significantly affect the level of awareness in this study, which was similar to a previous study [22] . This may be due to worldwide COVID-19 vaccine advocacy and the indiscriminate intensified efforts of the Nigerian government to ensure all residents, regardless of their demographic status, know about the arrival and commencement of the vaccination exercise. Enhancing situational awareness of information generates knowledge and behaviour that enables people to develop a mental model towards perception, comprehension and prediction of the future status of an event [24] . In this study, findings showed the main sources of COVID-19 vaccination information were the Media (television, radio, and newspapers), health workers and social media platforms. A similar study carried out in Poland showed experts' materials as a major source of information on COVID-19 vaccines [25] . Health workers and mass media have been identified as important sources of health information for the general population [26, 27] . Doctors and other health workers have been identified as potential communicators through which messages emphasizing the medical and social benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine can be effectively disseminated [28] . To counter misinformation and improve trust, the NPHCDA in partnership with multinational media platforms in Nigeria, has engaged in various initiatives to ensure residents of Nigeria get credible information on COVID-19 vaccination. For instance, there was a range of Facebook frames and Instagram stickers that allowed people to share their support for getting vaccinated with their family and friends. The frames and stickers include banners with a statement such as 'Let's Get Vaccinated' or 'I Got My COVID-19 Vaccine' [29] .",

This may mean that people within the younger age group think they have better immunity and may not be necessarily vaccinated [31] . The elderly might have a perceived fear of the side effects and likely complications [32, 33] . It may also be because the younger participants are more exposed to vaccine-related misinformation [31] . This may require further investigation. It is worthy of note that trust, confidence, and belief in a program influence the acceptance and successful outcome. The government should intensify efforts for the highest possible outreach through the major sources of information identified in this study. Safety issues with COVID-19 vaccines should be continuously addressed by tailoring clear and reliable targeted messages to promote engagement and acceptance.",
