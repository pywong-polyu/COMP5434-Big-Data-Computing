MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) has been used to facilitate an individual therapy for PTSD. This study was an initial test of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MDMAfacilitated CBCT. Six couples with varying levels of baseline relationship satisfaction in which one partner was diagnosed with PTSD participated in a condensed version of the 15-session CBCT protocol delivered over 7 weeks. There were two sessions in which both members of the couple were administered MDMA. All couples completed the treatment protocol, and there were no serious adverse events in either partner. There were significant improvements in clinician-assessed, patient-rated, and partner-rated PTSD symptoms (pre-to post-treatment/follow-up effect sizes ranged from d = 1.85-3.59), as well as patient depression, sleep, emotion regulation, and trauma-related beliefs. In addition, there were significant improvements in patient and partner-rated relationship adjustment and happiness (d =.64-2.79). These results are contextualized in relation to prior results from individual MDMA-facilitated psychotherapy and CBCT for PTSD alone. MDMA holds promise as a facilitator of CBCT to achieve more robust and broad effects on individual and relational functioning in those with PTSD and their partners.",

MDMA's (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) empathogenic and neurocognitive properties make it a promising facilitator of this trauma-focused, empirically supported relational therapy (e.g. . Previous studies using MDMA with individual psychotherapy have yielded significant improvements in PTSD symptoms, and other outcomes such as increased openness to experience, posttraumatic growth, and improvement in comorbid conditions (Gorman et al., 2020; Mithoefer et al., 2019 Mithoefer et al., , 2018 Wagner et al., 2017) . MDMA had not yet been tested alongside a stand-alone, empirically-supported psychotherapy for PTSD. We sought to fill this gap by using MDMA to potentially facilitate the effects of CBCT for PTSD.",

These trials have revealed significant improvements in clinicianand patient-rated PTSD severity, comorbid conditions, and relationship improvements (see Liebman et al., in press for review). Compared with individual therapies for PTSD, CBCT for PTSD focuses on the relationship between the participants as the treatment target and engages participants in developing their skills as a dyad, both in terms of communication as well as reduction of avoidance and challenging of beliefs. MDMA's empathogenic qualities are posited to be a natural fit with the purported mechanisms of CBCT for PTSD in that MDMA can support the dyadic process in psychotherapy through enhancing feelings of connection and greater ease in communicating. We therefore conducted an initial test of the safety, feasibility and efficacy of MDMA-facilitated CBCT in an uncontrolled trial of six couples with a range of baseline relationship satisfaction in which one member was diagnosed with PTSD resulting from a range of traumas. We hypothesized that MDMA-facilitated CBCT would be safe, feasible, and result in significant and sustained improvements in PTSD, its common comorbidities, and relationship adjustment and happiness.",

CBCT for PTSD includes content related to psychoeducation about trauma and relationships, increasing relational safety, communication skills, tools for behavioural approach, and dyadic cognitive intervention related to problematic traumarelated and relationship cognitions. The first three sessions of CBCT were delivered in person the day before the first MDMA session (4 hours), and sessions 4 and 5 focused on feelings and thoughts (1 hour) were delivered in person the morning before MDMA administration (6-8 hours). An integration session (1.5 hours) took place the morning after the MDMA session. Following this intensive weekend of treatment, sessions 6 through 9 of CBCT were delivered biweekly via secure video over the next 2.5 weeks (1.25 hours each). The second intensive weekend consisted of sessions 10 and 11 focused on appraising blame and trust (2 hours) delivered in person the day before the second MDMA session, the second MDMA session (6-8 hours), and an integration session (1.5 hours) the following day. The final four sessions of CBCT (sessions 12 to 15) were conducted weekly over video (1.25 hours each). The entire duration of treatment was 7 weeks.",

            "text": "This is the first study to investigate the use of MDMA to facilitate a therapy established to be efficacious outside of MDMA treatment studies. Our initial data indicates that MDMA delivered in combination with CBCT for PTSD appears to be safe, does not appear to be treatment-interfering, and may potentiate the treatment effects for PTSD and the larger relationship context in which it exists. In the 1970s and 1980s, before MDMA was placed on schedule 1, it was used in clinical practice to facilitate couple therapy, although no controlled trials were conducted. MDMA has more recently been studied to facilitate an individual therapy for PTSD . This initial study suggests that MDMAfacilitated CBCT holds promise in facilitating trauma recovery and achieving broader relational outcomes not fully realized with individual evidence-based treatment for PTSD. The effect sizes for improvements in PTSD and common co-occurring conditions in this pilot study were greater than those found with individually delivered MDMA-facilitated psychotherapy for PTSD (see Mithoefer et al., 2019 for pooled preto post-treatment effect in six phase 2 RCTs of approximately d = 1.20). In addition, the effects on PTSD, other symptoms, and relationship outcomes in this study were on par with, or greater than, those previously achieved with CBCT alone. More specifically, the largest pre-to post-treatment PTSD effect sizes found with CBCT come from waitlist controlled trial with a mixed trauma sample. In that study, the effects for clinician-rated PTSD from pre-to post-treatment were g = 1.82, and g = .64 for patient-rated and g = .15 for partner-rated relationship adjustment. In comparison, the effects in the current trial were d = 2.10 for clinician-rated PTSD and d = .82 for patient-rated and g = .64 for partner-rated overall relationship adjustment. Interestingly, in the current study, across all outcomes, the effects were generally largest at 6-month follow-up, suggesting that MDMA facilitation may confer ongoing benefits. It is important to note that comparison of these effect sizes is tentative because of the small sample and lack of a control condition in the current study.",

We are currently preparing a Phase 2 randomized controlled trial to more rigorously investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-facilitated CBCT. Moreover, the therapy was delivered by expert therapists in each of the modalities, which is expected at this stage of treatment development, but limits generalizability. The size of the trial precluded examination of potential moderators of treatment outcomes (e.g. gender of patient and partner, pre-treatment relationship distress, type of index trauma), as well as mechanisms of treatment action. These are important questions to consider in future studies examining the use of MDMA to facilitate existing evidence-based treatments.",
