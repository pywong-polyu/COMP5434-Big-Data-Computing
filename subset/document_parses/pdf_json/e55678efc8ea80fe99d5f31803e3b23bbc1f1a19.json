Methods This was a 1-year observational study, as a continuation of the previous 3 months prospective study of pediatric patients with T1D conducted at Sidra Medicine in Qatar. The study enrolled individuals aged 7-18 years with T1D > 1 year, on MDI with self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring, with no prior pump experience, and with an HbA1c level < 12.5% (< 113 mmol/mol). After the first 3 months of HCL use, patients were followed at 6, 9 and 12 months, where HbA1c was obtained and pump data were collected. Results All 30 participants (age 10.24 \u00b1 2.6 years) who initiated HCL completed 12 months of HCL system use in Auto Mode. The participants used the sensor 88.4 \u00b1 6.5% of the time with Auto Mode usage 85.6 \u00b1 7.4% during 12 months of HCL system use. HbA1c decreased from 8.2 \u00b1 1.4% (66 \u00b1 15.3 mmol/mol) at baseline, to 6.7 \u00b1 0.5% (50 \u00b1 5.5 mmol/mol) at 3 months (p = 0.02) and remained stable to 7.1 \u00b1 0.6 (54 \u00b1 6.6 mmol/mol) at 12 months (p = 0.02). TIR (70-180 mg/dL) increased from 46.9% at baseline to 71.9% at 1 month and remained above 70% during the 12 months of HCL use. Conclusion HCL system (MiniMed 670G) in children and adolescents previously treated with MDI significantly improves glycemic outcomes (HbA1c and Time in Ranges) immediately during the first month. This improved glycemic control was maintained over the 1 year following Auto Mode initiation.",

The use of Continious Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Continious Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is associated with a reduction in HbA1c, both when used separately and together [1] . Recent technological advances have integrated CSII with CGM, where insulin delivery can be automated by sensor glucose (SG) driven algorithms. Insulin delivery suspension when reaching a low glucose level [2, 3] or in the prediction of a low glucose level [4, 5] has demonstrated a significant reduction in hypoglycemia exposure. Closed-loop systems are designed to maintain glucose levels at a predetermined target by linking CGM information with an insulin dosing algorithm for automated subcutaneous insulin delivery by a pump [6] .",

            "text": "The MiniMed 670G [7] is the first hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin delivery system for use in diabetes care since 2017 and uses an algorithm to adjust basal insulin delivery automatically every 5 min based on SG values [8] . Several short-term studies on the HLC system have shown improved HbA1c, time in target range, and SG variability in children [9] , adolescents and adults [10, 11] . Glycemic outcomes in the pediatric age have been traditionally lower, while the causes are not clear and the underlying causes are to be defined. Three-month observational study [12] has shown that children and adolescents with T1D on MDI therapy without prior pump experience can successfully initiate the HCL system, using a concise structured 10-day protocol and achieve better glycemic outcome than previous treatment with MDI. Another study on the HCL system in children and youth with T1D shows that glycemic control is improved with Auto Mode use when measured by percent TIR, SG and HbA1c during the 6 months follow-up [13] . It remains to be determined whether these short-term effects on improved glycemic control with HCL systems are maintained in the long-term period. Long-term effect (6 and 12 months) of HCL shows scarce results in terms of Auto Mode usage, sensor wear, HbA1c, time in the target range and pump discontinuation [13] [14] [15] [16] . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 1-year HCL system on glycemic control in children and adolescents with T1D previously treated with MDI.",

As the sensor wear time drives, the Auto Mode usage is required for better outcomes, and the 88.4 \u00b1 6.5% sensor usage achieved at 12 months was one of the important achievements. This high percentage use of automation and no dropout rates can be attributed to the specific selection/initiation protocol including the initial use of the system as a sensor alone for 7 days, although the relative contribution of each component cannot be determined from the study. The study confirmed previous conclusions, that increased Auto Mode usage is associated with lower HbA1c and increased TIR, resulting in that patients with both higher sensor wear times and increased Auto Mode usage had incrementally lower HbA1c than patients with lower sensor wear time and less Auto Mode usage [17] . Our data showed high Auto Mode usage of 85.6% at 1 year, which is higher than 51% at 6 months after HCL initiation [13] .",

The 10-day initiation HCL protocol for individuals on MDI enables the activation of the Auto Mode feature after 3 days of Manual Mode use, which is significantly shorter compared to 2-4 weeks, reported in other studies [9, 11, 27] . This shortened process might be better accepted by those initiating the technology. Proper settings of the pump in order to decrease patient being burdened by exits and additional SMBG requirements are important elements in the initiation and follow-up process. Modifying the ICR by increasing the meal bolus dose by almost 20% during the first month of Auto Mode use is necessary when initiating individuals on the HCL system from MDI regimens, which is similar to previous reports [28] . Our study shows that further strengthening of ICR was needed on the long-term period, as the TDD of insulin increases in children due to their growth and evaluation on ICR should be performed on each visit.",

All individuals enrolled in this study completed 1-year usage of the MiniMed 670G system with Auto Mode with no dropouts, unlike the previously reported studies and a significant decrease of the calibration was observed. In our clinical practice, patients' selection criteria, concise initiation protocol, participants' high engagement with the HCL system as well as structured follow-up, and appropriate pump settings were key contributors to achieve and maintain better glycemic control. Further investigation on a more varied larger population and patient satisfaction should be performed to confirm these findings.",
