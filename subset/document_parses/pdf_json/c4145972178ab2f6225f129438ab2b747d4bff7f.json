Despite the enormous amount of literature since the beginning of the pandemic in the adult population, information on the evolution of COVID-19 in pregnancy and newborn infants, especially in extremely premature neonates, is limited. COVID-19 infection, particularly pneumonia, has been reported in pregnant women [2] . However, no evidence of intrauterine infection of the fetus has been reported until recently. Several studies have suggested that vertical transmission is possible from mother to infant, based on IgM antibodies [3, 4] and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detected from blood and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs [4] [5] [6] . Neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in late preterm infants following severe COVID-19 infection in the mother [5, 7, 8] . COVID-19 infection in extremely premature infants, notably, <28 weeks of gestation, is not reported, as most of the infections are reported late in pregnancy. Here, we report a case of respiratory failure due to perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an extremely premature infant at 27-weeks of gestation, compromised by prematurity and respiratory distress syndrome with surfactant deficiency. Informed consent was obtained from the parents for the publication of the case report on their infant.",

The mother was seen a day before delivery for abdominal pain and diarrhea, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, was managed conservatively, and discharged home. She was admitted with profuse bleeding per vagina from a suspected placental abruption. The mother was administered betamethasone, magnesium sulfate, and antibiotics on admission for active labor. Chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated patchy bilateral opacities, suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring a 5 L/min flow of 100% O 2 to maintain normoxia. Cesarean section was planned under spinal anesthesia for a frank breech presentation; however, the baby was delivered vaginally as the baby's foot was noted at the introitus. A 27-week-gestational age (GA) male infant was delivered and transferred to the warmer for stabilization. It is to be noted that the baby was placed at least 6 feet away from the mother, with no direct contact at birth because of the mother's positivity for SARS-CoV-2. The infant received positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) by the Neopuff (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zeland) device for apnea and bradycardia. The infant was intubated for desaturations at 7 min of age, which resulted in a rapid increase in heart rate and SpO 2, and was able to wean to 0.21 FiO 2 by 9 min of age. The APGAR scores were 1, 5, and 7 at 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively, and he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for further management. The infant was appropriate for gestational age, with a birth weight of 1185 g (79th percentile on Fenton curves) [9] .",

The infant was discharged home on daily budesonide and home oxygen therapy (0.5 L 100%O 2 ) via the nasal canula at 42 weeks post menstrual age (PMA).",

Real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values are inversely related to the amount of nucleic acid in a specimen sample. As such, while Ct values depend upon specimen collection factors and quality, Ct values can also provide an informal measure of both the patient's infectivity and viral load. The patient had lower Ct values initially, suggesting higher viral loads close to birth. Over time, increasing Ct values indicated a gradually decreasing viral load, with negative tests reported on days 50 and 57 ( Table 1 ). The parents visited their infant at resolution of their infection in full personal protective equipment (PPE) with airborne precautions until the time the infant was taken off precautions after the second negative test.",

The infant received one platelet transfusion, and his platelet count stabilized above 100,000/mm 3 by day 13. Anticoagulation therapy was deferred during the initial management of the thrombus in view of the risk of a life-threatening hemorrhage in a critically sick premature infant. Serial doppler studies of the IVC demonstrated a gradual decrease in the size of the thrombus over time. The infant was treated with IV acetaminophen for five days for moderate to large ductus arteriosus in the third week after birth. A repeat echocardiogram post-treatment demonstrated a small ductus. Bilateral grade I intraventricular hemorrhage was noted on serial head ultrasounds, with no hydrocephalus.

            "text": "We report a case of severe acute respiratory infection with hypoxic respiratory failure and likely COVID-19 pneumonia in a 27-week-GA extremely premature infant. The infant had problems associated with extreme prematurity, such as surfactant deficiency from hyaline membrane disease and a patent ductus arteriosus. The infant improved after surfactant administration and then worsened to develop HRF. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered because of a negative sepsis work-up, NP swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and presence of systemic signs of COVID-19 infection, such as an elevated level of C-reactive protein and thrombocytopenia in the infant. The clinical improvement with dexamethasone and a normalizing C-reactive protein level also strengthened the diagnosis of COVID-19. In adults, older age, male sex, and co-morbidities increase the risk of COVID-19 pneumonia and a prolonged clinical course [10] . Dexamethasone treatment improves mortality from severe and critical COVID-19 in adult patients [10] . An immature immune system and the lack of protective maternal antibodies due to extreme prematurity may have contributed to the prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in severe HRF and a protracted course in the infant. The duration of invasive and non-invasive ventilation (55 days) is not unusual in an extremely premature infant. However, it is not typical for infants born with a weight >1000 g to be mechanically ventilated for prolonged periods. SARS-CoV-2 virus may have contributed to the prolonged ventilation and respiratory support in this infant. The infant was SARS-CoV-2-positive for a prolonged period of six weeks, with Ct values not reaching the range wherein culturable virus can be confidently ruled out (e.g., >34 cycles) [11] . COVID-19 has been reported in an extremely premature infant positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of first week after birth [12] . However, unlike our case, the infant had no clinical or biochemical signs suggestive of COVID-19 infection. There is paucity of literature on the correlation between prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and inhaled budesonide administered to treat chronic lung disease of prematurity. However, early administration of inhaled budesonide has been shown to reduce the need for urgent medical care and recovery time from COVID-19 in adults in a randomized control trial [13] .",

However, defining vertical transmission based on isolated case reports is difficult. Antibody titers could have helped in differentiating vertical from horizontal transmission. However, the absence of maternal and infant antibody titers and placental cultures are the limitations of the report. Several studies have suggested that vertical transmission is possible from mother to infant, based on IgM antibodies [3, 4] and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA isolated from blood and nasopharyngeal swabs [4, 6] . Transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 in a neonate born to a mother who became infected with the virus in the third trimester has been reported [17] . A systematic review of 11 studies did not demonstrate any intrauterine or transplacental transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the fetus during the third trimester of pregnancy [18] . In a large study of 101 newborns born to Covid-19-positive mothers, no evidence of perinatal transmission was observed, despite two infants having results demonstrating low viral loads [19] . Current evidence suggests that the likelihood of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very low [20] . Despite the weight of the evidence demonstrating the lack of in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, on maternal-fetal interface cells such as stromal cells, cytotrophoblasts, and syncytiotrophoblasts on the placenta and other fetal organs [21] may suggest that vertical transmission is possible and needs to be investigated further.",

A dexamethasone course significantly improved lung aeration, with decreasing lung opacities on day 12 after birth.The infant's respiratory status worsened on day 5, with the development of severe hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) as indicated by extensive opacities on chest X-ray(Figure 1C), requiring 100% O2 and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Of note, the infant had an elevated level of C-reactive protein (31.7 mg/L), thrombocytopenia, and a moderately elevated level of D-dimer (1.17-1.34 \u00b5 g/mL), along with a worsening clinical status. The differential diagnosis included bacterial or fungal infection, pneumonia from Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma hominis, other viral etiologies including SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal swabs from the infant tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR at 24 and 48 h of age",
