            "text": "The long charge time of electric vehicles compared with the refueling time of gasoline vehicles, has been a major barrier to the mass adoption of EVs 1-4 . Currently, the charge time to 80% state of charge in electric vehicles such as Tesla with fast charging capabilities is >30 minutes 5 . For a comparable recharging experience as gasoline vehicles, governments and automobile companies have set <15 min with 500 cycles as the goal for extreme fast charging (XFC) of electric vehicles 6,7 . One of the biggest challenges to enable XFC for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is to avoid lithium plating [8][9][10] . Although significant research is taking place to enable XFC [11][12] [13] [14] , no promising technology/strategy has still emerged for mainstream commercial LIBs. Here, we propose a thermally modulated charging protocol (TMCP) by active thermal switching for XFC, i.e., retaining the battery heat during XFC with the switch OFF for boosting the kinetics to avoid lithium plating while dissipating the heat after XFC with the switch ON for reducing side reactions. Our proposed TMCP strategy enables XFC of commercial high-energy-density LIBs with charge time <15 min and >500 cycles while simultaneously beating other targets set by US Department of energy 6 (discharge energy density > 180 Wh/kg and capacity loss <4.5%). Further, we develop a thermal switch based on shape memory alloy and demonstrate the feasibility of integrating our TMCP in commercial battery thermal management system.",

Reducing the charge time to 15 min needs a charge rate of 6C, which can trigger lithium plating on graphite anodes and cause dramatic capacity fade in LIBs. Eliminating or mitigating lithium plating 8-10 , which requires faster ion transport and kinetics in LIBs, is one of the biggest R&D challenges for enabling XFC. Broadly, R&D efforts to develop XFC LIBs can be categorized as the development of new electrolytes 11,15 , electrode materials 12,16,17 , charge protocols 13,18 , and heating strategies (i.e., improving the kinetics by increasing the temperature before XFC) 14,19-21 . Among these approaches, only heating strategies have shown promising results for existing high-energy-density LIBs and thus have the potential to enable XFC of electric vehicles in the near term.",

Two heating strategies have been proposed/enacted for fast charging: 1) System-level TB control using battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) 20,21 by adjusting h and TC using coolant modulation, e.g., increasing or reducing h by starting or stopping the coolant flow and/or changing TC by heating or cooling the coolant.",

Based on our validated ECT model of battery packs with such low CTP ratios (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Note 1), a large portion of battery heat (~40%) is dissipated to the pack due to its high thermal mass even if coolant flow is completely stopped, thereby limiting the temperature rise during charging. This also results in negative anode potential which indicates high likelihood of lithium plating. 2) cell-level TB control with increased Q using embedded nickel foil heaters and reduced h by thermally insulating the cell 14 . This method enables higher C rates as the increase of TB is observably higher than the system-level strategy. However, there are two major challenges with this method. Since the battery is always thermally insulated, TB is high even during discharge and rest and the high average TB during operation can dramatically lower the overall performance and lifetime [23] [24] [25] (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This effect becomes noticeable with increasing ambient temperature as the side reaction rates increase rapidly with the temperature. Further, adding extra metal foils in the cell is incompatible with existing battery manufacturing process which has been perfected by the industry over decades. The intrusive nature of the embedded heater may also raise safety concerns.",

            "text": "In this work, we propose a thermally modulated charging protocol (TMCP) which combines the good traits of both the cell and system-level strategies by active thermal switching (ATS), i.e., low h (hoff) at cell level during XFC and high h (hon) during discharge/rest (Fig. 1a) . A proof-of-concept study of commercial highenergy-density LCO/C LIBs under various thermal protocols demonstrates that our TMCP consistently outperforms existing thermal protocols. With the TMCP, the XFC performance of commercial LIBs exceeds the key DOE targets. Based on electrochemical analysis and postmortem characterizations using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray tomography, the improved XFC performance is attributed to the mitigated lithium plating during XFC and reduced side reactions during discharging by ATS. For practical implementation of our approach with existing BTMSs, we have developed an ATS device with small mass and volume (1.4% and 3.0% compared to that of battery, respectively) using cost-effective shape memory alloy, which has the potential to enable XFC in commercial battery packs.

The simulation indicates the range of hoff needed to reach optimal TB and avoid negative anode potential for lithium plating mitigation during XFC (Fig. 1b) . Figure 1c reveals that a switching ratio (hon/hoff) of ~10 is needed as high hon is desired for the other states. As a proof of concept, we perform 6C1C cycling tests (6C charge and 1C discharge; see Methods for details) of commercial high-energy-density LIBs with our TMCP. Representative 5Ah LCO/C LIBs with C/3 energy density 240.8 Wh/kg, maximal charge rate 1C, and maximum discharge rate 2C are used for this XFC study (see details in Methods). A linear actuator is used to simulate ATS experimentally to validate the efficacy of TMCP ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The springs hold the battery during XFC (switch OFF and and discharging (i.e., the system-level strategy 18 ); and 3) insulation: the cell is always thermally insulated as proposed by Yang et al. 14 . Fig. 1e displays the representative battery temperature evolution in a XFC cycle under different thermal protocols. With the switch OFF, the rise of TB during XFC is comparable to the insulation case. After XFC, turning on the switch allows for efficient cooling and optimal control of TB. In contrast, the insulation case leads to high temperature during rest and discharge which is highly undesirable 25 (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). By fitting the temperature profile with thermal models (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Note 2), the effective h is extracted for various cases (Fig. 1f ). It shows that the switching ratio of 10.4 is >10 as needed (Fig. 1c ) and the effective h with the switch OFF and ON is comparable to h in the case of insulation and cooling, respectively.",

It decreases to <15 min in the case of insulation and switch due to the boost of battery kinetics by high temperature. As discussed earlier, the high temperature is beneficial to avoid negative anode potential and mitigate Li plating during XFC, which can be verified using the voltage feature related to the intercalation of plated Li during rest [27] [28] [29] .

The disappearance of the inflection feature indicates the mitigation of lithium plating and explains the high coulombic efficiency of these two cases ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). This further leads to the extended 6C1C cycle life associated with 20% capacity fade (Fig. 2c) . The lower cycle life in the insulation case (665), compared to the switch (975), is attributed to the increased side reaction rates at higher discharge temperature. This effect is more pronounced at higher ambient temperature (~40 \u00b0C) resulting in cycle life of 334 for the insulation as compared to 560 for the switch which still exceeds the US DOE target (Figs. 2d and 2e). Figure 2f demonstrates the XFC cycle life which is defined as the number of cycles that batteries can be charged to 80% SOC in 15 min. Due to the limit of tc ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ), the XFC cycle life can be lower than the overall cycle life at 20% capacity loss (Fig. 2b) , e.g., the XFC cycle life for the case of cooling and CM is 0. Our approach enables >500 XFC cycles at different ambient temperatures and the superiority of \"switch\" over \"insulation\" increases with ambient temperature. Further, we perform 1C1C cycling tests (1C charge and 1C discharge) using normal cooling condition and compare the results with those of 6C1C cycling using the ATS (Supplementary Fig.   7 ). The comparable operation time of 6C1C and 1C1C cycling reveals that the degradation related to XFC is largely reduced with our TMCP.",

To better understand the capacity fade in the case of ATS and cooling (i.e., our TMCP and the conventional thermal scheme for XFC), we investigated the degradation mechanism with electrochemical analysis (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and postmortem characterizations using optical microscopy, SEM, and X-ray tomography (Fig. 3 ). In the case of cooling, a large portion of the aged anode is covered by plated Li, and the particle feature becomes hardly visible due to the coverage ( Fig. 3b and 3e ). By comparison, the particle feature remains visible in most part of the aged anode while some particles are covered by a layer of reaction products in the case of ATS ( Fig. 3c and   3f ). These observations confirm the presence (cooling) or mitigation (ATS) of lithium plating as revealed by the dV/dt analysis (Fig. 2b) . This explains the different rate of capacity fade in the initial linear aging regime, which largely determines the cycle life. For the rapidly increased capacity loss after the initial stage, such transition has been reported in prior works [30] [31] [32] and is typically attributed to the rapid increase of lithium plating associated with battery aging, e.g., electrolyte consumption and reduced anode porosity.",

            "text": "The proof-of-concept study clearly demonstrates the benefits of TMCP for XFC. To integrate our approach in existing BTMSs, the desirable design rules for ATS devices are: 1) switching ratio \u2265 10; 2) minimal impact on the system-level volumetric and gravimetric energy density; 3) small power consumption for switching; 4) zero power consumption in the ON/OFF state to maximize the energy efficiency; 5) compatibility with existing BTMSs. For the switching ratio \u2265 10, solid/solid mechanical switch based on contact and separation is a promising option based on a thorough review study of thermal switches by Wehmeyer et. al. 33 . Thus, we built a prototype device by integrating a mechanical thermal switch based on shape memory alloy (SMA) with a heat sink plate (Fig. 4a) . SMA wires are selected for the active actuation using temperature-responsive phase and volume change, which satisfies the traits mentioned above. We purposely chose Nitinol SMA wires with a phase transition temperature > 60 \u00b0C to avoid any passive response to the environmental temperature. A bistable structure consisting of one spring steel strip and two pivot blocks is used for energy saving, i.e., energy is only consumed for the change of state (Fig. 4a) . The strip becomes concave or convex depending on the contraction of the SMA wire which triggers the rotation of pivot blocks. To switch from OFF to ON, a current pulse (1.5A and 5s) is applied to the right SMA wire to trigger the wire contraction and rotate the corresponding pivot block anticlockwise, and the gap between the battery and heat sink plate is closed as the spring strip becomes concave ( Supplementary Fig. 11a ). In the ON state, the pressure between the battery and heat sink comes from the elastic bands, which are used to mimic the pressure in practical battery packs. Reversely, heating the other SMA wire opens the gap (~0.5 mm) in a similar manner and brings the state back to OFF (Supplementary Fig. 11b ). The electrical energy consumed for the change of thermal state is ~36 J per cycle, which is negligible (~0.05%) compared to the charge/discharge energy of the cells (~18.5 Wh).",

Infrared thermal images of the cell display the different battery surface temperature during XFC (42.2 \u00b0C) and discharging (30.4 \u00b0C) (Fig. 4a) . ATS by the SMA device and the linear actuator demonstrates comparable thermal switching capability and results in similar evolution of temperature (Fig. 4b) and C rate (Fig. 4c) in a XFC cycle. Regardless of the ATS method, our TMCP leads to the XFC performance exceeding the targets set by DOE in terms of charge time (Fig. 4d) , capacity retention (Fig. 4e) , and discharge energy density after XFC (Fig. 4f) . The XFC cycle life (773) exceeds the DOE target (500) by 54.6% and the C/3 energy density after XFC is higher than the DOE target in the whole XFC cycle life. In addition to the XFC performance, the relative mass, volume, and material cost of the SMA-based thermal switch, compared to that of battery, is estimated to be 1.4%, 3.0%, 0.7-1.9%, respectively (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Table 3 and 4 ). The mass, volume, and cost of this BTMS-integrated switch can be further reduced by optimizing the design in the future work. Considering the long R&D and commercialization cycles (~15-20 years) for new electrolytes and electrode materials, our approach using existing costeffective materials (SMA) could provide a short to medium-term solution for enabling XFC. Besides XFC applications, ATS can improve battery performance at different temperatures by retaining or dissipating battery heat as needed, e.g., retaining battery heat is beneficial for discharging at low temperature as demonstrated by Hao et. al. 34 .",

The board acquires the battery operation status (i.e., charge or discharge) from the cell voltage reading and changes the status of actuator (i.e., the original or elongated state) accordingly. The same logic is applied to the thermal switch device based on SMA. At the start or end of XFC, the status of switch is tuned by heating a specific SMA wire (0.254 mm Nitinol wire, Kellogg) using a current pulse. The thermal interface material (TIM) layer (Laird TPLI210) was selected for ensuring good thermal contact and durability.

Verification of our ECT model by comparing to the anode potential measured in a three-electrode cell during charging at a) C/3, b) 1C, and b) 6C. Evolution of battery temperature and anode potential during XFC of LCO/C cells using d) the system-level thermal strategy and e) the local thermal control of the cell. We use the global thermal conductance per unit area (hgl) ranging from 10 W/m 2 -K to 1000 W/m 2 -K to mimic the different status of coolant flow. Regardless of the flow status, the heat leakage from the cell to the BTMS reduces the battery temperature rise during XFC and results in the negative anode potential. In contrast, the minimum anode potential can maintain positive by local thermal control of the cell with h ~10 W/m 2 -K.Supplementary Fig. 2 | Impact of operation temperature on the cycle life of LIBs 1 . The optimal operation temperature is ~25 \u00b0C for cycling at slow or medium rates (e.g., 1C1C cycling). Increasing the temperature leads to increased side reactions and reduced cycle life, while the cycle life decreases at low temperature due to lithium plating. In the case of insulation average temperature is much higher than the case of thermal switch which adversely affects the cycle life of the insulation case. , and is the ohmic resistance, solid-electrolyte interfacial (SEI) layer resistance, and the charge transfer resistance, respectively. , , and W represents the capacity of the SEI layer, the double layer capacitance, and the Warburg diffusion element, respectively. b. The EIS spectra of pristine and aged 5Ah LCO/C cells. From the analysis, the aged cell in the case of cooling has the higher Rct related to the severe lithium plating, and the highest RSEI is observed in the case of switch associated with the longest XFC cycle life. Comparison of c) and d) in the aged cell from \"cooling\" and \"switch\" indicates the different aging mechanism: the larger RSEI in the switch case corresponds to more side reaction products and the more significant increase of Rct in \"cooling\" relates to the severe lithium plating. Supplementary Fig. 9 | SEM images of a) pristine cathode and aged cathodes for the case of cooling and switch. No observable cracking is found in the aged cathodes, which verifies the minimal effect of cathode aging on the capacity degradation in our study 3 . The scale bar is 25 \u03bcm in these panels. ",
