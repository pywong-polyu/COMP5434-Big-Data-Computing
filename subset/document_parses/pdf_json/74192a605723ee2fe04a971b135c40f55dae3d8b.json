We sought to apply opensource product development to PAPRs to enable alternative sources of supply and further innovation.",

As a consequence, the availability of high-quality respiratory protection has been problematic, causing healthcare institutions to reuse normally disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs; N95-type masks) and turn to non-traditional devices as substititues [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Nontraditional supply chains commonly involve community-based collaborations among independent engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and volunteers in partnership with healthcare and academic institutions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . While multiple non-traditional designs for simple PPE products such as face shields have emerged, and multiple commercial and non-traditional technologies and methods have been developed to decontaminate and reuse N95-type masks 11, 12 , few alternative sources of supply exist for more complex products. This is particularly true of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), which can not only be worn by individuals unable to fit N95-style masks, but are also more comfortable in many settings and may provide a higher level of respiratory protection. Ongoing efforts to increase the supply of PAPRs have largely involved large manufacturing companies who have been provided with government support (e.g. the 3M Ford Limited-Use Public Health Emergency PAPR) 13, 14 .",

Common reasons for being unable to wear an N95 mask are the presence of facial hair and poor mask fit for individuals with small or narrow faces; the latter is often revealed by qualitative fit tests routinely performed on HCWs. 16 It is estimated that ~10% of HCWs fail fit testing, 17 and for these individuals PAPRs are the best, and in some instances, the only alternative. N95 masks are often reused in pandemic conditions due to supply shortages, leading to concerns about further loss of fit after multiple don-doff cycles 18 . In addition, HCWs report that PAPRs are more comfortable than masks in situations in which continuous respiratory protection is required for many hours, especially for those who have respiratory symptoms under normal circumstances or who work in hot conditions. It has also been observed that many healthcare workers who must wear N95-style masks day after day (i.e. during a sustained pandemic) experience painful abrasions 19, 20 . Attempts to mitigate this discomfort by using creams, tapes or loosening the straps that hold masks against a user's face degrade respiratory protection 21 . A recent systematic review of the available literature has identified a need to rigorously investigate all of these issues. 15 Commercial PAPRs certified by NIOSH offer higher filtration efficiency as compared to N95 masks (99.97% vs. 95%) 15, 22 and have assigned protection factors between 2.5 and 100 fold, substantially higher than those of N95-style masks 23 . PAPRs are also better suited to periods of very high demand: whereas N95 masks are designed for one-time use, commercially available PAPRs are designed to be sterilized for reuse 24 . Feedback from healthcare institutions following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic confirmed that HCWs with underlying respiratory conditions and individuals who must perform physically demanding tasks prefer PAPRs over masks; PAPRs are also broadly perceived to provide superior respiratory protection as compared to masks, which increases HCW confidence in highrisk settings 17 . However, the acquisition costs of commercial PAPRs are ~1,000-fold higher than N95 masks. PAPR filters, which must be changed regularly are also relatively expensive 17 . PAPRs are therefore in short supply in most US healthcare institutions, which typically seek the lowest cost .

The blower unit pulls room air through one or multiple high-efficiency particulate air/ high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter cartridges, thereby removing aerosols and small particles. The blower pushes the filtered air into the facepiece (also known as a hood) through the hose, where it is either breathed in by the user or (in case of a loose-fitting facepiece) escapes through gaps between the facepiece material and the user's body.

(which was not certified by peer review) Additionally, the regulatory approval process for PAPRs via the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is significantly more complex than for simpler devices such as face shields. In the U.S., PAPRs are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) under the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134 ). This requires that PAPRs be approved by NIOSH but does not require 510(k) premarket notification or clearance by the FDA 27,28 . One challenge is that NIOSH testing standards are highly prescriptive, typically describing the precise instruments to be used in a test. The physical or engineering principles underlying these tests are not always obvious. The prescriptive approach may be appropriate under normal circumstances when it is important to maintain quality standards in the face of cost pressure, but is problematic in emergency conditions in which the approved testing apparatus is in short supply. In the current work we therefore rely on \"NIOSH-equivalent\" testing to assess performance.",

User feedback on the functionality and comfort of the design was then obtained at a major US academic medical center from four participants: two healthcare providers and two research technicians who used PAPRs regularly as part of standard PPE prior to the pandemic. As mentioned above, performance testing was conducted using alternative procedures and with fewer samples than is required for NIOSH certification. An additional limitation is that PAPR certification, like certification of most medical products, requires a manufacturing process controlled by a quality management system (e.g. one to ISO 9001 standards). Achieving this is only possible in a commercial setting, and we are therefore collaborating with an industrial partner to create a design amenable to large-scale manufacturing and certified to NIOSH standards.

Two Milwaukee filter cartridges and one Custom Filters filter were challenged with KCl aerosol at 230 lpm. Filtration efficiency with 300 nm aerosol size was found to be 99.99% and 100.00% for two replicate Milwaukee filters and 99.99% for the Custom Filters filter, thereby exceeding the NIOSH salt aerosol filtration efficiency criteria of 99.97%. Equipment was not available to measure filtration efficiency below 300 nm but it is generally observed that HEPA filtration efficiency is lowest at 300 nm and increases as particle size falls 42 .

However, this restricts the development of new products to NIOSH-approved manufacturers, which has had the effect of creating near-monopolies for some types of PPE. To improve resilience in future emergencies, regulators might consider how to optimally balance the risk of non-traditional PPE against the risk of no protection at all.

Despite these repeated calls for action and greater innovation, there has been little response from the commercial sector or from government: in the COVID-19 pandemic, most innovation has come from volunteer groups of scientists and clinicians allied with maker communities with access to rapid prototyping and fabrication equipment, technology that is increasingly inexpensive and available to ordinary citizens. 10 Thus, open source product development (OSPD) 25 emerges as perhaps the only avenue to mitigating existing weaknesses while increasing product innovation under both normal and crisis conditions. .

Ease of communication was evaluated by counting the number of words correctly transcribed in each task, normalized by baseline performance without the PAPR.

Key design decisions included determining size and orientation of the motorblower housing, orientation of the filters, and the method of donning/doffing the motor-blower unit.Feedback from manufacturing experts yielded a design that is amenable to large-scale production by injection molding the motor-blower housing component. PanFab PAPR designs are modular and compatible with several standard commercial PAPR components, including facepieces and filters, allowing for substitution of components in limited supply. The PanFab Custom Design compares favorably to the 3M Ford Limited-Use Public Health Emergency PAPR 13 with respect to weight and size, although the 3M Ford unit appears to use higher performance batteries.The safety and functionality of PanFab PAPRs was evaluated using protocols that closely followed NIOSH STP's and aimed to meet or exceed the functional objectives of those tests. Given the limitations imposed by pandemic conditions, it was necessary to use substitute tests in university laboratories rather than use a NIOSH-specific apparatus at a commercial pre-certification laboratory.PanFab PAPRs passed all of the performed tests, in various combinations of commercial and custom components. User feedback on the PAPRs was obtained from clinicians inexperienced in using PAPRs and technical research staff who routinely use PAPRs in a major Boston-area hospital. The PanFab Custom Design scored favorably as compared to the traditionally manufactured PAPRs (primarily from ILC Dover) available to hospital staff.Challenges in design, testing, and regulatory approval During early specification and prototyping, we faced significant challenges in locating relevant design criteria for PAPRs: there also exists very limited information in the public domain on testing equipment that could be used to validate prototypes based on physical properties and objective engineering criteria.
