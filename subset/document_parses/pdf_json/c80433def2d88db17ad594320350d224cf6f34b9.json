We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020. Results: In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 34% (8-54). As the COVID-19 contact restrictions are nearly fully eased, from December 2020, the probability of a large measles outbreak will increase to 38% (19-54), 46% (30-59), and 54% (43-64) assuming a 15%, 50%, and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases further to 43% (25-56), 54% (43-63), and 67% (59-72) for the same coverage scenarios respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of all restrictions can be overcome by conducting a SIA with \u2265 95% coverage in under-fives.",

Following guidance from the WHO, all countries suspended scheduled measles SIAs [6] [7] [8] . Measles control in Kenya is achieved by giving children a first dose of measlescontaining vaccine (MCV1) at 9 months, and a second dose (MCV2) from 18 months. SIAs, first introduced in 2002, are conducted periodically among children < 5 years or < 15 years for accelerated control of measles [9] . Based on the accumulation of susceptible children, the timing of such campaigns has typically been chosen to close immunity gaps in time to prevent potentially large measles outbreaks. A measles SIA originally planned for 2019 was rescheduled for February 2020 due to a shortfall in funding and postponed again following the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Our assumption of 15% reduction in vaccine coverage rates is based on reduction in vaccine clinic visits in Kilifi County (DHIS2 Routine Report) while the 50% reduction lies in the range of reported disruption in vaccination services from WHO immunisation pulse poll [6] . We assumed a 50% reduction in measles transmissibility given that COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented on 25th March 2020 were reported to have reduced social contacts and disease transmission by the same margin [20] . Although some restriction measures remain in place, e.g. nationwide curfew, others like the partial lockdown have since been eased and ban on international flights was lifted on 1st August 2020. While the assumption of a 50% reduction in measles transmission was applicable at the beginning of the epidemic due to stringent measures imposed, current herd immunity threshold may be much higher than originally assumed but still lower than pre-COVID-19 threshold.",

Here, a delay in age of MCV1 by 3 months resulted in a marginal increase in outbreak risk. For instance, assuming a 50% reduction in routine vaccination, a delay in vaccination would see the risk increase from 46% (30-59) to 53% (40-64) by the end of the year.

Following the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea reported more than a 25% reductions in MCV1 coverage [26, 27] .

The serological data estimates and the mixing matrix used in our study may not be fully representative of the country although we utilised national estimates of vaccination coverage, which was the main driver of predicted immunity. We did not explicitly model MCV2 delivery but assumed the overall effectiveness was an average of MCV1 and MCV2 efficacy weighted by the proportion of children who either receive MCV1 only or both doses. Finally, there is some uncertainty around the actual reduction in transmission due to variability in compliance with physical distancing measures in place.
