The COVID-19 pandemic forced people to stay at home. In some countries, this was voluntary while in other countries, this was in a non-voluntary capacity. People stayed home, and it was impossible to dine-in as restaurants were ordered to close their dine-in service. As a result, people spent more time in their kitchens, not only to cook meals but also as a personal hobby [1, 2] . *Correspondence should be addressed to: Sayaka Suzuki, E-mail: sayakas@fri.go.jp Fire Technology \u00d3 2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature Manufactured in The United States https://doi.org/10.1007/s10694-021-01177-z It is well known that cooking fires are a main cause of fires in residential homes, along with cigarette induced fires [3] [4] [5] . The number of residential fires increases in the afternoon to night, when people stay home, and are awake, peaking around dinner time. Cigarette induced fires, and resulting deaths, increase at night when people are sleeping [3] [4] [5] .",

In this study, the change in the number of cooking fires in residential homes, as well as the number of residential fires, during so-called initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated.

San Francisco reported far fewer cases of COVID-19 during this period. New York City and San Francisco implemented lockdown measures [6] [7] [8] [9] . Tokyo did not have so many reported COVID-19 cases but was on alert far earlier than the other cities examined here due to the Diamond Princess cruise ship situation. Tokyo was never locked down by government order but declared a state of emergency, with voluntary stay-at-home orders [10] . The UK was hoping to achieve herd immunity initially without lockdown but quickly changed course and resorted to lockdown measures [11, 12] . Table 1 is summary of each city's approach and lockdown duration.",

The number of residential fires in 2020 (Fig. 2d) in London is lower than the average of last 5 years, due to the decrease in the number of residential fires in general in London.

As shown in Table 1 , the general approach to lockdown or stay-at-home in New York City, San Francisco and London was similar (mandatory) while people in Tokyo stayed home on more ''voluntary'' basis. Community mobility reports, such as google or apple, indicate more people stayed home, or less commuted to work in all four cities [25, 26] . This being said, the trend on the number of residential fires and cooking fires in each city, are not clear. For residential fires, the numbers increased in San Francisco and Tokyo, while it did not in London and New York City. For cooking fires, the numbers increased in San Francisco and Tokyo, while it did not in New York City. These The Influence of COVID-19 Stay at Home Measures findings are interesting since residents were forced to stay home and spent time in cooking. The simple comparison did not provide general increases or decreases in the numbers of residential fires or cooking fires. Possible reasons for these findings may be in cultural differences, including cooking habits in those cities, and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The option for carry-out should be also investigated Additionally, cooking habits may change when carry-out became available in general.",

No clear trend was observed among the four cities. The number of residential fires increased during the stay-at-home period in San Francisco and Tokyo, while the percentage of residential fires in all fires in New York City increased during the stay-at-home period and both remains similar for London. The number of cooking fires increased in San Francisco and Tokyo, while it did not increase in New York City. One possible explanation for this is the number of COVID-19 cases. The dispatch call number is the same for ambulance and fire, and people hesitated to call fire department if a fire was small due to high demand of first responders or to let first responders into their home. This needs more investigation including more data from different counties and taking into cultural aspects.",
