The proportion of infected people with mild or no symptoms may be as high as 59% (1) . However, they may still be contagious, as throat swabs detected high levels of the virus early in their illness, as was the case with symptomatic patients (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . It is worth noting that the peak viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was more than 1,000 times higher than SARS-CoV-1, and active SARS-CoV-2 replication in upper respiratory tract tissues has been found, whereas SARS-CoV-1 is not thought to replicate at this site (7) . Some convenient and efficient large-scalescreening methods specific to mild/asymptomatic patients urgently need to be developed. Ferretti et al. (9) explored the possibility of protecting the population using questionnaires vs. algorithmic instantaneous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contact tracing assisted by a mobile phone application. This tracing method may be very useful for identifying infected people (10), however some convenient and pre-diagnostic methods still need to be developed urgently, since people without symptoms do not always take the viral nucleic acid test, even if they have been in close contact with an infected individual.",

Similarly, a study with a cohort of 366 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Sichuan, China, from January 2020 to February 2020 indicated that 69.3% of the mild patients and 79.1% of the severe patients showed body temperatures <37.3 \u2022 C on admission (14) . These reports suggested that the virus has converted its infection strategy to adapt to the human body or that more asymptomatic patients (without fever) had been screened out as time went by. Considering that over 70% of COVID patients did not have fever on admission, the current definition of a viral fever of \u226537.3 \u2022 C cannot discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 cases.",

The body temperature of older individuals is even lower, with a basal body temperature of 0.23-0.56 degrees less than young individuals (18, 19) . A rise of 1.0 \u2022 C in some older infected individuals would not be defined as a fever case, if their basal body temperature was <36.3 \u2022 C, which would result in missed diagnosis. Nevertheless, the older the infected individuals are, the more likely they are to develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and die (14, 20, 21) . The presence of coexisting medical conditions was significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients (55.15 vs. 21.93%), including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, significantly higher rates of severe clinical type (16.18 vs. 5.98%), critical clinical type (8.82 vs. 0.77%), and shortness of breath (12.50 vs. 3.07%) were observed in older patients compared with younger patients (20) .

The following two key terms were employed for the literature search: \"body temperature\" and \"SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.\" Through these searches, we obtained a total of 175 results in PubMed and 1,735 results in medRxiv, irrespective of the language, date of publication, and nationality, race, age, or gender of the participants. Two authors (SCJ and SY) independently screened the titles and abstracts to remove the ineligible studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We retrieved the full text of the potentially eligible studies and examined full-text reports for further evaluation. In cases where there were multiple reports for the same study, we used the last published report. During the subsequent full-text screening, articles without the average (median) body temperature data from both mild and severe patients were excluded. Finally, only four reports met the criteria.",

An individual's body temperature can change significantly within a day (<1.0 \u2022 C), influenced by diet, exercise state, mental factors, and so on (25) . A rise of 0.5 \u2022 C could not be discriminated accurately. In order to reflect the changing trend more accurately, we propose a method of iterative monitoring of body temperatures: recording axillary temperatures of close contacts every morning (immediately after getting up) and every night (about 2 h after supper). The average temperature of the first 3 days of the quarantine period (six measurements) should be taken as the basal value. Then if the average temperature of the next 3 days (the 4th, 5th, and 6th days) could be more than 0.5 \u2022 C higher than the reference value, it would be suggested to do the SARS-CoV-2 infection test. If the temperature continued to rise in the following 2 days (both the average temperature of 5th, 6th, and 7th days \u2265 the basic value + 0.5 \u2022 C and the average temperature of 6th, 7th, and 8th days \u2265 the basic value + 0.5 \u2022 C), it would be strongly suggested to carry out the SARS-CoV-2 infection test. If it was not more than 0.5 \u2022 C higher than the reference value, then the recording would continue until the end of the 14th day of the quarantine period (see the flow chart in Figure 1) . However, the positive detection rate FIGURE 1 | Flow chart of the iterative temperature monitoring method to find possible infections of SARS-CoV-2. The average temperature of the first 3 days of the quarantine period would be taken as the basal value. Then if the average temperature of the next 3 days is more than 0.5 \u2022 C higher than the reference value, it would be suggested to do a SARS-CoV-2 infection test (pink arrows). If the temperature continued to rise in the following 2 days or apparent symptoms (for example, fever or cough.) developed, it would be strongly suggested to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 infection test (red arrows). If the temperature is not higher than the reference value by more than 0.5 \u2022 C, then the recording would continue until the end of the 14th day of the quarantine period (black arrows). In addition to a nucleic-acid test, adjunct of serological test is recommended when possible. of a single nucleic-acid test is only 30-50% (26, 27) . With the rapid advances in SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody tests, adjuncts of serological tests would improve the accuracy in COVID-19 diagnosis. Thus, combined detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and nucleic acid has been recommended when possible (26, 27) .",

Evidence profiles of the two reports with 6378 patients showed that the average body temperature of the patients on admission was 37.3 \u2022 C, which was 0.5 \u2022 C higher than the normal body temperature of 36.8 \u2022 C. However, many patients' basal body temperatures are below 36.8 \u2022 C (especially in older patients with ages \u226560), and a rise of 0.5 \u2022 C would not be defined as a fever symptom. The current definition of viral fever of \u226537.3 \u2022 C cannot discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we propose that if the average temperature of 3 days is more than 0.5 \u2022 C higher than the reference value, it would indicate an infection. If the temperature continued to rise in the following 2 days, it would be strongly suggested to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 infection test. It is now clear that many individuals who are infected (and even those with mild symptoms) do not exhibit fever. Thus, our approach could not discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this method may be helpful to quickly identify contagious asymptomatic patients and older infected individuals with higher risks of death.",
