The benefits of exercise training on glycaemic control are largely attributed to the accumulated effects Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba A strength of this randomised controlled trial is the use of continuous glucose monitoring for personalising exercise timing to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia, as well as the inclusion of an active placebo control condition. \u25ba This study will employ a variety of data collection methods (in-lab and free-living) to measure changes in cardiovascular and metabolic health, physical activity and behaviour change. \u25ba Recruitment of participants across Australia (urban and rural) with remote delivery is both a strength in diversity and inclusion and a limitation given the reliance on dried blood spot home collection, and vascular/body composition measures will not be available for those unable to attend the university visits. \u25ba This study is robust in its adaptation to the COVID- 19 pandemic, while retaining high-quality study design and data collection with strong external validity.",

The current guidelines for physical activity recommend adults to accumulate ~150-300 min of moderate intensity aerobic activity throughout the week to improve or maintain health, 9 including glycaemic control (ie, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)) in people with T2D. 10 However, mounting evidence [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] indicates that exercise timing (eg, premeal vs postmeal or morning vs afternoon) influences glycaemic responses, yet there are no consistent guidelines on exercise timing in any current physical activity recommendations globally. Multiple systematic reviews have recently examined the effects of exercise timing on measures of glycaemic control in people with T2D and suggest the best time to exercise is within the first few hours after a meal. [11] [12] [13] However, performing exercise at different times of the day (ie, morning vs afternoon) has also shown to influence glycaemic responses. 14 15 For example, Savikj et al (2019) recently demonstrated that 2 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 3 days/week) performed in the afternoon improved 24 hours glucose concentration by \u22120.6 mmol/L more than HIIT in the morning, 14 whereas a separate study by Teo et al (2019) found no significant differences in any glycaemic outcomes (HbA1c, fasting or postprandial glucose) after 12 weeks of exercise (3 days/ week) performed in the morning versus afternoon. 15 Given the inconsistent findings and broad recommendations in the current literature (ie, exercise timing relative to time of day or meal consumption), a more personalised approach may be needed to target CVD and for practitioners to prescribe exercise timing for people with T2D. Postprandial hyperglycaemia is linked to CVD and timing exercise to specifically target the largest postprandial excursion (ie, peak hyperglycaemia) of the day may lead to greater glycaemic benefits and reduced cardiovascular risk.",

Further, the vascular effects of exercising specifically to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia are unknown. The endothelium is a key regulator of vascular homeostasis and endothelial function is an early risk factor for CVD. 16 17 Hyperglycaemia increases production of reactive oxygen species 18 and the resulting oxidative stress reduces vascular homeostasis (ie, by increasing vasoconstriction and decreasing vasodilation) which can lead to endothelial dysfunction and CVD over time. A longer-term intervention of daily exercise is now warranted to garner a better understanding of exercise timing on glycaemic control and to examine whether exercising at the time of peak hyperglycaemia improves HbA1c and reduces cardiovascular risk factors.",

This technique uses ultrasound imaging (Terason uSmart 3300) of the brachial artery. Following 10-15 min of laying supine (at rest), a longitudinal section of the brachial artery, 2-3 cm above the antecubital fossa, will be imaged using B-mode ultrasound imaging (insonation angle of 60\u00b0). A blood pressure cuff placed around the forearm, 1-2 cm below the olecranon process, will then be rapidly inflated to ~60 mm Hg above resting systolic blood pressure for 5 min. Brachial artery diameter and blood flow velocity will be recorded for 1 min before cuff inflation (baseline), ~30 s prior to cuff release (ischaemic stimulus), and 3 min following cuff release (recovery). 25 26 The ~5 min recording will then be analysed with customdesigned edge-detection and wall-tracking software (Cardiovascular Suite, Quipu, Italy) which reduces user bias and increases accuracy. FMD will be reported as an absolute change in artery diameter (absolute FMD = postocclusion mean diameter \u2212 preocclusion mean diameter ), and a relative change in artery diameter from baseline (%FMD=100 \u00d7 (absolute FMD/preocclusion mean diameter )). Allometric Open access scaling will be used to account for potential confounders from baseline diameter. 26 27 Blood flow (mL/min) will be measured using noninvasive Doppler from the cross-sectional area and blood velocity (velocity \u00d7 \u03c0 \u00d7 (diameter2/4)\u00d760). Shear rate (s-1) will then be determined from the diameter and velocity measures (four times velocity/diameter). 28 Shear rate area under the curve (SR AUC ) will automatically be calculated from the diameter and velocity measures from the time of cuff release to peak dilation of the artery. Antegrade and retrograde mean blood velocities will be used to calculate baseline antegrade and retrograde shear rates (four times mean baseline antegrade or retrograde velocity \u00f7 mean baseline diameter), and the mean blood flow to mean arterial pressure ratio will be used to measure vascular conductance (mL/min/mmHg). 25 26 Central arterial stiffness will be assessed via pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements (SphygmoCor XCEL System, AtCor Medical). PWA will be used to measure central blood pressure. A brachial blood pressure cuff will be inflated and the central aortic pressure waveform, derived from pulsations at the brachial artery, will be recorded for 5 s and then automatically analysed through the SphygmoCor software. Key parameters of central blood pressure and arterial stiffness will be determined from the aortic waveform including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, aortic pressure, augmentation index and mean arterial pressure. PWV will be measured by holding a tonometer on the carotid artery for 10-15 s, while a femoral blood pressure cuff is automatically inflated. Once fully inflated, the femoral cuff and carotid tonometer will simultaneously record a 10 s capture of the carotid and femoral pressure waveforms. PWV will then be calculated by dividing the carotid-femoral distance by the pulse transit time; the carotid-femoral distance will be calculated by subtracting the proximal distance (distance between the carotid artery and sternal notch) from the distal distance (distance between the sternal notch and proximal edge of the femoral cuff) (PWV (m/s) = (distal -proximal distance )/transit time). 29 Measurements will be performed in duplicate. A third measurement will be taken if the difference between the two PWV values is >0.5 m/s and the average of the three values will be used.",

This is the first study to investigate whether prescribing exercise that is personalised to target daily peak hyperglycaemia, using CGM, can improve cardiovascular risk factors in T2D. Based on evidence from prior research, 11 34-36 it is hypothesised that strategically timing daily exercise to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia will improve glycaemic control (HbA1c), and the reduction in peak glycaemia will improve vascular function (endothelial function and arterial stiffness), blood lipids and CRP, more than exercising not at peak hyperglycaemia or control standard care (ie, physical activity guidelines).",

            "text": "Recent evidence suggests exercise timing may be important to offset circadian rhythms 14 and to target postprandial hyperglycaemia 11 in T2D. However, there are no recommendations for exercise timing in the current physical activity guidelines (ie, physical activity can be accumulated at any time throughout the week). Further, adherence to the current recommendations is notoriously poor. Regardless of the effectiveness for an intervention to improve diabetes management, findings will only be translatable if patients comply with and adopt to the treatment over the long-term. Therefore, adherence to prescribed daily exercise time (ie, creating more of a habit) will be assessed for 3 months following the 8-week intervention. Exercising at the time of peak hyperglycaemia may improve self-efficacy to the exercise prescription, as results from the CGM data (pre/mid/ post 8-week intervention) will allow participants to see the direct impact of exercise on blood glucose levels. Use of CGM in this trial not only offers the distinct advantage of determining time of peak hyperglycaemia, but will also allow us to examine any changes in daily glycaemic patterns, such as glycaemic variability, which are more closely related to cardiovascular risk than HbA1c. 37 If strategically timing exercise to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia improves long-term glycaemic control (HbA1c), reduces cardiovascular risk (endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness) and improves exercise adherence then this may be an alternative recommendation for physical activity prescription in people with T2D.",

            "text": "This is the first randomised controlled trial to examine the effects of personalising exercise timing to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia (determined via CGM technology) on cardiometabolic and vascular health outcomes in individuals with T2D. This study will be conducted in free-living conditions, with exercise performed at home and contact/ delivery of Phase 1 (8-week exercise intervention) mirroring standard care (five telehealth calls with an exercise physiologist), while Phase 2 (3-month follow-up) will assess adherence to the exercise prescription (with minimal contact from the research team); thus informing us of the real-world applicability of the proposed exercise prescription. In addition, this study will use a variety of data collection methods (inlab and free-living) to objectively measure cardiometabolic health, vascular function, physical activity and behaviour change across the trial. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, remote participants from across rural and urban Australia will be included, allowing for a wider range of individuals to be recruited while adhering to the COVID-19 restrictions. However, this is also a limitation as the vascular and body composition measures will be excluded for those who cannot attend university assessments, and dried blood spot testing kits will be used rather than the gold-standard plasma measurement of HbA1c. Finally, a limitation of the waitlist control group is the potential overestimation of intervention effects and bias in favour of the treatment group. Nevertheless, inclusion of the waitlist control group will provide insight on the cause-effect relationship between the intervention and subsequent health outcomes/behaviour changes, as these participants will follow a delayed-start design (ie, will receive treatment following the waitlist period), thus allowing for direct comparisons to be made under various conditions with reduced error variance and not withholding treatment to individuals.",
