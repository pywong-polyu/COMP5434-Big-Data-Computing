On March 11th 2020, WHO publicly declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a pandemic. In a few weeks, the virus caused thousands of deaths worldwide, strongly impacting the global economy and human habits. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, +ssRNA virus, belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus which includes two other RNA viruses that have caused recent important epidemics: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) by MERS-CoV.",

For example, Baud and colleagues reported that mortality rate is three times higher out of China (15.2% [95% ] out of China, compared to 5.6% [95% CI 5. 4-5.8] in China) [1] . This rate has been re-estimated by dividing the number of deaths on a given day by the number of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 days before, considering the WHO data relative to the cumulative number of deaths to March 1st, 2020 [1] . Differences in viral infection rates can be due to a combination of factors, including different national strategies adopted for people movement restrictions, isolation and quarantine, different genetic population herd immunity. Mortality differences are to understand, but viral mutations and evolution capability over time may be important.",

Biological characterization of viral mutations can provide precious insights for assessing viral drug resistance, immune escape and pathogenesis related mechanisms. Additionally, viral mutation studies can be crucial for designing new vaccines, antiviral drugs and diagnostic assays. The viral genome mutagenic process depends on the viral enzymes that replicate the nucleic acids, influenced by few or no proofreading capability and/or post-replicative nucleic acid repair. Other mutation-generating processes include: host enzymes, spontaneous nucleic acid damages due to physical and chemical mutagens, recombination events and also particular genetic elements responsible for production of new variants.

SARS-CoV-2 shares a high homology for nsp12 compared to SARS-CoV, suggesting that its function and mechanism of action might be well conserved [11] . This has been confirmed by a recent cryo-EM structural study obtained for SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 [12] . In SARS-CoV, an exonuclease activity with proofreading function has been reported for the nsp14 (ExoN), and a homologue nsp14 protein is found in the SARS-CoV-2 as well [11, 13] . ExoN increases the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by RdRp [14] . Genetic inactivation of the coronavirus ExoN results in a 21-fold decrease in replication fidelity compared to wild type SARS-CoV [15] . Moreover, Kirchdoerfer and colleagues showed the involvement of nsp7 and nsp8 in the formation of a supercomplex with RdRp in SARS-CoV [16] , and this has been confirmed also for SARS-CoV-2 in a recent study unveiling the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/nsp7/nsp8 complex [12] . This complex ensures RdRp processivity, becoming fundamental in the transcription fidelity. Nevertheless, the critical SARS-CoV RdRp residues involved in ExoN, nsp7 and nsp8 interaction have still to be identified.",

Genomes carrying mutations in positions 3036, 23403, 28881, 17746, 17857 and 18060 show a median of 3-4 mutations (range [2:5] ), whereas genomes carrying none of them have a median of 1 or 2 mutations (range [0:3], p-value < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test).

To this regard, it is well-known that SARS-CoV RdRp forms a hollow cylinder-like supercomplex with nsp7 and nsp8, which confer processivity to RdRp [28] . Additionally, replication supercomplex interacts with nsp14, an exonuclease having the Nidovirales-typical proofreading capability. This activity is important in the context of the mutation rate and for controlling the fidelity in RNA replication. However, critical RdRp residues involved in this interaction are still to be identified, and for this reason further studies are needed to assess the possible role of mutation 14408 concerning RdRp fidelity.",

            "text": "In our study, we found that the RdRp mutation, located at position 14408, which is present in European viral genomes starting from February 20th, 2020, is associated with a higher number of point mutations compared to viral genomes from Asia. Given that RdRp works in a complex machinery that includes proofreading activities (in cooperation with other viral cofactors, like ExoN, nsp7 and nsp8), it is tempting to speculate that this mutation has contributed in impairing its proofreading capability. One possible mechanism could involve a minor change in the RdRp structure, without affecting its catalytic activity, that might nonetheless alter its binding capability with other cofactors such as ExoN, nsp7 or nsp8, thus altering the mutation rate. This could explain the increased number of mutations that we observed in Europe since February 2020. Further studies are needed to determine whether the observed cluster mutations originate from the same molecular mechanism. Further studies are also needed to determine whether the mutation in RdRp results in increased viral replication. Some polymerase inhibitors [29, 30] are currently being tested in clinical studies to target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, including Favipiravir [17, 19] , Galidesivir [18] , Remdesivir [19] , Ribavirin [20] , Penciclovir [31] , Galidesivir [32] and Ponatinib [33] . Additionally, other drugs such as Simeprevir (FDA approved HCV protease inhibitor), as well as Filibuvir and Tegobuvir (both RdRp inhibitors) [22] , are predicted to bind RdRp by molecular docking studies. In particular, a putative docking site was identified in a hydrophobic cleft very close to the mutated site 323 (P to L), corresponding to mutation 14408 identified in our study [22] . Naturally occurring mutations in RdRp can potentially lead to drug-resistance phenomena, as already observed previously [19, 34, 35] . Alternatively, it might induce a significant decrease in drug-RdRp complex binding affinity. This could lead to different effectiveness of antiviral treatments where mutation 14408 is present. For this reason, due to the high frequency of RdRp mutation in the infected population, it is important to characterize the impact of 14408 mutation on the activity of RdRp and its susceptibility to antiviral drugs.",

Among these hotspots, one mutation in position 14408 is located within the RdRp protein and is associated with an overall increased mutation rate. An in silico analysis comparing annotated functional domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sequences, showed that this particular mutation occurs in the so-called RdRp interface domain, a still poorly characterized surface structure, involved in protein-protein interactions [16] . The role for the RdRp interface domain requires further investigations, and in particular the effect of mutation in position 14408, its interaction with other cofactors (such as ExoN, nsp7 and nsp8), possibly affecting its proofreading activity and potentially altering its mutation rate. It is also essential to understand if the described mutations could result in the emergence of drug-resistance viral phenotypes. Our data may help the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and the study of potential drug resistance mechanisms. ",

Eight novel recurrent hotspots mutations (namely 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881) and 5 hotspots already reported in literature (namely 3036, 8782, 11083, 28144 and 26143) were subdivided into 4 geographic areas: Asia (n = 71), Oceania (n = 15), Europe (n = 101), North America (n = 33). The mutation frequency was estimated for each of them, by normalizing the number of genomes carrying a given mutation in a geographic area, by the overall number of retrieved genomes per geographic area; the graph shows the cumulative mutation frequency of all given mutations present in each geographic area. Mutation locations in viral genes are reported in the legend as well as the proteins (i.e. non-structural protein, nsp) presenting these mutations. The figure shows that genomes from European and North American patients present an increase in mutation frequency compared to Asia. It is also possible to observe that Europe and North America show a differential pattern of mutations: mutation 14408 (red), 23403 (black), 28881 (electric blue) and 26143 (light green) are present mostly in Europe, whereas 18060 (pink), 17857 (purple) and 17746 (light blue) are present mostly in North AmericaPachetti et al.

Next, for each time group, a further subclassification per geographic area (Asia, Oceania, Europe and North America) was performed (number of genomes in each area are reported in the figure inset). The number of mutations in each area was normalized by the number of genomes analyzed for each period of time. This figure shows that mutation frequency increases over time during viral spread out of Asia. No mutations were observed in the Asian genomes analyzed in December 2019.
