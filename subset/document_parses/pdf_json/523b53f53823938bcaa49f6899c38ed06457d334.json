For instance, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which was discovered in 2019 as the first disease of its kind, is an emerging infectious disease that was recorded globally in 2021 to have a fatality rate of approximately 2.17% [1]. The digitally automated pre-hospital triage system such as the internet of things (IoT) is capable of classifying a patient's severity and guiding them to the appropriate healthcare setting. An effective IoT-based triage system would ultimately help free up time for healthcare professionals to focus on more complex tasks and increase the safety of employees and patients with respect to COVID-19. Kerr et al. [2] implemented a tactile sensing and fuzzy triage system for COVID-19. Further, an automated triage system could improve the quality of service and reduce costs due to the misappropriation of resources [3] .",

In Korea, disaster-related research has been growing rapidly, with an annual average increase rate of 52.8% since 2003 [4] . This indicates that technologies using wireless sensor networks are being used to build infrastructure in the disaster and social safety sectors. As such, there are many critics who say that even though Korea has begun incorporating science and technology into disaster management, domestic R&D is focused on SCI-level papers or only studies technology development instead of practical applications [5] . In other words, as is the case with major advanced countries, Korea has the task of proactively utilizing science and technology as a key means of responding to disasters. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objective of contributing to active disaster response by developing an Internet of things (IoT)-based e-triage tag system for vital sign monitoring to improve the survival rates in MCIs due to disasters.",

The key design features include rugged personal digital assistants (PDA) and compact hand-held devices on large screens that are easy to use in field settings. It also features secure data communication over Internet Protocols, simple easy-to-use electronic medical software (EMR) for first responders in a difficult disaster response, battery life of at least 4-6 h, self-diagnosis, and remote software upgrades. Flashing lights of color were designed to flash at the same time as the heartbeat, and locking functions were designed to prevent the patient from operating.

In addition, WIISARD accurately tracked the status of triage and reduced the missing triage and duplicate triage ratio [22] . Therefore, field practitioners and researchers must re-examine technical aspects such as e-triage development.

Further, medical staff should always be aware of where patients have been transported.

Hence, the potential issues and shortcomings, especially technical limitations, have not been fully considered. For example, smartphone and tablet batteries should last around 12 h, depending on the level of use; however, as more than 24 h of blackouts can occur during disasters, alternatives or backup options should be considered. In addition, large amounts of information will be sent and received in disasters, and responding will take considerable time and manpower; hence, the administrative costs should be considered. If mobile devices are used for disaster victim triage, privacy is a concern as governments or medical institutions can collect and retain personal information and perform data mining on them. This point should also be addressed in future research. Also, all casualties in the study were adults. Future work would include expanding data collection to include a wider range of age ultimately link an in-hospital e-triage system.
