In early pregnancy, mononuclear cytotrophoblasts fuse to multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts that cover the floating chorionic villi, or differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts, which are capable of invading the endometrium and develop from anchoring villi. Impairment of trophoblast cell invasion into the endometrium causes serious complications during pregnancy, including hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP), which is mainly caused by insufficient invasion by extravillous trophoblast cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of the development of HDP and pre-eclampsia (PE) remain to be determined. Nevertheless, inadequate invasion of extravillous trophoblasts into the myometrium of the uterus and inappropriate remodeling of the uterine spiral arterioles are thought to be involved in these disorders [1] . There are several mechanisms that may contribute to trophoblast dysfunction, including ischemic placenta, dysregulation of angiogenesis, and excessive oxidative stress [2] .",

            "text": "The excessive deficiency and polymerization of A1AT are related to emphysema, which involves the intracellular accumulation of mutated protein, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [10] . The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a response to ER stress that is conserved among all mammalian species [11] and that leads to an increase in the production of molecular chaperones. Impairments in ER homeostasis can occur under physiological and/or pathological conditions, and the UPR can involve the activation of various signaling pathways, including pro-inflammatory pathways [12] . In our previous study, we showed that A1AT regulates the production of pro-inflammatory adipokines and other pro-inflammatory factors through UPR-related genes in human omental adipocytes [13] . Although ER stress may influence endometrial invasion by extravillous trophoblasts [14] , it remains unclear whether A1AT and/or HTRA1 are involved in ER stress in trophoblasts. We hypothesize that intracellular A1AT may regulate inflammatory cytokine expression and HTRA1-induced invasion via the induction of ER stress in trophoblasts. Our hypothesis also implies that the roles of intracellular A1AT and circulating A1AT may be different. Abnormal regulation of A1AT expression could cause defective trophoblast invasion, leading to HDP and PE. To test this hypothesis, we determine the effects of the knockdown and overexpression of A1AT on the expression of inflammation-and ER stress-related factors in human extravillous trophoblast HTR8/SVneo cells and whether pharmacological stimulation or inhibition of UPR signaling affects the invasion of trophoblasts.",

The effect of A1AT knockdown (KD) or overexpression (OE) on the expression of HTRAs and the pro-inflammatory genes IL6 and CXCL8 was determined in HTR8/SVneo cells (Figure 1a ,b). A1AT-KD reduced the expression of HTRA1, CXCL8, and A1AT (Figure 1a ), whereas A1AT-OE increased the expression of HTRA1, HTRA3, HTRA4, IL6, and CXCL8 in the trophoblast cells ( Figure 1b) . Furthermore, A1AT-OE increased the amount of the HTRA1 protein ( Figure 1c ). As HTRA1 regulates the invasion of trophoblast cells [15] , we evaluated the effect of A1AT on that invasion. A1AT-KD reduced the number of invading cells, whereas A1AT-OE increased the number (Figure 1d ). In addition, A1AT-OE trophoblasts exhibited an approximately two-fold higher rate of proliferation (Figure 1e ), but A1AT-OE did not affect the expression of the trophoblast invasion markers MMP2 and MMP9 (Figure 1f ).

To ascertain whether HTRA1 regulates invasion by extravillous trophoblast cells, the effects of the knockdown of HTRA1 were determined using two siRNAs (HTRA1-KD1 and -KD2) that specifically recognize HTRA1 mRNA sequences in different regions. The HTRA1 siRNAs reduced HTRA1 mRNA and protein expression but did not change the expression of HTRA paralogs (Figure 2b ,c). Both HTRA1 siRNAs markedly inhibited cell invasion (Figure 2d ).

A1AT is a serine protease inhibitor that might also interact with HTRA1 [7] . We evaluated the interaction between A1AT and HTRA1 using an immunoprecipitation assay but could not demonstrate the binding of A1AT to HTRA1 (data not shown). Jonigk et al. [6] have demonstrated that A1AT reduces organ damage in a serine protease activity-independent fashion, but the intracellular accumulation of A1AT protein induces ER stress [10] . Consistent with this, in the present study, A1AT-OE increased ER stress marker expression. ER stress requires three major ER-spanning transmembrane proteins, PERK, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF6, all of which bind to BiP (encoded by HSPA5) [11] . The activation of PERK by the dissociation of BiP increases ATF4 expression, which directly upregulates CHOP (encoded by DDIT3), while the activation of IRE1\u03b1 by the dissociation of BiP upregulates spliced XBP1 [17] . In the present study, A1AT-OE increased the levels of PERK and IRE1\u03b1 signaling-related proteins, whereas inhibition of either PERK or IRE1\u03b1 largely prevented the A1AT-OE-induced expression of HTRA1.

Notably, A1AT administration improves the survival rate of mice with peritonitis and sepsis [18] . A1AT expression has been shown to be lower in the placentas of patients with PE than in normal placentas [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Similarly, A1AT expression is low in a mouse model of PE and high blood pressure, though these symptoms are improved by the administration of A1AT [19] . In the present study, A1AT-OE increased ER stress-mediated invasion and HTRA1 levels, and A1AT-KD reduced invasion. Furthermore, A1AT-OE or A1AT administration increases the migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells from women with PE [19] . Conversely, it has been reported that A1AT expression is high in placentas from patients with PE [24] and that the urinary A1AT concentration is high in women with PE [5, 25, 26] . Our data suggest that A1AT regulates cell motility via ER stress and HTRA1 expression in trophoblast cells, and that dysregulation may be associated with complications of pregnancy, including PE (Table S1 ). These findings are consistent with the notion that abnormal A1AT expression affects trophoblast invasion and might aggravate PE. An abnormal immune response between mother and fetus and aberrant placentation can both induce HDP, acting as initiation factors during the early stage of pregnancy. Defective trophoblast invasion, and especially insufficient penetration into the endometrium, leads to HDP. Placenta ischemia may result in oxidative stress and inflammation in extravillous trophoblasts, which triggers and accelerates ER stress. The mechanisms of regulation for A1AT expression are still poorly understood. However, A1AT is known to be post-translationally modified to generate various molecular forms with different natures in response to oxidative stress and inflammatory circumstance [27] . Further studies into the polymorphism of the A1AT protein in placental physiology could identify a prognostic marker and therapeutic target of HDP for clinical use.",
