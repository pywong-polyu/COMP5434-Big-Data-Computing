Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatments were stopped, two units of erythrocyte transfusion was performed and ceftriaxone was started to avoid possible bacterial superinfection.

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causing COVID-19, first reported in Wuhan, China at the end of November 2019 and has spread worldwide. 2 The World Health Organization on March 11 declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In a study of 1099 patients in China with confirmed COVID-19, the most commonly reported symptom was fever (43.8-88.7%), followed by cough (67.8%), and shortness of breath (18.7%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest CT (56.4%). Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission, elevated d-dimer and LDH being less common. 3 Although our patient was asymptomatic at the time of admission and was evaluated as low risk in terms of COVID-19 according to the past medical history and clinical picture; changing clinical (sub-febrile fever, dyspnoea, and hypoxaemia) and laboratory (elevated d-dimer, LDH, and lymphopenia) findings as well an abnormal CT result (bilateral severe ground-glass opacity) were compatible with COVID-19 during follow-up. Early diagnosis of DAH can be extremely difficult, as the common clinical picture, such as haemoptysis, hypoxaemia, and chest radiological infiltrates, is often attributed to more common clinical scenarios such as viral pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, or pulmonary embolism. Misdiagnosis may result in inappropriate drug use, prolonged exposure to anticoagulation or even death. High degree of suspicion is key to diagnosis and this can be much more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially in the early stages, CT findings in viral pneumonias and DAH consistently overlap and are therefore difficult to distinguish. [4] [5] [6] Recently, Kloth et al. 7 compared CT finds of viral pneumonias and DAH, reporting no statistically significant differences for ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving, centrilobular nodules, and parenchymal consolidations between the different subgroups. Kalra et al. 8 patients at Mayo Clinic that severe pulmonary haemorrhage was identified in seven patients out of the 2553 patients (0.27%) who received abciximab. Four diagnoses of seven patients in this study were based on major haemoptysis accompanied by a significant (> _1.24 mmol/L) decrease in haemoglobin concentration, abnormal chest radiographic findings, and hypoxaemia within the 2 h-2.6 days without the bronchoscopy. In this study, although the appearance of more than 20% hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage is the gold standard of alveolar haemorrhage diagnosis, we did not perform bronchoscopy since it was relatively contraindicated in recent MI. 1 Based on the clinical picture and radiological findings, we diagnosed our patient with abciximab-induced DAH collectively by a council consisting of cardiologists, chest disease experts, and radiologists.",
