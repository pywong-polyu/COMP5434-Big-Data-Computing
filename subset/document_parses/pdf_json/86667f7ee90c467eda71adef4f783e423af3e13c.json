            "text": "Background: The coping theory shows that stressful life events are associated with individuals' psychology/ behaviors; meanwhile, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to have impacted individuals' physical and mental health. Prior studies revealed that undergraduates have many sexual behavior and emotion disorders, which may be impacted during an isolation period, such as the one brought by COVID-19. However, few studies have explored the longitudinal associations between COVID-19-related stress and sexual compulsivity symptoms (SCS), and the mediating effect of emotions (i.e., depression and anxiety) on this relationship. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate these associations. Methods: We employed a cross-lagged design (2020/2/12: Time 1, 3219 participants; 2020/6/6: Time 2, 2998 participants) and recruited Chinese undergraduates through an online system to respond to a survey. Results: Our results showed that COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 directly influenced SCS at Time 1, and there was an indirect influence via depression and anxiety at Time 1. COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 positively correlated with depression, anxiety, and SCS at Time 2, and the first could directly and positively predict SCS at Time 2. Moreover, albeit depression at Time 2 was negatively linked to SCS at Time 2, anxiety at Time 2 enhanced the effect of COVID-19-related stress on SCS. Conclusions: Our findings extend the literature on SCS, showing that the higher the COVID-19-related stress, the higher the SCS, and the longer-lasting effect was associated with anxiety in undergraduates. Furthermore, depression does not mediate the relationship between COVID-19-related stress and SCS.",

SCS comprise individuals' sexuality and sexting behaviors and sexual behavioral intention. Increasingly, young college students have been experiencing a number of psychological and behavioral disorders that are influenced by many factors, such as life events, negative stress, and coping strategies [4] [5] [6] [7] . Concurring, the ecological systems theory [8] has pointed out that people's SCS are influenced by many factors, which can be summarized into two categories: outside environmental factors and individual coping strategies [9] [10] [11] .",

Particularly, most undergraduates became isolated, be it either in their homes or in diminished school environments, leading to a lack of interrelationships with society; this can be designated as a negative life event. According to the coping theory, negative life events influence individuals' psychological states and behaviors [12] [13] [14] . For example, young people who experience negative life events tend to have a higher SCS [9, 10] , and undergraduates may present more impulsive sexual behaviors and psychological states owing to negative life events [1, 2, 4, 15] . However, the underlying mechanism behind the effect of negative life events on people's sexual behaviors and psychology have yet to be more thoroughly explored.",

Prior studies have suggested that social policies and cultural factors can impact people's psychology and behavior [15] , especially when interrelationships are affected, highlighting that young undergraduates may be eager to communicate with others, peers, or the opposite sex. However, in events that evoke the need for isolation (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), they become forced to isolate or remain in a diminished school environment, having to bear with the strains evoked by such stressful events. Amid this, undergraduates may also suffer with the stress that this isolation imposes on their sexuality, including both sexual psychology and behavior.",

Namely, anxiety and depression are different emotions, and albeit the first can mediate the relationship we examined, both emotions were shown to significantly affect SCS. Furthermore, as described above, our results showed that anxiety at Time 2 mediated and enhanced the effect of COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 on SCS at Time 2, in that anxious individuals with higher COVID-19 related stress would incur in higher SCS later on. Consistently, studies have shown that anxiety can mediate the relationship between life events or stress and emotion or behaviors [9, [41] [42] [43] [44] , and that depression could not boost individuals' coping ability toward stressful life event [45] . These results are in line with those of other studies that showed that individuals' psychological resources may protect mental health, albeit anxiety symptoms could also decrease individuals' coping efficacy [24] and ability to cope with negative life events [46] . Notwithstanding, our results also showed that both anxiety at Time 1 and depression at both Times 1 and 2 did not significantly mediate the relationship between COVID-19-related stress at Time 1 and SCS at Time 2.",
