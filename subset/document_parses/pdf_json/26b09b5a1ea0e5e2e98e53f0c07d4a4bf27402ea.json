To identify biomarkers for SR, we systematically analyzed the molecular alterations in both sorafenib-resistant HCC specimens and cultured cells. By combining bioinformatics tools and experimental validation, four genes (C2orf27A, insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, complement factor B, and paraoxonase 1) were identified as key genes related to SR in HCC and as independent prognostic factors significantly associated with clinical cancer stages and pathological tumor grades of liver cancer. These genes can affect the cytotoxicity of sorafenib to regulate the proliferation and invasion of Huh7 cells in vitro. Additionally, immunecell infiltration according to tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, a biomarker integrating the mechanisms of dysfunction and exclusion of T cells showed good predictive power for SR, with an AUC of 0.869. These findings suggest that immunotherapy may be a potential strategy for treating sorafenib-resistant HCC. Furthermore, the results enhance the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of SR in HCC and will facilitate the development of precision therapy for patients with liver cancer.",

However, most patients are relatively asymptomatic during early stages, and due to the rapid progression of the disease, 80% of HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages. Less than 30% of patients with HCC can be managed by curative therapy, and sorafenib, a multi-target kinase inhibitor, has been approved in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for first-line treatment in patients with advanced liver cancer to improve overall survival [4, 5] . Sorafenib can block tumor cell proliferation by promoting apoptosis and suppressing anti-apoptotic and metastatic activity; however, the response rate to sorafenib is low, and many patients develop drug resistance and serious adverse side effects. Initiation and development of sorafenib resistance (SR) AGING is considered a multi-step process, although the precise molecular events that underlie resistance remain only partially understood. This highlights the need for continued development of biomarkers allowing determination of which patients are more likely to benefit from sorafenib and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved.",

Recently, immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has delivered unprecedented success.

TargetScan, MiRDB, and miRanda were used to predict potential miRNA targets for the DEmRNAs, resulting in formation of 293 of 2,875 DEmRNAs and 29 miRNAs into 370 miRNA-mRNA pairs ( Figure 4A ). We then used miRcode to identify lncRNA-mRNA pairs, resulting in formation of 27 of 43 DElncRNAs and 207 miRNAs into 1,612 lncRNA-miRNA pairs. We ultimately selected 10 miRNAs Enriched Ontology Clusters of statistically enriched terms. Each term is represented by a circle node, where its size is proportional to the number of input genes that fall into that term, and its color represents its cluster identity. The y-axis represents the pathways and the x-axis represents enriched gene numbers, and the color means adjust P-value. The netplot of KEGG pathways means the enrichment of genes in different pathways. And the number adjacent to nodes stands for gene ID. GO, Gene Ontology; BP, biological process; MF, molecular function; CC, cellular component; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; DEGs, differentially expressed genes. The most significant module was obtained from the PPI network by MCODE with criteria as follows: MCODE scores > 5, degree cut-off = 2, node score cut-off= 0.2, node density cut-off=0.1, Max depth=100 and k-score = 2. PPI, protein-protein interaction; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; MCODE, Molecular Complex Detection (version 1.6), an APP of Cytoscape for clustering a given network based on the topology to find densely connected regions. DElncRNAs and 2875 DEmRNAs were identified. miRDB, miRanda, and TargetScan were used to predict the potential miRNA target by DEmRNAs. Only the miRNA-mRNA pairs that exist in all three databases were enrolled in the ceRNA network. The miRcode was applied to predict the potential miRNA target by DElncRNAs. As a result, a total of 26 lncRNAs, 194 mRNAs, and 10 miRNAs were enrolled in the ceRNA network. (A) Venn diagram of miRNA-mRNA pairs. (B) Venn diagram of target miRNAs.

            "text": "Due to the genetic heterogeneity of HCC, the acquisition of therapeutic resistance to sorafenib is a serious clinical problem. Recently, microvascular invasion (MVI), high concentration of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; >200 ng/mL), and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were reported as poor prognostic factors for sorafenib-treated HCC [4, 5, 17] . Additionally, previous studies have shown that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or its ligand in HCC cells might result in continued SR through activation of EGFR downstream signaling. Similarly, these downstream signaling molecules, including Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, reportedly affect the sensitivity of HCC to sorafenib [18] . Tasnuva [19] reported a regulatory role of miR-7 in the growth and migration of SR HCC cells by direct inhibition of expression of the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor TYRO3 and its downstream signaling network. Furthermore, a recent study reported several AGING mechanisms potentially involved in SR, including interaction between the phosphoinositde-3 kinase/Akt and Janus kinase-STAT pathways, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/VEGF receptor-2 signaling network, autophagy, and the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, their predictive power and molecular mechanisms remain inconsistent and contradictory. In this study, using a combination of liver tissue and cell lines, our analysis eliminated individual patient differences and other factors, such as histories of alcohol and tobacco use, virus infection, family histories, and other treatments, which might have influenced the results. A total of 85 DEGs were screened from the whole genome, and GO analysis revealed that the DEGs were enriched in enzyme inhibitor activity, which is considered to be the main role of sorafenib. Furthermore, sorafenib has recently been reported to downregulate membranebound complement regulatory protein to potentiate the antitumor effects of rituximab and ofatumumab in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [25] . KEGG analysis in this study revealed DEGs are primarily related to complement and coagulation cascades. These findings suggested that the complement pathway may be involved in SR-specific HCC.",

Additionally, the inactivation of M6P/IGF2R occurred in the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis, which supports the role of M6P / IGF2R as a tumor suppressor gene [27] . CFB is associated with HBV related HCC [28] and is considered as a potential predictor of response to PegIFN\u03b1 therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B [29] . PON1 is considered as a biomarker for the clinical diagnosis of early HCC and able to distinguish early HCC from liver cirrhosis patients with low AFP levels [30] . Furthermore, PON1 is potentially related to the MVI of liver cancer [31, 32] ; therefore, given the correlation between MVI and sorafenib efficacy [33] , PON1 might play a crucial role in the development of SR by influencing MVI, which agrees with the findings of the present study.

Moreover, compared with the responder group, both antitumor cells and immune cells involved in tumor survival showed higher expression levels in the non-responder group, suggesting the potential efficacy of immunotherapy. Similar results were found for the predictive efficacy of biomarkers for ICI response, reinforcing the potential effectiveness of immunotherapy for treating sorafenib-resistant HCC. Interestingly, the expression of PD-L1 was lower in non-responders, which might contribute to poor efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors. However, without validation, caution must be applied, as these findings might be attributed to the complexity of resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has resulted in better overall survival and progression free survival than sorafenib in unresectable HCC [36] , which highlighted the immunotherapy based on PD-L1.

Besides, we conducted another analysis about calculating APS based on 7 genes from Senbabaoglu et al. [58] , which were involved in the processing and presentation of antigens on MHC. We named this score as 'APS7'. APS, APS7, IIS, and TIS were quantified using the R package \"GSVA\" [59] and gene lists according to a previous report [58] . IIS was defined as the mean of the standardized values of immune cells, including macrophages, DCs, B cells, eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, NK cell subsets, and all T cell subsets. TIS was defined as the mean of the standardized values for the following T cell subsets: CD8 + , T central and effector memory cells, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells.",

According to the list of genes defined in previous studies, the scores of biomarkers were quantified as the average expression level of the gene set. IFN\u03b3-related biomarkers included C-X-C chemokine ligand (CXCL)10, CXCL9, IFN\u03b3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase 1, and human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype \u03b1.
