The shortage of clinician-scientists dedicated to the mental health needs of children is urgent given the \"heavy burden on young minds\" at a global level (3, 4) . There is a need for combined research and clinical educational programs that can introduce scientific advances and prepare physician-scientists for interdisciplinary careers through the acquisition of advanced research skills and working collaborations with clinicians and scientists in related fields. The traditional model of training in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) provides opportunities for medical students and residents to participate in child and adolescent clinical services but does not typically encourage CAP trainees to pursue formal research training. This unfortunate reality has had a significant impact on the minting of new doctors in the \"endangered but essential\" (5) physician-scientist mold.",

Specifically, integrated program participants outperformed their peers across the outcomes of: (1) AACAP development career awards, with a higher number of awards per recipient and a shorter time to first award; (2) PubMed entries, with more publications, more first-authored publications, a higher h-index, and a shorter time to first publication; and (3) higher federal grant (NIH K-or R-series) funding success rates (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). From a return-on-investment perspective, the 2.8 million dollars in R25 funding since 2004 has already yielded 4.6 million dollars in new grant funding. Quite aside from hard metrics and fiscal bottom lines, the program has led to the formation of a unique group of clinician-scientists with remarkable scientific creativity, innovation, and commitment.",

Each key theme was supported by multiple quotations. We followed best practice guidelines for the analysis, drafting, and submission of qualitative studies (14, 15) .

Progressing in lockstep with their evolving program certainly required comfort with uncertainty, but that trait was necessary well beyond the particularities of any given program: \"There are no assurances of success, or of a given experiment even working out. You just buckle up, hold on tight, trust the process, and go go go.\" Uncertainty could be not just tolerated but embraced, so long as there was a perspective that \"the scientific journey may There is that evocative quote from the Indigo Girls: \"There's more than one answer to these questions/Pointing me in a crooked line/And the less I seek my source for some definitive/Closer I am to fine.\" We're looking for concrete answers, but the more we're committed to that concrete part, the less successful we'll be, and probably the less happy.

In turn, they then do not comfortably admit feeling depressed, and in turn will not teach the next generation of trainees to get support when needed. As a result, stigmatized views about mental illness become entrenched and internalized, and each new class of trainees is flooded with lots of talk about self-care, without the commensurate role-modeling walk by their superiors (27) .",

Such questioning was not universal but certainly not rare either. Further, the discomfort with even skirting around the edges of the issue was evident. Trainees with as stellar backgrounds, trajectories, and promise could be paradoxically set up for the shortcomings of a medical culture and implicit hidden curriculum that make trainees feel like there is no room for mistakes in medicine, space for flaws in their personal makeup, or for rerouting their professional trajectories. Being in a high-pressure, outcomedriven, and demanding environment can set the stage for imposter syndrome feelings, narcissistic injury, or fear of being \"outed\" as somehow lacking.",

Instead I opted to dedicate myself to clinical work that would touch a significantly smaller number of people but would do so at a timescale and community immediacy I longed for. At the end of the day, it was those very mentors, family, and peers who encouraged me to apply the knowledge I had gained in the way that was most fulfilling for me. . . I did not \"leave\" anything.

To that end, we do not consider this study a formal evaluation of the program, for that purpose relying instead on the annual metrics set out by appropriate governing bodies, and on reporting requirements from funding agencies. Moreover, we have an external advisory board, and additionally conducted a consultation with outside experts after the initial decade of the program. We should also note that there was a substantial amount of feedback about programmatic granularities that we left out of this analysis and which may still prove useful in our efforts to improve the overall quality of the program in moving forward. Second, we did not interview stakeholders other than current trainees and graduates from the AJSP; the perspectives of program leaders, mentors, and external advisors are thus lacking. Finally, we recognize the limitations inherent to a single-site study conducted in a developed country and highresourced setting. However, we consider having done well on the trustworthiness of our report as reflected by two qualitative constructs (31, 32): (1) credibility, or the plausibility of our descriptions being recognized by its participants (a concept akin to internal validity); and (2) transferability, or the applicability of findings to other settings and programs (akin to generalizability or external validity).",
