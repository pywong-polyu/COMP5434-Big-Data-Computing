In this work we demonstrate that this technique is sensitive enough to distinguish films as thin as a single monolayer from the underlying substrate. Using collimated beams of He and Kr atoms as an incident probe on MoS2 films grown on SiO2/Si substrate, we observe systematic changes in the scattered atom flux which allows us to map the thin MoS2 films. Measurements carried out by varying incidence energy using both He and Kr provides insights into the details of atom-surface collision dynamics and its role in contrast generation.",

Contrast arising from the changes in scattering distributions resulting from inelastic collisions has also been identified [17] . More recently, contrast resulting via atomic diffraction by the crystalline nature of target sample has also been demonstrated [18] . This opens up the possibility of seeing features beyond the capability of conventional imaging methods. It is well known that atom scattering from surfaces is sensitive to local surface structure and disorder at an atomic length scale [19] and in principle can be utilized for contrast generation.

The beam is extracted into a differentially pumped chamber using a skimmer (Beam Dynamics, Model 2) with orifice diameter of 200 \u00b5m. Another metal film having a 20 \u00b5m diameter orifice was used to collimate the beam before entering into the scattering chamber. Source to sample distance was approximately 65 mm. Incident beam cross-sectional diameters were measured using a knifeedge scan on the sample plane, approximately 10 mm away from the final aperture. Cross-sectional diameters (full width at half maximum, FWHM) ranged from 27 to 33 \u00b5m (table I) , corresponding to a narrow angular divergence of \u223c 1 mrad (see appendix A). Typical steady state pressures in the source, differ-ential stages were 2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mbar, 1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mbar with beam off and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mbar, 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mbar with beam on, respectively (pure He, backing pressure 6 bar). Pressure increase in the scattering chamber with beam on (measured with an ionization gauge) remained below our detection limit with the pressure being 1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mbar.

On the other hand, the true specular scattered flux having a much narrow angular distribution ( 1 \u2022 ) will be completely captured by our detector. Previously reported He scattering studies from clean single crystal MoS 2 surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions [35] , show that specular reflected intensity is of the order of 2% at 300 K. Since samples in our experiments are far from being under pristine condition, this represents an upper limit to the true specular scattered flux seen by our detector. Consequently, it is well possible that the small fraction of diffuse scattered flux and true specular scattered flux reaching our detector are of comparable magnitude. This presents several interesting possibilities for contrast generation and its E inc dependence which are discussed below.",

Nevertheless, a qualitative estimate can be made as discussed below. For MoS 2 , based on the attenuation of specular He intensity vs surface temperature [35] , we obtain an effective surface mass in the range of 210 -240 amu. Given that He signal for SiO 2 /Si surface is comparatively lower by 10 to 30 %, the range of surface mass of SiO 2 /Si which satisfies this constraint is around 60 amu. This leads to an estimated contrast in the range of 5 to 15 % which decreases with E inc (appendix F). For Kr, even from pristine surfaces, inelastic scattering will dominate and the scattered flux will have a broad angular distribution.

It has been reported in atom scattering based imaging experiments, that in case of He atom scattering from LiF(100) surface [18] , features corresponding to diffraction can be observed from the regions where sample is locally flat. Extending this argument one can say that, in general, different surfaces will lead to different diffraction patterns thereby leading to a contrast. Further, as E inc decreases, diffraction peaks are expected to appear at larger angles from the specular direction. Hence, for a fixed detector geometry placed near specular direction, this can lead to a decreasing signal (and contrast) with decreasing E inc . Based on the results available for He scattering from MoS 2 surfaces [35] the first order in-plane diffraction peaks from MoS 2 are expected to be approximately at +/-15 \u2022 from the specular direction. At lower E inc these peaks are expected to move away from specular direction and lowering the signal and contrast, consistent with our observations using He. A more thorough evaluation of the role of diffraction based contrast generation and its E inc dependence can be obtained by measuring angular distributions.",

Under such circumstances, a large fraction He atoms (> 98%) are expected to undergo diffuse elastic scattering. If MoS 2 surfaces have a lower defect/adsorbate density compared to the substrate, it will lead to a relatively lower diffuse elastic scattering component (and larger mirror-like reflection component). This would be consistent with larger scattered signals observed from MoS 2 surfaces seen in our experiments. Further, increase in diffuse elastic scattering cross-sections with decreasing E inc will result in a loss of signal in the specular direction. The exact rate of this change will depend on the specific nature of surface and defects/adsorbates. In case, this diffuse elastic component from MoS 2 surface increases faster as compared to that on SiO 2 /Si, it will result in a decrease in contrast with decreasing E inc , as seen in figure 4a -4d.

            "text": "Different out-of-plane scattering components resulting from inelastic scattering of incident He atoms can lead to changes in specular scattered flux. Barr and coworkers [17] have identified this effect by imaging a series of thin metal films (15 to 40 nm thickness) on SiO 2 /Si surface using He as probe. Contrast observed in their experiments does not follow the trend expected from surface roughness (measured independently using atomic force microscopy), but decreases with decreasing incidence energy. In the present case, for He, a similar trend is observed (figures 4 and 5). It could well be that changes in the inelastic scattering component of He on MoS 2 and SiO 2 /Si lead to an E inc dependent contrast in NAM im-ages. As mentioned earlier, Kr being relatively heavier and at larger E inc than He (see table I) is expected to undergo largely classical scattering [29, 36, 37] . Under these conditions, scattered flux of Kr will be relatively insensitive to surface lattice vibrations, leading to more or less unchanged contrast as observed in 450 to 270 meV region. The decrease in contrast at lower energies could possibly arise from trapping and desorption behavior, where Kr atoms leave the surface with a very broad angular distribution leading to a lower signal seen by our detector. Finally, another point that needs to be looked into is that of change in surface roughness of MoS 2 vs SiO 2 /Si. Although, for the current samples a direct surface roughness measurement is not available with us, we estimate this based on previously prepared samples using the same experimental setup and methodology. Measurements over regions with areas up to 25 \u00b5m 2 show that the surface roughness, characterized by RMS of height distribution, is lower for MoS 2 (1.28 nm -1.72 nm) than SiO 2 /Si (1.99 nm -3.15 nm) (see appendix G). Assuming that a similar picture holds true for our samples, this is likely to be important factor in contrast generation, especially when Kr atoms are used as a probe. The beam of Kr atoms being at higher E inc than He, is a more sensitive probe of surface roughness and the increased Kr signal from MoS 2 surface and contrast (compared to He) points towards the same. It should be noted that the contrast based purely on surface roughness is expected to be independent of E inc , hence additional factors as discussed above need to be considered, especially for He atoms.",

Observations made using Kr atoms point towards the role of decreased surface roughness caused by MoS 2 films, compared to SiO 2 /Si substrate, leading to contrast generation. The decrease in contrast at lower E inc possibly arises from trapping-desorption of Kr atoms. On the other hand, in case of He atoms, several factors such as changes in surface roughness, specular component, diffuse elastic scattering, inelastic scattering, diffraction are possibly playing a role. At present, based on these results alone, it is difficult to precisely evaluate the contribution of these individual factors.

Low temperature zone, containing sulphur powder, was maintained at 200 \u2022 C. MoO 3 , placed in an alumina crucible, was kept in the high temperature zone beside SiO 2 /Si substrate at 650 \u2022 C. It took around 30 min for high temperature zone to reach 650 \u2022 C.

Contrast observed for thin MoS 2 films, corresponding to regions A 1 , A 2 and B 1 , B 2 , remain largely unchanged over this time span.

A fit to this data (two curves) using the surface mass as fit parameter gives the effective mass of MoS 2 surface to be 210 and 240 amu.

Panel d, blue and red points show the contrast evaluated from the above images. For comparison, contrast vs Einc measured during the same time span is also shown (green points). Contrast is calculated using the signals obtained from regions marked by rectangles and labelled as A1, A2 and B1, B2 in panels a -c.
