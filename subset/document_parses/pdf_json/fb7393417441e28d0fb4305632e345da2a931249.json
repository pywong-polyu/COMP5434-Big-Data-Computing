            "text": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex and disabling condition that affects an estimated 200,000 Australians [1] with a substantial economic burden estimated at $14.5 billion (AUD) in Australia per annum [2] . The pathomechanism underlying ME/CFS is not fully understood. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the application of case criteria including the Fukuda criteria (1994), the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC), and the International Consensus Criteria (ICC) following the exclusion of any other pathological cause [3] [4] [5] . Under these criteria, ME/CFS is hallmarked by post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion (PENE). PENE presents as profound fatigue following minimal exertion, is unrelieved by rest, and exacerbates other symptoms that affect multiple body systems [3, 4] . These symptoms include immune dysfunction, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, cardiovascular, and neurological issues [4] . The severity of these symptoms varies between patients ranging from mild to severe, where approximately 25% of patients are either housebound or bedbound [4] . Many patients are dependent on carer support and require access to numerous multidisciplinary services including various specialists, physio-and occupational therapy [6, 7] . Currently there is no targeted treatment or molecular-based diagnostic test for this illness and existing treatment guidelines attempt to relieve specific symptoms [8] .",

In an Australian epidemiological investigation, almost half of ME/CFS patients whose ME/CFS onset was attributed to a non-infectious trigger listed 'undue stress' as a significant contribution to illness onset [10] . A study conducted by Lutgendorf et al. in 1995 suggested that physical symptoms of ME/CFS were exacerbated by stress from Hurricane Andrew [11] . Chu et al. acknowledged stress as a potential trigger of flare-ups and symptom aggravation. Importantly, greater stress management is associated with reduced symptom severity and the improvement of the illness burden [12] .",

Participants were then invited to complete a series of questionnaires which were composed of questions detailing experiences of stress and/or change in work, loss of income or change in family dynamic.

Reduced economic and social productivity can cause stress, anxiety or depression, as well as exacerbate symptoms in individuals suffering chronic conditions, such as ME/CFS [10] . A relationship between unemployment and poorer health has been consistently reported [19, 20] . Jain et al. determined that severe cognitive impairment and sleep symptoms were significantly associated and increased with ME/CFS patients with a low household income [19] . Another study also reported that increased muscular, cognitive, neurological, autonomic, and immunological symptoms are consistently associated with unemployment and increased risk of work disability in ME/CFS patients [20] . Interestingly, another study identified that environmental and psychological stressors exacerbate self-reported ME/CFS symptoms following a natural disaster [11] . Given that this study occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, this unprecedented environmental stressor could have influenced these clinical changes. Stress management in ME/CFS patients has also been related to lower fatigue severity in ME/CFS [12] .
