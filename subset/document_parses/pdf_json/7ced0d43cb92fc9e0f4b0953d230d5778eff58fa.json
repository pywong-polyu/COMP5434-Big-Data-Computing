Typical treatment involves teaching children the correct tongue movements to produce speech sounds. This is known as articulation intervention. However, this intervention is challenging because the tongue is hidden from view and movements are difficult to see and describe. This pilot randomized control trial will try a new treatment, ultrasound visual biofeedback (U-VBF) versus standard articulatory intervention for children with cleft lip and palate, as comparison. Feasibility outcomes will be determined.",

It is likely that larger studies using EPG are sparse because of practical issues with using this tool.

U-VBF holds several practical advantages over EPG: it is cheaper and does not require individualized equipment. The one-off outlay cost of an ultrasound system that is suitable for speech therapy is approximately $6,000 [9] , initial outlay for EPG is similar, but in addition each patient requires an EPG plate costing between $300-$570, not including the dental impression cost [7] . Moreover, while EPG images only tongue-palate contact from the alveolar region to the boundary of the hard and soft palate, U-VBF images from near the tongue tip to the root, with pharyngeal articulations, common in CLP, clearly visible. This makes U-VBF arguably the technique of choice for CLP [10] ; yet, it is relatively new to the Speech and Language Therapy clinic.

In that study the U-VBF treatment was effective for one of the children, aged 6;2, who achieved accurate production of target sounds and generalized them to untreated words. In children with other types of speech sound disorders, U-VBF shows positive outcomes for the majority of children and it is particularly useful for establishing new articulations [8] : an area of particular difficulty in CLP [5] . U-VBF is therefore potentially a useful tool for establishing new articulations in children with CLP. The aim of this study is therefore to assess the feasibility and inform the design of a full-scale RCT of U-VBF for children with cleft speech characteristics. Key objectives and success criteria for proceeding to full trial are given below. If these are met, a full-scale RCT will proceed using a similar design. Questionnaires and focus groups will provide qualitative data from patients and carers.

The person carrying out this assessment will not be involved in the therapy. This assessment will be either in person or via video conferencing, with in-person preferred. Screening assessment will comprise the British Picture Vocabulary Test 3 [15] to screen for adequate receptive vocabulary. This test does not require verbal responses or assess speech production, instead participants point to responses. The screening will also include a speech assessment protocol to determine whether patients present with at least one cleft speech characteristic which would be amenable to both U-VBF and the control intervention. This assessment protocol comprises the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology [16] articulation and phonology subtests and an ultrasound tongue imaging protocol designed in a previous project [11] to identify covert speech errors from consonants at all places of articulation and sentences from the GoS.SP.aSS. '98/ CAPS-A [17] (Appendix 1). Families who opt for the assessment over video-conferencing will complete the same assessments, but the ultrasound tongue imaging protocol will be replaced with an audio-perceptual assessment of the same materials 1 .",

We intend to select as intervention targets speech sounds which are (1) amenable to treatment with both interventions and (2) likely to have the biggest functional impact on intelligibility, based on the prevalence of the error during assessment and how frequently the target sound occurs in English minimal pairs [20] . Following the screening assessments, we will select wordlists targeting each child's specific lingual errors from a battery. In English, lingual speech sounds (imageable with ultrasound and amenable to treatment with both interventions) are /t,d,n,r,l,s,z,\u222b,\u0292,t\u0283,d\u0292,j,k,\u0261,\u014b/ and all vowels. Children with CLP are more likely to have difficulty with anterior consonants /t,d,s/. Wordlists containing these speech sounds will also form a key outcome measure (see below). Two wordlists per error type will be selected, firstly an \"untreated probe\" (i.e., the words will not be used in the course of therapy, and this allows us to check for generalization of targets). Secondly a \"treated probe\", containing high-frequency and functionally useful words will be used to train speech targets in the course of therapy. The wordlists contain lingual targets in increasingly complex contexts from single syllable words/pseudowords through to multi-syllabic words and sentences. Where the child has more than one error, multiple wordlists will be used; however, only one treatment target (the speech sound with the most errors) will be selected and the other errors will serve as \"control segments\" (i.e., speech sounds that should not improve during the course of therapy unless maturation is a factor). Wordlists will be analyzed for percentage target consonants correct (PTC). Children must score < 30PTC at baseline to be eligible for the study.",

Therapy in both treatment arms will be once per week for six sessions with each session lasting up to 45 min. The number of sessions is pragmatic in nature, reflecting current practice, and is designed to highlight initial response to both interventions. It is likely that some children in both arms of the trial may require further speech intervention in the future (after the follow-up measures are taken), and this will be provided in line with standard practice, which includes further U-VBF. Both interventions will focus on acquisition of new speech sounds. Previous studies of children with non-cleft speech disorders show that a new speech sound can be acquired within one to two sessions [21] of U-VBF for most children but that some children take four to six sessions. Target articulations will be decided individually. Both interventions begin with a pre-practice phase where the aim is to teach the child to approximate the target articulation before they can begin the practice phase where at least 100 repetitions are required for learning and generalization. The dosage of a minimum of 100 trials is set in line with [22] who report a minimum of 60 to 120 trials per session for motor-based treatments. However, we recognize that the literature on dosage required during intervention for CSCs is sparse and that there is much variation reported in the literature on articulation intervention [23] . This dosage will be measured in both interventions. In this pilot we will focus on both the pre-practice phase and the first stage of practice: acquisition of a new sound in simple contexts such as \"ta, tea, toe\" building to short words such as \"tap, team, tore\" as this is feasible within six intervention sessions. If children are super-responders (i.e., they quickly retain the new speech sound and are able to produce it in complex contexts) then the protocol will also allow us to measure this. Participants will be discontinued from the intervention if they show any adverse effects to the ultrasound treatment-in rare cases, the ultrasound gel can cause contact dermatitis [24] .",

These SLTs will also rate the audio recordings from the within-treatment sessions (t1 to t6 in Table 1 ), blinded to group.",

            "text": "This pilot feasibility study will determine whether a fullscale randomized control trial comparing ultrasound visual biofeedback to treatment as usual (articulation intervention) for the treatment of cleft speech characteristics is feasible. Prior studies such as [21] suggest that children with CLP can tolerate ultrasound recordings and studies such as [14] suggest good retention in ultrasound intervention, with only one child in this study lost to follow-up. We therefore predict that the objectives outlined above will be met, and if this is the case a full-scale, adequately powered, multi-center RCT will be warranted. Within this planned larger RCT, we hypothesize that U-VBF will show quicker acquisition of speech sounds in error, leading to shorter time in intervention, reduced frustration for patients, and cost savings. Nevertheless, there are some potential limitations to the current study. Firstly, it is not known how acceptable randomization will be to patients and carers, and it is possible that carers will express a preference for the trial intervention, given the novelty of the technology used in U-VBF [23] . To mitigate this, patients will be offered U-VBF at the completion of the study, if their speech errors remain. A previous study trialing a similar technologybased intervention with children with Down syndrome showed that no children were lost to follow-up in either arm of the trial when this was offered [32] . A further limitation of the current study, which cannot be completely mitigated, is a potential preference from the treating clinicians for one intervention over the other, in particular the trial intervention. This could lead to increased outcomes in the trial intervention, which are not due to the visual biofeedback per se, but more to increased motivation in the intervention sessions [33] . Finally, a recent move towards more use of telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic, means that U-VBF is disadvantaged compared to articulation intervention, because it is a behavioral intervention which requires hardware and therefore only be can only be carried out in person, rather than over video-conferencing. It therefore currently may be more difficult to recruit to a trial which involves travel to a hospital or university.",
