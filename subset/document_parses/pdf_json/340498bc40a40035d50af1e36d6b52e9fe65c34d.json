In this paper, we use novel deep learning methods for short-term (multi-step-ahead) air-quality prediction in selected parts of Delhi, India. Our deep learning methods comprise of long short-term memory (LSTM) network models which also include some recent versions such as bidirectional-LSTM and encoder-decoder LSTM models. We use a multivariate time series approach that attempts to predict air quality for 10 prediction horizons covering total of 80 hours and provide a long-term (one month ahead) forecast with uncertainties quantified. Our results show that the multivariate bidirectional-LSTM model provides best predictions despite COVID-19 impact on the air-quality during full and partial lockdown periods. The effect of COVID-19 on the air quality has been significant during full lockdown; however, there was unprecedented growth of poor air quality afterwards.",

Research show that the major growth in population is attributed to the metropolitan areas in the less developed regions around the globe [2, 3] . The consequence of these increased levels of growth in poorly developed states is low air quality. We note that 80% of global cities [3] and 98% of cities in middle-income countries surpass the proposed levels of air quality [4, 5] . Increase in air pollution results in economic losses, reduced visibility, contributes to faster climate change that contribute to extreme weather conditions, millions of premature deaths annually [6] . The major factor in air pollution is the anthropogenic fine particulate matter (PM); i.e. PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter shorter than 2.5 micrometer) [7, 8, 9, 10] . Despite the concentrations of PM2.5 being two to five times higher in developing countries, most of the air quality considerations and estimations are analyzed for developed countries [11] .",

Machine learning methods have been promoting for forecasting temporal sequences and their application to air-quality forecasting has gained attention recently [18, 19, 20] . Forecasting models can be used to develop strategies to evaluate and alarm the general public for future hazardous levels of air quality index. Forecasting models for air pollution concentrations can be broadly classified into two major categories; simulation based and data driven approaches such as statistical or machine learning methods. Simulationbased method incorporates physical and chemical models for generating meteorological and background parameters to simulate emission, transport and chemical transformation of air pollution [21, 22] ]. However, they suffer from numerical model uncertainties and due to the lack of data, the parameterization of aerosol emissions is restricted [23] ]. Data driven approaches exploit statistical and machine learning techniques to detect patterns between predictors and dependent variables in temporal sequences [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] . Machine learning methods can be used to identify the exposures relevant to health outcomes of interest within high-dimensional data [29] . Advances in deep learning methods give further motivations for application to domain of air-quality prediction.",

COVID-19 forced many countries to close their borders and enforce a partial or full lock down with devastating impact on the world economy [45, 46, 47] . There has been studies relating the effect of environment and air pollution on COVID-19 and vice versa [48, 49, 49] with studies regarding China [50] , Kazakhstan [48] and [49] Brazil. In some cases, COVID-19 lock-downs with reduced traffic showed to reduce air pollution while in others, it did not make significant impact due to meteorological conditions and factors such as industrial pollutants [51, 49] . Although machine learning has been used for forecasting air-quality, there is scope in improving the forecasts in using latest machine learning models, that feature deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks. Given this motivation, we focus on air-quality index of Delhi which lately reached hazardous levels. We note that the air-quality in Delhi has significantly improved post COVID-19 pandemic [52] , however this was due to lock-downs by the government and the air-quality can deteriorate further when the restrictions are eased. Hence it is important to develop robust forecasting models, that are applicable even during lock-downs and eras of lock-downs during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We also provide a long-term (one month ahead) forecast with uncertainty quantification given feedback of predicted values into the model. We first show visualisation of the air quality indicators before and during coronavirus (COVID) restrictions in Delhi. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on air-quality and the ability of the model to provide quality predictions before and during COVID-19. Our models feature data that considers major seasons, effect of COVID-19, and considers multivariate and univariate approach for predictions.",

[50] found that there was a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 infection in China. Kerimray et al. [48] presented an assessment on the impact of COVID-19 in large cities in Kazakhstan and found that the temporal reduction in pollution may not be directly attributed to the lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, however the spatial effects of the lockdown on the pollution levels were clear. Moreover, other non-traffic based sources such as coal based power plants substantially contributed to the pollution level. Dantas et al. [49] presented a study on the impact of COVID-19 partial lockdown on the air quality of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The authors reported that The carbon-dioxide levels showed the most significant reductions during the partial lockdown while nitrogen-oxide decreased in a lower extent, due to industrial and diesel input. The air quality index (with PM-10 concentration) was only reduced during the first partial lockout week. Bao and Zhang [53] reviewed 44 cities in China to find if COVID-19 lockdowns had an effect on air pollution. The authors showed that the lockdowns of 44 cities reduced human movements by 69.85 %, and the reduction in the air quality index was mediated by human mobility. Li et al. [54] presented a study on air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the Yangtze River Delta region in Northern China where the authors showed that the ozone did not show any reduction. Moreover, even during the lockdown it was evident that background and residual pollution are still high, which includes sources mostly from the industry. Dutheil and Naval [55] investigated COVID-19 as a factor influencing air pollution for China. The authors argued that COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically have decreased the total number of deaths during the period by drastically decreasing the number of fatalities due to air pollution, apart from positive benefits in reducing preventable non communicable diseases. Wang et al. [51] showed that in case of China, severe air pollution events were not avoided by reduced activities during COVID-19 outbreak due to adverse meteorological events. The authors highlight that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution especially when meteorology is unfavorable.",

In the past five years, the air quality index of Delhi has been generally moderate level between January to September. The air quality index then drastically deteriorates to very poor (301-400), and further Severe (401-500) or Hazardous (500+) levels during October to December due to various factors [73, 74] .

Lower wind speed (weak dispersion/ventilation) can result in higher concentrations of traffic pollutants [80] . However, strong wind speed might form dust storms and end up blowing the particles on the ground. [81] . Higher humidity levels are associated with higher aggregates of air pollutants like PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [82] . In addition, high levels of humidity often indicate precipitation events which result in heavy wet deposition leading to the lowering of air pollutants [83] . The most important factors of attenuated visibility are the interactions of particle compositions and light [84? ]. Thus, low visibility can be considered as a strong indicator of high PM2.5 concentrations. Many a time, the formation of some significant air pollutants like ozone (O3) is reduced by cloud cover as they absorb and scatter solar radiations [85, 86] . Therefore, these meteorological variables are importantly selected to predict air quality and hence we take them into consideration.",

[92] . Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network [33] was developed which was capable of overcoming the fundamental problems of deep learning [30] . LSTM networks addressed the issue with much better capabilities in remembering the long-term dependencies using memory cells and gates for temporal sequences. The memory cells are trained in a supervised fashion using an adaptation of the BPTT algorithm that considers the respective gates [33] . More recently, Adam optimiser which features adaptive learning rate has been prominent in training LSTM models via BPTT [93] .",

We find some missing data in the initial months of 2018 for some stations therefore we consider the data from 1 January 2019 to 10 December 2020 for building our respective models and strategies. Table 6 presents a summary of the visualisation in Figure 5 where the seasons are quantitatively highlighted. We observe higher values of PM2.5 value for the months from October till February on a seasonal basis after which the value starts to descend starting from the month of March. Although we find lower values of PM2.5 during March-June every year, we observe a significant decrease for months of interest (March-June 2020), which belongs to the COVID-19 full lockdown period in India when compared to the respective months in 2018 and 2019as shown in Table 6 and Figure 5 . We find a similar decrease of PM2.5 values for all the monitoring stations while Bawana records the highest values for 2019 and 2020 among other stations. The partial lockdown period include the months after June, 2020 as highlighted in Figure 5 . more independent feature sets. Higher positive correlation values are represented as dark brown panels while higher negative correlation values are represented as dark blue panels in different correlation heatmaps. We observe higher correlation values of NOx with NO and NO2 also which is expected because they are nitrogenous pollutants and show higher positive dependence. We also observe high positive correlation values between PM2.5 and PM10 for all the monitoring stations which also indicates a good amount of correlation. ",

Table 6 shows the mean and (\u00b1) 95% confidence interval for PM2.5 concentration for different monitoring stations for the months March to June in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. We selected this particular interval of months to show a comparison of PM2.5 concentration in consecutive years for these COVID-19 lockdown months. We observe a significant decrease in PM2.5 concentration in 2020 for all monitoring stations as compared to 2019 as a consequence of COVID-19 lockdown. In our first set of experiments, we compare the performance of different multivariate LSTM models (LSTM, ED-LSTM and BD-LSTM) where all the models are trained using Adam Optimizer using the dataset collected from the monitoring station at Anand Vihar. We also show results with canonical feedforward neural network (FNN-Adam) with Adam optimiser. We also show results for case of shuffling the training data (BD-LSTM*), univariate (UBD-LSTM) and seasonal (SBD-LSTM) at Anand Vihar. Note that all LSTM models are multivariate except for UBD-LSTM. Figure 6 (a) shows the prediction horizon RMSE for 10 step ahead prediction, and Figure 6 (b) shows the mean RMSE for entire train and test datasets for Anand Vihar using different LSTM models. We show bar plots with mean and (\u00b1) 95% confidence interval using 30 experimental runs. Note that lower value of RMSE indicates better performance. We find that the prediction RMSE in general increases across prediction horizons for all the models which is also natural as we use a specified window size as input to predict the multi-step ahead values and the results deteriorate as the gap in the missing values increases with increasing prediction horizon. In Figure 6 (b) and Table 7 , we find that the multivariate BD-LSTM performs the best on train dataset generalizes well with test performance. We find that ED-LSTM is the worst performer in this case with highest RMSE on both train and test dataset in comparison to other models. In Figure 6 (a) and Table 7 , we observe that multivariate BD-LSTM generally has the best performance which significantly improved for step sizes 6-10 when compared to other models.",

This could be due to the BD-LSTM architecture which features both forward and backward information for a sequence at each time-step using two LSTM layers [95] . We find that BD-LSTM performs the best for larger time steps (6-10) with better generalization as compared to other models which indicates that BD-LSTM captures better information for long-term ahead prediction.

The seasonal model (SBD-LSTM) performs slightly better on test dataset for Anand Vihar, Bawana and DTU along with good generalization performance which indicates that the model is robust to the effects of COVID-19 lockdown period. It is important to evaluate the effect on performance of different models due to seasonal decrease of PM2.5 values during COVID-19 lockdown period when compared to previous years.

Moreover, India also has plans to go fully electric in the transportation sector by 2030 [111] . Currently, India has began manufacturing electric vehicles with plans to have fully electric rail network by 2024 [112] . Renewable energy is expected to rise from 27 % of total energy demand in 2014 to around 43 % by 2040 [113] . In many developing countries, it is clear that an increase of population density increases the air pollution; however, this can change with type of energy used. In a recent study, in the case of China, it has been shown that the increase in population density will reduces air pollution which has been due to clean energy and public transportation [114] . A study on the effects of meteorological conditions and air pollution on COVID-19 transmission from 219 Chinese cities found that air pollution indicators were positively correlated with new confirmed cases and increase in cases were linked with air-quality index [115] . Such study in case of India would be needed and prediction of air-quality indicators could help in preventative measures.",

Moreover, we envision the application of the proposed framework in other parts of India and rest of the world which has decline in air quality. A web-based framework can be implemented by the respective authorities that can be used to provide proper weekly and monthly planning, which could involve the way traffic is managed for different seasons.

Although we selected a subset of the base stations, the methodology can be applied to rest of the base stations in Delhi or in other parts of the world. Our results show that multivariate bi-directional LSTM model shows best performance, and rest of the LSTM models have certain strengths and limitations which need to be evaluated prior to developing a system that provides rigours uncertainty quantification in predictions. We also found that COVID-19 had a significant effect on the air quality during full lockdown implemented for few months and afterwards, there was unprecedented growth of poor air quality which has a seasonal effect as compared to previous years. We provide open source software framework and open data which can be used for further verification and also application for studying or developing prediction models in other places.",
