Despite all the efforts, the pharmacological agents used for controlling or treating the disease, especially curing the respiratory problems, have not been fully successful so far. Among various treatment options, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based cellular therapies are being investigated, because of MSC's regeneration ability though limitless self-renewal and multipotency along with other features like immunomodulation, antifibrosis and anti-inflammatory effects [4, 5, 6] .

Coronavirus, named after the spike-like glycoproteins (S proteins) surrounding the viral envelope like a crown [10] . These S proteins binds the virus to its cellular receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in MERS-CoV, with subsequent membrane fusion [11] .

The virion-containing vesicles consists of genomic RNA, envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins develops, then fuses with the plasma membrane, resulting in the release of the viruses [12] .

When the virus invades the host, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) work on the recognition of the virus by innate immune system. The virus promotes dendritic cells maturation, expression of the inflammatory factors, and type I interferons (IFNs) release. These induce macrophage function and thus viral invasion restriction [24] . SARS-CoV's N protein can induce the interference of the immune process by supporting the virus run off the immune responses [25] . As parts of the adaptive immune system, the main actors, CD4+ T cells work by stimulating B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells. On the other hand, T helper cells secrete the proinflammatory cytokines to support the defense of the body. Anyhow, nCoV is able to suppress the function of T cells by inducing their apoptosis. On the other hand, if the immune system is overreacted, local reactive free radicals may provoke severe damages to the organs, particularly to the lungs [26] . ",

The other methodologies are using the extracorporeal organ replacement for acute renal failure or fulminant acute liver failure, skeletal stem cell implantation for bone regeneration, which are already under clinical application [33, 34] . As the considerable amount of evidence has been obtained from basic research and its translation towards the clinical research, MSCs placed in medical practice as an alternative treatment option as safe and effective cellbased therapies for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as graft versus-host disease (GVHD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

The transparency in clinical research involves registration of clinical trials on public databases, accessibility of patient data for subsequent analysis, and publication of results irrespective of the trial outcome. The publicly available clinical trial data over registries keeps all parties involved in the clinical trials up to date on the recent medical research trends and results even before they are published. It is of crucial importance to have transparent results to ensure that decisions related to the safety and efficacy of investigated treatment or prevention approaches to be used in human are supported by the best-available scientific evidence. Evidence-based public health decisions and strategies ensure, in turn, an optimal allocation of public health resources and, ideally, better patient outcomes (https://www.ecrin.org/node/583 access 24 April 2020).",

These findings were supported by the abating pneumonia infiltration indicated in chest CT, and negative results for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in two weeks after infusion [72] . The mechanisms underlying the MSC infusion-led improvements in COVID-19 patients attributed to strong antiinflammatory action of MSCs. The evidence of this was obtained from multiple beneficial outcomes, including the increased number of peripheral lymphocytes, the decline in the Creactive protein, and waning of overactivated cytokinesecreting immune cells (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells) by 3-6 days in the circulating blood [72, 73] .

A single intravenous dose of 10 \u00d7 10 6 BM-MSCs/ kg bw was given to 40 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. A wellknown pulmonary and systemic vascular injury biomarker, Angiopoietin 2, is a well-recognized mediator and biomarker of pulmonary and systemic vascular injury was chosen to track the pulmonary function improvement and a strong correlation between this biomarker and cell viability and between viability and improvement in oxygenation index. The authors claimed the effective treatment in recovering patients in MSC group with no MSC-related hemodynamic or respiratory adverse events. The authors concluded that a single dose of intravenous BM-MSCs was safe in patients with moderate to severe ARDS and larger trials were needed to assess efficacy.",

Secondly, used dosing regimens, dosing intervals and follow up durations vary among the trials, probably due to the experimental nature, sources, clinical-stage of the dose context of the MSCs. When the information on the severity of the COVID-19 target cases is not given in trial information, then the validity of the data needs to be justified since the disease is appearing in varying severities due to the individual differences [7, 77] . The cytokine storm and the relevant pulmonary and/or other tissue damages could vary depending on the age and the concomitant other chronic diseases [78, 79, 80, 81] . As the ages of the included patients almost at all selected trials, there is one more concern raise: Can the same dosing strategy be followed confidently at all ages between 18 and 76 (note: average of inclusion age maximum at all trials, except the ones that maximum age was mentioned as 'older' only).",
