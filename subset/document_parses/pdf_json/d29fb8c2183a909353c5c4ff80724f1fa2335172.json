An important reason behind the widespread social anxiety is the huge uncertainty about the pandemic. One major uncertainty is how many or what percentage of people have been infected? There are published and frequently updated data on various statistics of the pandemic, at local, country or global level. However, due to various reasons, many cases were not included in those reported numbers. We propose a structured approach for the estimation of the number of unreported cases, where we distinguish cases that arrive late in the reported numbers and those who had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured by any medical system at all. We use post-report data for the estimation of the former and population matching to the latter. We estimate that the reported number of infected cases in the US should be corrected by multiplying a factor of 220.54% as of Apr 20, 2020. The infection ratio out of the US population is estimated to be 0.53%, implying a case mortality rate at 2.85% which is close to the 3.4% suggested by the WHO.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "With the quick spread at the global scale, the COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the most tragic disasters in human history, with a worldwide confirmed cases of 2.74 million and death toll at 192k as of April 24, 2020. Rising trend of these numbers still remains in multiple countries right now. The most risky aspects about the coronavirus are the long incubation period and the existence of a large number of asymptomatic cases. These cause a substantial proportion of infected cases not tracked by medical systems. For better policy making and disease control, as well as to reduce the widespread speculations among the public about the extent of the disease spread, it is of significant interest to give an estimate on the missing counts.

However, certain characteristics of the coronavirus epidemiology allow us to take a different approach. We adopt a structured approach, inspired by the diagnostic analysis of remote sensing studies [8] where the errors in the land use classification were decomposed according to their sources. Our approach is illustrated by Figure 1 . The missing counts in the reported numbers come from two sources. One is those cases for which, at the report date, the symptoms were not severe enough and the affected individuals would not test for infection; however, they would eventually visit some medical facility and test for potential coronavirus infection. We call such cases the type I cases, and the waiting period before the onset is termed as the incubation (or dormant) period. This is illustrated as the filled blue bars in Figure 1 . At the time of report, all such cases are still in dormant status thus are missing in the reported number. The second source of unreported cases are those who were infected but are either not aware of it or with symptoms too light to visit the medical facility, and later on recovered without any particular medical treatments. We call such cases the type II cases. The type II cases never show up in any reported numbers, thus leaving too little clue for estimation. But we cannot overlook such cases, be-cause the number of such cases could be potentially large and such individuals form an important infecting source. For the rest of this section, we will describe our method for the estimation of each of the two cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 124, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 142, "end": 145, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 346, "end": 349, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 473, "end": 481, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 973, "end": 981, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "A structured approach"}, {"text": "The estimation of the number of type I cases is facilitated by a crucial observation.

First, the length of the dormant period varies for individual cases. Also, during the post-report time window, newly infected cases may arise and be reported. Thus the number of newly reported cases at any particular day within this time window might be mixed, in the sense that it would include both cases that are infected both before (but were in dormant period) and after the report date. The former case will not pose a problem as anyway such cases would be counted towardsD type1 though cases infected at the same day may now contribute to different D i 's. The latter case is undesirable but could be corrected, to a certain extent, by the truncating effect when we only sum up the counts in the post-report time window up to a length of T days. That is, those cases with a dormant period extending more than T days post-report will be truncated and not included inD type1 , with the total count of such truncated cases being 'cancelled out' by the newly infected cases within the post-report time window of a properly chosen length T .

For such an estimation to be feasible, we have two requirements. One is that the daily reported counts through time would not change too abruptly. Thus, our approach would not work well when the infection trend still rises very rapidly. During such a period, the safest strategy might be to strictly enforce social distancing. But as the overall situation is gradually under control, our estimation would apply. The other is knowledge of the duration of the incubation period. According to many studies [3, 1, 4] , the incubation periods has a median of around 4-7 days. While further studies or data analysis is required to confirm this, we take T = 7 in our estimation. Additionally, it should be cautious that our estimation is valid assuming that the test of coronavirus is sufficiently carried out for the population of interest; insufficient test would render an underestimate of the number of type I cases. In Figure 2 , we plot the ratio of estimated type I cases w.r.t. the reported number of cases for Connecticut (CT) and Massachusetts (MA) since Mar 8, 2020. These two states were chosen as they are similar in many aspects, so we expect their ratio of type I cases out of reported cases would be similar. In Figure 2 , there is an initial difference in ratios of type I cases in these two states, which we attribute to the late response and the small number of cases tested in CT. Later, these two states exhibit strikingly similar trend, which is quite xpected. We also explore the effect of using different values of T where 6 and 7 are used. Again, initially the resulting estimation are fairly different, which indicates the rapid spread of coronavirus and the rapid rise of infected cases. Gradually, the difference in the resulting estimations diminish, which implies that the choice of T = 7 leads to a fairly stable estimation at late stages of disease spread. Similar observation can be made for the estimation of type I cases in US. This is shown in the right panel of Figure 2 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 683, "end": 686, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 687, "end": 689, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 690, "end": 692, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1097, "end": 1105, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1409, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2180, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Estimating the number of type I cases"}, {"text": "The estimation of the number of type II cases is extremely challenging, as there is barely anything observable. Our main strategy in the estimation is based on the matching of population statistics-using what we see well to infer what is missing. When we group reported infection cases, we notice a significant discrepancy in the count statistics by age groups between reported cases and the US population. We expect that, while people in most age groups in the popu- lation have a similar chance of being infected, those type II cases occur much more often in age groups 20-64 but rarely for people of age 65+. This is because people at age over 65 typically have a relatively weaker immune system along with some pre-existing medical conditions. Once they are infected with coronavirus, a slight symptom would prompt them to seek medical treatments. As a result, such cases are very likely to be discovered. Thus reported counts about such age groups would be more accurate and can serve as a reference to correct counts for other age groups. On the contrary, cases for the 20-64 age group are easy to be overlooked or not noticed, unless their status is deteriorated. The reported counts for these age groups thus require a correction (termed as age correction). The age group of 85+ is more vulnerable to infections, as they typically live in the senior centers or extended-care nursing facilities which, as a matter of fact, have a very high risk of infection. The case statistics for this age group would be very thorough, but many in this age group get infected simply because they share a very confined living space with many other equally vulnerable seniors, and the infection of any one (including staff) in a senior center will quickly spread to the rest (To certain extent, one may think of this as a party of many people during COVID-19). So statistics in this age group would not be a reliable reference for population match, since people in other age groups have a very different mobility pattern (the infants interact with the world through their parents thus have a chance of infection not so different from the general population).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Estimating the number of type II cases"}, {"text": "The main assumption we use for population match is that all the people, with an age in the range 0-84, have similar chance of being infected. As a result, the counts at different age groups would be proportional to their respective percentage in the population; we call such an approach population matching. Let r pop and r case be the proportions of the reference group in the population and in the reported cases, and x pop and x corrected be the the respective proportions for the target group, respectively. Then r case : r pop = x corrected : x pop , and the corrected percentage in the infected cases for the target group can be calculated accordingly. As we argue before, the case statistics for age groups 65-74 and 75-84 are reliable, but those for ages 0-64 are incomplete and consist of substantial missing data, and we will use the reliable portion of the data to infer or correct statistics about the incomplete part of the data. A simple calculation reveals that age groups, 65-74 and 75-84, according to Table 1, have a similar ratio of cases percentage: population percentage, i.e., 9.00 : 4.70 \u2248 17.00 : 9.32. Thus, we can pool counts from these two groups and obtain r case : r pop = (9.00 + 17.00)/(4.70 + 9.32) = 1.8544. This yields the corrected ratio as the bottom row of Table 1 . Adding up numbers in the bottom row gives a total of 187.94%, implying that we should expand the reported counts by 87.94% in order for the reported case counts to match the population statistics across age groups.

We claim that this will not, at least not significantly, so the addition of estimated counts for type I and II cases is valid. The reason is that, type I cases still contribute to the reported numbers, at a delayed time though. These delayed cases can be thought of as a sample from the reported cases (assuming that the reported cases have a stable proportion when breakdown by age groups). The inclusion of type I cases will not change the age-breakdown proportions. Thus, after the inclusion of type I cases, we still have the same age-breakdown proportions and thus require an age correction.
