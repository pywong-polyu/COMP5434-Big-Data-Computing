Other coronaviruses (CoVs) can also infect humans, although the majority cause only mild respiratory symptoms. Because early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for preventing further transmission events and improving clinical outcomes, it is important to be able to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other SARS-related CoVs in respiratory samples. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a novel reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the genes encoding the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins to enable the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2, including several new circulating variants and other emerging SARS-like CoVs. By analysis of in vitro-transcribed mRNA, we established multiplex RT-qPCR assays capable of detecting 5 \u00d7 10\u00b0 copies/reaction. Using RNA extracted from cell culture supernatants, our multiple simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 assays had a limit of detection of 1 \u00d7 10\u00b0 TCID 50 /mL and showed no cross-reaction with human CoVs or other respiratory viruses. We also validated our method using human clinical samples from patients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals, including nasal swab and sputum samples. This novel one-step multiplex RT-qPCR assay can be used to improve the laboratory diagnosis of human-pathogenic CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and may be useful for the identification of other SARS-like CoVs of zoonotic origin.",

            "text": "In December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China [5] . A novel betacoronavirus, which was later officially named SARS-CoV-2, was discovered to be the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [6] . Next-generation sequencing analysis of the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed that the virus shares 80-89% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV. However, the genome sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and bat-derived SARSlike CoVs, such as BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/ RaTG13/2013, is approximately 96%, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in a bat species. Therefore, pan-SARS-CoV molecular diagnostics are no longer used to detect SARS-CoV-2, and international research groups have been designing specific primers and probes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the most conserved genes, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E), or nucleocapsid (N) gene [7] . Initial RT-qPCR assays were based on detection of a single target gene; however, assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA are now available targeting one, two, and/or three viral genes, resulting in complicated diagnostic criteria for positive and negative results [8] [9] [10] . For example, verification of positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 requires all target genes to be positive, including the RdRp, N, and E genes [11, 12] . However, primers targeting the RdRp gene for detection of SARS-CoV-2 cross-react with SARS-CoV RNA [11] , and some researchers have found that the sensitivity of RT-qPCR is only approximately 70% for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis [13] , which may result in false-negative results. These results suggest that, although a protocol using RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection using RdRp, E, and N genes has been established, alternative molecular diagnostic targets are needed to improve the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus detection.",

The rationale behind this approach was not only to design a highly sensitive and specific primer and probe set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 but to also produce a tool that would be able to distinguish this virus from other similar SARS-like CoVs, such as those found in the bat reservoir, which would have utility for use in resource-poor regions with limited laboratory capacity. The S gene encodes a trimeric protein, with each monomer comprised of an S1 (receptor-binding) and an S2 (membrane-fusion) subunit [14] . Although several amino acid substitutions [15] and deletions [16] have been reported in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoVs, the amino acid sequence of the S2 subunit is conserved, similar to those of other CoV genes, including the RdRp, E, and N genes. Accordingly, the S gene represents a molecular diagnostic target for SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, as has been demonstrated in previous studies [17, 18] . The M gene is a conserved gene encoding an important glycoprotein that functions to maintain virion size and shape and assists in the assembly of other structural proteins [19] . Moreover, the M gene has been shown to be useful for applications in molecular diagnostics for viral pathogen detection [20, 21] . However, the M gene has not been used in screening procedures for SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

To determine the detection limit of our RT-qPCR assay, a standard curve was made using the Cq values obtained using a tenfold serial dilution of transcribed mRNA from 5 \u00d7 10 7 to 5 \u00d7 10 0 copies/reaction, and the efficiency of the singleplex assay was found to be 102.52-104.26%, compared with 101.67-104.98% for the multiplex assay ( Fig. 2A) .

Four SARS-CoV-2 variants (wild-type, alpha variant, beta variant, and delta variant) were used to extract viral genomic RNA.

The Cq value obtained in our multiplex assay was comparable to that of the assay targeting the E gene and approximately 2 units lower than the assay targeting the RdRp gene using the WHO-recommended procedure. These results suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in swabs and sputum were similar to those of the WHO-recommended assay.",

The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has about 76% amino acid sequence identity to that of SARS-CoV and approximately 80% identity to those of bat-derived CoVs [28] [29] [30] , indicating the utility of S glycoproteins as targets for molecular diagnostics and discrimination between human-pathogenic CoVs and related zoonotic viruses. The M glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares approximately 90% sequence identity with those of other members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The newly designed primer/probe sets targeting S and M genes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like CoVs were shown to successfully detect the corresponding virus in clinical samples from patients Table 1 ). The assays were performed using in vitro-transcribed mRNA of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (KUMC01/2020) and SARS-like CoV. The virus concentration ranged from 5 \u00d7 10 7 to 10 0 RNA copies per reac-tion (A). The assays were performed using intact viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2, and the range of the serial virus dilution was 6 to 0 log 10 TCID 50 /ml (B). The cycle threshold in amplification plots, the correlation coefficient (R2), the slope of the standard curve for the assays, and the efficiency were determined automatically using Light-Cycler 96 software. Each concentration was tested in triplicate with COVID-19 and several different cultured viruses. WHO recently published a list of several RT-qPCR assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 using RNA transcript standards, including ORF1/nsp14, N, E, and RdRp genes. Our onestep multiplex RT-qPCR assays could have applications in the simultaneous wide screening of SARS-related CoVs and in discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSrelated CoVs.",

Our multiplex assay could also be performed with a reduced number of primer sets, with four channels for reading signals using a commercial real-time PCR instrument, as compared with conventional multiplex RT-qPCR assays. The small number of tests (67) performed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human clinical samples and the two bat-derived SARS-related CoV samples is a limitation of this study. However, our results showed 100% sensitivity, and the results were comparable obtained targeting those of the RdRp and E genes based on WHO guidelines (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S4) . Overall, our one-step multiplex molecular diagnostic assay provides consistent and reliable results.",

Furthermore, expansion of the host range of the virus and the high rate of mutation have contributed to the complex evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 [32] . Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoVs, an important initial step for the prevention of potential pandemic outbreaks in humans, is necessary. Analysis of the number of mismatches in primers/probes against SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-related-CoV (Supplementary Table S1 ) and specific tests using two bat SARS-like CoV strains (Table 2) suggested that the novel multiplex RT-qPCR assay developed in this study may have applications in detection of SARS-like CoVs in human and bat samples.",
