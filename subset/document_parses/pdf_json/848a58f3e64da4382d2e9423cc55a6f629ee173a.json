Growing attention has been devoted to mindfulness-being alert and acting swiftly-to explain recovery. Scholars have primarily focused on mindful resource preparation pre-crisis. Nevertheless, how to mindfully organize resources as a crisis occurs remains under-explored. Based on an inductive study of a ride-sharing vehicle venture, which rapidly became an open service platform during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, we develop a framework termed \"swift resilience\" to understand how new ventures mindfully organize resources, driven by digital innovation. In particular, we critically trace three mechanisms-\"data-driven stretching,\" \"collective sharing,\" and \"rapid pivoting\"-and develop a process model to understand how new ventures build swift resilience. Our emerging findings shed light on the scholarship of organizational resilience, mindfulness, and digital entrepreneurship, and provide guidance to managers on achieving resilience quickly.",

According to Statista, 72% of new ventures have seen their revenues decline since COVID-19 hit, as they were vulnerable to the shock brought on by the pandemic (McCarthy, 2020) . However, anecdotal evidence has indicated that, despite these challenges, some innovative new ventures have creatively deployed resources and quickly achieved organizational resilience, defined as \"positively adjust and maintain functioning prior to, during, and following adversity\" (Williams et al., 2017, p. 742 ; see also Mckinsey, 2021) . Building resilience quickly is particularly important for new ventures with few resources since they are less likely to withstand adversity for long periods of time (Pillai et al., 2020) . Moreover, faster recoveries protect ventures from ongoing damage (DesJardine et al., 2019) that significantly impacts new ventures' survival and growth (Herbane, 2019) .",

Growing attention has been devoted to how mindfulness-being alert and acting swiftly-of emerging issues (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2012; Weick et al., 1999) influences a quick response and faster recovery (Linnenluecke, 2017; Singh et al., 2021) . Scholars have typically put weight on how mindfully preparing resources such as relationships (Powley, 2009 ) and risk-averting infrastructures (Ramezani & Camarinha-Matos, 2020 ) facilitate ventures to maintain organizational function. Nevertheless, the assumption of mindful anticipation pre-crisis has two limitations. First, mindfully prepared resources pre-crisis might not necessarily be what a venture needs during challenging times (Battisti & Deakins, 2017) . Second, even for ventures that have specific resources in reserve, these resources are highly vulnerable and more likely to be lost when the complexity and uncertainty level of the crisis is high (Doern, 2016) . Indeed, scholars have indicated the tendency of transitioning from dependence on mindful preparing to mindful organizing as the crisis occurs (Williams et al., 2017) . The alternative method of mindful organizing-swiftly and consciously generating a variety of forms of resource development and deployment-might offer a faster, more fundamental solution to resilience. An initial attempt has been made by Zafari et al. (2020) to mindfully manage external relationships during a crisis. However, mindful managing of relational resources might require a relatively long period to come to fruition; thus, the process by which resilience can be achieved quickly remains under-explored. Moreover, the prevalence of digital innovation, with its particular characteristics (Huang et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2012 Yoo et al., , 2010 , might significantly change the relationship between mindfulness and resilience. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate mindful resource organizing by taking into account digital innovation and its impact on resilience.",

            "text": "Mindful resource organizing enabled by digital innovation is theoretically and practically essential. Aided by the prevalence of digital technologies such as artificial intelligent (AI) driven adaptive learning technologies, algorithms, and so on, innovative ventures are more likely to develop and deploy resources quickly-and this has been particularly true in the ever-changing environment of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mckinsey, 2021) . As such, new ventures that mindfully organize resources could enjoy a higher possibility of building resilience swiftly. Notably, the prevalence of digital innovation, which is defined as \"the recombination of digital components in a layered, modular architecture to create new values\" (Huang et al., 2017, p.302) , especially with its unique characteristics, offers new ventures ample opportunities to change the process, outcome, and actors pertaining to the mindful organization of resources, ultimately resulting in building resilience quickly. Since most digital products remain reprogrammable (Yoo et al., 2012) and generative (Wareham et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2010) , ventures can be open to recombination and interpretation of existing operations and can swiftly extend their functional scope, features, and values with negligible cost. Furthermore, design flexibility of digital innovation views entrepreneurial opportunities as emergent and rescopes them mindfully (Henfridsson et al., 2014) , thus triggering the market-shaping result (Garud et al., 2008; Lusch & Nambisan, 2015) . Moreover, the convergence of digital innovation (Henfridsson & Bygstad, 2013; Yoo et al. 2012 ) enables the venture to be \"less predefinition\" (Nambisan, 2017 (Nambisan, , p. 1030 , thus significantly expanding the scope and scale of actors' mindful behaviors. Yet, while digital innovation is a potential critical stimulator of various mindful behaviors-which are a significant driver for new ventures' robust transformation during a crisis-the process of how to utilize digital innovation to facilitate resilience is under-researched. This raises the research question: How can ventures engage in mindful behaviors driven by digital innovation, which can quickly facilitate resilience?",

Drawing on definitions of organizational resilience (Lengnick-Hall & Beck, 2005; Shepherd, 2020; Williamset al., 2017) , wepropose the term swift resilience to capture the dynamic process throughwhich mindful resource organizing behaviors could be developed when digitalinnovation is at the core, quickly resulting in a new and better equilibrium.We undertake an in-depth case study of a venture called Digital ICAR (a ride-sharingvehicle business) based on its invested business intelligence systems, analyticalgorithms, platforms, and so on. Since February 2020, the venture has quicklyand efficiently resumed and revised its business thanks to its digitaltechnologies. Moreover, it launched numerous business trials in less than amonth to respond to users' desire for exclusive travel space. Toward the end of2020, this venture achieved exponential growth in its revenues and user baseand transformed from a pure self-service leasing platform to an open-serviceplatform. We select Digital ICAR as an extreme case (Gerring, 2007) toinvestigate our research question because it has achieved swiftresilience-rapid transformation in less than one year. The venture provides anexcellent setting to elaborate the process by which digital innovationfacilitates new ventures to engage in mindful resource organizing behaviors.",

First, our core contribution is the theoretical framework for swift resilience-a dynamic process in which digital innovation catalyzes mindful resource organizing behaviors that allow ventures to build a new equilibrium quickly. Departing from the dominating mindful resource preparation assumption (Powley, 2009; Ramezani & Camarinha-Matos, 2020; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007) , our study illuminates a novel pathway that contains three main mechanisms for ventures to rapidly transform their business despite challenges: data-driven stretching, collective sharing, and rapid pivoting. Second, we contribute to mindfulness literature (Sutcliffe et al., 2016; Weick & Roberts, 1993; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006) by extending knowledge of its behavioral process, outcome, and actors. Resonating with the crosslevel and emergent perspective of mindfulness (Carlo et al., 2012) , the nuanced view of how intra-organizational and inter-organizational mindful organizing interplay ultimately facilitates the venture to achieve a transformative outcome. Third, we highlight how our insights may hold potential for the burgeoning identity change in the entrepreneurship literature (Powell & Baker, 2014; Williams & Shepherd, 2016a , 2016b . We confirm that ventures with prosocial motivation and that foster flexible interdependency with external stakeholders are more likely to change identity without penalty.",

            "text": "Organizational resilience-wherein an organization interacts with its environment and positively maintains and adjusts its functions (Williams et al., 2017) -has emerged as one of the most important and widely applied concepts that are receiving growing attention from management researchers. More recently, attention has turned to how to build resilience quickly (DesJardine et al., 2019; Haase & Eberl, 2019; Herbane, 2015 Herbane, , 2019 , with an emphasis on quick recovery (DesJardine et al., 2019; G\u00f6lgeci & Kuivalainen, 2020) , immediate identification of risk and opportunities (Conz & Magnani, 2020; El Baz & Ruel, 2021; Morrish & Jones, 2020) , quick decisions without delay (Men\u00e9ndez Blanco & Montes-Botella, 2017; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007) , and faster response (Chesbrough, 2020; Gittell et al., 2006) . The ability to build resilience quickly is essential for ventures because the quicker a venture takes action, the more likely it is to be able to reduce the severity of loss and protect itself from ongoing damage (DesJardine et al., 2019) . This is particularly true for new ventures, as long-term recovery may be exhausted by their limited resources (Pillai et al., 2020) and substantially influence survival prospects and business continuity (Herbane, 2019) . Nascent scholars have emphasized the importance of mindfulness-defined as the awareness of discriminatory details about emerging issues and acting swiftly in response to these details (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2012; Weick et al., 1999) -facilitating resilience quickly (Linnenluecke, 2017; Singh et al., 2021; Sutcliffe et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2017) . As summarized in Table 1 , studies have typically focused on the anticipation aspect of mindfulness to investigate how mindfully prepared resources-such as relational reserves (DesJardine et al., 2019; G\u00f6lgeci & Kuivalainen, 2020; Powley, 2009) , risk averting infrastructures (Beigi, (2007) Financial abundance Sufficiently flexible activities by which ventures buffer the impact of environmental jolts and deploy faster responses to unanticipated events based on cash flow and low debt Bartz and Winkler (2016) Gittell et al. (2006) McFarlane and Norris (2006) 2014; Ramezani & Camarinha-Matos, 2020) , diversified products and markets (Markman & Venzin, 2014; Morrish & Jones, 2020) , managerial experience (Li et al., 2016; Men\u00e9ndez Blanco & Montes-Botella, 2017) , and financial abundance (Bartz & Winkler, 2016; Gittell et al., 2006 )-contribute to highly reliable operations and resilience during a crisis (Vogus et al., 2014; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007) . In particular, the relational reserves stream focuses more on the interdependency between internal and external stakeholders during periods pre-crisis. For instance, Powley (2009) showed that organization members who usually consider their colleagues and respond to others are more likely to reach out when a venture is in a critical period of crisis. Likewise, the riskaverting infrastructures stream devotes attention to strategic risk planning, through which ventures can resume operations and heal immediately following crisis. Scholars have argued that organizations that put mindful engineering systems in place pre-crisis are more likely to be resilient during times of crisis (Ramezani & Camarinha-Matos, 2020) . Other streams of literature, such as those on diversified products and markets, have highlighted the importance of the incremental capability of mindfully responding to market needs by adapting product offerings (Morrish & Jones, 2020) . Financial and human capital streams have emphasized the need to ensure the mindful preparedness of sufficient internal resources accumulated prior to crisis (Bartz & Winkler, 2016; Men\u00e9ndez Blanco & Montes-Botella, 2017) . Despite the abundance of literature identified above, insights into how ventures mindfully prepare resources may constitute shortcomings. Two aspects are worth noting. First, given that crises are characterized by high uncertainty and ambiguity (Oehmen et al., 2020) , ventures must have the necessary resources prepared and accurately anticipate challenges to meet the disruptive event's requirement. For example, risk anticipation systems for natural disasters such as earthquakes might not be relevant to an altered crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, underpinned by the fragility that is experienced during adversity (Bartz & Winkler, 2016; Lai et al., 2016) , ventures are more vulnerable to losing or exhausting reserved resources (e.g., relationships with customers and suppliers) within an ever-changing and sustained crisis (Parker & Ameen, 2018; Zafari et al., 2020) . For example, firms' financial reserves might be used up due to the significant and long-lasting negative effects of COVID-19. To address these issues, many scholars have shifted attention to another aspect of mindfulness-swift actions to cope with crisis in the moment (Linnenluecke, 2017; Williams et al., 2017) . This requires ventures to quickly organize resources in order to detect issues, problems, or opportunities as they arise (Ndubisi & Al-Shuridah, 2019) . One pioneering study investigated how mindful relationship management facilitates recovery after a crisis (Zafari et al., 2020) . The findings revealed that a combination of trust, doubt, and control might facilitate a venture to mindfully build relationships with external partners. Nevertheless, the mindful relationship-building process could require a relatively long time to come to fruition, and the process by which ventures mindfully organize resources to facilitate resilience quickly remains under-researched. Moreover, the prevalence of digital innovation, with its unique characteristics (Huang et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2012; Yoo et al., 2010) , enables new ventures to quickly engage in various mindful resource organizing behaviors, thus considerably changing the relationship between new ventures and resilience. This suggests the need to revisit the mindfulness literature by taking into account digital innovation.",

            "text": "The substantial advances in digital innovation, namely, \"the recombination of digital components in a layered, modular architecture\" (Huang et al., 2017, p. 302) , have paved the way for firms to mindfully organize large amounts of heterogeneous resources in new ways (Amit & Han, 2017; Du, 2015; Yoo et al., 2012) . Drawing upon leading research in digital innovation, such as that by Yoo et al. (2012) , Henfridsson et al. (2014) , and Huang et al. (2017) , digital innovation can be traced to three essential characteristics: reprogrammabilitythat is, separation of the semiotic function from the physical media (Henfridsson & Bygstad, 2013; Yoo et al., 2012) ; convergence-or increasingly bringing previously separate industries together (Henfridsson & Bygstad, 2013; Yoo et al., 2012) ; and generativity-comprising self-reinforcement without any input from the originator of the system (Wareham et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2010) . Reprogrammability means that digital technologies become inherently re-combinable with relatively marginal costs (Yoo et al., 2012) , further catalyzing abundant opportunities for convergence and generativity. For example, the popularity of intelligent products, such as smartphones, is one case of reprogrammability resulting from the convergence of technologies within previously non-digital physical industries. Moreover, even the smartphones are sold, it is possible for the venture to introduce generative forms of updated versions. Therefore, the characteristics of digital innovation might potentially disrupt mindful organizing in at least two respects. First, the process and outcomes of mindfulness might be dramatically changed when digital innovation is at the core. Specifically, the distinct qualities of reprogrammability and generativity offer ventures ample opportunities to mindfully recombine and reintegrate large amounts of resources at negligible marginal cost (Briel et al., 2018; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016) . For example, machine learning algorithms make it possible for programs to instantly learn and improve with alertness (Rai et al., 2019) , and governance, risk, and compliance software makes ventures less likely to engage in mindless decision making (Papazafeiropoulou & Spanaki, 2016) . The resource organizing process may occur conservatively and swiftly because digital technologies are effortless to reproduce and \"inexpensive to scale\" (Henfridsson et al., 2014, p. 30 ). In addition, the inherently intentional incomplete design (Garud et al., 2008) and design flexibility (Henfridsson et al., 2014) afforded by reprogrammability allow ventures to explore and actualize concurrent entrepreneurial opportunities, work on parallel ideas, and even swiftly change ideas when the actualized opportunity does not materialize as expected (Henfridsson et al., 2014; Nasiri et al., 2020) . For example, the Internet of things may enable a venture to revisit dynamic data based on improved information processing capability, thereby resulting in more chances of operational agility (Akhtar et al., 2018) . Rather than committing to a single resource deployment behavior, new ventures are more likely to simultaneously participate in multiple mindful resource organizing behaviors. This mindful resource organizing resonates well with generativity that promises waves of innovation (Henfridsson et al., 2014) and fosters market-shaping capability (Huang et al., 2017; Nambisan, 2017; Spagnoletti et al., 2021; Yoo et al., 2010) . Thereby, it opens up new opportunities to do business in new ways, and significantly changes the outcome of mindful resource organizing even during crisis.",

Rooted in the convergence of digital innovation, heterogeneous and abundant actors within and across the industrial boundary are flooding into the locus and becoming inter-connected entrepreneurial agencies (Nambisan et al., 2019) . Furthermore, catalyzed by reduced information asymmetry and increased transparency among actors (Nambisan et al., 2018) , it takes a relatively short time to engage in mindful behaviors. Consequently, collective actors can detect disturbances early, respond quickly, monitor efficiently, and pursue entrepreneurship opportunities collaboratively (Singh et al., 2020; Van Der Vegt et al., 2015) . Moreover, the traceability and design flexibility offered by reprogrammability (Henfridsson et al., 2014; Nambisan et al., 2019) enable ventures to monitor activities among partners in real-time, resulting in effective mindful resource management.",

While acknowledging the importance of mindful resource preparation, we argue that the ability to mindfully engage in resource organizing behaviors that enable response to crisis is potentially a far more fundamental solution than previously anticipated. Moreover, the prevalence of digital innovation might disrupt mindful resource organizing, thus considerably shaping the relationship between new ventures and resilience. However, the process by which mindfulness enabled by digital innovation facilitates resilience remains under-explored. To theoretically understand this process, we herein propose the term swift resilience to emphasize how digital innovation facilitates mindful resource organizing that allows for a robust transformation quickly. Swift resilience has become increasingly possible for new ventures, as digital innovation can be used to develop, progress, and support resource organizing behaviors mindfully. Resonating with recent calls to pursue theoretical perspectives of mindfulness (Linnenluecke, 2017; Williams et al., 2017) , this paper aims to encapsulate the underlying complex process and develop a more nuanced understanding of mechanisms that afford swift resilience.",

Aiming to shift the traditional heavy asset operation mode to a lighter mode, it worked closely with external actors that cover vehicle production's entire life cycle-ranging from production, sales, and aftersales services to second-hand vehicle trading and more. Therefore, the mindful behaviors of this venture continuously surface over time as it expanded its actors, such as manufacturers, distributors, second-hand vehicle agencies, and leasing ventures.

The analysis followed Gibbs's (2002) framework to analyze data-creating open coding, axial coding, and aggregated coding. The data structure is presented in Fig. 1 . We adopted an iterative approach to travel back and forth between data, literature, and emerging theory to solicit the themes (Locke, 2001) . During Phase 1, we began with a big picture of what the venture has made. From there, we generated the first order (left column of Fig. 1 ) to identify the empirical codes that were central to the informants during both observations and interviews (Maanen, 1979) . We also cross-checked the preliminary case narratives with different sources of data in our set, such as project descriptions, technical documents, and releases on social media, to avoid overreliance on interview data. To ensure the reliability of our understanding of the organization and key focus, two of the authors separately conducted open coding for six months. In Phase 2, known as selective coding, we compared similarities and differences in various first-order codes. We adopted concepts from mindfulness and digital innovation literature as analytical filters to cluster first-order codes in Phase 1. This step enabled us to develop the theoretical concepts involved in the swift resilience process from broader categories of first-order empirical observation as the second orders. As a result (indicated in the middle column of Fig. 1 ) we identified the context conditions, digital innovation, ongoing actions, and outcomes behind or related to swift resilience. We also developed Tables 3,  4 , 5, 6, 7 and 8 to articulate how the first-order empirical observations related to the second theoretical concepts. In Phase 3, by conducting selective coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) , we aimed to identify the relationships between different second-order codes and distilled them to aggregated dimensions (right-hand column of Fig. 1 ) by which the venture achieved swift resilience. Drawing on the notions of organizational resilience, mindfulness, and digital innovation, we unpacked the interrelationship among the aggregated dimensions that were identified during the three steps. We then refined categories and themes into a process model of swift resilience ( Fig. 2 ) that accounted for changes in the mindful resource organizing behaviors. Subsequently, we reached an agreement among the authorship team after the iterative process of revisiting the transcript, the existing theory, and our research question.",

After identifying the pain points in the industry, the managerial team realized that the venture could sustain its resilience only if they devoted efforts to industrial resilience. The contextual condition of entrepreneurial opportunity captures the emerging opportunities of sensing and seeking (in this case largely carried out by the managerial team). These two contextual conditions can be found in the way they trigger swift resilience. Specifically, the venture's prosocial motivation rationalizes following cooperative actions with external actors. The entrepreneurial opportunity represents its cognitive capacity in actualizing opportunities into some commercial reality. It is worth noting that achieving organizational resilience is far from enough; the venture is expected to consider industry resilience as a whole during the COVID-19 crisis.",

First, the conceptual theme of prediction makes the venture enhance operational effectiveness. Our data analysis indicated that the prediction afforded by digital technologies played a pivotal role at the initial stage of the crisis. Serving as a basis for the consideration of which opportunity to seize, prediction makes the venture balance reusing of the existing operation with continuing to mindfully improvise. Moreover, our case showed that the venture could align with external actors due to the second conceptual theme, relationality. Digital infrastructures, such as T-box, BI systems, and invented applications, could be quickly integrated to external actors, such as partners and competitors, within and across the industry. Contributed to by digital innovation, the empirical observation showed that the venture was more likely to synthesize distributed stakeholders into a coherent whole after the crisis because industrial boundaries became more blurred. Also, the automation caused the venture to not only monitor emerging dangers but also to enhance efficiency by adopting effortless and autonomous decision-making. Therefore, the venture was more likely to simultaneously take part in multiple trials and errors. We noted that prediction, relationality, and automation afforded by digital innovation were incorporated into all episodes of the swift resilience process and support mechanisms of mindfulness.",

Thanks to the versatile BI systems, and predictive and analytic algorithms, the venture was capable of restructuring operation planning, adding operation procedures, and outsourcing business operations in a swift manner with relatively marginal costs. In responding to operational adjustments, the internal role shift was also quickly arranged. For instance, a new department was rapidly established to provide managerial guidance to outsourced city partners. Although this department was unfamiliar with numerous city situations, the onecity-one-plan scheme was executed smoothly, following a hybrid model of human and autonomous decision making. The venture also mindfully decentralized the decision making to regional city managers, since the centralized decision making was inefficient due to hectic and chaotic conditions.

We refer to this mechanism as rapid pivoting, which denotes a venture's openness to strategic addition and exit strategies. As shown in Table 7 , our analysis yielded two conceptual themes related to rapid pivoting. First, the venture proactively templated concurrent ideas around core business, such as a trusteeship scheme, service innovation, and crowdsourcing, to concurrently integrate the supply chain's downside and upside. Even though the venture could engage in numerous templating in parallel, such as trusteeship, supply chain integration, and crowdsourcing schemes, they always worked around their core business, and a significant degree of pivoting was not allowed. Concentrated templating was therefore considered important. The second conceptual theme was immediate withdrawal of non-successful trials. Not all attempts were successful. Thus, the venture was engaging in an ongoing cutting-off process with alertness, although some cut-downs were a relatively small portion of the plan.

We then seized the opportunity and quickly templated a few ideas around the automobile industry. For instance, thanks to the revisability of vehicle-using situations afforded by digital technologies, we can promptly attract wholesalers, vehicle manufacturing factories, second-hand vehicle ventures, and other players in our trusteeship scheme. The trusteeship scheme can be interpreted as partner companies entrusting spare vehicles to us, and we share profits following the agreed proportion. Embedded with our asset management capabilities, we try to tackle the pain point in the industry-heavy assets-and create more value for vehicle companies, dealers, and vehicle rental users. We have currently worked with more than 10 dealers, and most of them have already been profitable.\" (The founder) \u2022 Launching a business close-loop through downside and upside supply chain integration To ease the burden of heavy asset investment of vehicles and revitalize vehicle inventory, the venture creates a \"onestop exposure + deep experience new vehicle sales model\" for manufacturers and distributors. The venture has promoted the innovative operation mode of \"personalized travel service + professional vehicle operation system + auto assets revitalization,\" encouraging partners in the auto industry chain to join their network SaaS platform. Therefore, on the one hand, the distributors can enrich their customer base and improve operational efficiency. On the other hand, the factory can fully revitalize vehicle inventory and get more accurate customer feedback directly for precision production. As a result, it builds a closed business loop from research and development, manufacturing, and customer consumption. (The release) \"Built upon the user data, operational capabilities, and resource integration capabilities, the venture proactively expands to a vehicle selling business through offering customized renting and purchasing packaging. The venture's test drive mode is different from the traditional test drive mode. Users can get access to the new vehicle models earlier. Also, there is no need for a point-to-point test drive on a fixed line. Customers can choose the route freely and use it several times. It has enhanced the connection between new vehicles and potential vehicle buyers. The Test Drive, launched by Volkswagen and us, is one of the most successful trials.\" (Marketing manager) \"The in-depth test drives enable us to experience a full range of vehicle performance; then, we can find out which vehicle is more suitable.\" (One of the customers who signed up for the Test Drive program) \"We also cooperate with the manufacturers to introduce a \"travel package\" at the stage of vehicle purchase that allows owners to offset the cost of vehicle purchase by joining trusteeship. For instance, customers can purchase the usage right from the manufacturer. When a new model comes out, customers can also negotiate to replace it with the new model.\" (Sales manager) \u2022 Proposal of a crowdsourcing scheme for after-sales vehicle service The mode of \"vehicle service crowdsourcing,\" a new trial in the gig economy, aims to transform industry development using an Internet mindset. It tries to make full use of the idle labor force in society and effectively increase efficiency with the lowest cost. (The release) \"Crowdsourced services aim to provide a series of after-sales services such as pickup and maintenance, vehicle flash delivery, vehicle washing services, used vehicle evaluation, etc. Owners can quickly connect and match with errands, flash delivery, vehicle washes, and other services through the vehicle service system, resulting in a comprehensive closed-loop between people, vehicles, and scenes. As a result, after one month of crowdsourced services, the vehicle's maintenance cost decreases roughly by 10%, and the timeliness increases by 51%.\" (Operation manager)",

As reflected in the case, the reprogrammability characteristic of digital innovation affords new ventures the ability to quickly restructure their routines by customizing specific processes, adding various modules of tasks, and outsourcing operations with marginal costs. In addition, unlike prior scholarly work demonstrating mindfulness and involving a broad spectrum of experts as necessary for generating immediate and flexible responses (Carlo et al., 2012; Salovaara et al., 2019) , our case shows that effortless lower-level lateral responsiveness is also feasible, afforded by digital innovation. Moreover, with a hybrid of autonomous and human decision-making, multiple data can be mindfully stretched for new use. As such, ventures could absorb these disturbances quickly and keep the stretching momentum continuous by minimizing the cognitive decision bias and learning curve. The second dimension, collective sharing, refers to the process by which a venture openly fosters interdependent relationships with external stakeholders via the joining of mindful resource behaviors of actors within and across industries. Enabled by the convergence of digital innovation \u2022 Repositioning itself as a technology company that focuses on platform ecosystem construction Thanks to a quick recovery of its user base and rapid market responsiveness, the venture has successfully achieved profitability and be rewarded as one of the most resilient Chinese enterprises during COVID-19. The venture has officially launched its technology platform to provide integrated technology service for the time-sharing business and vehicle service management. (The release) \u2022 Separating the vehicle after-sales service from its business \"We have separated our after-sales business from our core business. Based on the Internet of things, AI images, video algorithms, strong quality control management, etc., we effectively offer a series of after-sales services such as personal vehicle sharing, vehicle flash delivery errands, and used vehicle evaluation subscriptions.\" (General manager) In particular, the venture has cooperated with a partner in terms of marketing activities, financial service products, risk control, and security management. In addition, it further strengthens the cooperation depth and service capability in the travel market and provides far more convenient and high-quality service and consumption experiences for both sides.

            "text": "Continuous sustaining of the new equilibrium (Yoo et al., 2012) , a digital venture significantly extends the scope and scale of actors engaged in mindful organizing. Prior studies have primarily emphasized that organizational resilience is affected by mindfully managing internal relations (Kahn et al., 2018; Stoverink et al., 2020) . While an initial attempt was made on how to mindfully manage external suppliers' relationships (Zafari et al., 2020) , these relationships are more likely to be bilateral in the context of lower network diversity. This empirical evidence supplements the existing literature by delineating how networkbased external mindfulness happens across the industry boundary. In this case, we observed how Digital ICAR quickly aggregated a large number of actors who made the relationship from lower network diversity to higher diversity due to the relative transparency among actors. Consistent with research on network interdependency (Van Der Vegt et al., 2015) , our empirical observation indicates mindful knowledge sharing and recombination between separate groups, allowing information to be exchanged in a broader network, resulting in unique and novel opportunities outside the industry experience. Furthermore, rather than a partnership that takes a relatively long time (Zafari et al., 2020) , the cooperation indicated in the case was established rapidly due to the visibility and transparency afforded by digital innovation. We also extend the informal control of relationships (Michaelis et al., 2021; Zafari et al., 2020) by exemplifying how mindful control solutions, such as selective sharing, partial co-competition, and multi-homing, might effectively facilitate a venture to secure its benefit during the collective sharing process. The third mechanism of swift resilience refers to rapid pivoting, the process by which a venture alertly monitors external environments and minimizes the time gap between opportunity identification and new value-in-use development. Consistent with existing mindfulness literature that emphasizes the frequent questioning of the existing assumption and considers alternatives (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2012; Weick et al., 1999; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007) , this research showcases that a venture mindfully engages in various concurrent, strategic addition and exit processes within a limited period. Our case indicates that the heterogeneous resources afforded by the convergence of digital innovation made Digital ICAR able to efficiently alleviate the burden of heavy assets and capture new opportunities bolstered by the crisis, as well as simultaneously avoid less fruitful results through an inevitable setback. Moreover, departing from most ventures that reactively launch a pivot (Hampel et al., 2020; Kirtley & O'Mahony, 2020) , we extend the existing literature on pivoting by highlighting the importance of proactive and rapid pivoting and how they play out in recovery from a crisis. Further, our research speaks to recent observations in pivoting literature, where scholars such as Morgan et al. (2020) emphasize the difference of nearby pivots (when a venture leverages existing resources and capabilities to move into a related product category) and distant pivots (when a venture seeks new resources and capabilities in order to produce completely unrelated products). Our empirical observation paves the way for thinking about the sequence of pivoting by hypothesizing that entrepreneurs are more likely to explore nearby pivots before considering distant pivots during crises. Entrepreneurs could engage in proactive and continuous pivots in a less costly and timeconsuming manner. The reason may be that the number of entrepreneurial agencies becomes larger when pivoting and a venture's digital capability enables it to embrace iterative innovation capability with a marginal cost (Huang et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2010) .",

For instance, the mechanism of data-driven stretching could yield a meaningful intraorganizational operation foundation as new ventures mindfully reuse existing resources and continuously improvise operations to support new ideas that resonate with the changing circumstances. Guaranteed by data-driven stretching, the mechanism of collective sharing-when viewed from the inter-organization viewpoint-could then openly embrace numerous exchanges when a large number of actors are included. The mechanism of rapid pivoting, drawing upon both intra-and inter-organizational views, is stimulated by collective sharing, whilst having access to heterogeneous resources in a timely manner through the diverse network. By intra-organizational pivoting, we mean the pivots are triggered by the problems and opportunities from the internal operation. The inter-organizational pivots are triggered by problems and opportunities when they interplay with external stakeholders like partners and competitors. As a result, in fast-changing circumstances, entrepreneurs could expand their network diversity and mindfully participate in a variety of changes. In the same way, data-driven stretching-with a close eye on how operations could be further optimized based on emerging opportunities and difficulties-makes the venture continuously alert to details of entrepreneurial opportunities.",

This is different from the existing literature, where being responsive quickly would typically require significant adjustments to organizational structures after a crisis (DesJardine et al., 2019) . Moreover, prior studies show that resuming and adapting organizational operations and routines is largely dependent on purposeful leadership initiatives such as managers' previous experience (Haase & Eberl, 2019; Men\u00e9ndez Blanco & Montes-Botella, 2017) . In contrast, digital ventures can have quick adaptability through a combination of autonomous and human decision making derived from digital innovation (Rai et al., 2019) . Thus, swift resilience occurs with a quick and continuous improvisation process contributed to by efficient decision making.",

In this research, departing from the dominating mindful preparation approach, such as long-term employee relationships (Powley, 2009 ) and risk averting infrastructures (Ramezani & Camarinha-Matos, 2020) , our findings answer the call for mindful organizing to improve resilience (Williams et al., 2017) and elaborate an alternative view of the success of swift resilience. Specifically, drawing upon prior insights of digital innovation (Henfridsson et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2012) , we explain how ventures intertwine with three mechanisms, namely, data-driven stretching, collective sharing, and instant pivoting, resulting in doing business unusually quickly. This is particularly imperative for new ventures, significantly influencing their survival (Herbane, 2019) . We also offer an initial theoretical attempt to extend the existing literature from research about building resilience quickly (DesJardine et al., 2019; El Baz & Ruel, 2021) to exploring swift resilience. By explaining the differences between swift resilience and various other quickness-related concepts (e.g., quick decision making, responsiveness) in resilience literature, we have clarified the nature of swift resilience in relationship building, operation structure, and degree changes. The proposed concept of swift resilience can offer guidance to future research on resilience literature.",

The identity influences new ventures' day-to-day behaviors that gradually shape the ventures' strategic responses to adversity, ultimately enabling actors to enact who they want to be (Powell & Baker, 2014; Williams & Shepherd, 2016a , 2016b .

The case observes the venture change its identity together with its partners, competitors, and customers. Resonating with the call to study how ventures help others impact themselves (Williams & Shepherd, 2016b) , our study supplements existing literature by showing how helping others may benefit a venture's identity changing without penalty. Our case indicates the process by which a venture changes from simply doing business to becoming a platform ecosystem builder who does business with others. Consistent with the notion of compassion venturing (Williams & Shepherd, 2016a; Williams & Shepherd, 2020) , our case indicates that the prosocial motivation initially took a role enabling the venture to proactively search for a solution that helped others impact themselves. Further, rather than prosocial actions organized by a singular venture, we complement extant literature by illustrating partner-based prosocial activities, such as collective sharing and labor crowdsourcing, with many external ventures, which contribute to the smooth identity change.",

            "text": "With regard to practical implications, this study has at least four implications for managers of firms. First, we provide insights into how ventures alertly seize emerging opportunities to engage in mindful resource organizing behaviors that contribute to robust transformation during a crisis. Rather than preparing resources before a crisis, our model demonstrates that managers can mindfully develop and deploy digital technologies. They can leverage digital technologies such as platform, blockchain, and analytic algorithms to mindfully bootstrap internal and external actors, ultimately resulting in robust transformation. This requires shifting of managerial attention away from the sole focus on controlling available resources at hand to a more mindful exploration of heterogeneous alternatives from the external. Specifically, as our case shows, a venture receives the initial benefit from mindful stretching. Rather than reactively receiving support from the government, entrepreneurs can be more attentive and alert to emerging opportunities and proactively seize an opportunity through the reutilization of existing resources for new purposes. Furthermore, after gaining internal support afforded by digital technologies, ventures can continuously reach out and mindfully mobilize a number of external resources. For example, in the context of this study, managers sought complementary partnerships with competitors and partners without necessarily obtaining the ownership of external resources. Instead, a venture can efficiently forge exchange relationships with a large number of heterogeneous actors within and across the industry boundary. Second, this work might also offer insights for managers to effectively engage in mindful control practice to manage the interdependent relationship with external actors. For example, the finding of this study provides evidence of the importance for managers to share and exchange labor resources during the crisis. It is also encouraging that managers allow partners to use multi-homing. Third, developing the capability to pivot in the face of crisis is a much-needed capability. Often, firms must pivot when it is no other choice. However, the findings of this study indicate that unexpected innovation by uncoordinated actors might also provide productive opportunities for ventures to effectively embrace pivoting. Finally, the results of this study are valuable for managers of firms that seek to make a strategic change during a crisis. Rather than reestablishing legitimacy from stakeholders such as customers and partners after the identity change, managers should become forward-looking to identify methods of shielding their firms from the penalty of identity change. For example, in the context of this study, managers gradually changed their image by working on a collective identity with partners and proactively building a pro-social image at the beginning.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations that offer possibilities for future research. First, the insights generated by this study for understanding swift resilience are grounded in our purposive case selection to focus on an extreme digital venture. This choice enabled us to have the unique resources to credibly engage in mindful resource organizing behaviors. Future research can investigate if and how findings from discrete case examples could be integrated to develop insights that are more generalizable to different settings and contexts, such as established ventures. Furthermore, researchers might seek to understand the long-term effects of mindful behaviors after the crisis; how, for instance, mindful practices might imprint onto the organizational culture or contribute to platform sustainability. In addition, following our argument on pivoting, we call for more work to study the emerging literature (Grimes, 2018; Hampel et al., 2020) to unfold the dynamic process of pivoting suited to varying contexts. In the future, scholars might look for opportunities to elaborate in particular on how the mindful organizing dynamics come into play with pivoting. Potential shortcomings aside, our study shows that such mindful resource organizing behaviors through digital innovation could enable new ventures to achieve resilience swiftly. We have emphasized that mindfulness through digital innovation can extend our understanding of how new ventures can build a new equilibrium effectively during a crisis. In doing so, we hope that our study will raise the critical issue in digital entrepreneurship that continues to inform academe and practice alike.",
