It focuses on the spread dynamics between Phase I (from March 23th to May 31st, 2020) and II (from June 1st to August 22th, 2020) of the social distancing measures. It also examines municipal-level factors associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic. The analysis of the geographic pattern of the pandemic via Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) revealed fast spread among municipalities. During Phase I, clusters of infections and deaths were mainly located at the center of the country, while in Phase II, these clusters dispersed to the rest of the country. The regression results from the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression analysis suggested that income inequality, prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) are strongly positively associated to confirmed cases and deaths regardless of lockdown.",

            "text": "As of November 24, 2020, Mexico ranks fourth in the world in coronavirus disease 2019 deaths, behind only by the U.S., Brazil and India. The country has a total 1'049,358 positive cases and 101,926 deaths, which at present, represents one of the highest lethality rates (10.29%) in the world. Mexico, like other Latin American countries is framed by growing poverty levels, large income inequality and disparities in access to healthcare services (D\u00e1vila-Cervantes and Agudelo-Botero, 2019; Hessel et al., 2019; Mesenburg et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions that might shape obesity in the country have a much larger role on the lethality disease. The strong relationship between being individual with overweight or obesity and severe outcomes of hospitalization has been well documented (Hern\u00e1ndez-Gardu\u00f1o, 2020; Popkin et al., 2020) . Hence, individuals with excessive body fat, or major cardiometabolic problems (ranging from hypertension to cardiovascular disease and diabetes) could present severe or even lethal complications. In this vein, Mexico faces a significant risk as, for years now, it has been in the second spot when it comes to the global ranking of adult obesity, just behind the U.S., whereas, overweight and obesity in childhood rates are the highest worldwide (OECD, 2019) .",

Interestingly, during Phase II, the most-likely cluster was also centered at Mexico City metropolitan area but with a considerably lower RR (RR=1.96). Phase II was also characterized by the spread of new infection and death clusters along the country. The findings suggest that during Phase I, both deaths and infections from COVID-19 were concentrated in the country's capital, however, after the lifting of containment measures, the virus had a rapid spread to the rest of the country due to multiple causes which we further try to investigate.",

Under this approach, we tested whether RR of the geographical clustering was caused by a random variation or not. This is, whether the expected number of infections (resp. death) within clusters were larger (e.g., cluster of a high risk of infection (resp. death)) than infections (resp. deaths) outside. To do so, we implemented discrete Poisson probability models using different windows of geographical radius. We refer interested readers to Kihal-Talantikite et al. (2013) , and Rao et al. (2017) for full technical details. Recent SaTScan applications in the context of COVID-19 can be found in the works of Desjardins et al. (2020) or Kim and Castro (2020) for the cases of U.S. and South Korea, respectively. The most-likely geographical cluster is the one with maximum likelihood, and other clusters with significant log-likelihood ratios (LLR) can be seeing secondary potential clusters. Each LLR has a p-value estimated via 999 Monte Carlo Simulations. Finally, if p-value<0.05, then the geographical cluster has significantly higher risk of COVID-19 infections (resp. deaths) than that outside the area.",

Recall that Mexico City metropolitan area has a total population of more than 20 million inhabitants. Like New York in the U.S., this high-density area was the first in being hit by the pandemic. During this period, the risk of COVID-19 positive cases of the most-likely cluster was about 4.5 (RR=4.49) times higher than that in other clusters. The effectiveness of social distancing measures imposed by local and federal governments could, perhaps, be appreciated in Figure 2 (b). From the figure, we observe that most-likely and secondary clusters shifted towards southern and eastern regions. As expected, these dynamics indicate the rising spread of the virus in less populated areas of the States of Tlaxcala or Guanajuato. Interestingly, however, are the results of spatio-temporal clusters of COVID-19 deaths which show an opposite pattern. This is, municipalities clustered at highrisk areas during Phase I were located along different latitudes and longitudes (States of Baja California, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Tamaulipas, Oaxaca and Puebla) without a visible spatial pattern. Alternatively, the high-risk areas during Phase II were concentrated around Mexico City metro area (States of Mexico, Mexico City, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Hidalgo). The center of the most-likely cluster of COVID-19 deaths during Phase II was located in Sonora State, with centroid All rights reserved.

Black lines represent the 95% confidence interval. Variables in grey, red, green and yellow color correspond to socioeconomic, health, climate and commuting factors, respectively Socio-economic and health-related variables had an important role on the evolution of monthly cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. For the count model results in Figure 3 , the estimated coefficient of population density (log) during Phase I equals 0.53 (resp. 0.31) and it is statistically significant at the 99%. An alternative explanation for the estimated coefficients is the incidence rate ratios (IRR), also known as odds ratios in ZINB models, which are calculated by taking the exponent of the estimated coefficients in Figure 3 . The IRR of population density (log), see Table 3 , indicates that a unit increase in this variable increased it by 1.71 (=exp(0.53)) (resp. 1.37) times among those municipalities who experienced cases of coronavirus disease 2019 infection (resp. deaths) during the Phase I. In Phase II, however, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient became larger in the case of deaths, meaning that more densely populated municipalities suffered from larger counts of fatalities. This result is also partially illustrated in Figure 2 . The finding is in line with recent published work using U.S. county-level data (Sun et al., 2020a) or Iran province-level data (Ahmadi et al. 2020 ) but contrary to the empirical evidence of the provincial regions in China (Sun et al., 2020c) .

Phase II) an increase in 1 metric tonne in PM2.5 (log) per year would increase COVID-19 death rate by a factor of 1.25 (resp. 1.97). The finding is in line with relevant studies tackling the atmospheric determinants of population's vulnerability to COVID-19 in the U.S. (Bashir et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) , Italy (Lubrano et al., 2020) , China (Lin et al., 2020a) or some cities of Latin America (Bola\u00f1o et al., 2020), all of them unanimously confirmed the correlation between atmospheric conditions and COVID-19 cases, making poor air quality an additional co-determinant of COVID-19 lethality. With respect to precipitation, we observed that high cumulative rainfall (log) reduced the virus transmission and deaths during Phase II, only. Different from air pollution, the literature focusing on the role of amount of rainfall and virus transmission/deaths have found inconclusive results. In some countries like the U.S. (Bashir et al., 2020) , Indonesia (Tosepu et al., 2020) or Brazil (Rosario et al., 2020) rainfall has been shown to be not associated with the dynamics of the virus.",

We identified a total of 23 clusters of COVID-19 infections during Phase I, and surprisingly, the total number of clusters increased to 40 in Phase II. Notwithstanding, we also found an opposite dynamic with respect to cumulative COVID-19 deaths. This is, the total number of clusters reduced from 24 to 16 between Phase I and II, respectively, and their centroids moved away from Mexico City metropolitan area to Sonora and other bordering states. Although Phase II was characterized by a small number of clusters of COVID-19 deaths, they also reported a considerably larger number of cumulative deaths. For instance, the most-likely cluster during Phase I reported 1,072 deaths whereas in Phase II, it exhibited 3,179.

The above-mentioned link, between obesity/air pollution and higher COVID-19 lethality is also supported by Sanchis-Gomar et al. (2020) . The authors detail how adipose tissue may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, therefore, obese patients also have worse outcomes with COVID-19 infection, including respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality (Almerie and Kerrigan, 2020; Palaiodimos et al., 2020; Flint and Tahrani, 2020) .

Therefore, due to the large prevalence of diabetes (15%) and obesity (60%) in Mexico, we expect COVID-19 lethality being considerably higher than the one experienced by other countries in the region. In this vein, our variable fast food per 1,000 people was intended to discover possible effects of fast food restaurants on infections and deaths. There is an ongoing debate on weather higher density of unhealthy food options is associated with higher obesity and diabetes prevalence. While the evidence is mixed (Frankenfeld et al., 2015 , Mejova et al., 2015 , Mexico has recently implemented a front-ofpack labeling system as an attempt to tackle obesity by reducing the purchase of unhealthy products. All in all, our empirical evidence does not support the idea that an increasing number of local fast food restaurants is associated with higher rates of disease infections or lethality.",

For instance, when there is a substantial overlap of secondary clusters, e.g., Figure 2 (a), it is indicative of an urgent need of regional measures for the prevention, containment and coordination to be implemented in combating the COVID-19 health crisis. Successfully examples of localized policy interventions are detailed in Leal-Neto et al. (2020) and Dlamini et al. (2020) for the case of Brazil and Eswatini (Africa), respectively. Likewise, some of the spatial clusters identified in this work grouped together municipalities from different states. This scenario is of key relevance while designing localized public health efforts. In Mexico, the federal government has delegated to Federal States much of the responsibility about the management of the public health system during the pandemic. Federal States also have main duties and responsibilities related to the restriction of non-essential economic activities when the Epidemiological Risk Traffic Light (a bi-weekly monitoring system met to monitor and grade the use of public space according to virus transmission) turns into red color. In context of emerging clusters sharing municipalities from different states, coordinated efforts among various governments levels are critical. Past published research has shown the advantages of these type of coordinated public policy interventions not only to prevent the spread of sexual transmission diseases (Marotta, 2016) or Salmonella (Seixas et al., 2018) but also to provide with better healthcare services to vulnerable population suffering from cleft lip and palate (Gasca et al., 2019), obesity (Gartner et al., 2016) , tuberculosis (Rao et al., 2017) , and so forth.",

Thus, government response policies, such as testing procedures, tracking of individuals, social distancing measures or plans for hospital reconversion and immediate expansion will not be sufficient to mitigate the dynamics of the disease spread. Unless major policy changes are implemented to improve environmental sustainability and promote human development, more disadvantaged Mexican municipalities will become hotspots for virus All rights reserved.

More precisely, some of the possible policy actions could include support for workers in the informal sector, assistance for the population in poverty or a decarbonization pathway that focuses on electrification and clean renewable energy. Interestingly, the recent front-of-pack labeling system based on warning labels of unhealthy products seems to be an adequate government's strategy to fight obesity and ultimately COVID-19.",
