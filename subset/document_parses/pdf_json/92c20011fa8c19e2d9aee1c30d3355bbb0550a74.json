However, the extent to which students perceive these mediators as having an impact on their mental health has not been investigated. It is important to investigate this issue because students who do not perceive issues as having an impact on their mental health may not be motivated to address those issues. In the current study, 402 first-year undergraduate psychology students from a large Australian university indicated the extent to which 32 issues had a negative impact on their mental health over the past six months. Students rated lack of money, time management, coursework assessment items, lack of sleep, and course marks as having the largest impact on their mental health. Lack of money and time management mediated the positive association between subjective social status and mental health over (a) the past week and (b) the past month. Coursework assessment items and course marks mediated the positive association between subjective social status and satisfaction with the university experience. It is concluded that interventions should focus on these relatively high impact issues in order to address social class differences in students' mental health and university satisfaction.",

Prior work in this area has found that classism, sense of control, social contact with other students, and parenting style operate as mediators (Allan et al. 2016; Ibrahim et al. 2013; Rubin et al. 2016; Rubin and Kelly 2015) . In other words, controlling for these variables tends to reduce the size of the association between social class and mental health, suggesting that social class differences in mental health are partly explained by social class differences in classism, sense of control, social contact, and parenting style. However, it remains unclear whether students perceive these sorts of issues as having a substantial impact on their mental health. No prior research has addressed this question of perceived impact, and yet there are two reasons why it should be addressed.",

Certainly, students may be biased in these views and potentially in error. Nonetheless, they believe that they know what has been \"stressing them out,\" and these beliefs may correspond with reality. Hence, asking students to rate the impact of potential stressors on their mental health may allow researchers to identify stressors that have an objectively high impact on mental health.",

            "text": "Second, from an applied perspective, students who perceive a link between an issue and their mental health may be more motivated to address that issue in any social intervention that is designed to improve their mental health. For example, a lack of social contact with other students may mediate the positive association between social class and mental health ). However, interventions that aim to reduce social class differences in social contact in order to improve mental health may not be effective if students do not buy into the idea that improved social contact will reduce their mental health problems. Hence, understanding which potential mediators are perceived to be impactful by students is important in the case of interventions that require active participation and endorsement by students. Juniper et al. (2012) conducted an impact analysis study with PhD students. In this study, 1202 students indicated (a) whether they had experienced a series of work-related issues over the past six months and (b) how important each issue was to their well-being. The researchers then computed an impact score, which was the product of (a) the frequency with which students had experienced an issue and (b) the perceived impact of that issue on their well-being. In contrast to Juniper et al.' s study, the present study sampled 1st-year psychology undergraduate students rather than PhD students. In addition, instead of assessing experience and importance separately and then combining them to form an impact score, the present study asked students to rate the \"negative impact\" of a series of issues on their mental health over the past six months using a single scale. Hence, in the SN Soc Sci (2021) 1:20 Page 3 of 21 20 present study, experience and importance were measured together as part of an overall assessment of impact. Similar to Juniper et al., these impact ratings were then ranked in order to identify high impact issues. It is also important to note that Juniper et al. (2012) did not measure either social class or general mental health. Hence, Juniper et al.'s research was unable to either assess or explain the association between social class and mental health. In contrast, in the current project, mediators of the association between subjective social status and mental health were identified from among the group of high impact issues. Hence, unlike Juniper et al.'s study, the present research was focused on identifying high impact mediators of the association between subjective social status and mental health.",

The strengths of this measure are that it is a brief, intuitive, face-valid scale that has been shown to have good convergent validity with objective measures of social class and good predictive validity in relation to physical health and social behaviour (Adler et al. 2000 ; for reviews, see Diemer et al. 2013, pp. 104-105; Kraus et al. 2011 ). In addition, subjective measures such as the MacArthur scale have been recommended for use in higher education settings, where students' objective levels of social class (e.g., education level, occupational status, income) are less diagnostic and/or applicable (Diemer et al. 2013; Rubin et al. 2014 MacArthur scale by removing the associated ladder diagram, because it was difficult to operationalize this diagram in the online survey. Instead, participants moved a slider on a 101-point scale to indicate where they would place themselves relative to other people in Australia in terms of their income, education, and occupation. The sliding scale was anchored lowest income, education, and occupation (0) and highest income, education, and occupation (100). The scale scores were normally distributed in the present sample (skewness = \u2212 0.26, kurtosis = \u2212 0.78). In addition, prior research has shown that this adapted version of the MacArthur scale has good convergent validity with self-report measures of parental education, prestige of parental occupation, and family wealth among university students (Rubin and Stuart 2018, p. 240) . Please note that the MacArthur scale is a continuous measure of subjective social status, rather than a categorical measure of social class. Hence, the terms \"lower subjective social status\" and \"higher subjective social status\" are relative to students who report having an average social status score on this measure. In the present sample, the mean subjective social status score was 51.11 (SD = 19.31).",

I selected each issue on the basis that (a) it had the potential, in theory, to affect mental health, and (b) it was relevant to university students. I acknowledge that I may have omitted some potential issues in this list, and that future research may adopt a more systematic approach to this matter (e.g., Juniper et al. 2012) . Nonetheless, I believe that I have represented the key issues that may affect students' mental health. Participants provided their responses to each issue on a 101-point sliding scale anchored no impact on my mental health (0), a moderate impact on my mental health (50), and a very large impact on my mental health (100). Note that it is important to interpret the scores on this scale correctly. A low score indicates that the student has either not experienced an issue or they have experienced an issue but it has not affected their mental health. In contrast, a high score indicates that a student has both experienced an issue and that it has affected their mental health.",

In this model, subjective social status was the predictor variable and Page 14 of 21 DASS, BMHI, or satisfaction with university were the outcome variables. Lack of money, time management, coursework assessment items, lack of sleep, and course marks were the mediator variables. I used 5000 bootstrapping iterations and bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals to test the significance of indirect effects. Preliminary results showed that each of the five high impact issues mediated the associations between subjective social status and (a) DASS, (b), BMHI, and (c) satisfaction with university, \u03b2s \u2265 0.013, ps \u2264 0.05. However, the mental health measures had medium-sized negative correlations with the measure of satisfaction with university (rs \u2265|.42|). Again, this result is consistent with prior evidence (e.g., Almhdawi et al. 2018; Karaca et al. 2019) , and it suggests that some of the initial mediation effects may have occurred due to shared variance between mental health and satisfaction with university. In order to provide more diagnostic tests, I included satisfaction with university as a covariate when testing mediators in relation to DASS and BMHI, and I included DASS and BMHI as covariates when testing mediators in relation to satisfaction with university. I tested the indirect effects of each issue (a) separately and (b) together with the other four issues in parallel. The parallel mediation analysis tests the indirect effect of each mediator variable while controlling for the indirect effects of the other mediator variables. Hence, it provides a method of testing the independent mediating effect of each mediator. Table 6 provides the results from these analyses.",

Interestingly, students rated \"prejudice and discrimination against me\" as having a relatively low impact on their mental health, and subjective social status did not have a significant correlation with this variable (r = \u2212 0.09, p = 0.064). Hence, contrary to Allan et al. (2016) , classism did not appear to be a major issue, at least among the first-year undergraduate psychology students that I sampled, although it should be noted that the reliability and validity of this single item measure can be questioned. Similarly, although there was a significant negative correlation between subjective social status and the perceived mental health impacts of (a) loneliness (r \u2212 0.13, p = 0.008) and (b) lack of sense of belonging at university (r = \u2212 0.10, p = 0.043), students rated these issues as having only a medium impact on their mental health. Hence, although Rubin et al.'s (2016) social contact explanation received some support, students did not perceive a strong link between lack of social contact with university friends and their mental health. These results do not deny that classism and lack of social contact mediate the association between subjective social status and mental health. However, they do suggest that interventions based on these issues may face an uphill struggle in motivating students to take these issues seriously. The present research was able to identify mediators of the association between subjective social status and mental health from among a group of issues that had received relatively high impact ratings. In particular, the perceived impact of lack of money and, less consistently, time management mediated the association between subjective social status and mental health while controlling for satisfaction with university. These results are consistent with prior work that has shown that lack of money and time explain the disadvantages experienced by students from lower SES backgrounds in other areas of university life, namely social integration (Rubin and Wright 2017) . The current results build on this prior work by showing that a similar mediation effect applies to the association between subjective social status and mental health. Students who reported having a lower social status rated lack of money and time management as having a relatively large impact on their mental health, and these ratings helped to explain their poorer mental health (DASS & BMHI). These results make sense because money and time are resources that can be used to buffer the impact of stressful events on mental health. For example, students with more money can afford to pay for stress-relieving activities, such as social activities (e.g., Cabrera et al., 1992; Martin 2012) . In addition, students with better time management opportunities can complete their university studies in a less stressful manner (Macan et al. 1990 ).",

In particular, perceived impact of coursework assessment items and, less consistently, course marks mediated the association between subjective social status and satisfaction with university. These results are consistent with prior research that has shown that students from lower SES backgrounds tend to be less satisfied with their university experience than students from higher SES backgrounds (Martin 2012) , and that course marks are positively associated with satisfaction with university (for a review, see Green et al. 2015, pp. 139-140) .",

            "text": "The present results refer to a measure of subjective social status. It is unclear whether they extend to more objective measures of social class. Having said that, there are good theoretical and empirical grounds for expecting a close connection between these subjective and objective measures (Adler et al. 2000) , including in university samples (Kraus et al. 2011; Rubin and Stuart 2018; Rubin et al. 2014) , and so I predict that the current results will replicate using more objective measures of social class. It is also important to appreciate that the impacting issues in the present research confounded the frequency with which students experienced potentially impacting issues with the perceived impact of those issues on their mental health. For example, participants in this study may have rated being the victim of violence as having a relatively low impact on their mental health over the past six months because either (a) they had not experienced being the victim of violence during this time period or (b) they had experienced being the victim of violence but it did not have a large impact on their mental health. It is important to appreciate that this confound between frequency of experience and perceived impact does not undermine the conclusions of the current study, because these conclusions refer to the student population rather than to individual students. Hence, it remains valid to claim that issues such as drug use, being a victim of violence, and sexual identity had a relative low impact on the mental health of students, even if the reason for this low impact is the relatively low frequency with which students experienced these issues. It is also worth noting that the current approach is consistent with prior work by Juniper et al. (2012) , who measured experience (frequency) and subjective importance separately, but then created an impact score based on the product of frequency and importance. This approach is conceptually similar to the single scale approach that was used in the present study. Nonetheless, further research is required to confirm that (a) lack of money and time management mediate the positive association between social class and mental health, and (b) coursework assessment items and course marks mediate the positive association between subjective social class and satisfaction with university.",

This gender imbalance is typical for psychology degrees, and the current sample was drawn from psychology courses. Hence, the sample is representative in this sense. Women sometimes report slightly more mental health problems than men (e.g., Crawford et al. 2011, p. 9 ). However, this gender difference was not significant in the present sample (ps \u2265 0.112). An exploratory investigation of gender differences in impact ratings found that, compared to men, women rated the following issues as being more impactful: lack of money, physical health, difficulty understanding course material, family members, eating disorder, sexual abuse/harassment, homesickness, travelling to and from university, unhealthy diet, not knowing how things work at university, and lack of exercise (ps \u2264 0.041). Lack of money is the only variable in this list that was used as a mediator variable in the present analyses. Consequently, I repeated the simple mediation analyses that included lack of money, but this time I included gender (coded as male, female, or missing data) as a covariate. The pattern of significant and nonsignificant indirect effects that are reported in Table 6 remained the same. Hence, gender did not appear to affect the results in this respect.",

            "text": "Of course, there is a balance to be struck between the student uptake of an intervention and its theoretical efficacy. Ideally, we should strive for interventions that have both large effects and good uptake. It is obviously not useful to focus on interventions that have negligible effects, even if their uptake is very good. Similarly, it is problematic to focus on interventions that have massive effects but almost no uptake. Most research in the current area has focused on effect sizes rather than student uptake. For example, Rubin et al. (2016, p. 734 ) explained that, when extrapolating to the population level, their small-to-medium sized effects had \"the potential to affect thousands of students in higher education.\" The present research builds SN Soc Sci (2021) on this point by focusing on the potential for student uptake and considering which putative processes are more likely to be accepted by students and acted on. Of course, it is not difficult to persuade students of the need for greater financial subsidising of their university education. However, the present research findings indicate that more students may be willing to accept that financial subsidies will help to reduce social class disparities in mental health relative to interventions that address issues such as drug use, violence, or sexual identity, because more students will have personal experience of lack of money affecting their mental health. To be clear, these latter issues are vitally important, and they deserve funding towards their reduction in student populations. However, the present research findings suggest that most students are unlikely to accept that interventions that address drug use, being a victim of violence, and sexual identity will lead to significant improvements in their own mental health, because most students do not view these issues as being impactful on their own mental health.",

In this case, a reduction in coursework assessment items may actually increase the impact of each coursework item on mental health. A more effective approach to this issue may be to reduce the number of stressful coursework items.
