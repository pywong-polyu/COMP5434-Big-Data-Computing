The country has since documented record-breaking increase in heat-related illness incidence in recent years [19] . The main culprit for the increase in heat-related illnesses is the exposure to extreme heat [36] , amplified by the changing climate. In response to this looming threat in the time of the pandemic, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) issued guidelines, dated 4 May 2020, which was entitled and loosely translated to \"Heatstroke prevention in \"a new lifestyle\" during the COVID-19 pandemic\", elaborating on how to prevent heatstroke while maintaining the 3Cs [32] . The guidelines explicitly cautioned about the increase in the possibility of heat-related illness risk during the pandemic, particularly with the use of protective face masks (PFM). The stern caution stems from several studies which have noted that PFM use may negatively impact body thermoregulation through increased thermal stress [28, 40] and thus increasing the risk of developing heat-related illnesses.",

The authors noted the role of mobility restrictions as well as remote working in decreasing the exposure of the population to heat, and thus the reduction in HIAT. On the other hand, the observed reduction may also be due to the changes in the exposure-response function, which, most of the time, leads to changes in the health risk/burden. With just little more than a year into the pandemic, evidence regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temperature and heat illness association is scarce, and thus making it challenging to attribute whether the changes observed in HIAT was indeed due to the changes in the exposurehealth association or otherwise. The determination of how the pandemic impacted the temperature-health outcome associations would help health managers understand which mechanisms may have been linked with these changes and at the same time will serve as a guide in crafting evidence-informed policies in relation to heat-related risk management/strategies in light of ongoing and future pandemics. In this study, we examined the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the temperature-HIAT associations in Japan.",

The cross-basis term implemented via a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), models the bi-dimensional associations of both the exposure-response and lagged dimensions [13] . The cross-basis term was specified with a quadratic B-spline for the exposure-response dimension with two internal knots placed at the 50th and 90th percentiles of locationspecific summer temperature distributions, and a natural cubic B-spline for the lag dimension with an intercept and two equally-spaced internal knots in the log scale. Lag dimension results reflect the risks at the 99th temperature percentile compared to the minimum risk temperature (MRT); the temperature whereby the risk is assumed to be the lowest; in this study it was determined to be at the 1st percentile, which was at 20.9 \u00b0C. Due to the immediate nature of HIAT, we set the lag to 5 days.

Subsequent fitted multivariate meta-regression models were used to estimate the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) for the overall cumulative exposure-response in each prefecture. In brief, BLUP allows prefectures with relatively low number of daily HIAT data to utilize the information from larger prefectures sharing similar characteristics [11] . Nationwide pre-pandemic and pandemic period associations, for both exposure and lag dimensions, were derived through the second stage analysis via the R package \"mvmeta\". We further examined the difference between pre-pandemic and pandemic associations using a test of interaction [2] and estimated the ratio of relative risks (RRR) [2, 3] , along the exposure and lag dimensions. The test of interaction determines whether there is statistical difference between the periods, whereas the subsequent derived RRR estimates the magnitude of the changes in the relative risk by comparing pandemic risk to the baseline (pre-pandemic risk).

            "text": "In this study, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic modified both the HIAT exposure-response and lag associations in Japan. An overall reduction in the HIAT risk was generally observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may partially be due to the attenuation of both the exposure-response and immediate lag associations. Aside from the reduction, notable risk increments were also apparent in the delayed lag associations. Several mechanisms may have contributed to the reduction or increment of HIAT risk during the pandemic. Firstly, we draw comparison on how these observed changes resemble the impact of large-scale events on heat-related health risks in a more familiar concept of heat-health plans. In addition, we subsequently examined how these changes reflect the role of multi-sectoral policies as well as behavioral changes on the reduction and increment of heatrelated health risks. In the absence of true comparison, we presuppose that the COVID-19 pandemic setting serves as a community-level effect modifier, which share similarities to a heat-health plan. Though not entirely the same, the characterization of preventive measures within a heat wave warning system and measures against COVID-19, which, in part, affect the behaviors of people towards exposures, may be assumed to share the same concept of collective consciousness of risk aversion [30] . In Ahmedabad, India, Hess et al. [20] observed a substantial reduction in the heat-related risk after the implementation of a heat action plan (HAP) in response to the 2010 heat wave event. The authors noted an after-to-before HAP unlagged mortality incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-1.22) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.29-1.81) for maximum temperatures of over 40 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C, respectively. Here, the authors noted that regardless of the cut off, of either over 40 \u00b0C or 45 \u00b0C, the reductions in the IRR are still discernable. On the other hand, Mart\u00ednez-Solanas and Basaga\u00f1a [29] shares a similar observation, whereby the authors observed a weak to non-significant difference between the overlapping effects estimates of pre-HAP (percent change = 28.0; 95% CI: 22.4 -33.9%) and post-HAP (percent change = 24.9; 95% CI: 21.4 -28.6%) periods of high temperature effects in the 50 provinces of Spain. The reduction of heat-related risks due to heat-health plans has a resemblance, albeit different, on how COVID-19 attenuated temperature-HIAT association. Here, a population's response to the risks is influenced mainly by both physical and behavioral factors [21] . The direction of the changes in the risks would also vary depending on the response. However, in this study, we observed an apparent and consistent reduction in the heat-related risks for both exposure-response ( Fig. 2A) and same-day lag dimensions (Fig. 3A) . Though it is difficult to draw definitive conclusion on the cause of these reductions, it remains plausible that both physical factors, in terms of policy interventions, accompanied with behavioral changes may have resulted to these changes.",

Though mobility restrictions were not that strict, the response of the population towards these governmental requests have been reciprocated with a significant reduction in trips with the number of inter-prefectural travel halved across the country compared to prepandemic conditions [15] . Changes in human behavior during the pandemic is a cognitive response to the immediate threat of COVID-19, which has an indirect effect on the reduction of heat exposure [38] . Specifically, behavioral changes related to time spent indoor/ outdoor may be related to the variability in heat exposure [27] . In an online survey conducted from 3 to 25 August 2020 in selected major cities and prefectures in Japan (n = 12,872), there was an approximately 13.8% increase in time spent indoors during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic period, which subsequently corresponded to an 18.8% reduction in outdoor activities across the country [33] . Since HIAT occur mostly in roads (15.6%) and outdoor public areas (12.5%) [16] , the increase in time spent indoor may have led to the attenuation of the heat-related health risks during the pandemic.",

This is quite apparent in the significant difference in Lag 2, whereby pandemic risks were higher compared to the pre-pandemic period. It is plausible that this phenomenon is related to the reduction of same-day risks observed during the pandemic. During the pandemic, several studies have noted the delay of access to medical care [6, 9] , with the fear of contracting the disease [5, 45] . In the US, a survey revealed that 41% of the respondents have foregone medical care in the early phase of the pandemic [4] . In another online survey, 12% of 4975 respondents opted to delay or have avoided urgent or emergency medical care [9] . It is reasonable to believe that those populations which have foregone immediate medical services (i.e. hospital/ ambulance transport) may have delayed their access to a later period, thus mirroring the reduction in the same-day risk and a subsequent increase in the delayed association.",

The increment in the delayed risk during the pandemic period may have potential implications to health service access. In part, this may be loosely related to the delay in accessing health services due to medical care access hesitancy during the pandemic and of other related barriers such as informational/technological resource access [9, 37] . Health service providers and managers would then need to consider these factors and other potential mechanisms in order to overcome the barriers to healthcare access in the pandemic-stricken setting. In terms of heat-related health risk management, access to the appropriate information, such as clinic availability/schedule which provide telemedicine [7] as well as readily-accessible geographical maps of health facilities catering to non-COVID-19 cases [25] , may potentially ease up the hesitancy in accessing immediate health care services.",

The ecological nature of the study may not be able to capture the individual-level characteristics, which may possibly explain the changes in the association. Further studies are needed to account for these personal-level data. In the absence of 2019 air pollution data, we were not able to examine the role of air pollution, particularly particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in size (PM 2.5 ), on the temperature-HIAT associations; a complete data is needed whenever available. However, it would be prudent to assume that the effect of air pollution on temperature-HIAT associations would be minimal, since 1) Japan has a relatively low ambient air pollution level [46] compared to other developed countries, and 2) that this low ambient air pollution may have been further reduced during the pandemic, which was similarly observed across several countries globally [42] . Also, the pandemic period data coverage is limited to 2020. Data supplementation would be necessary whenever available in order to further establish the robustness of the results. In this study, we utilized a simple binary indicator to represent COVID-19 impact. There is merit for other studies to explore other indicators which could represent the magnitude of the pandemic's impact, i.e. continuous metrics. Nevertheless, we believe that the results provide substantial evidence on the magnitude of temperature-HIAT association reduction or increment during the pandemic. The results can serve as a guidepost for health managers and policymakers in crafting subsequent heat-health advisories as we enter the second year into the pandemic as well as future disease entities with pandemic potential.",
