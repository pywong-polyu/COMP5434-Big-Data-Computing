Moreover, when the maximum distance between the sensors is greater than half the wavelength of the maximum frequency of source signals involved, a problem called spatial aliasing is inevitable [4] . The bin-wise methods [7, 8, [13] [14] [15] are robust to these two problems. However, these methods require the introduction of an additional step to solve a permutation problem in the estimated masks, when we pass from one frequency bin to another, which is a classical problem that is common to all bin-wise BSS methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 71, "end": 74, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 75, "end": 77, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 343, "end": 346, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 542, "end": 545, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 573, "end": 575, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 576, "end": 580, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 581, "end": 585, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "However, all of these BSS methods based on TF masking (full-band and binwise) suffers from artifacts problem which affect the quality of the separated signals and due to the fact that the W-disjoint orthogonality assumption is not perfectly verified in practice. Indeed, being introduced by the TF masking operation, these artifacts are more and more troublesome when the spectral overlap of source signals in the TF domain becomes important. In [11] the authors proposed a first solution to this problem which consists of a cepstral smoothing of spectral masks before applying them to the frequency observations X i (m, k). An interesting extension of this technique, which was proposed in [3] , consists in applying cepstral smoothing not to spectral masks but rather to the separated signals, i.e. after applying the separation masks. Knowing that these two techniques [3, 11] were have only been validated on a few full-band methods, in [5] we have recently proposed to evaluate their effectiveness using a few popular bin-wise methods. However, these two solutions could only improve one particular type of artifact called musical noise [3, 5, 11] . In the same sense, in order to avoid the artifacts caused by the TF masking operation, we propose in this paper a new BSS method which also exploits the sparsity of source signals in the TF domain for determined LC mixtures. Indeed, by focusing on the case of determined mixtures, we show that we can avoid TF masking and also relax the W-disjoint orthogonality assumption. Note that the case of determined mixtures was also addressed in [1] , but with an assumption which is again very restrictive and which consists in having at least a whole time frame of silence 4 for each of the source signals.

However, we note that 8 We have indeed opted for these 4 realizations instead of only one in order to approach as close as possible to a statistical validation of our results. 9 I.e. the mixing filters length (Q + 1 = fs \u00b7 RT60) varies from 800 coefficients (for RT 60 = 50 ms) to 3200 coefficients (for RT 60 = 200 ms). this performance is degraded when RT 60 increases. This result, which is common to all BSS methods, is expected and is mainly explained by the fact that the higher the reverberation time, the less the assumption (here of sparseness in the TF domain) assumed by these methods on source signals is verified.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 155, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 13, "end": 20, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "In this paper, we have proposed a new Blind Source Separation method for linear convolutive mixtures with a sparsity assumption in the time-frequency domain that is much less restrictive compared to the existing methods [1, 2, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [13] [14] [15] . Indeed, by focusing on the case of determined mixtures, we have shown that our method avoids the problem of artifacts at the separated signals from which suffers most of these methods [2, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [13] [14] [15] . According to the results of the several tests performed, the performance of our new method, in terms of SDR and SAR, is better than that obtained by using the method proposed by Sawada et al. [15] and the UCBSS method [13] , which are known for their good performance within existing methods. Nevertheless, considering that these results were obtained over 4 different realizations of the mixtures and only for some values of the parameters involved, a larger statistical performance study including all these parameters is desirable to confirm this results.
