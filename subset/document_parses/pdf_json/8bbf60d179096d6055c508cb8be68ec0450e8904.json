Examples of hazards are floods, earthquakes, and wildfires, yet the disaster is not caused by these natural processes (even where modified or triggered by human activity). Instead, the disaster emerges from choices to create and allow vulnerabilities-such as through wealth inequities, discrimination against populations, and failing to provide education-so that people do not have the information, resources, or empowerment to prevent harm from the hazards [10] [11] [12] . Thus, the term \"natural disaster\" is a misnomer while preventing and responding to disasters means addressing vulnerabilities, irrespective of what nature does [13] [14] [15] .",

For this mitigation to be fully effective, key people involved (those who are directly affected) need to be included in producing and testing recommendations and actions, due to the self-reliance necessary for providing DRR and healthcare in locations with limited accessibility [34] . Research methods for investigating this topic in a systematic, verifiable, and robust manner are needed, while including the people affected. These concepts lead, therefore, to participatory research, ensuring that people are directly involved in the research process [35] [36] [37] , which can be qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods [38, 39] . Participatory research within healthcare contexts can be described as collaborative research between researchers, healthcare users, and healthcare professionals (covering, for instance, scientists, research support staff, patients, service users, suppliers, and healthcare providers) [40, 41] . Methodologically, participatory research can be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods [38, 39] . One method is not better than another. Instead, the choice of which method to use to conduct participatory research should be based on the appropriateness for answering a well-defined research question or questions. Examples of participatory research for healthcare are women's groups for reducing material and infant mortality [42] and developing mobile phone games to improve health awareness [43] . Improving such approaches is suggested as being needed to reduce HIV infection and intimate partner violence in Southern Africa [44] . Participatory research for healthcare means that all parties are involved in the research, aiming for positive health-related outcomes. Participatory research with a qualitative methodology tends to align more closely to healthcare research covering all aspects of health, including physical, psycho-social, spiritual, occupational, and environmental health. Participatory research, however, still can and often should be informed by quantitative methods or mixed methods, providing that the methods suit the answering of the well-defined research question(s).",

In contrast, human judgements, subjectivities, and values imbue all steps of the scientific process, meaning that scientists' views might differ from the perspectives of the people whom the science is about or who are affected by the science [52] . The issue is not about who is \"right\" and who is \"wrong\", since all knowledge forms have limitations [53, 54] . Instead, it is about collaboration, to cross-check material and relevance, aiming for as complete and as useful an understanding as possible, so that the people affected by DRR and healthcare gain from the research. Hence, participation in the entire research process is important and such collaboration enhances the generalizability of research findings, as demonstrated by the examples in the references given in this section.",

This method is similar to a literature review (not a systematic literature review, but a broad examination of the literature with a narrative exploration), although the method used here is more appropriate for this paper due to its focus on surveying the literature and describing the characteristics and impact on practice [62] The qualitative evidence synthesis is a critical review of evidence about a defined theme, aiming to formulate an evidence-based description of that theme for dissemination. The evidence comes from examples and sources, selected by using the overview paper approach of purposive sampling (which some label as a subset of selective sampling). [36] (p. 1670) support purposive sampling in participatory research for \"reliability and representativeness\" (which should also be interpreted to encompass validity) while [63] (p. 124) note its importance for \"identification of differing views and perspectives\", corroborating [64] 's explanation of how the method is appropriate in health for obtaining a variety of examples, exactly as per the aim here. The point of this method is not to be comprehensive or systematic, but to ensure a variety and balance of examples, providing an overview of the topic [62] , as has been applied to aspects of connecting humanitarian aid and DRR [65] . In other words, the findings of this paper are useful for informing participatory research, using any method or combination of methods, in areas with limited accessibility. The method effectively collates and critiques the evidence on the selected theme for indicating relevant issues and research gaps, enabling the findings to be generalizable and applicable to practice. The next section summarizes two known, specific, data-related challenges of participatory research methodologies as applied to this paper's topic. Section 3 uses case studies to illustrate these specific challenges, and how they might be overcome, in practice. Section 4 syntheses the material and provides recommendations through exploring limitations and further interpretations of the evidence. The conclusions describe the main contributions of this paper and indicate some gaps to be filled.",

Other research approaches involve examining real situations in real time [68] or post-hoc analyses [69] . Challenges emerge in using participatory research to investigate these topics when defining the data (Section 2.1) and when collecting the data (Section 2.2), which are then summarized in Section 2.3. The morals of conducting such research, as well as how institutional and national ethical approval does not necessarily resolve all the concerns, are well documented [70] [71] [72] [73] . The discussion in this section assumes that no research should be carried out without the appropriate approvals-including data protection, background checks, informed consent, ethics approval, and risk assessments-in order to focus here on the pragmatic challenges of what the data are and how they would be collected, with the ethics and risks already presumed to be acceptable.",

For research publications, few problems emerge, as these are all appropriate and accepted methods, particularly when considering the need for data to be representative and applicable to a context or area of practice [82] . For developing manuals, training, instructions, and guidance, transferability and generalization pose difficulties due to the need to adapt to specific circumstances as well as limited verifiability and repeatability. When conducting research on patients' needs [83] or perceptions [84] in locations with limited accessibility, what the healthcare actually was and its effectiveness represent different research questions. When determining the healthcare to provide and being able to assess its effectiveness, anecdotal or ad hoc material is difficult to use due to the dynamic nature of locations with limited accessibility [30] .",

By the very nature of the problem defined (participatory research for linking DRR and healthcare in locations with limited accessibility to mitigate further harm or damage), specific examples are not always available and sample sizes tend to be small due to lower population sizes which are frequently present in areas with limited accessibility. The island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and many settlements on small islands in Northern Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) lack both an airport and a large harbor, so bringing in medical equipment and health personnel is not easy. The differences are nonetheless substantial. Many of the settlements in Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) are accessible by helicopter, depending on the weather, whereas Tristan da Cunha is out of range of land-based helicopters, and the settlements in Kalaallit Nunaat must contend with far more wintry conditions than Tristan da Cunha. Whether or not islands inevitably have commonalities is debated [23, 85] and there are certainly some similarities between the two examples provided here. Using them as comparable units of analysis simply to increase the sample size would be difficult to defend, as would island examples as the case study. Even just considering the settlements in Northern Kalaallit Nunaat would be problematic for comparison, because their accessibility varies substantially across the modes of access of helicopter, airplane, boat, dogsled, snowmobile, and skiing as well as the people who are seeking access to or from the locations [86] . Furthermore, seasonal conditions increase the complexity of DRR and healthcare provision. The large number of influencing factors often inhibits robust comparisons across time, geography, or circumstance.",

            "text": "In 1960-1961, a Soviet team built a new inland research station to spend 1961 s winter there. In April, the team's sole doctor diagnosed himself with acute appendicitis. After trying other treatments unsuccessfully, the only remaining possibility was to remove his appendix, which he did himself in an operation called an auto-appendicectomy, after which he made a full recovery [109] . The situation is explained as being \"in the wilderness, out of hospital settings, with no possibility of outside help, and without any other medical professional around\" [109] (p. 1422), which is the epitome of the need for prolonged healthcare to mitigate further injury or illness in locations with limited accessibility. This instance is another example of a participatory research study with a small sample size that provided an opportunity to investigate the provision of healthcare in an area with limited accessibility. Although circumstances such as these may appear rare, there are other documented examples. Another doctor who had to self-treat during the Antarctic winter was the only physician at the South Pole station in 1999. She discovered a lump in her breast, did a biopsy, and found that it was cancerous. Supplies were dropped by air for self-treatment until it was possible to evacuate her in October during a dangerous landing and takeoff [110] . This case study has been used as an analogy for planning for similar scenarios during space flight [111] , which is an example of how the findings of a participatory research study can inform practice in other locations with limited accessibility.",

The expected time to evacuation can make a difference. The patient with appendicitis knew that there was no early route out of Antarctica and that inaction likely meant death. The patient with breast cancer knew that efforts were being made for the earliest possible evacuation flight, although with a large window regarding when it would be feasible, as well as the fact that some of form of treatment, substantially reducing the chance of dying, was feasible while awaiting evacuation.",

Third, New Zealand is a small country and struggled to treat and rehabilitate so many patients with burn injuries [116] due to the amount of skin grafts and length of healthcare required at around the same time. Many of the injured were soon repatriated out of New Zealand, some of whom died in their home country. The Whakaari volcano eruption exemplifies how healthcare services can be rapidly overwhelmed in the response to disaster due to limited capacity and resources. Participatory research would provide an opportunity to investigate the provision of acute and long-term healthcare for people in a location with limited accessibility, and in this example, there is a larger sample size, which could result in more representative findings.",

The first priority of any researcher present should be providing first aid, including psychological support and reassurance to survivors, rather than trying to collect data, or else the research becomes unethical. Once the patients are transported to larger centers, such as Oslo for Ut\u00f8ya and Auckland for Whakaari, prospects exist for participatory research with the patients and the medical staff into mitigating further illness and injury, which was completed for Ut\u00f8ya [117] and which seems to be ongoing for Whakaari [116] .

War zones have limited accessibility due to the high risk of injury or death as a result of conflict, or reduced accessibility fueled by political sensitivity or censorship [120] . Historical studies [121, 122] contribute, as do descriptive [123] and observational [124] data collection. The journal Military Medicine has been published since 1940 and lists 35 papers with the word \"participatory\" in the title, abstract, or full text, only one of which was about combat medicine [125] . Nonetheless, the literature on participatory research in war zones is large, including auto-ethnographies [68] and volunteers trying an intervention [126] , with the work covering a wide range of issues on data, ethics, operations, transferability, and researcher roles. War and conflict case studies hence provide evidence that using auto-ethnographic or participant-observer methods can provide an opportunity to enable valuable (and sometimes the only) contributions to DRR and healthcare research in such areas with limited accessibility. Table 3 summarizes the data-related challenges, correlated with information in Table 2 , which apply to each example in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. In each instance, the vulnerabilities of the individuals and collectives involved match up with the basic disaster risk theory presented in Section 1.1 in that known vulnerabilities led to the adverse outcomes. For the three Antarctic cases, as well as Burma, the vulnerabilities and risks were well known and were assessed before, but the actions went forward anyway on the basis of accepting the risks and taking as many mitigative actions as feasible. These actions led to a successful outcome in two of these four cases. For Ut\u00f8ya, the official report documented numerous failings and missed opportunities to stop the terrorism, which was a known threat [127] . ",

This work is especially helpful in the context of knowing that participatory research is unlikely to be feasible to a great extent immediately after an earthquake due to the ongoing post-disaster operations. Furthermore, participatory research provides an opportunity to develop bespoke DRR strategies for the people in Wellington, demonstrating personcentered DRR research, which reflects the expected standard of healthcare provision in response to a disaster. Participatory research would empower people who would be in an area of limited accessibility should an earthquake occur, which is important because local people would initially be the responders to a disaster in that location of temporarily limited accessibility.",

Poor long-term management of the healthcare system in the UK [133] meant that, to deal with COVID-19, the healthcare system had to have restrictions imposed.

One advantage is that locations with limited accessibility are easily included in the research without the need for travel, reducing the possibilities for interfering with operations. One disadvantage is that those with access to social media and those willing to post on social media are not necessarily a representative sample of the affected population; in fact, not all locations with limited accessibility even have internet coverage. Disinformation, misinformation, people paid to post (typically from an ideological standpoint or for commercial gain), influencers, boosted posts (paying the social media company to promote the post), and bots all skew the samples and hence the results and findings. The data nonetheless remain representative of what is posted, even if not of what is happening, although explanation would be required to highlight the limitations and advantages of such data. An additional challenge is how much social media postings could be considered to be participatory. Is real-time reporting, videoing, and photographing-including through interactive processes such as streaming-from a disaster scene observation or participation?

For both acute and chronic healthcare, the healthcare provider requires training to be able to meet the patient's needs in challenging circumstances [147] . Relying on clinical experience only can increase the risk of human error and the patient experiencing further illness or injury. In contrast, secondary care settings and prehospital care practices are premised on opportunities being available to replenish resources and to medevac or provide other logistical support [148] . Managing long-term conditions or additional care needs in locations with limited accessibility requires DRR strategies, thorough risk assessment, and planning, entailing robust and adequate training [100] . Participatory research could and should be part of such work, providing an opportunity to examine these processes systematically and verifiably for improving training and practice without putting people's lives at risk. As with social media, challenges regarding the role of participation arises, particularly how participatory research is where the patient cannot or does not participate, even where healthcare professionals are participatory subjects. After all, the aim of mitigating further illness and injury is meant to serve the patient and participatory research is meant to involve those who are being served. The opportunity remains in improving links between healthcare and DRR, which would also increase the safety of healthcare professionals and the quality of their work which, in turn, does indeed serve the patients [149] .",

The latter is particularly important in case decisions might be changed for the better, which means trying to understand how to identify when improvements would occur through the knowledge that operations are being researched.

Both disasters and health are socially determined and should highlight prevention rather than treatment and cure [10] [11] [12] [16] [17] [18] . In disaster response and reconstruction, DRR could be better applied [150, 151] alongside illness care better adopting healthcare approaches [152] . How to engrain the ethos of prevention as a long-term process in participatory research for mitigating further illness and injury is an ongoing research task, which is part of using participatory research to apply prevention within response, treatment, and cure. Emergency resources can be used, and sometimes are used, to avoid an emergency-such as firefighters advocating for smoke detectors [153] and medical professionals advising which occupational protective equipment to use [154] -but the operational aspects of doing so in locations with limited accessibility remain understudied. The ultimate goal of this participatory research is learning how to connect pre-and postactions for DRR and healthcare together.",

Two main challenges are grounded in identifying and collecting the data, leading to an overarching challenge of potentially divergent goals between research and practice of DRR and healthcare. Participatory research nevertheless provides opportunities for strengthening the association of DRR and healthcare in areas with limited accessibility, but its limitations need to be acknowledged and overcome with transparency.",
