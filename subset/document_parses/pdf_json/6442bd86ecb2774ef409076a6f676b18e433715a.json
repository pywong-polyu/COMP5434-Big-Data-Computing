            "text": "This paper examines the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in mediating the effect of job and household income loss on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We note that even though job loss will invariably reduce household income, the relationship between these factors and mental health may be mediated by SES. Specifically, in the context of COVID-19 induced shock, job loss may not be a threat to survival for an individual with relatively high SES, while this is not the case for individuals with low SES. Our empirical analysis uses threshold regression under the assumption that the relationship between depressive symptoms and pandemic induced job/ income loss has a threshold effect. We find that job loss (but not the decline in household income) is a stronger predictor of poor mental health for individuals that live in households above a certain SES threshold. This suggests that the psychological trauma of job loss due to loss of identity and purpose outweighs the financial loss for individuals with higher SES. On the other hand, a decrease in household income (as against the loss of individual income) is a stronger predictor of poor mental health for individuals with lower SES. We argue that these findings are related to high-income inequality in South Africa. The results highlight the different implications of job loss and income loss for depressive symptoms in the context of high socioeconomic inequality.",

            "text": "Given the aforementioned and consistent with available evidence from elsewhere, mental health problems are likely to have increased relative to the pre-COVID period in South Africa . Furthermore, because South Africa is one of the most unequal countries in the world (Leibbrandt & D\u00edaz Pab\u00f3n, 2021; Leibbrandt et al., 2012) , there will be significant differences in how South African residents experience the lockdown (i.e. the experience of the poor might be different from to those who are wealthy). The restriction of movement and the need to change behaviour (e.g., social distancing) may introduce additional stressors for a minority of relatively affluent families living in the suburbs. However, for low-income families living in informal settlements (or \"townships\") who rely on the informal economy (i.e. economic activities that are not regulated or protected by the state 1 ; International Labour Organization, 2010) for a living, earnings loss as a result of forced disengagement from the labour market may cause severe economic strain. 2 While for the wealthy, loneliness may contribute to depression (Erzen & \u00c7ikrikci, 2018) , poverty and mental illness are widely considered to operate in a vicious cycle for the poor. This is because povertyrelated stress can predispose individuals to mental illness (including depression), and psychological problems, in turn, can increase the risk of falling into or remaining in poverty (Lund et al., 2011) . 3 Available literature suggests that the pandemic's impact on job and income loss varies by gender, race, and nature of employment (Spaull et al., 2020) . It has also been shown that the poor, women and informal workers are disproportionately affected (Casale & Shepherd, 2020; Oyenubi, 2021; Rogan & Skinner, 2020) . In terms of the impact of the pandemic on health, those who live in poorer households are more likely to report poor health in 2020 compared to 2017 (i.e. before and after the pandemic) . This higher level of disparity in (self-reported) poor health is driven by hunger, and loss of employment. Given the impact of the pandemic on the economy, it is expected that the additional burden associated with the pandemic in terms of depressive symptoms will exacerbate existing inequality in health.",

Risk perception of COVID-19 may exacerbate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic irrespective of socioeconomic status (SES). Therefore, those who believe they are at a greater risk of contracting or transmitting the virus may experience more psychological distress. It has been shown that affluent South Africans have higher (subjective) infection risk perception than poor South Africans (Burger et al., 2020; Oyenubi et al., 2021) . Therefore, while financial pressure is expected to affect the poor disproportionately, risk perception may disproportionately affect the affluent. This highlights the significance of re-evaluating the prevalence of depressive symptoms in South Africa. It also underscores the importance of re-evaluating demographic characteristics that are correlated with depressive symptoms.",

            "text": "A priori, the pandemic and associated lockdown would be expected to exacerbate existing inequalities in well-being, similar to the pandemic's negative effect on self-reported health . However, some evidence has suggested that individuals with higher SES are more likely to experience worse impact in terms of wellbeing in the initial phases of a crisis. For example, Wanberg et al. (2020) argue that individuals who are better off in terms of SES experience a greater loss in well-being as measured by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those who are worse-off. This finding is consistent with the Axios-Ipsos poll conducted in the United States, which found similar results when comparing decline in emotional well-being due to the pandemic across SES (Talev, 2020) . Although this result appears counterintuitive, it is supported by the Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory (Wanberg et al., 2020) . The COR theory acknowledges the possibility that in the context of a public event crisis like COVID-19, lower well-being among individuals of higher SES is possible. The COR theory (Hobfoll et al., 2016) is a psychological theory that seeks to explain stress and trauma. The theory posits that humans want and conserve resources to protect their well-being and ease challenges in life. These resources range from valued conditions and situations to personal resources such as self-efficacy and material resources (Hobfoll, 1989) . The theory suggests that when individuals sense that they are losing or in danger of losing valued resources, wellbeing is impacted negatively (Hobfoll, 1989 (Hobfoll, , 2010 . However, reduction in well-being depends on one's perception of how his/her resource contracts in a specific context (Hobfoll, 2010; Hobfoll et al., 2003) . Therefore, loss of well-being is a function of individual perception of the loss. It is, therefore, possible that loss or fear of loss of resources due to COVID-19 may have occurred differentially for individuals of higher and lower SES (Wanberg et al., 2020) .",

Unlike the COR explanation (based on loss or fear of loss of valued resource), the steeling effect suggests that past experiences of adversity may increase resilience to latter adversities by facilitating adaptive functioning. Under both explanations (steeling effect and COR theory), observing worse outcome for individuals with higher SES is plausible. This phenomenon has also been observed in South Africa data, where variables that point to higher SES (non-black race and education) are positively correlated with depressive symptoms for data collected during the pandemic, while the pre-pandemic relationship suggests that poor mental health is concentrated amongst the poor (Mukong et al., 2017; Oyenubi et al., 2021) .",

About a third of the working population in February 2020 have lost their income by April 2020 (Spaull et al., 2020) . Job and income losses disproportionately affect vulnerable workers and those in the bottom half of the prepandemic income distribution (Jain et al., 2020; K\u00f6hler & Bhorat, 2020; Ranchhod & Daniels, 2020) . One can think of the income shock as having two effects on affected workers and their households. For the worker, job loss can give rise to psychological trauma due to loss of identity, purpose and structure of time (Jahoda, 1981) . Further, for the workers and the household that depend on them for livelihood, income loss (or decrease in household income) threatens economic security (Posel et al., 2021; Ting & Kollamparambil, 2015) . Given the high level of inequality in South Africa, the implication of the pandemic induced income shock for households may depend on SES. Households with higher SES will be able to rely on their savings if there is a reduction in household income, suggesting that the negative effect of income loss may be milder than the loss related to identity and structure. On the contrary, the threat to survival (through shock to household income) may be more important than loss of identity and structure for households with lower SES.",

For example, in terms of the steeling effect, the South African labour market is known to exhibit significant churning and labour market churning (even before the pandemic) is higher for earners at the bottom of the earnings distribution (Andrew Kerr, 2018) . This suggests that the adverse condition of losing employment may not be new for individual workers at the bottom end of the earnings distribution. However, the COVID labour market shock meant that many of these workers are affected simultaneously which may have severe implications for household income in poorer households. 5 Such shock might push poorer households further into poverty. Therefore, change in activity status may not be as stressful as the net shock to household income for poorer households. For households at the upper end of the earnings distribution, a change in activity status may be more critical since the negative change in household income due to job loss may not translate into an immediate threat to livelihood.",

Since the COR theory suggests that loss is correlated with reduced perceived control over one's well-being, the reduction in well-being associated with such loss may be higher for someone with a higher SES. For individuals of lower SES, the amount of income loss may not have the same effect because both the income and the loss of wellbeing it represents have always been relatively smaller. Therefore, perceived loss of control may not be comparable across SES. In addition, a substantial part of household income for people of low SES may be coming from transfers like social grants rather than wages. Since the grants were increased substantially at the inception of the lockdown, loss of income from employment may not have the same effect for individuals from low SES backgrounds.",

First, employment status in wave 1 refers to employment in April 2020, while employment status in wave 2 refers to employment in June 2020.

For individuals of higher SES, loss of employment is correlated with a significant increase in depressive symptoms, while a reduction in household income is not. On the other hand, loss of employment is not significant in explaining variation in depressive symptoms for individuals with lower SES, while a decrease in household income is correlated with an increase in depressive symptoms. Consequently, the loss of individual income (as against household income) is more detrimental to mental health for higher SES individuals, while a decrease in household income (as against the loss of individual income) is more detrimental for individuals of lower SES. This is probably because the psychological trauma of job loss, through loss of identity and purpose, overrides the financial consequence of job loss among higher SES individuals. The opposite appears to be the case among lower SES individuals, and hence the protective effect of household income is stronger for individuals that live in poorer households.",

Therefore, consistent with what is suggested by steeling effect (and COR), the loss of control experienced due to job loss by these groups of workers may be smaller than their higher SES counterparts. On the other hand, irrespective of individual loss of income, household income has implications for survival in poor SES households. Therefore individuals of low SES respond more to a decrease in household income than the loss of employment. This result implies that the reversal of the relationship between well-being and socioeconomic factors during a crisis like COVID-19 may be context-specific or depend on the economy's structure in question. High inequality may constitute an enabling environment for this kind of a shock to reverse the relationship prevailing before the shock. This suggests that the increase in social grants implemented by the South African government is important in mitigating the effect of the shock on mental health for poorer households.",

However, our result suggests that this relationship is stronger for individuals with higher SES and may have more to do with the loss of identity, purpose and structure of time or loss of control in terms of uncertainty about the future.

The implication is that the relationship between job loss, decrease in household income and depressive symptoms vary based on SES. The study uses threshold regression to examine the differential relationship between depressive symptoms (measured by PHQ-2) and job/income loss across socioeconomic status in the context of the pandemic.",

This suggests that the reversal in the relationship between well-being and pandemic induced shock (as articulated under the COR theory) may be aided by the labour market structure. High inequality before the pandemic means that the shock will operate through different channels across socioeconomic status. In our case, high inequality in South Africa is a plausible explanation for the observed reversal. In South Africa, loss of individual income and decrease in household income has different implications for affected individuals depending on their SES. For high SES individuals, changes in activity status may not constitute an immediate threat to survival but may lower well-being through other channels (like loss of identity, purpose and structure of time).",

            "text": "Contrary to this, loss of employment for individuals with low SES may be a familiar situation because of the high level of labour market churning that disproportionately affects individuals with low earnings (Andrew Kerr, 2018) . However, when this translates into a significant decrease in household income, it may become a risk factor for psychological distress. Poorer household tends to live in larger groups because this offers considerable economies of scale in the consumption of goods and services (Posel et al., 2020) . The pandemic might disrupt such insurance since it is likely that a larger number of working adults in poorer households will lose their income at the same time (because of lockdown), translating into a significant shock to household income.",
