The six of them drove in a minibus from Athens, in the southeast, to Ioannina in the northwest, via Patras (Figure 1 ). Their tour guides on this fateful journey were Jim Maraganore and John Ioannidis. In part, the mission was to visit the ancestral origin of the alpha-synuclein p.A53T mutation, the first genetic mutation to be associated with familial late-onset parkinsonism. Focused on PD and genetic epidemiology, it was a remarkable journey of scientific discovery. They jointly elected to share that journey with likeminded colleagues around the world and Rejko Kruger coined the name \"GEoPD\" on the minibus. Ever since, one member of the Consortium has elected to host the meeting in a different part of the globe.",

A central part of the meeting is reserved for a \"data blitz\" session that gives members \u223c10 min to highlight unpublished data and seek the help and collaboration of the entire membership. As a first exemplary project, GEoPD assessed the role of alpha-synuclein beyond autosomal dominantly inherited PD and established common regulatory polymorphisms in the SNCA gene as a risk factor for sporadic PD worldwide (3). This first global confirmation of SNCA as a risk factor in sporadic PD was subsequently confirmed by an unbiased approach in the era of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (4).",

These in-person meetings are organized and hosted each year in a different country by one of the members; the first \"official\" meeting was organized in Paris Using the large multi-ethnic clinical and genetic datasets (currently including over 40,000 PD patients and 40,000 controls, mainly of European and Asian origins), multiple advanced analyses are performed to assess emerging mutations or variants associated with PD, and several studies have been published. We have examined the role of \u223c120 LRRK2 coding variants in \u223c15,000 individuals, to implicate frequent substitutions in idiopathic PD and neuroprotection (5) . Additionally, interactions between LRRK2 and PARK16 (RAB7L1; RAB29) variants were not replicated in GEoPD efforts (6) . Similarly, we have not been able to provide any evidence of an interaction of LRRK2 p.R1398H, which has a protective effect, with MAPT or SNCA variants (7). We have also questioned the role of intermediate size repeat expansions in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 (8) ",

Hence, the science is neither convened nor limited by the desires and constraints of funding agencies, nor political influence. This concept provides assurance that each site can jointly own and participate in federated data and sample infrastructure.

To date, most genetic discoveries have been made in Caucasians of European ancestry, but these populations do not include the genetic diversity of different ethnicities worldwide. Identifying new genes, consolidating candidate genes and defining the impact of genetic variability in diverse populations has been a priority for GEoPD since its inception.

However, recent innovations in whole genome sequencing, distributed cloud computing and artificial intelligence promise far greater breakthroughs in medical research discovery. We now have the opportunity to define the joint contribution of all genetic variants, including those of intermediate frequency and modest effect, provided that sample sizes are sufficiently large. The collaborative spirit of the GEoPD consortium strongly supports these larger scale international initiatives. Hence, we have embraced the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) effort, led by Andrew Singleton, supported by the US National Institutes of Health and the recent Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP) initiative, that provides the opportunity to synergize and maximize the precious research contribution of people worldwide, with and without PD.",
