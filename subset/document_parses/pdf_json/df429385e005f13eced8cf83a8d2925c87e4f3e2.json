This lockdown affected significantly the atmospheric pollution levels due to the restrictions of human activities. In the present study, we investigate the evolution of air quality in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, focusing on nine atmospheric pollutants (NO 2 , NO, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , O 3 , VOC, CO, SO 2 , and isoprene). In Lyon, center of the region, the results indicated that NO 2 , NO, and CO levels were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in a decrease in road traffic by 80%. However, O 3 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 were increased by 105%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is explained by the dropping in NO and other gases linked to human activity, which consume ozone. Thus, the increase of solar radiation, sunshine, temperature, and humidity promoted the O 3 formation during the lockdown. Besides, rising temperature enhances the BVOC emissions such as isoprene. In addition, volatile organic component (VOC) and SO 2 remain almost stable and oxidation of these species leads to the formation of ozone and organic aerosol, which also explains the increase in PM during the lockdown. This study shows the contribution of atmospheric photochemistry to air pollution.",

The number of confirmed cases was progressively increased which lead to the announcement of limited safety measures on February 28th. While on March 17th, 2020, the French authority has implemented a nationwide lockdown as a response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 (Pullano et al. 2020) . These strict safety measures have impacted negatively almost all economic activities in the whole world. In contrast, the environment has taken advantage of lockdown as the activities generating pollutants were reduced or suspended such as industrial activities, local transport and travel in and out the home country, and population mobility (Lal et al. 2020) .

Under high wind speed, the dispersion of the pollutant is greater, while, in the lower wind speed is likely for air pollution accumulation. Strong winds can direct a plume to a specific area, thereby concentrating pollution. Rain cleans the atmosphere from several pollutants because the falling water interacts with the pollutants present during its fall and then transform or deposit them on the ground. For nitrogen oxides, leaching is an efficient phenomenon permitting the decrease of NOx concentrations; however, chemical interaction between NO 2 and water leads to the formation of acid rain. Likewise, the particle matter (PM) can be cleaned from the air by the rain. Concerning ozone, despite his very low soluble in water, leaching contributes also to reduce its concentrations. Both high and low temperatures influenced the air atmospheric pollution emissions, formation, and evolution, for example, the volatility of organic species like VOC increase with temperature, which may increase their ratio in the gas phase and thus their condensation and conversion especially into particles (Kourtchev et al. 2016) . Sunshine duration, solar radiation, and relative humidity (RH) can strongly affect atmospheric photochemistry such as O 3 and OH radical formation, and also particle process formation including nucleation, condensation, and growth (Li et al. 2018; Lu et al. 2019a, b) .",

The highest NO 2 , PM 2.5 , and PM 10 levels are recorded in the middle at Rh\u00f4ne and Loire departments, which are characterized by high population and car densities (Anzivino and Venzac 2018) . Nevertheless, only NO 2 levels exceed European limit values (40 \u03bcg/m 3 ), especially in Rh\u00f4ne and Loire departments and in the north of the Ain department. The industrial activities located in the south of the Lyon metropolis contribute significantly to the increase in PM level, either by direct emissions or by VOC conversion via photochemical reactions (Kourtchev et al. 2016; Palm et al. 2016; Sbai et al. 2020) . Thus, sulfate particles can represent a significant amount of PM in the center of the region due to the SO 2 emission by industrial activities located in several areas in the Rh\u00f4ne department (Fig. S2 ). The moderate ozone mass concentration observed in Rh\u00f4ne and Loire departments can be especially due to its consumption by NO 2 because this area is characterized by high levels of NO 2 (Fig.  1 ). The departments affected by the highest O 3 mass concentration are Allier, Cantal, and Puy de D\u00f4me; they are characterized by low population and car density. Moreover, higher solar radiation and sunshine in this area promote the formation of ozone (O 3 ), but stay below European Limit values (120 \u03bcg/ m 3 daily 8 h mean) (European Commission 2019).",

The results indicate an increase of O 3 levels from the beginning of the lockdown (March 17th) and this increase has become clearer on May 18th, especially in the center and south of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. The results show that ozone mass concentration increased by 120.7, 109.5, 105.7, 102.6, 94.4, and 75 .9% in Saint Etienne, Annecy, Lyon, Grenoble, Chambery, and Valence, respectively (Table 1) . This behavior could be attributed to the drastic drop in NO levels (Fig. S4) , which leads to the reduction of the O 3 consumption (Sharma et al. 2020 ). The ozone destruction flux via the main NO X photochemical reactions has been calculated (Table 2) ; the flux has been reduced from 1.51 \u00d7 10 23 (molecule cm \u22123 s \u22121 ) before the lockdown to 6.28 \u00d7 10 22 (molecule cm \u22123 s \u22121 ) during the lockdown, which represent a reduction of 40% of O 3 destruction. This partially explains the increase in ozone during the lockdown. Similar results were found in almost all studies done in worldwide cities Siciliano et al. 2020) . Besides, the significant ozone levels a Average mass concentration for 1 month before lockdown period b Average mass concentration during lockdown period before consecutive rainy days detected in rural areas can be explained by the transport of air masses over long distances from urban areas. In addition, the presence of methane (CH 4 ), an important ozone precursor with a long chemical lifetime (about 9 years), contributes significantly to O 3 formation in rural areas (Atmo 2020b). 24.7, 22.5, 14.9, 11.3, and 4 .5% in Chambery, Valence, Lyon, Grenoble, Annecy, and Saint Etienne, respectively (Table 1) . Residential wood heating which is the main emitter of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in cold weather can contribute to 80% of total particle emissions in this region (Atmo 2020c). Thus, domestic housing could contribute to emissions of PM during the lockdown where the people spent more time confined in their homes, which increases the consumption of wood heating and consequently much PM emission. In addition to primary sources (heating, vehicles exhaust, and industrial activities), numerous secondary sources can also contribute to the PM emission, such as the atmospheric photochemistry Huang et al. 2015; Sbai and Farida 2019a) . The SOA formation is enhanced during the lockdown period (Peng et al. 2015) .",

This clearly shows that O 3 /OH oxidation of VOCs is an important secondary source of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in the metropolitan Lyon. In addition, in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, there are several parks and important forest areas (Fibois 2018) , which may represent an important source of biogenic VOCs (BVOC), which can contribute to the PM formation. In our previous study, we found that urban air in Lyon can effectively contribute to the SOA formation via OH oxidation and ozonolysis (Sbai et al. 2020) . Moreover, Sea salt especially iodine can contribute also to PM formation via OH and O 3 oxidation mainly under high O 3 levels (Saiz-Lopez and Plane 2004; G\u00f3mez Mart\u00edn et al. 2013; Sbai and Farida 2019b) .

Three Fig. 6 Meteorological parameters pattern including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, sun radiation, and sunshine, at Lyon downtown between February 3rd and June 15th, 2020 (the dense area represented lockdown period) pollutants were considered for AQI estimation, including NO 2 , O 3 , and PM 10 . These species are considered as the main indicators of air pollution. For each of these pollutants, a subindex is determined using daily mass concentration between February 3rd and June 15th, the final index corresponding to the highest sub-index. The air quality sub-index associated with O 3 , NO 2 , and PM 10 at Lyon downtown shows that PM 10 represents the main pollutant and the AQI is often attached to the PM 10 mass concentration (Fig. S7 ). In addition, the AQI of the region generally varies between good and moderate, which indicates that there is no possibility of affecting public health. Despite the decrease of NO 2 level, the AQI level is not reduced during the lockdown due to a notable increase in PM.

However, O 3 , PM2.5, and PM10 have increased during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is attributed to the decrease in its titration by NO because the flux of ozone depletion via a photochemical reaction involving NO decreased by 40%. On the other hand, the reduction in ozone consumption by other gases is of anthropic origin. Moreover, weather conditions (temperature, solar radiation, RH, sunshine) have favored the formation of ozone during the lockdown. Thus, the oxidation of VOC and BVOC also can contribute significantly to O 3 and PM formation, because they have not been reduced during the lockdown. The AQI which represents good and moderate categories remains almost stable despite the decrease of NOx because PM and O 3 increase. It is noted that AQI shows that PM 10 is the main pollutant in this region. ",
