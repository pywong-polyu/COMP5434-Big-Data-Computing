            "text": "In December 2019, a pneumonia cluster with unknown etiology was reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China's Hubei province. 1 A distinctive coronavirus was subsequently isolated from patients, which led to the detection of a new beta-corona virus named \"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV 2),\" which caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 2, 3 Within days, health authorities in China confirmed more cases, announced a virus outbreak, and linked its origin to the seafood market of Wuhan. 4 Up to the end of January 2020, other countries also started reporting COVID-19 cases. The WHO Emergency Committee subsequently laid down COVID-19 as an acute respiratory disease and declared it an international public health emergency. 5 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) announced on 2 March 2020 the first COVID-19 case, and the first death was reported on the 24th of March 2020. Fortunately, the KSA has had previous experience managing a similar virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), since 2013. 6 In response to COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC), KSA updated its standard protocol and requirements across the nation. 7 Since then, the Ministry of Health has started 31 health centers in six regions for COVID-19-infected patients that include around 8000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 80,000 hospital beds. 8 In addition to this, 2200 beds have been assigned for isolation of quarantined and suspected cases. 9 The different categories of beds are prepared due to the severity of symptoms of COVID- 19. Evidence to date suggests that having chronic conditions increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 that requires patients to be hospitalized, to be admitted to the ICU, and to be intubated. In addition, data exists regarding the vulnerability of patients who are taking immune suppressors to treat their inflammatory chronic conditions. They are more susceptible to infection by the COVID-19 and tend to develop more severe infections. 10 In Saudi Arabia, a single study was conducted to assess clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. 11 While the study provided a valuable look at the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia, it did not demonstrate the differences in clinical characteristics and the outcomes in terms of the number of chronic conditions.",

The reason may be that they are less likely to get infected or have milder symptoms if infected. Therefore, they might not seek treatment for these cases, which results in lower prevalence and hospitalization of COVID-19 in these age groups.",

            "text": "In our study of COVID-19 patients, we observed an average hospitalization period of 6 to 7 days, whereas, for ICU, it was 9 to 10 days, which is similar to the previously reported studies. 19 The incubation period for COVID-19 is predicted to be a maximum of 14 days, with a median period of 4 to 5 days from exposure to onset of symptoms. [19] [20] [21] Similar findings have been reported for other patients with COVID-19, where a study showed that 97.5% of patients infected with COVID-19 would experience symptoms within 11.5 days from infection. 21 In addition, another study reported median (IQR) 5(3-8.8), 7(3-13.8), 20 (11.8-28), 27 (2-31) respectively for the time (days) from the outbreak of illness to hospital admission, diagnosis, death, and release from hospital. 22 Similar to an earlier study conducted in China, 23 our findings strongly suggest that patients with two or more chronic conditions experienced a poorer prognosis. Length of hospital stay and time in the ICU were significantly longer among patients in this group compared to those in other groups. These findings are not surprising, as it has been shown that chronic conditions have been a strong predictor of worse outcomes among COVID-19 patients according to Italian, US, Swedish, and Spanish surveillance findings. 24 Our data are also in agreement with findings from an observational study that suggests chronic conditions are associated with an increased risk of a more severe infection requiring COVID-19 hospitalization. 25 We also observed a significant difference among the three groups of patients admitted to ICU who used mechanical ventilation. Of patients with two or more chronic conditions, 47.92% received ICU admission, whereas 39.6% received mechanical ventilation. Our findings in this regard are similar to the global estimate percentages. 11 For yet another study reported chronic disease (72.2%) for ICU patients was higher than in non-ICU-admitted patients (37.3%). 26 Patients who had been referred to the ICU had different underlying conditions. In this study, we recorded only two deaths, and these were reported in patients without chronic conditions. Because the study sample and number of deaths are too small, it is difficult to show any effect of the number of chronic conditions on the mortality rate. However, it was reported that the current reported mortality rate for COVID-19 is about 3.4%. 27 A recent influenza disease study indicated that the risk of death from COVID-19 for critical patients with comorbidity was higher compared to patients without chronic conditions. 28 In earlier studies, it has been suggested that the death rate was linked to the older age of patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS. 29 Therefore, in this critical situation, there are certain responsibilities for health policy makers to implement comprehensive measures to protect these populations. In the literature, COVID-19's main symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, and myalgia. 26, 30, 31 Headache, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and nausea are also common. 26 About 75% of patients had pneumonia bilaterally. 32 In this study, fever, dry cough, dyspnea, sore throat, diarrhea, fatigue, and vomiting were the most commonly reported symptoms, whereas runny nose, chest pain, abdominal pain, myalgia, and nausea were relatively rare. Similar results were reported in 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, where patients experienced symptoms like fever, dry cough, myalgia, and fatigue, whereas production of sputum, headaches, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea were found to be less frequent. 19 In patients with chronic conditions, a significant difference has been reported in dyspnea. It is presumed that individuals with chronic conditions are more prone to severe infection; therefore, it has been suggested that the initial onset of dyspnea may indicate a poor prognosis. 33 Non-respiratory symptoms such as palpitation, diarrhea, or headache occasionally appeared before respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection cases is yet to be established since most of the initially asymptomatic infections eventually become symptomatic.",

The data was collected from a single hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; hence, the clinical courses and outcomes cannot be fully extrapolated to the whole population. In addition, the study population may differ from other populations in terms of their culture, prevalence of different clinical characteristics, and chronic conditions, as well as their access to high quality medical service. Second, 80.3% of the study population were non-Saudi, who are known to have a different living style and limited resources; hence, the results may not reflect those for the whole population. Finally, incomplete patient data regarding patient history, laboratory findings, and symptoms could modify the narrative.",
