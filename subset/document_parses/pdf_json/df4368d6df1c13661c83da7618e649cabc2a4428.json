In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.",

The large particles (>5 \u03bcm diameter) are referred to as respiratory droplets and tend to settle down quickly on the ground, usually within one meter of distance. The small particles (<5 \u03bcm in diameter) are referred to as droplet nuclei and are related to an airborne transmission. These particles can remain suspended in the air for longer periods of time and can reach a longer distance from the origin 6 . These small aerosol particles are inhalable and can penetrate all the way down to the alveolar space in the lungs 7 , where cell receptors for some infectious respiratory viruses are located, including .

This spatial configuration represents the well-known North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 23,24 in its positive phase, which is the teleconnection pattern linked to dry conditions in southern Europe whereas the opposite occurs in northern Europe 25 . Figure S2 show maps for February 2020 for several meteorological fields that provide clear evidence of the stable atmospheric circulation in southern Europe, with a tendency towards very dry (i.e., lack of precipitation) and calm conditions. As suggested in an earlier analysis 18 , the SARS-CoV-2 virus seems to be transmitted most effectively in dry conditions with daily mean air temperatures between around 5\u00baC and 11\u00baC, which are the conditions shown in Figure 2 for the major part of Italy and Spain. By contrast, northern Europe has experienced mainly wet and windy conditions due to an anomalous strong westerly circulation that is linked to rainy conditions. These spatial patterns fit with the well-known climate features associated over Europe during positive phases of the NAO 26 .",

Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was already in Europe in early 2020, but it may only have started to extend rapidly when suitable atmospheric conditions for its spread were reached.

To test this hypothesis further we have also analyzed the COVID-19 and meteorological data within Spain (see Data and Methods, Figure S5 ). The results show that mean temperature and specific humidity variables have the strong relation with COVID and fit with an exponential function ( Figure   4 ). They indicate that lower mean temperatures (i.e., average of around 8-11\u00baC) and lower specific humidity (e.g., <6 g/Kg) conditions are related to a higher number of cases and deaths in Spain. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that both meteorological variables are highly correlated (R 2 =0.838, p<0.05) and are not independent of each other. The temperatures as low as 8-10\u00baC are only reached in a few regions such as Madrid, Navarra, La Rioja, Aragon, Castille and Leon and Castilla-La Mancha.

Thus, in the southern regions of Spain (all of them with more than 13\u00baC and higher levels of specific humidity) we found lower rates of infection and deceases. This is in line with the spatial pattern in Italy, with the most (least) affected regions by COVID-19 mainly located in the North (South).

In Spain, a south-north gradient is also reported in the 1918 flu after controlling for demographic factors 31 . The central and northern regions of Spain experienced higher rates of mortality, and this has been suggested to be linked to more favorable climate conditions for influenza transmission as compared to the southern regions 31 . Interestingly, the SLP anomalies of the months before the major wave of this pandemic (which occurred in October-November 1918) shows a clear south-north dipole with positive anomalies in southern Europe centered over the Mediterranean, and negative ones in northern Europe ( Figure S6 ). In other words, the NAO was also in its positive phase just before the major outbreak of the 1918 influenza pandemic. This resembles the spatial .

We have selected the SLP and 500 hPa fields in order to summarize the meteorological conditions over each location, as it is known that several meteorological variables can be involved in the transmission of respiratory viruses 4, 5 . With this approach we also avoid the lack of properly updated data for all potential meteorological variables involved in the COVID-19 spread, which needs further research as soon as the pandemic ends and a more reliable and complete database of both COVID-19 impact and meteorological data can be compiled 6 .",

Taking into consideration current evidences in the literature, it seems that suitable conditions of air temperature and humidity were reached in Northern Italy and inland Spain. Indeed, meteorological conditions can affect the susceptibility of an infected host by altering the mucosal antiviral defense 32 and the stability and transmission of the virus 33 , as well as social contact patterns 34 . We also hypothesize that the anomalous meteorological conditions experienced in Italy and Spain promoted the airborne contagion both indoors and outdoors, in addition to the direct and indirect contact and short-range droplets, which helped to speed up the rates of effective reproductive number (R) of the virus (Figure S7). Equally, the anticyclonic conditions, amplified in some areas by temperature inversions, may have reduced the dispersion of the virus outdoors. This stability and lack of precipitation can also produce more processes of suspension and resuspension of the infected aerosols indoors and, especially, outdoors, in a similar way as resuspension of anthropogenic pollutants in cities 35,36 . Equally, it is also suggested that high atmospheric pollutant concentrations can be positively related to increase fatalities related to respiratory virus infections 37,38 and even COVID-19 39 . This is a relevant issue as the main hotspot of COVID-19 in Italy is located",
