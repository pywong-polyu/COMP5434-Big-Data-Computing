            "text": "Identifying the population structure of the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has significant potential to inform public health management and diagnosis. As SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data accrued, grouping them into clusters is important for organizing the landscape of the population structure of the virus. Due to the limited prior information on the newly emerged coronavirus, we utilized four different clustering algorithms to group 16,873 SARS-CoV-2 strains, which automatically enables the identification of spatial structure for SARS-CoV-2. A total of six distinct genomic clusters were identified using mutation profiles as input features. Comparison of the clustering results reveals that the four algorithms produced highly consistent results, but the state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning clustering algorithm performed best and produced the smallest intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances. The varied proportions of the six clusters within different continents revealed specific geographical distributions. In particular, our analysis found that Oceania was the only continent on which the strains were dispersively distributed into six clusters. In summary, this study provides a concrete framework for the use of clustering methods to study the global population structure of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, clustering methods can be used for future studies of variant population structures in specific regions of these fastgrowing viruses.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2] , and has spread throughout the world. In an effort to understand the molecular characteristics of the virus, viral genomes have been abundantly sequenced and presented at the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). As an emerging virus, it is important to understand the genetic diversity, evolutionary trajectory and possible routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from its natural reservoir to humans. Most studies have looked into the aspects of real-world SARS-CoV-2 evolution and strain diversification through phylogenetic tree [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Phylogenetic tree is a graph that shows the evolutionary relationships among various biological entities based on their genetic closeness [8, 9] . The distances from one entity to the other entities indicate the degree of relationships. However, as population genomic datasets grow in size, simply using pairwise genetic distances cannot present an explicit structure of the total population in phylogenetic analysis. Grouping similar entities into the same cluster and identifying the number of main subtypes (clusters) makes it easier to understand the main characteristics of the population. Traditionally, using the distance matrix and the bifurcations between branches of leaves on the phylogenetic tree, entities can be grouped into clusters. However, when the number of entities becomes large, it is not easy to directly and accurately partition the clades in the phylogenetic tree.",

The average mutation count per genome was 6.99 (Fig. 1A) . The frequency spectrum of substitutions illustrated that more than half (54.05%) of the mutations were singletons and 15.35% were doubletons. The proportion of the mutations below 0.01 was 99.28% (Fig. 1B) . The high percentage of these low-frequency mutations suggested that SARS-CoV-2 occurred recently and displayed a rapidly proliferating pattern [25] . In addition, there were 8,706 unique strains across the 16,873 strains (Fig. 1C) , and most unique strains (7,078) were singletons, yielding high diversity of the virus. In particular, Simpson's diversity index of the strains was 0.8222, indicating that two random strains would have a high probability of being genetically different. The frequency spectrum of substitutions and Simpson's diversity index indicated high genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.",

We first used the aggregated SNP matrix to cluster samples using an unsupervised deep learning clustering algorithm published by Xie et al [19] (see methodology). The unsupervised deep learning clustering algorithm requires one to pre-specify the number of clusters (K), but we have little prior knowledge about the number of subtypes formed by the heterogeneous SARS-CoV-2 genome. To determine the number of clusters, we plotted the curves of the SSE and BIC under different cluster numbers ranging from 2 to 20 (Fig. 2) . We used the elbow method and chose the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters [26] . This approach resulted in K=6 for both the SSE and BIC curves. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we also employed K-means clustering [27] , hierarchical clustering and BIRCH clustering [28, 29] for comparison. The objective of clustering is minimizing intra-cluster distances and maximizing inter-cluster distances. To this end, we did five repetitions for each of the four clustering algorithms and selected the one that achieved the best performance (lowest average intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances). The average intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances in the deep learning clustering algorithm (4.892) was significantly lower than that in K-means (4.896, Pvalue < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), hierarchical clustering (5.062, P-value < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and BIRCH (4.985, P-value < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). We compared the Silhouette score (Fig. 3A) , SSE (Fig. 3B) and BIC (Fig. 3C) of the four algorithms. The deep learning clustering obtained the highest Silhouette score and BIC, and the lowest SSE, indicating that the clustering results of deep learning clustering are better than the other algorithms. In contrast, BIRCH performed the worst of the four algorithms. We aligned the partitions of the six clusters against the phylogenetic tree for the three best methods (Fig. 3D) . The clustering results indicated that the partitions from the three algorithms were similar. The differences between the hierarchical clustering results and the two other clustering results were mainly at the boundary of the clusters. Of the three methods, strains grouped by deep learning clustering and Kmeans were more compact in the phylogenetic tree than those by hierarchical clustering. For example, the strains in both deep learning clustering cluster D and K-means cluster D were split into two clusters using hierarchical clustering. However, such a split was not supported by the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3D) .",
