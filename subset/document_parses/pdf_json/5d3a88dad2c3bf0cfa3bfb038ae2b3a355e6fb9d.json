We retrospectively assessed the utilization pattern of the web-based app using data systematically retrieved from Google Analytics.

The self-assessment test combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale and offers professional contact in the advent of a high level of depression and anxiety; contact is prioritized in accordance with a screening questionnaire administered at the time of obtaining individual consent to be contacted. The tools for emotional self-care can be accessed either on-demand or symptom-driven. The utilization analysis showed a high number of weekly accesses during the first wave. In this period, press releases regarding critical events of the pandemic progression and government decisions on containment measures were followed by a utilization peak, irrespective of the sense (ie, positive or negative) of the information. Positive information pieces (eg, relaxation of containment measures due to a reduction of COVID-19 cases) resulted in a sharp JMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 3 | e27402 | p. 1 https://formative.jmir.org/2022/3/e27402 (page number not for citation purposes) Fidel Kinori et al JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH",

The overloading of the health care system experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak boosted the implementation of various digital health strategies to counteract the collapse of many health resources [9] . To our knowledge, by the time of the nationwide lockdown in our country, no mHealth solutions had been developed for supporting people with mental health needs in a quarantine or lockdown context. Thus, considering the limited access of people to the health care system and the potential of ICT-based solutions to bridge these gaps, we aimed to develop a web-based app platform for supporting emotional management among the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak in our country. The existence of the PTSD Coach app provided us with an opportunity to develop such a web-based app quickly and offer it to the local population timely.",

While not recommended for depression diagnosis or monitoring, it is considered useful for screening for depression, which is the most common psychological conditions in clinical practice and research; individuals who screen positive should be further evaluated with the PHQ-9 to determine whether they meet the criteria for a depressive disorder [18] . The Spanish version of the PHQ-2 has shown good reliability and validity in identifying depressive symptoms in the primary care setting [19] . The GAD-7 was developed for its use in primary care, and it has high sensitivity in identifying symptoms of the anxiety spectrum. The Spanish validation of the questionnaire has shown good reliability and validity [20] . To facilitate self-assessment, the 2 questionnaires were merged into a single questionnaire. The combination of the PHQ-2 and GAD-7 for a joint assessment of anxiety and depression has shown high internal reliability and strong convergent and construct validity when assessing its association with other mental health, quality of life, and disability measures [21] .

The frequency of use of the web-based app was particularly high during the first wave of the outbreak in Spain and progressively declined until reaching a baseline activity below 1000 weekly accesses after halting the national lockdown. During the first wave, the number of accesses peaked after press releases associated with the pandemic progression or changes in the containment measures dictated by the government. Interestingly, positive news (eg, relaxation of social distancing measures) were immediately followed by a sharp increase in utilization and a successive decline. The between-wave and second wave periods were characterized by a less responsive pattern of web-based app users.",

We chose the PTSD Coach app because of the symptom overlapping between PTSD and those reported elsewhere for lockdown situations, particularly regarding anxiety and depression. One of the advantages of the PTSD Coach app was the body of evidence on its effectiveness for self-management of mental health needs. However, owing to the shift in the target population (ie, from people diagnosed with PTSD to the general population), effectiveness of our web-based app cannot be assumed and should be confirmed in future studies. Of note, the complicated scenario in which the web-based app should be assessed will strongly challenge the trial conduct.",

However, because of the negative correlation that often exists between App use or demand and permissions for accessing private data [11] , we were concerned that collecting too much data from users might be a barrier to web-based app utilization. Of note, the government announcement of launching a COVID-19 tracer app raised many privacy concerns among the population and was strongly criticized. In light of this general perception, we prioritized the acceptability of the web-based app over the capacity of collecting personal information. As a result, our database for the retrospective analysis lacked important information that might have helped to understand behavior patterns among users. One of the most remarkable consequences of this limitation is the lack of data at a user level, which precludes discriminating between entries of new users and regular access of the same user. More importantly, the lack of historical records of users prevents us from analyzing improvement or worsening of mental health state. Finally, we could not analyze the usage of the web-based app in accordance with socioeconomic status, which has been highlighted as a source of inequality in other aspects associated with access to COVID-19 resources [22, 23] . Nevertheless, while all these limitations compromise analytical approaches of the web-based app, the absence of personal questions and no need for signing in are likely to promote the platform use, in line with the overarching goal of the project, which was to help the population during the stressful circumstances of the lockdown.",

Although the PTSD Coach app was designed as adjuvant to face-to-face therapy for PTSD, its authors suggested that it could also help people not receiving psychological treatment [24, 25] .

It is worth noticing, however, our finding that self-assessment tests more often scored priority levels 1 or 2 during the between-wave and second wave periods suggests that people with higher mental health needs were more likely to retain the usage of the web-based app after the first wave.",
