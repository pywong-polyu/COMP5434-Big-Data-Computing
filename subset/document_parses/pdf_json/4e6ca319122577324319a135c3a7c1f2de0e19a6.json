            "text": "During the last decade, vitamin D (Vit D) has maintained and attracted higher levels of interest in biomedical and health researchers more than all other micronutrients. 1, 2 It is well known that Vit D plays a vital role in the homeostasis of calcium and phosphate as well as in bone mineralization and skeletal development. 3 In addition, recent research has established links between low levels of Vit D and various chronic disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and malignancies. 4 Vit D deficiency was highly prevalent in adult populations within Saudi Arabia. 5 A meta-analysis conducted in 2018, which included a cumulative sample of 1910 participants, concluded that hypovitaminosis D among Saudi women of childbearing age had a prevalence of 77.4%. 6 Importantly, the hot climate in Saudi Arabia limits outdoor activities during the day, and modern lifestyles focus on indoor sedentary activities, so Saudi adults often have a relatively low dietary intake of Vit D. 7, 8 This low intake of Vit D may be related to their frequent consumption of energy-dense foods, such as soft drinks and fast foods which are poor in Vit D, 9 while they have low consumption of healthy foods that contain reasonable amounts of Vit D, such as fatty fish (tuna, salmon and mackerel) 10 and dairy products fortified with Vit D. 9, 11 Additionally, sun avoidance is common in Saudi Arabia among women due to cultural reasons related to dress style, which tends to be usually dark and covers the entire body, 12 and aesthetic choices, as women commonly use sun blockers, since they prefer fair skin rather than suntanned skin. 13, 14 The COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions and has led to the largest economic collapse around the globe. 15 Therefore, an urgent need exists for therapeutic strategies to predict and understand risk factors for contracting the infection for better outcomes thereafter.",

            "text": "Locally, COVID-19 has infected a total of 547.262 patients with total mortality of 8.724 cases by the time of writing this paper (October 2021), according to the Saudi Ministry of Health registry. 16 There are many established risk factors for COVID-19. Currently, Vit D status has been identified as a potentially achievable supplement in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. 17 The immunoregulatory properties of Vit D in respiratory viral infections are induced via enhancing the levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 and Interferon in respiratory epithelium, recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, reducing viral replication strengthening of epithelial cell junction integrity and reducing the cytokine storm induced by the adaptive immune response as well as innate immune system. 18, 19 As aforementioned, some studies demonstrated a significant correlation between Vit D and COVID-19 cases and its related outcomes, 18, 20 while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. 21, 22 Yet, there is insufficient evidence on the association between COVID-19 severity or outcomes and Vit D levels. 23 The effect of Vit D supplementation, however, was not established. 24 A recent meta-analysis, which included a total of 25 randomized control studies, showed that intake of Vit D supplements decreased the possibility of having acute respiratory tract infections. 25 The studies which continued to be carried out regarding role of Vit D in severity and outcomes of COVID-19 demonstrated that Vit D supplementation could reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection and boost the immune function in Vit D deficient patients. 26 Nowadays, available data are controversial in this regard, and the most ideal regimen of supplementation advised has not yet been determined. 27, 28 The worldwide spread of the pandemic of COVID-19 infection has resulted in an increase in Vit D supplementation. This practice lacks adequate support of studies at the time being, mainly supported by speculations about presumed mechanisms of action. 25 Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between Vit D levels and the severity or outcomes of COVID-19 disease.",

A local study reported that Vit D deficiency was found to be a predictor for COVID-19 mortality; at the same time, this study failed to find a significant association between Vit D status with COVID-19 infection. 36 However, this study did not adjust for other comorbidities while running the statistical tests. A study conducted in India found a lower level of Vit D in severe COVID-19 patients. 37 However, this study did not define the criteria for severity. In our work, we had assessed the severity of COVID-19 based on well-reported clinical and paraclinical parameters. 2 ",

However, this small study did not define the low level of Vit D and did not control the confounders. 38 According to researchers, the reported relationship between Vit D level and the severity or mortality of COVID-19 infection may be confounded due to factors difficult to manage for even with advanced statistical adjustments, such as quality of health services, socioeconomic status, or preexisting medical comorbidities associated with lower Vit D status, 24,31 as well as the reverse causation bias accompanied the rapid publication process 24 and the small sample size or unblinded intervention. 27 Even the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition could not find sufficient facts to recommend Vit D supplementation in patients with acute pulmonary infection. 39 The relationship between Vit D level and viral infection was well reported. 40 Several observational studies have shown a positive association between Vit D deficiency or insufficiency and COVID-19 infection severity or better outcomes. 41, 42 One of the hallmarks of COVID-19 infection severity is the huge secretion of inflammatory cytokines known as a \"cytokine storm\". 43 According to a previous report showing that respiratory illnesses are associated with dysregulated Vit D metabolism, suggesting the possibility of Vit D deficiency as a consequence of pulmonary inflammation. 44 CRP is a sensitive non-specific biomarker of the acutephase response in infection, inflammation and tissue damage that could be utilized as an inflammation indicator. 45 Our data did not detect higher concentrations of CRP in the Vit D deficiency group when compared to the other two groups. However, this observation can be explained either by the fact that an elevated level of CRP could be seen mainly in the early stages of COVID19 infection in non-severe individuals and before the medical intervention, 46, 47 or due to the effect of sample size and other preexisting comorbidities on results. 27, 48 Since the onset of the COVID-19 infection outbreak, various research has been published, and there have been more meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the available evidence on the course of the disease and its related risk factors, but all previous researches have concluded that there is still a lack of strong evidence to support the direct role of Vit D and the severity or outcomes of COVID-19 infection. 49 ",
