[1] [2] [3] [4] Reportedly, the acquisition of antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patients is also inferior to that in healthy individuals. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In particular, patients with B-cell malignancies who have been treated with anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics or Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors present much lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after vaccination, and the rate of antibody acquisition correlates inversely with the interval between discontinuation of the drugs and vaccination. 8, 11, 12 However, there is still limited information about the conditions under which such patients might acquire antibodies after vaccination. In this study, we conducted a prospective observation study (UMIN 000045150) to evaluate antibody titers achieved after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with hematological diseases, focusing on peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and gamma globulin levels, to evaluate the response and search for markers that predict the response. Blood samples were harvested after obtaining appropriate informed consent from all the participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Next, we examined the relationship between duration since the last administration and acquired antibody titers in BCL patients who received anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics (N=82) (Figure 1B) . Patients within 10 months since the last dose of anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics tended to have more difficulty in acquiring antibodies than those with an interval of more than 10 months, which was consistent with previous reports. 8, 11 Additionally, in our cohort, 37.8% of the patients beyond 12 months after antibody treatment (N=37) did not mount an antibody response following vaccination (Figure 1B) . Based on these results, the factors involved in antibody response after vaccination among patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies were examined in detail, focusing on blood cell counts, including lymphocyte subsets, and globulin levels at the time of vaccination ( Figure S2 , Table S4 ). The results showed that the numbers of CD19-and CD4-positive cells in peripheral blood and serum IgM titer correlated significantly with the acquired antibody titer. These trends were also seen in patients with hematologic diseases overall, but were particularly pronounced in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics (Table S5) anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers (r=0.844, p<0.001), with 0% antibody gain at a titer of <20/\u00b5L and 76.7% gain at >20/\u00b5L ( Figure 1C ). In addition, CD4-positive cell counts of more than 320/\u03bcL and IgM levels of more than 20 mg/dL also significantly correlated with increased antibody titers (Figure 1D, E) , although the correlation coefficient was lower than that of CD19-positive cell count.",

In particular, patients after the use of anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics are less much likely to benefit from vaccination than other patients, a finding that emphasizes the need for an objective marker that can guide vaccination practice in this special population. Our analysis suggests that the number of CD19-positive cells in peripheral blood might be a useful marker to predict the likelihood of an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with hematological diseases. Furthermore, serum IgM levels might be useful as an alternative indicator in cases where subset analysis is difficult. One finding of this study that requires attention is that some patients who did not show low levels of CD19, CD4 or IgM also failed to acquire sufficient antibody titers following vaccination (Figures S2 and S4) . Although lymphocyte function and/or other related mechanisms are also thought to be important for antibody acquisition, we did not analyze these functions in individual cases in this study, and this is an issue for further study.

The primary endpoint was the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit 1 conjugated IgG antibody approximately 14-28 days after administration of the second vaccine dose.13 Secondary endpoints included the association between the acquired antibody titer and diagnosis of hematological diseases, treatment strategy, duration from the last treatment, blood cell counts, including lymphocyte subset at the time of vaccination, and serum immunoglobulin levels. Since the lowest antibody titer obtained after the second dose in healthy subjects (N=41) was 21.3 U/mL in this cohort, and all but one of the healthy volunteers in a previous study (N=219) at Fujita Health University showed an antibody titer of 20 U/mL or higher (manuscript submitted byFujigaki et al.), an antibody titer of 20 U/mL or higher was used as the cut-off to define a positive antibody response after vaccination in this study. The protocol for the experimental use of patient samples was approved by the institutional review board of Fujita Health University (HM21-067 and HM21-179).",
