            "text": "Polymeric materials have drastically changed the society in the last century. However, their nonrenewable origin, together with their indiscriminate use and disposal, resulted in a huge accumulation of waste in the environment and raised a wide discussion about the emission of greenhouse gases, which must be considerably reduced to minimize global warming. Thus, the establishment of a consolidated production of polymers prioritizing the use of renewable sources of raw materials became a hot research topic. Vegetable oils are protagonists of this initiative, and their carbon-carbon double bonds are convenient reactive sites for chain growth polymerization reactions. However, typical vegetable oil-based homopolymers often do not display competitive thermomechanical properties, and the preparation of the corresponding copolymers and composites is therefore an interesting alternative strategy. Herein, the preparation of composites based on a tung oil/furfuryl alcohol co-continuous network reinforced with bacterial cellulose fibers is described. For this purpose, the cellulose nanofibers were suspended in furfuryl alcohol, and different amounts of the ensuing suspension were mixed with tung oil in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as cationic initiator. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of all samples indicated the association of both tung oil and furfuryl alcohol in the final materials, with peaks belonging to cellulose superposed at the fingerprint regions of composites. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry demonstrated an interesting relationship between the composition and the corresponding thermal properties, and the morphology of the materials was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed a homogeneous distribution of cellulosic fibers at lower concentrations. The results gathered here contribute to the development of original macromolecular materials exclusively based on the renewable platform.",

The consolidation of this strategy is now boosted by widespread discussions on how polymers should advance in a sustainable society based on a circular economy (Kawashima et al. 2019) . Also, it contributes to a significant reduction in environmental impacts and opens the way for the preparation of materials with original microstructures and unprecedented properties. An efficient conversion of vegetable biomass into monomers and polymers, together with a correct and reduced disposal of wastes, have sparked the search for more sustainable polymeric materials (John et al. 2019; Gandini et al. 2016; Gandini and Lacerda, 2015) . In fact, the large-scale production of biobased polymers using consolidated technologies, or those under advanced development, which is the case of biobased ethylene, ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, are strong realities of such a trend (Hillmyer 2017) .",

To pursue novel polymers from vegetable oils, different approaches are possible, including, among others, the breakdown of triglycerides by transesterification processes and the chemical modification of the fatty acids' double bonds by means of metathesis, epoxidation and click reactions. The various possibilities in this regard lead to the production of macromolecular materials with interesting properties and applications, such as thermosets, linear polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, and their blends and composites (Conti Silva et al. 2021; Quirino et al. 2021; Di Mauro et al. 2021; Mucci et al. 2020; Chakraborty and Chatterjee 2020; Lom\u00e8ge et al. 2019 ).

            "text": "The use of tung oil for the synthesis of polymers is, however, much more promising in terms of the possibilities to develop smart functional materials that can be useful for a wide domain of applications. The three conjugated double bonds of its main fatty acid allow the occurrence of oxidopolymerization, a reaction with atmospheric oxygen that naturally converts the triglyceride into a crosslinked polymer, which is particularly useful in the domain of paints and varnishes. The highly unsaturated backbone also makes it promptly reactive to chain-growth polymerizations (Sharma and Kundu 2006) , as the occurrence of resonance stabilizes the intermediates involved in the process. The curing mechanism of tung oil under UV irradiation was investigated (Huang et al. 2018) , which involved the contributions of both oxidative and free radical polymerization. Tung oil was also submitted to cationic polymerization reactions within a wide strategy involving its homopolymerization (Hondred et al. 2014a, b) and its association with other reactive counterparts for the synthesis of copolymers (Madbouly et al. 2014; Sibaja et al. 2014) . In these and other cases reported in the literature, BF 3 was used as initiator, in conditions often involving relatively high temperatures and oxidant atmosphere. More recently, the cationic polymerization mechanism of tung oil fatty acid methyl ester (methyl a-eleostearate) initiated by a triarylsulfonium salt was investigated (Huang et al. 2019) . Again, the authors reported the utilization of high temperatures and UV irradiation to achieve high conversions. The lack of available information and experimental evidences about the mechanisms involved in the cationic polymerization of tung oil motivated a systematic study, using trifluoroacetic acid as initiator under a nitrogen atmosphere . The homopolymerization of tung oil leads to highly flexible materials with limited performance, and the use of comonomers can provide improved stiffness to the final polymers. Styrene and divinylbenzene are often the choice in this case (Meiorin et al. 2015; Hondred et al. 2014a, b) , giving materials with broader potential applications. Similar effects can be achieved by using furan derivatives as comonomers, since furfuryl alcohol and furan resins can be polymerized by acid catalysis to provide infusible solid products with high hardness, flexural strength, and chemical resistance. Recently, the copolymerization reaction of crude tung oil and furfuryl methacrylate initiated by benzoyl peroxide under an inert atmosphere was described, and the final networks were obtained in a second step based on the unusual Diels-Alder click reaction between pendant furan moieties and residual conjugated double bonds of tung oil, which was performed under high pressure and high temperature (Sain et al. 2020a) . The same authors applied the ensuing networks as matrixes to produce biocomposites reinforced with onion-skin-extracted cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals (Sain et al. 2020b) .",

A heat treatment was performed on tung oil at 100-200\u00b0C to modify bamboo materials, and the synergistic effects of tung oil and heat treatment on the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of these composites were investigated (Tang et al. 2019) .

Herein, a fully renewable composite material based on the cationic polymerization of tung oil and furfuryl alcohol in the presence of bacterial cellulose is investigated with the aim of chemically combining hard and soft networks incorporating a stiffening nanofiber (Gallegos et al. 2016) and thus being able to modulating its properties as a function of its composition. Given the rapid homopolymerization of furfuryl alcohol in acid conditions (Choura et al. 1996) , trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), an acid of moderate strength (pKa = 0.23), was used as cationic initiator. For this purpose, bacterial cellulose nanofibers were suspended for the first time in furfuryl alcohol, which is a very interesting strategy in this case considering (1) the incompatibility of water with the cationic mechanism, (2) the complete miscibility of water and furfuryl alcohol in all proportions, which avoids the need of an intermediate solvent for drying the nanofibers, and (3) the fact that furfuryl alcohol itself is one of the two comonomers involved in the synthesis of the copolymer matrix. Also, as recently reported, the preparation of composites based on tung oil and cellulose fibers, which respectively correspond to continuous and discontinuous phases of very different polarities, must be carried out in such a way as to favor the matrixreinforcement compatibility, leading to materials of improved properties (Murawski and Quirino 2019) . Therefore, considering the polymerization mechanism and the final structures of the copolymers that constitute the continuous phase of the composites prepared here (Ribeiro et al. 2020) , furfuryl alcohol could act as an additional compatibilization agent in this case (Fig. 2) , since the presence of ester groups in general triglycerides may intervene synergically. The development of these original materials may contribute to the advancement of fully renewable materials with tunable properties.",

However, the suspension of bacterial cellulose (BC) in furfuryl alcohol corresponds to a strategy that was not previously reported in the literature. BC was obtained from kombucha tea culture (Dufresne and Farnworth 2000) . As culture medium, a 1 L solution containing 20 g of sucrose, 20 mL of commercial vinegar (nominal acetic acid concentration of 5% v/v), and commercial black tea extract (20 g) was used. A membrane containing the cellulose producing microorganisms was immersed in the culture medium, and static fermentation was conducted for approximately 7 days, when it was possible to observe the presence of a floating thick cellulosic membrane on the surface. The membrane was purified in a 0.1 M NaOH solution, at 60\u00b0C, for 30-60 min, washed with distillated water until constant pH, and the fibers were dispersed in water with an UltraTurrax apparatus (IKA T25), giving a suspension of approximately 1 wt%. The cellulosic nature of the material was confirmed by comparing the FTIR spectra of the dried nanofibers with commercial microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel), using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer (Spectrum GX), working in a transmission mode. Sample pellets were prepared with KBr (spectroscopic grade), kept in an oven at 105\u00b0C for 60 min. For solvent exchange of cellulose suspensions, sequences of centrifugation, removal of the supernatant, addition of furfuryl alcohol and re-suspension of fibers were conducted (Johansson et al. 2011) . Since water and furfuryl alcohol are miscible in all proportions, the use of an intermediate solvent (such as acetone) was not necessary. These steps were repeated ten times to assure the total removal of moisture.",

The gels were then re-suspended in chloroform, and the acid was neutralized with triethylamine under vigorous magnetic stirring. The choice of triethylamine was made based on its ability to efficiently neutralize acids of moderate strength, such as trifluoroacetic acid and acetic acid (Barrow and Yerger 1954) , in non-dissociating solvents, forming a stable ion-pair. The insoluble fraction was isolated by filtration and extracted with dichloromethane in a Soxhlet system to remove unreacted monomers, soluble oligomers, and triethylammonium salts. Both copolymers (CP1-CP3) and composites (CPST1-CPST8) were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR/ATR), thermal analysis (TGA and DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (FEG/SEM). Figure 3 shows the FTIR spectra and SEM micrograph of isolated bacterial cellulose fibers. For the FTIR analysis, commercial microcrystalline cellulose was used for comparison purposes. There is a coincidence between the bands presented in the two cases (Fig. 3  a) , which appear at the same wavenumbers but with different relative intensities. Typical cellulose bands are found at (1) 3000-3600 cm -1 , from the O-H stretch of glucopyranose hydroxyls; (2) 2900 cm -1 , from C-H bonds stretching; (3) between 1050 and 1100 cm -1 , associated with vibrations of C-O bonds; and (4) around 700 cm -1 , related to vibrations of C-H and H-C-H bonds. In contrast to microcrystalline cellulose, the relative intensity of the band corresponding to hydroxyl group in the region of 4000-3000 cm -1 was lower with respect to the C-H bond stretching at 2900 cm -1 for the spectra of bacterial cellulose fibers, which may be due to the higher number of hydroxyl groups participating in strong hydrogen bonds in the bacterial cellulose sample (El-Saied et al. 2008; Levdik et al. 1967) . The main peaks between 2000 and 500 cm -1 are related to the axial disposition of the anomeric hydrogen atom in \u00df-glucopyranose unit, which leads to Van der Waals interaction with the axial hydrogen on C 5 , increasing the frequency of the deformation vibration involving C 1 -H (Higgins et al. 1961) . Also, it is important to mention the presence of a band in 1723 cm -1 , from ester carbonyls, in the sample of bacterial cellulose, which may be due to contamination of cells or protein residues (Fuller et al. 2018) . It is possible that even after the purification step, there were still cells (or cell debris) left in the membranes. The morphology of the nanofibers (Fig. 3b ) is in accordance with other SEM micrographs of bacterial cellulose reported in the literature (Gandini et al. 2016; Gomes et al. 2013) , with fibrils of long length and nanometric diameter. Typically, the diameter of bacterial cellulose fibers ranges from 20 to 100 nm (Manoukian et al. 2019 ), giving their well-known high aspect ratio.",

Tung oil typically present peaks (cm -1 ) at 3014, 1640, and 991, which correspond, respectively, to sp 2 C-H stretch, C=C stretch and =C-H out of plane bending of the three conjugated unsaturations of the fatty acid . The furfuryl alcohol-based resins, on the other hand, show peaks at 3450 cm -1 , from the -OH stretch, 2980 cm -1 , which suggests the presence of methyl groups, 1715 cm -1 , typical of carbonyl groups, suggesting the occurrence of some ring-opening induced by the acidic medium in the presence of the Fig. 3 a FTIR spectra of purified bacterial cellulose (black line) and microcrystalline cellulose (blue line); b SEM micrograph of purified bacterial cellulose nanofibers accumulated condensation water, and 793 cm -1 , characteristic of 2,5-disubstituted furan rings (Choura et al. 1996) . It is important to mention that, as previously indicated, the polymerization was initiated with tung oil alone to favor the formation of tung oil oligomers prior to the addition of furfuryl alcohol. The absence of a band at around 3014 cm -1 , from C=C-H stretching vibrations, suggests a high consumption of the double bonds through the incorporation of tung oil monomers into the copolymer chains Ribeiro et al. 2020) . Composites CPST1-CPST8 were prepared with different contents of bacterial cellulose nanofibers suspended in furfuryl alcohol with respect to tung oil ( Table 1 ). The presence of peaks coming from tung oil and furfuryl alcohol polymers in all samples was again observed. In the spectra of samples CPST1-CPST3, prepared with lower concentrations of furfuryl alcohol/bacterial cellulose, it was not possible to identify bands attributable to cellulose chains. When higher concentrations of the suspension were however employed (CPST4-CPST8), the contribution of bands from the segments of furfuryl alcohol resin became more significant (Ribeiro et al. 2020) , leading to bands superposition at the fingerprint regions, thus covering the peaks belonging to cellulose. Figures 6 and 7 show the results of DSC and TGA analyses, separately for copolymers (CP1-CP3) and composites (CPST1-CPST8). All DSC measurements were conducted with two cycles of heating/cooling, with temperatures ranging from -70 to 250\u00b0C at a rate of 10\u00b0C min -1 , and the DSC curves shown here correspond to the second heating in all instances.",

Assuming that the experimental conditions involve relatively fast heating and cooling rates (10\u00b0C min -1 ), it is possible that residual water molecules do not have enough time to diffuse and remain trapped into the gel, appearing on the second heating as well.

This result was expected considering the concentrations of bacterial cellulose/furfuryl alcohol suspension tested, that were not high enough to provide a strong increase in the rigidity to the final materials. The composites CPST4-CPST8, bearing progressively higher amounts of furfuryl alcohol, exhibited again the melting ice endothermic peak near 0\u00b0C, whose magnitude increased, as expected, as this amount was increased because of the correspondingly higher amount of condensation water released. In the second part of these curves, broad glass transitions appeared, which increased from about 60\u00b0C for the lower, to 105\u00b0C for the highest amount of bacterial cellulose/furfuryl alcohol used in the original compositions with tung oil, reflecting the expected more substantial stiffening effect brought about by progressively higher presence of both the furan polymer in the co-network and the nanocellulose content. Interestingly, all these DSC tracings displayed a single glass transition which varied as a function of tung oil-furfuryl alcohol composition, strongly suggesting that the two monomers had generated crosslinked materials in which the corresponding polymers were linked covalently in a single three-dimensional architecture. This important conclusion was confirmed by the SEM results discussed below.",

On the other hand, the other set of copolymers prepared with higher amounts of the bacterial cellulose/furfuryl alcohol suspension (CPST4-CPST8) exhibited an interesting pattern that was directly related to the contribution of the furfuryl alcohol resin, as already observed in a previous study on the tung oil-furfuryl alcohol cationic copolymerization [29] .

The copolymers CP1, CP2 and CP3 exhibited a compact, homogeneous and dense morphology, which indicated the formation of a continuous co-network, with no phase separation. The presence of some micrometric fragments on the materials surface was also observed (as highlighted with a black narrow in Fig. 8a ). EDS analysis did not show any difference in the chemical compositions of the fragments. It was already possible to observe the presence of fibers in samples CPST2 and CPST3 (Figs. 8e and f highlighted with black arrows) with diameters in accordance with bacterial cellulose morphology [36] . Despite the difference in polarity between cellulose and plant oil-based polymers, the adhesion of the continuous phase to the surface of cellulose was clearly established, most probably thanks to the initial fiber impregnation with furfuryl alcohol and to the presence of its polymer, despite its low concentration. Figure 9 shows surface micrographs of composites CPST4-CPST8. In all cases, it was possible to observe the presence of a continuous compact matrix together with regions containing cellulosic fibers with a rather low degree of dispersion. This phenomenon was more striking for samples containing higher amounts of bacterial cellulose/furfuryl alcohol suspension, which can be due, on the one hand, to the known tendency of self-assembling of nanocellulose fibers, mainly when high concentrations are involved, and on the other hand, to the fact that higher contents of furfuryl alcohol favored its fast resinification, which hindered a homogeneous dispersion of the nanofibers in the final materials. This non-uniformity of the samples, consisting of a nanoccelulose-rich part and a resin-rich part was previously reported for similar materials [21] , and may negatively impact the mechanical performance of the composites. However, it is also worth reemphasizing the good matrix-fibers compatibility, as indicated by the high adhesion between the phases.

These novel composite materials were, therefore, successfully developed involving three very different building blocks bearing the important commonality of vegetable biomass origin and thus carrying an important sustainability connotation. For this purpose, bacterial cellulose fibers were dispersed, for the first time, in furfuryl alcohol, which paved the way to an in-situ building of the final materials with varying compositions. The results demonstrated the feasibility of such approach, and the characterization by spectroscopic, thermal, and surface morphology inspections provided evidence for the formation of a covalently bound co-network matrix and for full compatibility between matrix and filler, as well as for the possibility of modulating their properties as a function of the soft/hard component content. These encouraging results are however preliminary, and the optimized conditions needed to achieve an improved dispersion of the nanofibers, as well as the assessment of the ensuing mechanical properties are in progress, regrettably slowed down considerably by the constraints imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic.",
