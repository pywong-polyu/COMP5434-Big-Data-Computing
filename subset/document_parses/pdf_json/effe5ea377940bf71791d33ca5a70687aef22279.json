The sample group consisted of 231 patients hospitalized in medical and surgical ICUs and agreed to participate in the study. The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 25. The average age of the patients was 53.67 \u00b1 13.3, 55.4% were male, 47.6% were high school graduates, and 45.5% were followed up in the COVID-19 ICU. It was also found that there was a negative and moderate degree of correlation between the Intensive Care Experience Scale (ICES) and the Intensive Care Unit Environmental Stressors Scale (ICUESS). Environmental stressors in ICUs are associated with patient experiences. It is clear that ICU stressors create a negative perception in the patient and this situation is emotionally exhausting.",

            "text": "Factors causing stress in the ICU lead to the emergence of sensory changes such as sensory overload, sensory deprivation, and perceptual deprivation in patients and the development of Intensive Care Syndrome (6, 7) . Physiological problems caused by stress include tachypnea, high blood pressure, hypothermia, vasoconstriction, increased sympathetic nerve activity, and decreased tissue perfusion (8) . Sedatives and opioids used to control stress cause respiratory depression and impaired consciousness (9) (10) (11) . In addition to these problems, problems such as insomnia and disorientation of time and place may occur in patients hospitalized in ICUs (3) . The stress and related disorders experienced by patients in the ICU may have a negative effect on the health of the individual, causing the patient to prolong the healing process and increase the duration of hospital stay. COVID-19, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, is a deadly disease that emerged in Wuhan, China toward the end of 2019, caused a global pandemic and continues to feel its overwhelming effects (12) (13) (14) . Although various vaccines have been produced, the number of patients treated in intensive care is substantial. Studies on the experience of patients in intensive care are limited. ICU patients have to face a difficult and stressful process when they least expect it. The injuries inflicted on the soul and body of the physical and psychological difficulties of staying in the ICU are often not noticed. The patient faces these challenges alone and most patients cannot forget the ICU experience. We wanted to determine the level of negativity of the ICU experience, in addition to reveal the relationship between the negative ICU experience and the severity of environmental stressors. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of environmental stressors on patients' intensive care experiences in medical, surgical, and COVID-19 ICUs.",

ICUESS measured the severity of the stress created by all these factors. Stress expresses negativity, while experience can be positive or negative (15) . While the stress felt in the ICU creates a negative experience, low or manageable stress can lead to compliance of care and a positive experience. With ICES, we determined what kind of experience the patients had in the ICU (18) . In our study, environmental stressors were found to be effective in negating intensive care experiences. Good care provided in the hospital, gradual recovery, and meeting patient expectations are the factors that make the ICU experience positive. In our study, a high experience score may be associated with patient satisfaction. In our study, the ICES score of COVID-19 patients was found to be higher than the patients hospitalized in the medical and surgical ICU. In the environmental awareness subdimension, the score of COVID-19 patients was higher. The environmental stressors they perceived were the same as in the other patients.",

As a result of the post hoc analysis, it was determined that the difference was due to the higher average score of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to others. Environmental stressor scores may have been found to be higher than at other times, as the COVID-19 pandemic process in which our study was conducted created extra stress in patients. Our study is single center. The variables of satisfaction, pain, and anxiety, which are effective in increasing the patient experience, were not controlled. All this was accepted as a principle of limitation. The fact that the data of the study was collected during the COVID-19 process has an important place in the fact that ICU patients are exposed to high stress. This study gives an idea that the patient experience can be positive despite high stress. Our work will pave the way for future studies to reduce stress and turn experiences into positive ones.",

It is of great importance to organize the patient's environment according to stressors, to take precautions, and to manage pain. It is very important to evaluate the needs of intubated patients frequently, to sedate them appropriately by considering the physician's recommendations, and to relieve their pain.
