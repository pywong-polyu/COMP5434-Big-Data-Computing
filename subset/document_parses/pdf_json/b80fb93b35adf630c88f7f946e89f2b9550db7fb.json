Pandemic-related social distancing measures have been largely successful in protecting physical health (Hellewell et al., 2020) yet, the long-term impact on mental health is anticipated to be largely negative (Holmes et al., 2020) . Fear can be a normal and adaptive response when facing an outbreak of a highly contagious virus, but psychological distress can be exacerbated in response to restricted social contact (Brooks et al., 2020) . Objective and perceived social isolation or loneliness are both robustly associated with psychological distress (Luo et al., 2012; Menec et al., 2020) . While social support is an established protective factor for psychological wellbeing (Cruwys et al., 2013) , current social distancing measures can mean a lack of access to these networks for many. Thus, restricted access to social networks during the COVID-19 increases the risk of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms in the general population.",

Government mandated social distancing measures are typically defined in terms of objective characteristics (number of social contacts), while subjective or \"perceived\" isolation, is defined as a painful feeling of being alone (Cacioppo and Cacioppo, 2014) . Literature shows when individuals experience a combination of objective and perceived social isolation this is related to higher levels of psychological distress compared to those who were either isolated or lonely (Menec et al., 2020) . Early research collected during COVID-19 supports previous empirical evidence that adults isolating were reporting moderate to severe anxiety levels, which dominated thoughts and impaired normal functioning (Qiu et al., 2020) . Further research is needed to evaluate psychological distress in response to social distancing measures as the current pandemic continues to impact lives on a global scale.",

            "text": "Psychological distress in general populations may stabilise overtime as individuals adapt to pandemic-related measures. Literature from the current and previous pandemics observed patterns in psychological distress in the general population stabilise after several months or postpandemic (Brooks et al., 2020; Chua et al., 2004) . During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea, a study found 7.6% of individuals who were isolating reported Generalised Anxiety Symptoms (GAD) whilst in isolation, which then dropped to a relatively normal population level of 3% six months post-isolation (Jeong et al., 2016) . Comparably, longitudinal research during COVID-19 found moderate to high depression and anxiety symptoms declined to relatively normal population levels over a four-month period (Shelvin, 2021) . In contrast, psychological distress remained high for those who were lonely or had a history of mental illness (Bu et al., 2020; Jeong et al., 2016) . One reason for this may be the increased difficulty in accessing professional mental health support during a pandemic (Whaibeh et al., 2020) . Heterogeneity in patterns of psychological distress in the empirical evidence indicates while most individuals adapt to brief periods of social isolation overtime, vulnerable groups continue to face challenges. It is therefore necessary to identify possible protective factors for mental health during longer periods of social isolation both for the general population and vulnerable groups.",

Mindfulness is a broad term used to describe both a trait that varies in levels across individuals and a state that can be enhanced with practice (Sovereign and Walker, 2021; Spijkerman et al., 2016) . A leading definition of mindfulness within psychological literature is a mental state or trait where full attention is given to an experience in the present moment and without judgment (Kabat-Zinn, 2003) . There has been considerable empirical support for the association between both state and trait mindfulness and improved wellbeing in both clinical and non-clinical populations (Basso et al., 2019; Dolatyar and Walker, 2020; McKay and Walker, 2021) . A systematic review of the benefits of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) found moderate effects on improved anxiety and depression as well as small effects on stress across 47 randomised controlled trials (Goyal et al., 2014) . While reported psychological benefits have been small to moderate to date (Van Dam et al., 2018) , even a mild to moderate distress reduction can be efficacious for people facing acute stress that may lead to the detriment of daily functioning.",

            "text": "Despite the evidence on the benefits of mindfulness for psychological wellbeing, issues in the literature exist regarding the conceptualisation and measurement of mindfulness. A vast number of studies in western mindfulness literature have based measures on the broad definition by Kabat-Zinn (2003) , while historical mediation teachings theorise that there are several complementary yet distinct components to being mindful (Fernandez and Walker, 2021; Zeng et al., 2015) . For example, equanimityan open and receptive towards all experiences -is considered a vital outcome of meditative practice in Buddhist contemplative traditions (Desbordes et al., 2015; Hosemans, 2017) . Where equanimity has been empirically measured as a discrete outcome of mindfulness practice it was related to improved emotional reactivity and reduced stress (Juneau et al., 2020) . For example, Lindsay et al. (2019) found a brief combined equanmity and awarenss intervention decreased objective and perceived social isolation levels in stressed adults. Findings are consistent with other research where taught equanimity and insight (change in awareness) skills were connected in effecting beneficial outcomes in mindful practice (Shoham et al., 2018) . However, as equanimity skills were taught alongside other mindfulness skills (awareness) in both studies and is frequently conflated with similar yet distinct constructs, such as acceptance (Lindsay et al., 2019) , further research is required to isolate the discrete benefits of equanimity. Overall, empirical evidence suggests equanimity is a psychological skill that is related to psychological wellbeing and may offer a protective factor in times of stress.",

            "text": "The current study aimed to examine the impact of both objective and perceived social isolation on psychological distress during COVID-19 and to examine trait equanimitybeing open and receptive to experience -as a mediator of these relationships. The first hypothesis was not supported as, unexpectedly, objective social isolation negatively predicted psychological distress. The second hypothesis was supported as perceived social isolation was found to positively predict psychological distress. The third hypothesis was not supported as equanimity did not mediate the objective social isolation-psychological distress relationship. The fourth hypothesis was supported as equanimity mediated the perceived social isolation-psychological distress relationship. These results improve understandings of the impact of the \"perceived\" nature of social isolation on psychological distress and may have implications for mindfulness-based clinical interventions. Support for Hypothesis 1 was not found as objective social isolation predicted lower levels of psychological distress, contrary to a large body of evidence on the negative effects of isolation on mental health (Lindsay et al., 2019; Matthews et al., 2019) . However, the current findings are consistent with emerging research on social distancing measures and mental health during COVID-19. For example, high levels of adherence to COVID-19 social distancing measurespredicted lower levels of anxiety and depression, which was indirectly affected by a sense of meaning attributed to the potential health benefits of the social distancing behaviours (Milman et al., 2020) . The discrepancies in the current findings may therefore be attributed to a positive association between isolating and health-related benefits. This suggests that negative affect is lower when isolation is externally driven (public health directives) rather than being driven by internal variables (anxiety).",

While living with others has been identified as a protective factor against loneliness (Cruwys et al., 2013) this was not evidenced in the current findings, despite the majority of the sample residing with two or more people (84.4%). One possible explanation for this finding is that individuals were not residing with their closest ties. For example, Kovac's et al. (2021) found individuals who reported fewer interactions with their \"very close\" close ties experienced more perceived social isolation during the 2020 lockdown in the United States. Fewer social interactions with close or quality relationships during COVID-19 may indicate that it is the \"perceived\" nature of social isolation that is a critical contributing factor to psychological distress compared to quantity of social contact. The importance of \"perceived\" social isolation may also be a contributing factor in the unexpected findings in Hypothesis 1. For example, reduced quantity of contact with others did not adversely affect psychological distress suggesting quality or closeness of ties is more important factor in psychological distress. The current findings indicate perceived social isolation is a vital factor to consider for public mental health during a pandemic.",

            "text": "Hypothesis 3 was not supported as trait equanimity did not mediate the objective social isolation-psychological distress relationship. One possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that equanimity may operate in conjunction with other mindfulness traits to positively effect mental wellbeing. Past research often conflates equanimity with conceptually similar, yet distinct variables and equanimity skills are taught alongside acceptance and awareness skills in mindfulness interventions making it difficult to isolate equanimity derived wellbeing benefits (Shoham et al., 2018) . Hence, current findings suggest trait equanimity alone may not explain the objective social isolation-psychological distress relationship and instead a combination of mindfulness-related skills are required. Hypothesis 4 was supported as perceived social isolation negatively predicted overall psychological distress and depression, anxiety, and stress through trait equanimity. Which corroborates a growing body of evidence suggesting equanimity is a predictor of mental wellbeing (Juneau et al., 2020; Shoham et al., 2018) . High trait equanimity is defined as an open and receptive attitude to experiences, regardless of valence, characterised by a balanced emotional and motivational response (Juneau et al., 2020) . As such, individuals with high levels of trait equanimity may be better able to regulate their emotions when they \"perceive\" the negative valence of social isolation, resulting in less negative affect specifically, depression, anxiety, and stress. The current findings are relevant for assessing how individuals are likely to respond to future pandemic-related social distancing measures.",

Perceived social isolation along with stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, are associated with poor cardiovascular health, cognitive decline, and functional impairment. An increased physiological stress response has been suggested as one mechanism for the impact of perceived social isolation on mental health. Therefore, it is important to identify individuals \"at-risk\" of perceived social isolation before an overactive stress response negatively impacts their wellbeing. Vulnerable groups such as adults living alone are already understood to have a greater risk of loneliness, but current findings alongside other COVID-19 research indicates a wider range of adults are vulnerable to perceived social isolation during a pandemic. Therefore, psychologists can try to mitigate the \"perceived\" nature of isolation for individuals to assist in reducing adverse outcomes.",

Perceived and objective social isolation have substantial health, financial, and social costs to society from functional impairment associated medical costs. While objective social isolation was not related to adverse outcomes in the current sample, the literature shows fewer social contacts and number of days of confinement positively predict depressive symptomology during COVID-19. Extended and unpredictable periods of social isolation are likely to continue while the virus remains highly transmissible, meaning future research may find that depression in the general population remains high or increases. Even individuals who find meaning or purpose during isolation may begin to experience distress symptomatology as social distancing measures continue. Psychologists can therefore offer preventative interventions for individuals who are socially isolating. Increasing protective factors, such as trait equanimity, via mindfulness practice may help to alleviate the potential health burden of social isolation on society. Interventions to improve equanimity outcomes can be designed with COVID-19 in mind, such as brief interventions delivered online while individuals are socially isolating. As the current study measured equanimity as a quality of awareness, specifically being receptiveness (open minded) and centered (returning to oneself and not getting caught up in external events) interventions should be created with this definition to ensure efficacy. Specifically, training to become receptive/open to both positive and negative experiences and remaining centered within oneself when faced with external stressors.",

Based on the concerns of bias in self-report measures, the use of behavioural measures may overcome this bias and further explain identified relationships.

For example, a recent study found people living in individualistic countries during COIVD-19 reported higher perceived social isolation compared to collectivist countries.

Perceived social isolation predicted psychological distress and there was an unexpected relationship with objective social isolation predicting lower levels of psychological distress. The prediction of psychological distress from perceived isolation was partially explained by trait equanimity. These findings can inform the development of adapted mindfulness-based interventions for individuals at risk of psychological distress related to population-wide social isolation restrictions. By understanding how individual trait differences and perceptions of social isolation are linked to stress, anxiety, and depression symptomology, interventions can be adapted to improve individual outcomes. Such interventions can potentially limit psychological distress in times of pandemic-related social isolation or when isolation is driven by individual factors.",
