Early-stage esophageal cancer is underdiagnosed during gastric endoscopy under white light because symptoms are subtle in the early stage (4) . So, chromoendoscopy was developed to facilitate accurate detection of early-stage esophageal cancer. Among the several chromoendoscopy techniques available, chromoendoscopy with iodine staining is currently the ideal technique for early-detecting superficial esophageal cancer (SEC) (5) because it is relatively easy to perform (6) and sensitive to detect esophageal dysplasia and carcinoma (7) . However, chromoendoscopy with iodine solution is often associated with a higher risk of adverse iodine-related events (8) . Previous works have not only determined the impact of various iodine concentrations on patients' discomfort (9) , but also determined the safety and efficacy of various neutralizing solutions such as vitamin C solution (6) and sodium thiosulfate solution (STS) (10) .",

Currently, there are no definitive criteria for evaluating the iodine-staining effect, and we therefore developed the criteria of defining good or excellent iodine-stained esophageal mucosa (Figure 1 ) according to the method introduced previously (9). We recorded the number of patients who achieved good or excellent iodinestained esophageal mucosa after iodine solution was sprayed only once, and then, the iodine-staining effect was evaluated by calculating the proportion of patients who achieved good or excellent iodine-stained esophageal mucosa after iodine solution was sprayed only once. During gastroscopy, the number of suspicious lesions was recorded and a biopsy was carried out by the endoscopist. Biopsy specimens taken at the index endoscopy were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u00b5m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). A pathologic diagnosis was rendered for each biopsy specimen by experienced pathologists who were blinded to all endoscopic findings, and discrepancies were adjudicated by consultation. For the purpose of determining the reflux of residual iodine solution in gastric cavity into the esophagus or oral cavity (including larynx), a starch indicator was introduced in this work. We firstly used a cotton swab to collect the pharyngeal contents, and then, it was put into a starch indicator solution. We judged that residual iodine solution reversely flowed back to the oral cavity if the starch indicator solution changed to be purple, which was defined as a positive response (Figure 2 ) (13, 14) and indicating a higher risk of results in AEs.",

We find that the starting position of spraying iodine solution is closely associated with the risk of iodine-related AEs, without impairment in staining effect. However, it has not been previously studied. This work, which is the first randomized trial investigating the starting position of spraying iodine solution to date, suggests that anterograde iodine staining appears to be as effective, but significantly safer than retrograde iodine staining during esophageal chromoendoscopy. Compared with retrograde iodine staining, anterograde iodine staining obtains similar iodine-staining effect and detection yield. However, no patients who were assigned to receive anterograde iodine staining suffered from pain and revealed a positive response to starch indicator. Importantly, anterograde iodine staining consumes fewer amount of iodine solution compared with retrograde iodine staining.",
