Chronic air pollution has been reported to be a contributing factor to higher COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths in China (Zhu et al., 2020) , Italy (Conticini et al., 2020) , Spain (Ogen 2020) , and The Netherlands (Cole et al., 2020) . Increased rates of COVID-19 have also been found in counties with elevated air pollution levels in the U.S. For example, Wu et al. (2020) have shown that a small increase in long-term exposure to fine particulate matter leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate, while Hendryx and Luo (2020a) found COVID-19 prevalence and fatality rates to be significantly associated with greater exposure to air pollution emissions from multiple sources.",

Recent reports on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality also indicate a higher burden among minorities and lower SES residents (Devakumar et al., 2020; Eligon et al., 2020; Ray 2020; Yancy 2020) . Greater COVID-19 incidence or fatality rates have also been documented in U.S. counties or ZIP codes containing higher percentages of non-White residents, people in poverty, and other socially vulnerable groups (Finch and Finch 2020; Hendryx and Luo 2020b; Karaye and Horney 2020; Mahajan and Larkins-Pettigrew 2020; Maroko et al., 2020) .",

This article addresses this gap by: (1) identifying counties facing significantly higher exposure to both COVID-19 and respiratory risks from hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) in the continental U.S.; and (2) investigating if socially disadvantaged population groups are more likely to reside in such counties. The central research question is framed as follows: are racial/ethnic minorities, socioeconomically deprived residents, and other vulnerable groups significantly overrepresented in counties where significantly higher COVID-19 prevalence coincides with higher respiratory risks from outdoor HAP exposure? Publicly available secondary data and local measures of spatial association are used to identify geographic clusters of counties that represent statistical relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and HAP respiratory risks. Socio-demographic characteristics of counties representing the spatial coincidence of significantly higher COVID-19 incidence and higher respiratory risk from HAP exposure are then statistically compared to those in: (1) all remaining counties in the continental U.S; and (2) counties where significantly lower COVID-19 prevalence coincides with lower HAP respiratory risk, using both bivariate statistical tests and multivariable generalized estimating equations that account for spatial clustering in the data.",

For each HAP known to cause adverse respiratory health outcomes, the NATA calculates a hazard quotient. This is estimated as the ratio of ambient air concentration to the chemical's inhalation reference concentration, defined as the amount of toxicity below which long-term exposure to the general population is not expected to result in adverse respiratory effects. Respiratory risk estimates in the NATA are scaled in terms of a respiratory hazard index, which represents the sum of hazard quotients for all HAPs that cause adverse respiratory effects. This index summarizes the cumulative impacts of all relevant HAPs for which respiratory effects were the key negative health impact. The NATA respiratory hazard index includes risks associated with inhalation exposure to HAPs released by major stationary sources (e.g., industrial factories), smaller stationary sources (e.g., small manufacturers), on-road mobile sources (e.g., cars and trucks), non-road mobile sources (e.g., trains, construction vehicles), non-point sources (e.g., agricultural livestock, residential wood combustion), fires, biogenic sources, secondary sources, and background concentrations (i.e., contributions from distant or natural sources).",

This single component extracted through PCA explained 61% of the variable's total variance.

The second variable was the percentage of civilian non-institutionalized persons reporting a disability in the ACS. Recent studies have demonstrated that people with disabilities are disproportionately exposed to environmental health hazards in the U.S. and also adversely impacted by COVID-19 (Chakraborty, 2020; Turk and McDermott 2020) . The third variable used was the percentage of civilian non-institutionalized persons without health insurance, a well-documented measure of socioeconomic vulnerability that has also been linked to disproportionate COVID-19 and respiratory health outcomes due to HAP exposure (Grineski et al., 2013; King 2020) . Finally, the multivariable analysis also includes and adjusts for population density, calculated by dividing the total county population by the area of the county in square miles, because densely populated areas are more likely to have higher COVID-19 cases (Maroko et al., 2020) as well as contain emission-generating activities that increase health risks from HAPs (Chakraborty 2009; Collins et al., 2017) .",

Unlike global measures of spatial association that evaluate relationships for the entire study area, LISA statistics provide a spatial correlation measure for each unit of analysis. Specifically, the local bivariate Moran's I statistic (Anselin 1995) was estimated to determine how the association between COVID-19 incidence rate and the HAP respiratory hazard index varies across counties in the continental U.S. To identify spatial clusters of significant associations and counties where these associations are statistically significant, 999 random permutations and a significance level of 0.05 (p < 0.05) were used.",

The fifth category comprises analytic units where spatial correlations are not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In this case, the high-high category implies that high COVID-19 incidence rate in a county is significantly associated with high HAP respiratory risk in neighboring counties (p < 0.05), while low-low category indicates that a county with low COVID-19 incidence is significantly associated with low respiratory risk in neighboring counties (p < 0.05). Spatial contiguity was measured based on the frequently used first-order queen criterion, which defines neighbors as adjacent spatial units (counties) that share a common border or vertex with the spatial unit (county) of interest.

GEEs are appropriate for this study since they are useful for analyzing clustered dichotomous variables and relax several assumptions of traditional regression models (Chakraborty et al., 2019a (Chakraborty et al., , 2019b Maldonado et al., 2016 ). An important assumption for estimating a GEE is that observations (i.e., counties) within a cluster are correlated, while observations from different clusters are independent. The state in which a county is located was used to define clusters to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state, because of similarities in COVID-19 response and testing policies, as well socio-cultural and healthcare system characteristics (Wu et al., 2020) . This cluster definition resulted in 49 clusters, with number of counties per cluster ranging from 1 (Washington DC) to 254 (Texas). GEEs also require the specification of an intra-cluster dependency correlation matrix (Garson 2012 ). After experimentation with several different specifications available in IBM SPSS Statistics software, the 'independent' correlation matrix was selected since this specification yielded the best statistical fit.",

The high-high category, which represents significantly high COVID-19 incidence spatially associated high HAP respiratory risks, contains 422 or almost 14% of counties in the continental U.S. These counties are located mainly in states of the U. S. Southeast, as well as in California. The top five counties in the highhigh category, based the bivariate local Moran's I values, comprise Chattahooche and Stewart in Georgia, Lincoln in Arkansas, Lafayette in Florida, and East Felicia in Louisiana. In these five counties, COVID-19 incidence rates are at least three times higher and cumulative respiratory risks from HAPs are almost twice as high compared to their respective national averages. The low-low category also comprises about 14% of all U.S. counties that are located primarily in the Mountain region of the U.S. West, northern areas of the Midwest (e.g., Michigan and Minnesota), and several states in the northeast. Less than 25% of all counties in the continental U.S. are collectively classified as either lowhigh or high-low. Counties with significantly low COVID-19 incidence surrounded by high HAP respiratory risk counties (low-high) can be found mainly in California, Arkansas, and Georgia, while those in the high-low category are scattered throughout the Mountain and Midwest regions. Table 2 provides the mean values of the socio-demographic variables in each of the five spatial clusters depicted in Fig. 1 . The high-high category is characterized by substantially higher percentages of Black residents, socioeconomically deprived persons, and other socially vulnerable groups, compared to the other four clusters and the continental U.S. as a whole. The first set of t-tests compares the means in highhigh category to those in the rest of the continental U.S., referred to as 'non high-high' in the tables. With regards to race/ethnicity, the highhigh category contains significantly higher percentages of Black residents, but significantly lower percentages of White, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian residents, when compared to the non high-high category of counties. With the exception of English language proficiency, all socioeconomic deprivation variables show significantly higher means in the high-high category than the rest of the U.S. The mean percentage of people aged 65 or years is significantly lower, while the percentages of people with a disability and without health insurance are significantly higher, among counties in the high-high category than those in the non high-high category.",

This disparity is particularly staggering for the mean Black percentage in the high-high category, which is about 18 times higher than that in the low-low category. All five socioeconomic deprivation variables, including the combined index, show significantly higher means in the high-high category. The largest disparities are observed for the percentages of adults without high school education and people in poverty; both these means are almost twice as high in the high-high category compared to the low-low category.

LISA measures and related significance tests indicated that about one out of seven counties in the continental U.S. are facing this double burden of COVID-19 prevalence and HAP respiratory risks. These counties are located primarily in southeastern states of the U.S. and California. Bivariate statistical analysis revealed that non-Hispanic Blacks, socioeconomically deprived residents, people with disabilities, and those without health insurance are significantly overrepresented in this high-high category of counties, when compared to the rest of the continental U.S. and the low-low category, in particular. The largest relative disparities were observed for the percentages of non-Hispanic Black population, adults without high school education, and people in poverty. White and older (age 65 or more) residents, in contrast, are significantly overrepresented in counties with both low COVID-19 prevalence and low HAP respiratory risks.

The American Indian percentage also revealed a significantly negative association with the odds of locating in the high-high category, in part, because of the overrepresentation of this group in the high-low category of counties. Although large proportions of American Indians reside in counties characterized by smaller population density and lower air pollution exposure that are located in southwestern or midwestern states, many of them are facing significantly high risks from exposure to COVID-19 in these counties. This study contributes to the existing literature on distributive EJ analysis of air pollution and emerging literature on the socially inequitable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic by documenting the significant overrepresentation of non-Hispanic Blacks, socioeconomically deprived residents, and those without health insurance in U.S. counties located at the intersection of COVID-19 and respiratory risks from HAPs. The significant social disparities revealed in this research highlight the urgent need to develop mitigation and intervention strategies that focus on addressing both COVID-19 and chronic air pollution risks for minority and socioeconomically vulnerable communities. The geospatial methodology used this study can also be applied to identify COVID-19impacted areas and populations burdened with other types of nonrespiratory health risks (e.g., cancer or neurological), as well as other kinds of pollution (e.g., exposure to criteria air pollutants or proximity to hazardous waste facilities) that are likely to amplify the negative environmental and health impacts.",

            "text": "While this study represents an important starting point for documenting the double burden of exposure to both COVID-19 and air pollution risks for socially disadvantaged populations, it is important to consider certain limitations. First, the statistical analyses are restricted to county level associations since COVID-19 data for smaller geographic units (e.g., census tracts) and individual cases are currently unavailable for the entire U.S. These county level results cannot be used for inferences regarding COVID-19 outcomes or respiratory risk from HAP exposure for individuals residing in these counties. Future research should focus on specific U.S. states, counties, and urban areas, as well as utilize more detailed data at the neighborhood and household levels to clarify the relationships between COVID-19 susceptibility, chronic air pollution exposure, and socio-demographic characteristics of impacted residents. Second, data on respiratory risks from long-term exposure to HAPs were based on the latest NATA (2014), but these estimates may not represent the most recent conditions or acute exposures to HAPs. Recent reports suggest that total HAP emissions could be declining nationwide, although many urban areas are experiencing local or neighborhood level increases (Trinity Consultants, 2019). The county level distribution of HAP respiratory risk can be expected to have remained relatively unchanged, an assumption supported by previous EJ studies utilizing the NATA and comparison of NATA risk estimates from 2014 to 2011. Third, the analysis of COVID-19 prevalence did not consider the potential impacts of the complex lockdown rules that were in effect in some states relative to others, and in specific counties within certain states. Finally, additional factors that explain COVID-19 burdens and their county level patterns such as testing capacity, access, and availability also need to be included in future research.",

The results of this study also emphasize the need to continue enforcing existing air pollution regulations, some of which were recently relaxed by the USEPA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Wu et al., 2020) . The failure to mitigate toxic air pollution could not only increase the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, but also contribute to other respiratory illnesses and deaths that draw resources away from COVID-19 patients and further amplify the racial/ethnic and social disparities reported in this study.",
