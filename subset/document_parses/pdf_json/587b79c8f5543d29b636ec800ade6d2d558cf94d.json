Effective communication and management ability (Cultural Intelligence) of employees in this type of diverse and heterogeneous environment impacts behavior and performance, affecting the sustainable innovation ability of organizations. Researchers have not yet fully assessed the impact of individuals' cross-cultural management ability on sustainable innovation. Using Cultural Intelligence Theory and Trait Activation Theory, this paper discusses the influence of individual cultural intelligence on sustainable innovation behavior. The results showed that employees' cultural intelligence positively affected their sustainable innovation behavior. Employee knowledge sharing plays an mediating role between intelligence and behavior. Differences in organizational culture have a negative moderating effect on the impact of employees' cultural intelligence on knowledge sharing and sustainable innovation behaviors. The research results provide theoretical guidance for managing organizational cultural diversity and advancing cultural intelligence and sustainable innovation behaviors among employees.",

At the same time, the global flow of human resources and the influx of a large number of \"new generation employees\" have led to employee differentiation, resulting the \"personalized\" development of corporate culture [3] . The \"personalization\" of multicultural organization environments and corporate culture requires employees to engage with groups form different cultural backgrounds, and cross-cultural communication has become the norm in employee activities. Cultural differences and cultural barriers have become important factors affecting employee behavior and performance, posing challenges for the innovative management, and sustainable development of enterprises [2, 4] . This context highlights the importance of cross- cultural communication and the ability to manage employees, making it worthy of in-depth study in academia and management practice. Individual sustainable innovation behavior has had an increasingly important influence on the sustainable development of enterprises. The innovation behavior of individuals in an organization forms a micro foundation of enterprise innovation and sustainable development [5] . Studies have focused on three main factors affecting individual innovation [6] . This first focuses on the individual characteristics of employees in the organization, such as personality, psychology, self-efficacy, knowledge, and ability [7] [8] [9] . The second focuses on job characteristics, including task complexity, work challenge, job autonomy, feedback, and rewards [10, 11] . The third focuses on organizational factors, including organizational leadership, organizational atmosphere, organizational system, human resource management, and organizational culture [5, 6] . Individual knowledge and ability are key factors affecting innovation behavior, however, individual sustainable innovation is affected by organizational environment factors, such as organizational culture, diversity of organizational culture, and the atmosphere created by organizational cultural differences [6] .",

Many scholars have studied the kinds of organizational culture that promote innovation and the kinds of culture that lead to an enterprise's sustainable development (such as learning culture, open culture, green culture, etc.) [13] [14] [15] . These studies have not focused on the impact of cultural diversity management within organizations and the impact of organizational cultural differences on innovation and sustainable development. Rather, research on organizational cultural diversity has focused on the impact of cultural diversity and organizational cultural differences on economic effects and sustainable development at the organizational level [16, 17] . At the individual level, researchers have focused on the impact of cultural diversity characteristics on employees' work performance and adaptability [18, 19] . However, the impact of individual employee cultural diversity management ability on sustainable innovation has not received corresponding attention. This is particularly true in organizational environments, where the cultural differences are increasingly visible due to the diversity of organizational culture. As such, the factors influencing employees' sustainable innovation behavior deserve more attention.",

To explore the reality that some people communicate and perform better than others in the context of cultural diversity, Earley and Ang (2003) proposed the concept of \"Cultural Intelligence\" (CQ), defining it as an individual's ability to play a role and effectively manage in the context of cross-cultural environment or cultural diversity [20] . Scholarly studies have shown that individuals with higher cultural intelligence have higher job performance with respect to cross-cultural adaptation, cross-cultural communication, and job adjustment [21, 22] . CQ also impacts an individual psychological well-being, interpersonal trust, and knowledge interaction [23, 24] . Therefore, as a unique index of individual ability and as an indicator of cross-cultural interaction ability, cultural intelligence has received more attention by scholars. However, few studies have examined how cultural intelligence affects employees' sustained innovation behavior, leading to a lack of understanding of this area.",

Second, previous studies on the impact of organizational culture on employees' innovation behavior have considered specific aspects, but have not integrated cross-cultural ability, the organizational culture situation, and knowledge interaction.

Based on the Theory of Multiple Intelligence (Gardner, 1983) and Sternberg and Detterman's (1986) multiple-loci framework of intelligences [31, 32] , Earley and Ang (2003) developed the concept of \"Cultural Intelligence\" (CQ), which assesses an individual's ability to effectively adapt to the new cultural environment [20] . Ang et al. (2007) further improved the definition: CQ reflects an individual's capability to function and manage effectively in a culturally diverse environment. CQ is a specific form of intelligence, focused on the capability to grasp, reason, and behave effectively in situations characterized by cultural diversity [33] . After the concept of CQ was proposed, many scholars studied the connotation, structural dimension, influencing factors, and influencing effects of CQ, forming a systematic Theory of Cultural Intelligence [21, 34, 35] . CQ is widely used in management, psychology, education, and other fields to measure an individual's cross-cultural adaptability, communication level, task performance, and innovation ability [36] [37] [38] [39] . With the deepening of global economic integration, cross-border communication has become the norm; employee expatriation and cross-cultural activities have become increasingly frequent; innovation has increasingly become a transnational and trans-regional cooperation model. Given this background, the study of employee cultural intelligence is an important and meaningful subject.",

The study of sustainable innovation is a research problem that has been, and will likely remain, a current issue. Human resource management, technology research and development, environmental protection, and market development are current hot topics in the sustainable innovation of organizations [41, 42] . In the field of organizational management, researchers focus on the impact of enterprise strategy and organizational leadership on sustainable innovation [43, 44] , but have not fully explored the sustainable innovation behavior of grassroots employees who are the front-line employees in the workplace. However, the continuous innovation of individuals is the foundation of the sustainable development of the organization. Focusing on the innovation behavior of grassroots employees in the workplace may support development opportunities for the organization; similarly, the sustainable innovation of employees requires organizational support. The sustainable innovation of employees requires the support of the organizational system, a supportive organizational culture, and the creative ability and characteristics of employees themselves [19] . Scott and Bruce (1994) viewed innovation as a multistage process, which is a collection of actions taken by individuals to seek, develop, and apply new ideas and solutions in their current situation [45] . Innovation requires divergent thinking, understanding, and looking at things from different perspectives; and then synthesizing unrelated processes, products, and materials into something new and better [46] . Employees' innovation behaviors are expressed in the form of opinion statements, experiments, and output; the organization converts these into transformative actions to create a competitive advantage [10] . Amabile and Pratt (2016) studied the innovation dynamic model in organizations and noted that individual innovation behavior is affected by many factors, including individual ability and motivation, organizational environment and leadership characteristics, and interactions between individuals and the organizational environment [47] .",

Tett and Burnett (2003) proposed Trait Activation Theory [49] , which refers to the process of an individual expressing his or her characteristics when faced with situational clues related to personality. Trait Activation Theory clarifies how the external situation activates an individual's internal traits and explore the organic connection between internal traits and external situations [50] . CQ focuses on the capability of individuals to effectively manage in the context of cultural diversity [21] ; this is similar to Trait Activation Theory, which focuses on the influence of the \"person-environment\" interaction on individual behavior. Employees' innovation behavior is influenced by personal traits, and is reflected in personal ability, psychological motivation, and behavior performance. CQ is a manifestation of personal abilities and traits. Therefore, in culturally diverse organizations, employees' cross-cultural communication and management ability will impact innovation behaviors. Pandey et al. (2019) studied the impact of CQ on employees' cross-cultural adaptation and work adjustment [51] ; Hu et al. (2017) studied the impact of CQ on innovation performance [52] ; and Golgeci et al. (2017) verified the mediating effect of CQ on the organization's ability to absorb innovation ability [53] . Studies on the factors that influence CQ show that CQ formation requires the learning of multicultural knowledge and cross-cultural experience and training [23] . This is a long-term and continuous process. Therefore, we hypothesize that the impact of CQ on innovation behavior is sustainable. This leads to the following hypothesis.",

The subjective cognition, behavior, and motivation of individuals are important factors influencing knowledge sharing; these can determine the willingness of employees to share knowledge.

This dimensional division of CQ indicates that CQ represents the cognitive ability of employees to gain cultural knowledge, and their motivation and action to learn knowledge. This includes the cognition of knowledge sharing, knowledge sharing motivation, and behavior. Metacognition, cognition, and motivation can support and encourage knowledge learning and sharing among employees, whereas behavior reflects actions and the results of that knowledge sharing [56, 57] .

Knowledge sharing facilitates mutual learning among members within the organization, facilitates the exchange of knowledge and experience among members of the organization, and creates conditions for the birth of new ideas or creativity.

Organizational culture difference is a significant manifestation of organizational diversity, which affects organizational working climate and employee behavior. Trait activation theory (Tett,2003) emphasizes the matching of individual traits and organizational climate, highlighting that individual traits are activated when the organizational climate accepts those traits [49] . Employee innovation behavior and knowledge sharing motivation are influenced by the interaction between individual characteristics (such as CQ) and the organizational cultural environment. Therefore, based on diversity climate theory and trait activation theory, and the above analysis of organizational culture differences, we hypothesize that organizational culture differences, as an important factor influencing organizational climate, play a moderating role in the relationship between CQ and employees' sustainable innovation behavior, CQ, and knowledge sharing.",

In the second-order model, the minimum factor loading of four dimensions was 0.755 (>0.7). This indicated that the second-order factor explained the variance with a higher firstorder factor.

In the second-order CFA model, the items were modified to remove the two items affecting the residual independence and the measurement effect of the model due to the relatively low factor loading.

Employees with high CQ are more likely to share knowledge with others, and those knowledge sharing behaviors further promote the generation of innovative ideas and employee behavior. In the context of cultural diversity, cultural consistency and cultural difference coexist within an organization. When the consistency of organizational culture is strong, the cultural difference is small and employees with a high CQ are more likely to share knowledge with others. This facilitates innovation. In contrast, when cultural differences become larger, knowledge sharing may be weakened.

These results showed that the relationship between CQ and sustainable innovation was not sensitive to the change of organizational culture differences.

Employees with high CQ reported having strong cultural metacognition, understanding more diverse cultural knowledge, having strong cross-cultural motivation and, take the initiative to adjust cross-cultural behaviors. Employees with high CQ reported being more likely to adapt to cultural diversity and were less sensitive to cultural differences.

The diversity of organizational culture is an important intangible resource of an enterprise, and has a profound impact on knowledge management and sustainable innovation. However, organizational culture diversity is a double-edged sword. Some managers hold that diversity brings innovation and high performance [2, 85] , and maximize cultural diversity in management practices (such as human resource recruitment). Some studies have shown that cultural diversity can lead to discrimination, conflicts, and differences, and eventually may become a cultural barrier to sustainable development of organizations, therefore, consistency of organizational culture should be advocated in management practice. This study argues that it is more meaningful to discuss how to do a good job in managing cultural diversity, rather than arguing about the pros and cons of cultural diversity. Therefore, this paper discusses the influence of individual cross-cultural management ability (CQ) on sustainable innovation behaviors, and calls on managers to strengthen cross-cultural management. Through the research, we found that the organizational culture of some small and medium-sized enterprises is somewhat spontaneous and fuzzy, and some of the newest generation of employees are personalized [3, 86] . This can lead to more cultural diversity within the organization. However, the lack of management of cultural diversity in the enterprise has formed cultural barriers, affecting employee innovation and development. Some other surveyed companies, such as Huawei and Haier, have attached importance to cultural diversity management and cultural intelligence training, and their employees have been reported to perform better in sustainable innovation [87, 88] . Cultural diversity management supports sustainable innovation. Managers should improve employees' CQ through cross-cultural experience and training, and control the level of organizational cultural differences.",

In the field of human resources training, we should pay attention to cultivating employees' cognitive abilities with respect to multi-culturalism, increase education about cross-cultural knowledge, and increase the use of cross-cultural experience projects to enhance cultural intelligence.",

The nature of knowledge sharing is interaction and learning, and while knowledge sharing reflects an individual's behavior, it also forms an organizational climate. If the staff in the organization are willing to share knowledge with others and learn from each other, it forms a transmission mechanism that promotes innovative behavior. Therefore, managers should promote knowledge-sharing behavior within the organization. This includes strengthening support for knowledge-sharing behavior in performance appraisals, organizational culture, and system construction, including through targeted performance awards, organized results sharing and seminars, and the award of honorary titles.",

Study subjects represented different industries, including education and training, manufacturing, finance, and e-commerce, and reported engaging in different types of work. This leads to the advantage of having results that are more universal; however, the study was not representative of a specific industry and occupation. Future research could discuss specific industries or professions, such as finance or technology, and discuss the impact of CQ on more specific sustainable innovation behaviors.",

As such, the scale may be biased. Future studies could avoid this problem by combining multiple research methods and collecting data across multiple time stages.",

In addition, the relationship between organizational cultural intelligence, organizational knowledge sharing climate, and organizational sustainable innovation remains to be explored.

They noted that the CQS did not assess the discriminant validity and correlation between the four dimensions, and the measurement results of the items caused multicollinearity among the four dimensions [73]. Bucker et al. applied the CQS using data for Chinese subjects with cross-cultural backgrounds, and deleted 8 items with poor factor loading in the CQS, further optimizing the scale. Bucker's scale was used in this study to measure the cultural intelligence of employees. The scale has 12 items and uses a Likert 7-point scale. Questions include: \"I adjust my cultural knowledge as I interact with people from a culture that is unfamiliar to me\" and \"I vary the rate of my speaking when a cross-cultural situation requires it.\" The Cronbach's \u03b1 of the original scale was 0.87.",
