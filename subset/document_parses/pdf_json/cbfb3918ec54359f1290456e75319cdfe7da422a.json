Ignoring these acute-level infections may lead to complications. Particularly in Pakistan, respiratory infections account for 20% to 30% of all deaths of children. Even though these infections are common, insufficiency of accessible data hinders development of a comprehensive summary of the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence rate in various regions of Pakistan and also to recognize the existing viral strains responsible for viral respiratory infections through published data. Respiratory viruses are detected more frequently among rural dwellers in Pakistan. Lower tract infections are found to be more lethal. The associated pathogens comprise respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. RSV is more dominant and can be subtyped as RSV-A and RSV-B (BA-9, BA-10, and BA-13).",

Nineteen percent of cases were identified as RSV associated infections. RSV appeared to be more incident from August to October and highest in September. Susceptibility increased in rainy seasons. 10 HMPV was detected in 7% of the cases in the above scenario, most of which were children under 1 year of age. 11 The results of a surveillance study conducted during January 2008 and December 2011 determined influenza A as a causative agent of infection in a great number of people. A total of 6258 samples were analyzed by RT-PCR assay, out of which 1489 samples were positive for influenza virus. Seventy-two percent of which were influenza A, and 28% were influenza B. Among influenza A, three strains were identified. These strains were A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and A/H1N1pdm09. 12 The results of another hospital-based study confirmed the viral association with ALRI. The study was conducted in two hospitals of twin cities of Pakistan from November 1986 to HMPV. RSV-A and RSV-B association was detected more commonly during 2 to 6 months of age, while influenza A was estimated as more common in 2.1 to 6-month age group. 9 RSV association with kids between the ages of one and 5 years old suffering from pneumonia and asthma was the most widely recognized finding of a 3-year study conducted in Karachi from August 2009 to June 2012. In older children between the ages of one and 5 years old, pneumonia and asthma were the most widely recognized findings. 10 In another study conducted by the group, the cases were characterized by pneumonia followed by bronchiolitis. 11",

Evidence of these cases suggested the occurrence of the transmission chain. It began with a poultry culling operation that was carried out in late October 2007. It was performed in the response to a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in a poultry breeding farm located near Abbottabad in the then North West Frontier Province (now KhyberPakhtun Khawa). Thirteen people performed in this operation. One of those was a 25-year-old Livestock Production officer, who became the index case. This was the initial transmission that was from poultry to human. This was followed by next three generations of human to human transmission because of long and intimate contact among brothers.27 In another evidence of human to human spread in KhyberPakhtunKhawa, 20 positive cases for A/H5N1 influenza were identified in October 2007. One subject had poultry infected H5N1 virus, other eight patients got an infection by human-to-human-transmission. However, 12 patients did not show any epidemiological relation with group of other eight patients. 28 In June 2009, the first case with A (H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection was documented. Between 27th April 2009 and 31st August 2010, 1287 suspected cases were analyzed by means of RT-PCR. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were detected in 262 samples from Pakistan. While others exhibited combinations of influenza A (unknown type), influenza B, and influenza A/H3N1. 29 According to another study conducted in a tertiary care hospital throughout December 2015 until the end of January 2016, patients with cough, nasal congestion, wheezing, and chest pain were likely to develop complications of RTI and were suspected for influenza A/H1N1 and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Samples from 36 patients were obtained and analyzed by qPCR. Out of 11 patients, seven were confirmed with the presence of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strain. Three patients died because of further respiratory The results of literature review acknowledged numerous gaps in the availability of data. Reportedly, lower tract infections have high fatality rate. Particularly in the countryside communities of Pakistan, the occurrence of respiratory viruses is more periodic and common especially in children under 2 years of age. Evaluation of reported data has identified several pathogens involved in causing respiratory infections. Pathogens involved include RSV, HMPV, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human Bocavirus. Especially, RSV is a major respiratory pathogen as reported by cited articles with both RSV-A and RSV-B, circulating in Pakistan. It is responsible for causing the death of children and infants. Three genotypes of RSV-B, BA-9, BA-10, and BA-13, are observed. Influenza A (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, and H1N1pdm09) and influenza B are common among Pakistani natives. Despite the fact that influenza strains keep circulating during the whole year but usually causes seasonal pandemics with high occurrence during winter and spring period. A number of diseases are associated with respiratory tract. However, available data include pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and influenza.Pneumonia is common among children whereas every year 2 to 3 episodes of influenza are commonly observed. Bronchiolitis is not common. On the other hand, such high mortality rate is also because of the inadequate awareness and lack of disease control strategies.",
