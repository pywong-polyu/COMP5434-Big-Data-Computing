            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing stressor that may have detrimental effects on mental health. Theoretical and empirical literature implies that individuals who are characterized by catastrophic appraisals of somatic cues, a tendency known as anxiety sensitivity, as well as by older subjective age, might be particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety during the pandemic. Furthermore, subjective age might moderate the relations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Yet, research to date has not explored the contribution of both anxiety sensitivity and subjective age in explaining distress following stress in general, nor in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Filling this gap, a convenience sample of 828 participants, (M age = 43.98, SD = 14.06), filled questionnaires measuring background variables, COVID-19 related stressors, anxiety sensitivity, subjective age, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. Results: Positive associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and subjective age, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression symptoms, on the other. Furthermore, subjective age moderated the associations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Although higher levels of anxiety sensitivity were related to depression and anxiety during the pandemic, these associations were stronger among participants with an older subjective age. Discussion: The findings are consistent with theories that view subjective age as an intra-individual construct involved in modulating important mental health outcomes in the context of coping with stress.",

It has therefore been proposed that COVID-19 be considered an ongoing traumatic stressor (Estes & Thompson, 2020; Hamam et al., 2020) that may bring about reactions such as depression and anxiety (Lahav, 2020; Shevlin et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, similar to other stressors, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic vary, with some factors increasing individuals' vulnerability for psychological distress. One such factor may be anxiety sensitivity, which is the fear of one's physical sensations (Reiss & McNally, 1985) . It involves negative, or catastrophic interpretations of bodily symptoms of arousal, therefore predisposing one to experience an increased sense of threat (Naragon-Gainey, 2010) . It has been shown to aggravate reactions to stressors, with potentially detrimental effects for one's mental health (i.e., Taylor, 2004) including anxiety (Olatunji & Wolitzky-Taylor, 2009 ) and depression (Stein et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Another imperative factor that could explain individuals' distress during the pandemic is subjective age. Subjective age (Barak & Schiffman, 1981) is the age that one feels regardless of one's chronological age (Kastenbaum et al., 1972) . Experiencing oneself as younger than one's age can be a powerful predictor of better health and physical functioning, psychological well-being, and is negatively associated with cognitive decline, loneliness, and even mortality (e.g., Palgi, Ayalon, Avidor, Segel-Karpas, & Bodner, 2018; Sargent-Cox, Anstey, & Luszcz, 2014; Stephan, Caudroit, Jaconelli, & Terracciano, 2014; Lahav et al., 2018) . Conversely, feeling older than one's age when coping with ongoing stress such as the current pandemic, may at times lead one to feel as though they have fewer coping resources, as suggested by a recent longitudinal findings that negative selfperceptions of aging predicted increased loneliness and distress during the COVID-19 lockdown (Losada-Baltar et al., 2021) . Contrary to feeling relatively young which may buffer a sense of threat or helplessness in the face of the pandemic and may help one to downregulate somatic fears and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 worries, feeling older might promote a more urgent sense of vulnerability, tension and worry in the face of catastrophic interpretations of somatic sensations rooted in anxiety sensitivity.",

This is also in line with findings that pertain specifically to the pandemic, revealing for example that subjective age played a moderating role in the relations between loneliness and psychiatric symptoms . As Western cultures worship youth and view old age in a negative and stereotypical manner (Nelson, 2011) , older self-perceptions might be themselves a source of strain for one's late-life development (Westerhof et al., 2014) , potentially leading to negative feelings of self-alienation. Additionally, feeling older has been found to associated with health-related behaviors, and interpretations of health changes, such that when people interpret health conditions as age-related, they tend to be more passive in fostering protective health habits and adhering to medical recommendations (Stephan, Caudroit, & Chalabaev, 2011) .

Future studies based on prospective designs, not only specific to the pandemic, are needed.
