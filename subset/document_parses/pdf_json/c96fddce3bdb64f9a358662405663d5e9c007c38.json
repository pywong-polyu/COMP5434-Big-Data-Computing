Selfmanagement plans (SMPs) are associated with better patient outcomes, however little is known about the association of LEP with having an SMP among adults with heart disease. This study examined this association using 2013-2016 California Health Interview Survey data. Among adults that received an SMP, we also examined whether they had a hard copy SMP (print or electronic vs. none), and whether they reported confidence in their ability to manage their heart disease. Our sample included a total of 9102 adults, including 1232 LEP and 7870 English proficient (EP) adults. LEP was associated with significantly lower odds of SMP receipt (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 0.46, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.31 to 0.68). LEP and EP adults who received an SMP were similarly likely to have a hard copy SMP and report confidence in heart disease management. The finding that LEP adults were less likely than EP adults to receive an SMP may represent a missed opportunity to improve heart health outcomes for this group.",

For example, among adults with hypertension, a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, there has been little improvement in the rate of physical activity (from 28% in 2010 to 31% in 2020) and the percent of people with a body mass index in the normal range actually declined (from 18% in 2008 to 14% in 2020) (Arps et al., 2020) .

These covariates were selected based on factors likely to be correlated with the self-management outcomes (Gonzalez-Zacarias et al., 2016; Mathew et al., 2012) . We examined the pairwise correlation between the model controls to assess the extent of multicollinearity.

However, younger adults ages 18-44 were more likely to report being LEP (21%). About two-thirds of LEP adults were Hispanic/Latino and about one-quarter were non-Hispanic/Latino Asian. Medicare was the most common source of insurance coverage among both LEP (43%) and EP (60%) adults, but it was more prevalent among the EP sample. LEP adults were more likely to be uninsured compared to EP adults (14% vs. 3%). Weighted and unweighted sample sizes are shown in Appendix Table S1 . Fig. 1 presents unadjusted weighted percentages for each of the outcome variables for the LEP and EP samples. There was a nearly 30 percentage point difference in the likelihood of receiving an SMP for LEP relative to EP adults (50 vs. 77%, p < 0.0001). Among those who received a plan, a similar percentage of LEP and EP adults reported receiving a hard copy (43 vs. 38%, p = 0.27), and a somewhat lower percentage of LEP adults than EP adults reported confidence in managing their heart disease (51 vs. 60%, p = 0.07). Table 2 presents weighted regression results for the association between LEP status and the self-management outcomes. LEP status was associated with approximately half the odds of having an SMP (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.46, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.68). Adults who were married or living with partners were more likely (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.89) and adults with incomes under 200% FPL were less likely (AOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.90) to report receiving an SMP. Estimates for the other respondent characteristics were not statistically significant at conventional levels. Our analysis of pairwise correlations suggested that the model covariates were generally only weakly or moderately correlated (Appendix Table S2 ). We also present an unadjusted analysis of the association between LEP status and the selfmanagement outcomes in Appendix Table S3 . Results without adjusting for covariates were qualitatively similar to the adjusted results shown in Table 2 .",
