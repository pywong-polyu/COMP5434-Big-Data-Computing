[1] On June 17, 2020, 213 countries have reported cases of COVID-19. [2, 3] The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. [4] The most common and typical clinical symptoms of the patients with coronavirus disease were fatigue, fever (88.7%), and coughing (67.8%); however, nausea and diarrhea (5% and 3.8%, respectively) were uncommon. The radiological findings showed that 56.4% of the patients have ground-glass opacity, and 51.8% have bilateral patchy shadowing in CT chest. Laboratory findings showed that lymphocytes were present in 83.2% of the patients. [5] The most common transmission route of coronavirus is direct contact with the coughing and sneezing patient's droplet. Furthermore, it can also be transmitted from person to person by direct or indirect contact. The dental staff has the risk of coronavirus infection due to the specificity of their procedures such as face-to-face communication, direct contact with saliva, and micro-organism inhalation that may be remained in the air for a long time. [6] Therefore, infection control and preventive measures should be very strict during dental diagnosis and treatment, especially that doctors get infected with COVID-19 more. [7] The aim of this study was to estimate the infection prevention and control (IPC) that may be adopted for both patients and dental team in the Syrian Arab Republic (SAR) dental clinics.",

[5, 6] Furthermore, 63% of the dentists sterilize the patients' hands before and after the dental treatment. About 59% out of them choose 70% ethyl alcohol as a disinfectant, while 35% preferred washing hands with soap and water for 20 s. Both ways are considered an efficient option in killing viruses according to the WHO recommendations. [10] This study was consisted of Hassenow et al. study, which was also conducted in Syrian Arab Republic. [11] More than half of the respondents were not aware to use cover shoes for the patients before entering the dental clinic; therefore, awareness of this point should be more highlighted since coronavirus can survive on the sole of the shoes for up to 5 days [12] due to its ability to land on the ground surface by gravity or airflow effect. [13] The majority of the respondents use dental mouthwashes before the initiation of the treatment (70%), including 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (47%) due to its virucidal effect, while the prevalence of using 0.2% povidone-iodine was (14%), and 9% for hydrogen peroxide. Recently many researchers showed that the antiviral action for some antiseptic rinses, including chlorhexidine, may be limited since the lipid outer layer of coronavirus would probably be protected against such agents. [14] Although almost three quarters of the dentists use high vacuum suctions such as surgical ejaculators due to its highly role in reducing respiratory droplets and this would minimize the virus counts in aerosol and surfaces, therefore decreasing prevalence rate in the dental clinic, 73% do not use dental rubber dam, and this might be according to the application time taken.",
