The major electronic databases were searched using both \"text words\" and \"thesaurus terms,\" focusing on viral infections, COVID-19 and healthcare systems in Pakistan. The content of the selected articles was analyzed by using thematic approach. Out of the total 171 potentially relevant citations, 24 articles were included in the data synthesis. We found that the recent COVID-19 outbreak is a major threat to Pakistan's public health and healthcare system, and the country is not in a position to control spread of disease and provide required standards of care deemed necessary by the World Health Organization. A number of intertwined reasons that expose the Pakistani population at increased risk of COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, include public related demurrals, healthcare workforce related demurrals, organizational and regulatory voids, and travel patterns. To cope with the upsurge of COVID-19 in Pakistan, the regulators need to re-examine and recognize deficiencies in the healthcare system, and thereafter reinforce core capacities in workforce and monetary resources, surveillance, laboratory",

Since their first identification, CoVs have been graded into four subgroups: alpha, beta, delta and gamma. 2 Among these, alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans. The alpha coronavirus subgroup comprises of 229E and NL63, and the beta coronavirus subgroup includes OC43, HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Four human CoVs (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) are endemic in humans and are primarily related to moderate, self-limiting respiratory diseases. In comparison, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic in origin and cause severe respiratory syndromes and pose a considerable threat to humans with their high mortality rates. 3 In relation to CoVs, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia was first emerged in China in 2002 before spreading to 29 countries/regions in 2003. The disease was named SARS, 4 ",

As of 25 May 2020, worldwide, a total of 5 307 298 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (mortality in 342 070 cases) have been documented by the WHO. 11 To date, there is a lot of ambiguity about various aspects of COVID-19, including epidemiology, transmission, clinical manifestation, pathophysiology and prevention and management. According to the reports, the clinical presentations in the confirmed cases of COVID-19 were very close to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 8, 12, 13 The median time from the onset of symptom to first hospital admission was 7 days, and to the intensive care unit admission was 10.5 days. 8 The common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever, cough and myalgia or fatigue followed by less common symptoms, that is, sputum production, headache, haemoptysis and diarrhea. 8, 12, 13 Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties occurred in 55% of the patients. 8 The consequences of infection were not limited to common respiratory symptoms but severe outcomes included pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, secondary infections, kidney failure and death. 8, 13 According to the United States (US) CDC and the WHO, the best way to prevent the infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus and minimizing person-to-person spread. 14, 15 The management of COVID-19 patients relies on early detection, prompt isolation and initiation of effective infection prevention and control measures; delivery of symptomatic care for those with mild illness and optimized supportive care for those with severe disease. 16 In this regard, the healthcare system and financial stability of nations plays a crucial role in achieving the required standards of prevention and management strategies. Recently, the WHO has alarmed that the increase of COVID-19 cases from the Eastern Mediterranean Region is of great concern due to a number of deficits in their healthcare systems and financial instability. 17 Pakistan is a low-and middle-income country that has been recently ranked 152th out of 189 countries with a Human Development Index value of 0.560. 16 The country encountered a variety of healthcare challenges in last several decades and endured a great deal from many epidemics that had devastating effect on people in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic burden. 18, 19 In 2017, lower respiratory tract infections and tuberculosis were among the top causes of mortality in Pakistan. 20 Whereas, the majority of the pediatrics died from acute respiratory infections, diarrhea and sepsis in 2013. 21 Due to failure to attain good healthcare standards, Pakistan has become a reservoir for infectious diseases, and thousands of people have succumbed to viral epidemics such as polio, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), measles, dengue, hepatitis and so forth ( Figure 1 ). 12, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] The dilemma could be gauged by the reemergence of polio virus in Pakistan, which has been exterminated, elsewhere. 22 Similarly, the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak poses significant threat to Pakistan owing to a number of reasons. In Pakistan, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on 25 February 2020. 28 As of 25 May 2020, the number of confirmed cases surpassed 56 349, with 1167 fatalities. 29 Considering the upsurge of the confirmed cases and deficits in the healthcare system, the disease is expected to spread like wildfire across the country. On 23 April 2020, the WHO warned the Pakistani government that the country is at an increased risk of COVID-19 associated mortality and morbidity, if no appropriate counteractions are taken to curb the infection. 30 We undertook this review to outline the shortcomings of Pakistan's public health and healthcare systems, which place the population at increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. The policy makers may take benefit of our findings to avert the anticipated agony associated with COVID-19 as well as future infectious outbreaks. (d) charting the data and (e) collating, summarizing and reporting the results. Even though, the scoping review has a lot of things in common with a systematic review, quality assessment is not necessary and the findings are generally published in a narrative format. 32 This approach enabled us to gain an overview of the breadth of literature in a developing field, especially where an area such as COVID-19 is new and has not been comprehensively synthesized earlier. 31 ",

The ignorance and noncooperative attitude exhibited by the general public can fuel the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout Pakistan. 40 Recently, COVID-19 focused Pakistani studies revealed that social distancing was significantly influenced by situational awareness, 41 and poor knowledge regarding transmission of COVID-19 was perceived as a major obstacle in infection control practices. 42 Pakistan is an agricultural country, and the people and its economy depends heavily on agriculture and natural resources. A total of about 40% of the total population in Pakistan is engaged in animal husbandry, livestock handling, fishing industry and forestry. 19 Considering the fact that zoonotic diseases are gaining momentum in Pakistan, a One Health Hub was created under Field Epidemiology & Disease Surveillance Division (FE&DSD) with the goal of preventing and managing the zoonotic diseases of national and international concern through well-coordinated response by human, animal and environmental departments. 43 Regarding COVID-19, although the preliminary cases were linked to livestock (seafood market), 44 animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission has not been greatly observed till date. However, at this point, the patterns of COVID-19 transmission cannot be firmly predicted due to persistent ambiguity about various aspects.

This has been borne out by a recent study, according to which \"pharmacist job\" was one of the substantial determinants of good COVID-19 infection control practices. 42 Apart from limited healthcare workforce, negligence, unaccountability, lack of follow up of existing infection control guidelines, and inadequate experience, knowledge and formal training of healthcare professionals about emerging diseases continue to severely derail the existing healthcare resources. 49, 50, 79 The Joint External Evaluation task study (2016) of the International Health Regulations (IHR) raised concerns that staff members in Pakistan lack the requisite experience and background knowledge on control and prevention of health issues. 80, 81 Similarly, a previous study reported that healthcare professionals had suboptimal knowledge of preventive methods (72%) and diagnostic techniques (59%) and other aspects of MERS infection since advanced training and continued medical education were not mandatory in Pakistan. 68 Likewise, Khan et al has recently reported that front-line healthcare workers were not well aware of the COVID-19 related strategies for the prevention and control of infection, and were not prepared for the alarming situation in the country. 82 Beside this, poor collaboration among all the healthcare professionals, such as physicians, clinical microbiologist, pharmacists and nurses 83 is other well-known factor that undermines infection control efforts. 84, 85 Taking into account all the aforementioned healthcare workforce related deficits, COVID-19 might put undue pressure on the healthcare professionals.",

This exposes Pakistani population to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission, as evidenced by the fact that the majority of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 had travel history to Iran. 40 Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon and a driving force behind vibrant world economies. 88 Recognizing this, Pakistan has also established different sort of alliances with other nations around the globe, in particular with four border-sharing countries, namely China, Iran, India and Afghanistan. As a result, a number of workers, scholars and commodities travel in and out of the country. 88, 89 Therefore, in the current situation, when there is COVID-19 pandemic, the threat of harm posed to our vulnerable nation by COVID-19 tainted travelers is significant. For instance, the trade agreement with China has contributed to an influx of COVID-19 infected individuals from this regional epicenter. 40 Although, in response to alerts from Chinese authorities, Pakistani government has taken preventive steps in line with the IHR-2005 to prevent the entry of infection at the country's entry points, but has failed to prevent the contamination because of delays in enforcing immigration policies. 40,90",

There are currently only a few quarantine centers in Pakistan and these centers are overflowing with patients and consequently, the \"one person one room\" policy has been badly violated. 40 Significant concerns exist over availability of medicinal products, including protective equipment, essential medicines and ventilators. 91, 92 The limited healthcare workforce combined with poor expertise further impedes the delivery of services needed for the standard management of patients. 40 In addition to existing workforce related issues, the morbidity and mortality of doctors and other healthcare workers has emerged as a new major concern. 93 As of 29 April 2020, the total number of infected medical workers in the country has risen to 444 (i.e., 216 doctors, 67 nurses and 161 healthcare staff). 94 Due to fear of being infected, some healthcare professionals have shown reluctance to handle presumptive COVID-19 patients. In view of the increasing number of infected cases and lack of occupational safety measures and crucial protective suits for healthcare personnel, 40,93 a further shortage of emergency response teams is anticipated in the near future. Moreover, currently only few Pakistani hospitals have the facility to test COVID-19 suspects. 40 Lapses in the screening system and resulting proliferation of COVID-19 warrant the implementation of a more efficient system. 40, 93 The ignorant and noncooperative attitude of patients and general public toward COVID-19 response is further drastically endangering all governmental level efforts.",

The aim of FE&DSD was to respond to outbreaks and epidemics, national and international events of public health significance and provide the necessary input to the concerned stakeholders. However despite meaningful governmental level efforts, recent outbreaks of AIDS, polio, dengue, hepatitis, measles and now COVID-19 (Figure 1) raise concerns and call for improvements in the functioning of FE&DSD. 12,22-26",
