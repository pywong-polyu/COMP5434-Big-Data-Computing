Covid-19 results in a wide spectrum of disease from asymptomatic carriers through pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death leading to many hospitalizations and ICU admissions [1] . In the hospital as part of the work up, biological specimens (such as blood and sputum) are sent for microbiological culture to determine the presence of coexisting, or superimposed bacterial infections in patients diagnosed with Covid-19. To date, data on the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in Covid-19 positive patients is not well established [2] [3] [4] .",

In the last 20 years, the world has experienced at least six major viral epidemics, including SARS-CoV, MERS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and the current SARS-CoV-2. Bacterial super-infections during these viral illnesses have been associated with poor outcomes [6] [7] [8] . Thus, bacterial superinfection is a poor prognostic factor for patients and 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic that between 29 and 55% of deaths were due to secondary bacterial infections. Of five studies done during the original 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak, 11% of cases were associated with secondary bacterial infections [6] . Staphylococcus aureus, in particular, has been shown to be isolated from hospitalized patients with influenza virus infection [9, 10] . Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp., and Haemophilus influenzae are also common bacteria isolated from blood and sputum cultures in patients with a bacterial superinfection on top of a respiratory viral infection [2, 3, 5, 8] .",

We found that non-Covid-19 patients with pneumonia were more likely to have a bacterial infection than Covid-19 patients and were more likely to present with a community acquired infection on arrival to the hospital. In contrast, Covid-19 patients were less likely to present with evidence of bacterial infection and when bacterial infection was evident, it was more likely to be nosocomial occurring later in the hospital admission. This suggests that bacterial superinfection occurred in the majority of Covid-19 patients. Given the appearance of bacteremia later in the hospital course of Covid-19 patients, line infection with skin flora translocation to the bloodstream is a possible likely etiology in many patients. This is similar to other respiratory viral infections such as influenza, in which superinfection is not uncommon, particularly with Staph. aureus [9, 10] . Not surprisingly, we also found that the evidence of a bacterial coinfection was independently associated with mortality both in patients with and without Covid-19. Another possible explanation for the reduced rates of bacterial co-infection during the Covid-19 study period is the widespread use of masks and social distancing that may have further reduced bacterial co0infections and superinfections.",

This decrease in immune function likely contributes to increased susceptibility to bacterial coinfection [18] . Our study is unique in that it directly compared patients with non-Covid-19 pneumonia who did not have a confirmed diagnosis of viral infection with patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. A study preceding the Covid-19 pandemic found that among patients infected with other respiratory viruses, the number of cases of primary coinfection or secondary bacterial pneumonia was between 11 and 35% [19] . Another study from 2003, reported that more than 20% of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV had evidence of bacterial and fungal coinfection [20] . A single-center, retrospective case series study including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients with laboratoryconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, found that in all 221 patients the bacterial coinfection rate was 7.7% [21] . A study from Italy that included 16,654 patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported that 11% had coinfection [22] . A retrospective, single-center study of 99 Covid-19 cases from Wuhan reported coinfections with Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae [23] . Regardless of the rate and cause of bacterial co-infections in patients with Covid-19, there is evidence that bacterial co-infection is proportional to the severity of the disease [24] , and that coinfection can increase the mortality [25] .",

The remaining 37 (29%) non-Covid-19 patients developed infection >48 h of admission, of which 9 had bacteremia, 34 had a positive sputum culture, and three patients had a positive pleural culture. Among 116 Covid-19 patients, only 28 (24%) had evidence of infection within the first 48 h and the remaining 88 (76%) developed infection at least 48 h after admission. Among 28 Covid-19 patients who were diagnosed early with infections, 15 had bacteremia, 11 had positive sputum cultures, and three had a positive urinary antigen. In contrast among 88 Covid-19 patients who presented late with infection, 33 had bacteremia, 75 had positive sputum cultures, 20 had a positive urinary antigen and two had a positive pleural culture. Thus, community acquired bacterial infections were more common in non-Covid-19 pneumonia patients while bacterial nosocomial infections were more common in Covid-19 patients.",
