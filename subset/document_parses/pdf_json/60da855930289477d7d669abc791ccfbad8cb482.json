This posed a unique summer semester challenge, as students needed to complete an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The traditional face-to-face OSCE was revised into a virtual format using a teleconferencing platform and included the following learning objectives: obtain the medical history, describe a focused physical examination, formulate differential diagnoses, and develop an appropriate plan of care. Together with the Health Education Center, students met with a standardized patient (SP) virtually. All elements of the virtual OSCE were the same as the traditional OSCE, except students were required to demonstrate their clinical assessment skills by verbalizing to faculty what they would examine if the visit were in-person. When finished, all participants were invited to complete a survey about their experience. Survey findings revealed that most faculty and students considered the interactive virtual OSCE an extremely effective tool for assessing communication and history taking skills, differential diagnosis, and management of patients. All SPs felt comfortable communicating with the students and felt that the virtual OSCE was a very effective way to assess their interpersonal skills of students. The virtual OSCE also served as an opportunity to incorporate telehealth competencies into a simulation experience for students. This innovative distance learning activity facilitated effective virtual evaluation of clinical competence in NP students and all stakeholders expressed satisfaction with the experience. Most faculty and students strongly agreed that they wanted to continue using the virtual OSCE platform.",

As the demand for NPs increases, so does the need for online programs which can expand their reach to include distance students. Although many NP programs utilize an online format for their didactic content, most programs still require students to travel to campus periodically for structured clinical examinations. The National Task Force on Quality Nurse Practitioner Education (NTF) has developed a set of criteria that are used to evaluate NP programs and mandate that student clinical competence and performance must be evaluated through observation [1] .",

This posed a unique summer semester challenge, as students needed to complete their objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). With the pandemic imposing travel restrictions and mandating social distancing, an alternative method of clinical evaluation was needed. After reviewing the literature and collaborating with the UTMB Health Education Center (HEC), faculty in the primary care NP programs implemented a virtual OSCE clinical simulation during Summer 2020. It was determined that the planned simulation would not only alleviate the need for travel and allow for social distancing but would incorporate telehealth competencies which would provide an important clinical immersion experience for students. These competencies included telehealth etiquette and professionalism, proficiency in history taking, and generating differential diagnoses while using videoconferencing technology [2] . The National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (NONPF) supports and encourages NP programs to incorporate telehealth into their curriculum, and there is a growing body of evidence supporting successful implementation of virtual/telehealth assessments into health and medical education [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Students and faculty received separate training on the use of Zoom\u00ae prior to the scheduled OSCE. Facilitated by the HEC, students met virtually with an SP to complete a medical interview while faculty observed and evaluated student performance. The virtual OSCE contained all the elements of the traditional assessment, except that students were instructed to verbalize to faculty what they would examine if the visit were in person. Faculty notified the student of any abnormal findings, and the student then had a few minutes to develop differential diagnoses and a plan for the working diagnosis. Finally, the student presented the patient's pertinent history to the faculty and the diagnoses, including the working diagnosis, and the plan of care. Debriefing occurred after the student presentation. The SPs also provided written feedback for students regarding their interpersonal skills. Upon completion of the activity, both quantitative and qualitative data measuring the efficacy of the virtual OSCE were collected from participating students, faculty, and SPs using self-administered surveys accessed via the online survey tool SurveyMonkey\u00ae [11] .",

Faculty were asked to rank the efficacy of the virtual OSCE in evaluating key clinical competencies (history taking, clinical assessment, differential diagnosis, patient education, and management and communication) using Likert scale survey items. Responses were on a 5-point scale, and participants were asked to rank efficacy as either \"extremely effective,\" \"very effective,\" \"moderately effective,\" \"somewhat effective,\" or \"not at all effective.\" Faculty were also asked to rank efficacy of student debriefing. Student participants were asked to rank the efficacy of the virtual OSCE in allowing them to demonstrate the aforementioned key clinical competencies using the same 5-point response scale. Standardized patients (SPs) were queried about how effective the virtual OSCE was in allowing assessment of student's interpersonal skills, again using the same 5-point efficacy scale. Faculty and student participants were also surveyed using a 6-point response scale \"strongly agree,\" \"agree,\" \"neither agree nor disagree,\" \"disagree,\" or \"strongly disagree\" to collect data regarding whether the virtual OSCE saved them time and effort. Students used the same 6-point scale to indicate whether the activity was useful and valuable to learning and enhanced performance, and if they would be more comfortable conducing virtual patient visits in the future. Dichotomous questions (yes/no) were used in all participant surveys to identify ease of platform use, whether technical difficulties were experienced and whether participants would like continued use of the virtual OSCE process. For all survey items, an open comment option was included to collect qualitative data. It should be noted that open comment response rate varied by survey item and participants. Analysis of survey responses was provided by Survey-Monkey\u00ae as aggregate data. Quantitative data was further analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Qualitative feedback data from all surveys were reviewed and closely examined using thematic analysis. Identification of common topics, keyword connectors, and ideas was used to identify the key themes as well as the percent of respondents that provided qualitative data is summarized in Table 2 .",

This integration of telehealth clinical experience aligns with the NP Core Competency of Technology and Information Literacy as delineated by NONPF [12] . Some limitations were observed during project completion. Since the case scenarios were not true telehealth visits, the students were required to \"demonstrate\" their clinical assessment skills by verbalizing to faculty what they would examine if the visit were being performed in-person. The faculty noted that verbalization of the physical exam required more time than allotted and assessment of physical examination technique is difficult in a virtual setting. These findings could be suggestive of the need for face-to-face evaluation of student physical examination skills at some point in the program.
