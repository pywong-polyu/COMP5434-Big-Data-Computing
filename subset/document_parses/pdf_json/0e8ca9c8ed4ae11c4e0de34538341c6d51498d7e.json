Prior research has introduced tools that help developers capture information from various sources and organize it into structures useful for subsequent decision-making. However, it remains a laborious process for developers to manually identify and clip content, maintaining its provenance and synthesizing it with other content. In this work, we introduce a new system called Crystalline that automatically collects and organizes information into tabular structures as the user searches and browses the web. It leverages natural language processing to automatically group similar criteria together to reduce clutter, and uses passive behavioral signals such as mouse movement and dwell time to infer what information to collect and how to visualize and prioritize it. Our user study suggests that developers are able to create comparison tables about 20% faster with a 60% reduction in operational cost without sacrificing the quality of the tables.",

            "text": "There have been many commercial and research tools and systems that try to help people make sense of information about tradeoffs to facilitate further decision making, such as by helping with easily capturing snippets of information [1, 5, 53, 110, 121] from web pages or organizing and synthesizing information into useful schema and representations [15, 29, 61, 71, 81, 122] . For example, one common practice that people employ is copying pieces of text as well as taking screenshots and putting them in a running Google Doc as they search and browse the web [88] . One system that is relevant to the context of programming is Unakite [81] , which enables developers to collect and organize information online into comparison tables with options, criteria, and evidence to help with making decisions (see Figure 2 ). However, even with the above tools, it remains a challenging process for developers to manually identify and capture the relevant content, maintain its provenance (where it came from), and synthesize it with other content. Prior work suggests that one cause is that people are often uncertain about which information will eventually turn out to be relevant, valuable, and worth capturing, especially at early stages of their learning and exploration when they are overloaded with information [4, 37] . Under these circumstances, people are hesitant to frequently pause and shift their focus from the investigation itself to reasoning about what to capture for later use [14, 58, 72, 109] , or they could be too engaged in the sensemaking process and forget to collect anything at all. Indeed, research suggests that interactions for gathering information while performing active reading need to be quick and low effort, otherwise people tend not to capture information in the first place [58, 81, 85, 118] . In addition, though existing tools provide users with the flexibility and agency to synthesize the collected information into useful representations, such as comparison tables [15, 81] or knowledge maps [87] , developers still need to perform these organizing operations manually. This is often a laborious process, as developers need to Figure 1 : Crystalline's list view UI (a). As the developer browses a web page (b), Crystalline attempts to automatically collect options and criteria from the page, and display them in the options (c) and criteria panes (d) in the sidebar (a). In addition, Crystalline leverages natural language processing to automatically group similar criteria together, as shown by the multiplepages icon (e). Crystalline uses behavioral signals such as mouse movement and dwell time to try to automatically detect the relative importance of the criteria (shown by the display order, with most important at the top). Users can use the \"See more\" and \"See less\" buttons (g) to adjust how many criteria are to be displayed at once. Crystalline will remind users of the existence of additional related evidence through a red notification dot at the top right of a criterion (f). The sidebar can be toggled in and out by clicking the browser extension icon (h). Users may pin (i) important criteria to the top of the list.",

Another challenge reported in prior work is that developers' needs for collecting and organizing information are often not discovered until part of the way through an investigation process [16, 81] . This could be due to several major reasons, including but not limited to: 1) additional external requirements, constraints, or user feedback are discovered or introduced in the middle of a project which significantly complicates the original decision making problem [23, 30, 31] ; 2) developers discover many more options, criteria, and their trade-offs than they anticipated at the beginning [81] ; and/or 3) developers are required to explain or document their decisions and design rationale after the fact for the long-term maintainability and success of a software project [25, 39, 75, 76, 79, 104, 112] . In these situations, it is hard and involves duplicate work for developers to recall and retrace their steps for reaching their current state of sensemaking (the linear history visualization in almost all current browsers is known to be not particularly effective [16, 67, 124] ) and recollect all the relevant evidence again.",

Although we focus on the domain of programming due to strongly motivating prior work and ease of prototype development due to regularities of the programming context, our work may also generalize to other sensemaking contexts on the web. We instantiate this idea in a prototype system called Crystalline, 1 which is an extension to the Chrome web browser. Crystalline plays the role of a user's copilot and attempts to automatically identify and keep track of the options, criteria, and the corresponding evidence snippets from the web pages that a user has viewed, and organize the snippets into both list and tabular formats. To achieve this, Crystalline mines a variety of behavioral signals while a user browses the web, including scrolling patterns and mouse cursor actions, and employs natural language understanding techniques to automatically classify and organize the collected content. The goal is that users can focus more on reading and understanding web content while occasionally guiding the system when it makes mistakes. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of Crystalline compared to Unakite as a baseline, which found that developers are able to build comparison tables about 20% faster with a 60% reduction in operational cost without sacrificing the quality of the tables. In particular, it only requires around 12% of the total task completion time for participants to use the tool to build and maintain a table, compared to around 30% in the baseline condition.",

This can be particularly difficult if the previous developers failed to properly document the rationale [120] , or the documentation was incomplete or not up-to-date [38] . Granted, the fundamental challenge here is that it is effort-and timeintensive for decision authors to document their rationale (either in situ or after the fact) with little immediate payoff for themselves [42] . Our previous Unakite tool [81] addressed this challenge by encouraging authors to document their decision making processes and results using the tool's lightweight collecting and organizing features. Building on top of this, Crystalline further transforms the previously active capturing and organizing work [5, 81, 110] into passive monitoring and error-fixing [80] , which has been shown to present a much lower entry barrier for people to start contributing [37] .",

However, one common characteristic of these tools is that it is mostly the user's responsibility to manually complete the information collection, triage, and organization process, while we attempt to do this automatically with Crystalline as the user searches and browses the web. Other threads of prior research have explored different ways for machines to help during sensemaking, which inspired and informed our design. For example, systems like Entity Quick Click [6, 66, 116] employ techniques like named-entity recognition [84] to pre-process and highlight semantically meaningful entities in web content, and enable users to collect and annotate relevant information with a single click. Previous work like Thresher [60] and Dontcheva et al.'s personal web summarization tool [29] let users annotate and curate patterns and templates of information that they would like to collect on a few example web pages, then automatically collect them from future pages. In addition, Chang et al.' Mesh system [15] automatically retrieves relevant consumer product facts and reviews from Amazon into a comparison table to enable users to curate and explore nuanced options and criteria. These systems have largely relied on natural language understanding to analyze and transform the web content that users browse and read, while we argue that leveraging the signals from users' natural browsing behavior, such as dwell time and cursor movements, would unlock a new design space for automated machine support during online sensemaking, motivating us to use both NLP heuristics and passive behavioral signals to infer what information to collect and how to visualize and prioritize it in Crystalline.",

For example, Claypool et al. [22] had participants use a custom-built browser to surf the web and concluded that the time spent on a page, the amount of scrolling on a page, and the combination of time and scrolling had a strong correlation with explicit user interest. In addition, Hijikata [57] discovered that actions such as text tracing and link pointing are decent behavioral indicators for perceived interesting segments of web pages. Similarly, in the domain of web searches, Buscher et al. [10] [11] [12] , Guo and Agichtein [50, 51] , and Huang et al. [65] demonstrated that eye tracking, as well as interactions like scrolling and cursor hovers, could accurately predict user interests in search results pages. Building on the empirical understanding laid out by this research, in this work, we explore putting a combination of these implicit behavioral signals into use to approximate user visual attention in a working prototype. We used heuristics and pilot testing to devise mechanisms that translate the raw behavioral signals into numeric scores representing the \"amount of attention\" a user has given to a particular piece of online content. We then use these scores to filter out and rank the content of the evolving comparison table, further reducing the cost for developers to manually manage and prioritize collected information incrementally as they are searching and browsing.",

As a Chrome extension, Unakite enables developers to manually collect any content from any web pages as snippets (pieces of information, Figure 2 -d) into the snippet repository (a holding tank of information snippets, Figure 2 -c) by selecting (Figure 2 -a1) or dragging out a bounding box to enclose the desired content with the mouse cursor ( Figure 2-a2) . To organize the collected content, developers can use drag-and-drop to move the collected snippets from the repository into a comparison table (Figure 2 -b) options (as row headers, e.g., a solution to solve a problem), criteria (as column headers, e.g., a standard by which options are judged), and evidence (\"thumbs-up\" or positive, \"thumbs-down\" or negative, and \"informational\" (\"i\") ratings that spread across the rest of the table cells) that illustrates the trade-offs among various options on those criteria. Developers can also rank the options and criteria in the table to reflect their unique order of preferences. The resulting comparison table is automatically saved and can be used by subsequent developers to understand the context of the previous decision space: what options and alternatives were explored, what criteria needed to be met, what trade-offs were discovered, and what was considered the most important and why.",

In addition, it forces developers to start using the tool from the outset to be able to capture the whole exploration, but, for cases in which the needs for collecting and organizing information are not discovered until partway through an investigation process (which can be quite common in agile style software development [23, 30, 31, 81] that is widely adopted across the software development industry), developers would have to retrace their exploration paths from the beginning and re-collect and organize the content, wasting time and causing duplicate work.",

As a developer opens and reads web pages, the sidebar will be updated with the automatically collected options ( Figure 1c ) and criteria (Figure 1d ) in the list view (Figure 1c & d) . The list view serves as a concise and glanceable outline that reflects one's exploration progress -what options one has encountered and what criteria one has looked into. Clicking on one of the criteria will enter a detailed view for that criterion (Figure 3a) , listing out all the collected evidence snippets organized by options; similarly, clicking on an option will enter the detailed view for that option, which lists all the related criteria and the corresponding evidence associated with that option.

This has the benefit of minimizing the distraction and cost of keeping track of information as an extra step in addition to thinking about the content on a web page, which, in turn, maximizes a user's attention to reading and understanding the content itself. Specifically, Crystalline collects information about options, criteria, and their associated evidence snippets as discussed previously, which was reported by prior work as the key aspects developers look for when solving decision making problems [63, 75, 81] . Currently, to automatically recognize the options, Crystalline employs the following techniques: (1) it looks for the word or phrase between any instances of \"vs. \" (or other variants like \"v.s. \", \"versus\", etc.) in web page titles and opening paragraphs and adds them as potential options. For example, the Medium.com article titled \"Tensorflow vs Keras vs Pytorch: Which Framework is the Best?\" 2 would yield \"Tensorflow\", \"Keras\", and \"Pytorch\" as three potential options; (2) it first runs noun phrase and entity extractions using the Google Cloud Natural Language API [48] on the web page title, section headers as well as the column and row headers of any HTML tables, then checks if the identified entities are mentioned in the titles of other visited pages. In addition, it also checks if the identified entities would frequently come up in each other's Google autocomplete results (the Google \"vs\" technique is described in [40, 82] , which issues queries in the form of \"[option_name] vs\" to the Google Autocomplete API to get a list of autocomplete results that can be interpreted as potential alternatives to \"[option_name]\". An earlier version of this technique was launched as an experimental feature named Google Sets [21, 119] ). Furthermore, it checks if the identified entities are mentioned repeatedly across the main content of the current web page. All potential options will go through a final deduplication process to produce the final list of options presented in the options pane (Figure 1c ) in the sidebar. We chose and tuned these heuristics based on our internal usage and pilot testing results. In the future, more advanced NLP techniques could be used to augment the current set of heuristics.",

At the end of each sensemaking episode, we prompted them to review how well the system did in inferring what they thought was important, and tuned the score function heuristics accordingly (favoring recall over precision).

As the user browses more content and spreads his or her attention on different content blocks, the order of these criteria changes accordingly in real-time, which provides the user with an ambient awareness of what the system thinks are important. To provide users with the flexibility to override the system's ranking, they can right-click on a criterion and use the \"pin this criterion\" feature to pin it at the top (Figure 1i ). They can additionally specify their own order of preferences by dragging and dropping to reorder the criteria in the table view, which will automatically pin a criterion if it is not already pinned.

            "text": "One way for Crystalline to actively manage the relationships among the collected information is to automatically merge similar criteria together into criteria groups (indicated by a \"multiple items\" icon at the end, see Figure 1e ). To achieve this, we leverage recent advances in transformer machine learning models such as Universal Sentence Encoder [13] and BERT [28] that can encode textual content into semantically meaningful vector representations called embeddings [43] , i.e., two or more semantically close pieces of content will also be close in the embedding vector space (measured by a distance metric, e.g., the cosine similarity distance between vectors [113] ). Crystalline computes an embedding for every criterion as the average of its own embedding and its corresponding evidence snippet, and automatically merges criteria that are within a specified semantic distance threshold to each other into a group. For example, as shown in Figure 3a , the system automatically merges \"Right to Left\" (taken from the option \"Splide\") and \"RTL\" (taken from the option \"Swiper\") together since they are semantically similar. The distance threshold was determined empirically through iterative pilot testing. This has the benefit of reducing clutter while helping users make connections among the information that they have seen, which is reported by prior work as one of the difficult steps during sensemaking and schematization [37, 96, 106] . In case the system fails to automatically group similar criteria together, users can use drag and drop to manually make the grouping. Similarly, users can easily split a criteria group by right-clicking on the group and hitting the \"split this criteria group\" menu item.",

Since there is not a gold standard comparison table, we evaluated the correctness of Crystalline's automatic approaches by how much editing participants had to do in order to fix Crystalline's mistakes and make sure that all the content in the table was eventually filled out and ranked correctly according to their understanding as per the study protocol. As shown in Table 2 (b), participants only had to perform on average 12.2 edits to the automatically generated comparison tables, compared to the 51.3 actions that they had to manually perform in the baseline Unakite condition (the difference is statistically significant, < 0.01). Among these, edits that are related to collecting information, such as manually selecting information and capture (0.92 times), renaming (1.92 times), and deleting information (0.50 times) were minimal, suggesting that our combination of NLP and behavioral signal heuristics was working effectively to collect information that the users thought was important. However, participants pinned or reordered the criteria that were automatically ranked by Crystalline on average 5.42 times (SD = 2.27 times). One possible explanation is that the universal scoring functions (in Table 1 ) did not necessarily apply to every single participant, suggesting the need for a more sophisticated and personalized scoring mechanism in future iterations of Crystalline and systems that leverage signals from users' natural browsing behavior.",

For example, P4 said: \"I think being able to read something like this [Crystalline table] is going to make a big difference when you're banging your head against the wall trying to understand why this particularly old API was chosen, I mean, especially when the guy who wrote the code was long gone, I could at least 'read a transcription of his mind' in some sense.\" Here, we see preliminary evidence that our approach of automatically collecting and organizing information on behalf of developers is useful and valuable.

However, the performance reported on the web pages used in the study is not necessarily representative of how Crystalline would operate even on web pages of these types for users in general. In addition, Crystalline currently relies heavily on the overall structure of the web pages being standard, meaning that a page uses HTML tags appropriately according to their semantics (e.g., enclosing headers and list items in <h> and <li> tags rather than wrapping everything with <div> tags) and that there is a strong semantic coherence between a section header and its corresponding content.

We mitigate these risks in the study setup by: 1) having participants perform a practice task for each condition simulating what they would have to do in the real tasks; 2) choosing the study tasks based on actual questions that are discussed by developers on Stack Overflow and other popular programming community forums; and 3) providing participants with sufficient background information and context to help them get prepared. In fact, 7 out of 12 participants reported that the tasks were indeed similar to what they would deal with in their daily work.

Further research would be needed to understand how to collect and organize information from these sources as well as how to integrate them together to provide a more comprehensive picture of the decision making context. Another dimension that is relevant is the lifecycle of the knowledge captured via systems like Unakite and Crystalline. Early evidence from the user study has suggested there is a benefit of Crystalline's organization from the perspective of a subsequent developer who may need to understand a previous developer's decision. Future research could investigate how well developers are able to understand and potentially reuse these automatically assembled knowledge artifacts, possibly without any manual interventions from the initial knowledge authors, which could, in turn, eliminate the starting cost associated with initial knowledge creation [37] and unlock the virtuous cycle of accelerated programming knowledge reuse [37, 82] .",

            "text": "Though the current set of mechanisms for deriving the importance of criteria from implicit behavioral signals generally works well for the setting of this research, there could be situations where a user's default browsing behaviors and patterns fall outside the limited set of signals and heuristics that Crystalline is currently looking for. For example, a user might not have the habit of unconsciously using the cursor as a reading guide or might not interact with the page at all while reading, which would render the tracking of some of the behavioral signals moot. In addition, users could exhibit different or additional behavior patterns when generalized to other tasks domains that involve information-backed decision making, such as comparison shopping, trip-planning, etc. [15, 53] . For example, when interacting with a map view to find the best local dining option, a user may frequently pan around and zoom (in and out) to view different restaurants, and both the duration of stay on a particular restaurant and how many times it is viewed back and forth could be leveraged to approximate the user's interest and investment of effort. One way to address these concerns is to leverage a more diverse set of behavioral signals and potentially signal combinations, such as scrolling, mouse panning, zooming, eye tracking [35, 36, 89, 90] , and facial gestures tracking [70, 117] to collect a more accurate picture of what users are seeing on screen. Another future direction that could be fruitful is to take a machine learning approach instead of the current rule-based approach for approximating content importance using behavioral signals. Specifically, we could leverage recent advances in crowdsourcing and labeling [17, 20, 27, 114] to log, annotate, and construct a largescale data set that maps a variety of behavioral signals to the perceived importance of content blocks that they are triggered on, and train on this data set to obtain scoring functions that would work more widely. Alternatively, an online learning approach could also be promising, where the system continuously learns, adapts, and improves from an individual user's behavior over time, as suggested by Horvitz [62] .",

However, prior work in learning science, such as Bransford et al. [24] , found that people who personally performed the actions of collecting, categorizing, and organizing information were more likely to be able to recall it correctly and in detail, and exhibited increased confidence in the final outcome. This raises an interesting tension and trade-off between full-on automation and direct manipulationfuture research would be required to examine the long term effect on people's learning outcome as well as confidence in their decisions using systems like Crystalline, and determine the appropriate levels and circumstances when automatic information bookkeeping should be applied.",

Our designs were motivated by the growing complexity of the decisions that developers need to make, and the lack of tooling support to help them efficiently gather and synthesize evidence without causing much interruption to their main focus of reading and understanding content online. We introduced Crystalline, a browser extension that instantiates this idea by leveraging natural language processing and users' behavior signals such as mouse movement and dwell time to infer what information to collect and how to organize and prioritize it on behalf of a user. Through a lab study with 12 participants, we found promising evidence that using Crystalline as a copilot to collect and organize information is much faster and more efficient, and the resulting knowledge artifacts are potentially useful and valuable for the initial user as well as for subsequent consumption by people who need to understand the original decision-making context.",

The collected snippets will show up under the \"Uncategorized\" tab in the snippet repository (c) inside the Unakite sidebar (e). The developer can drag a snippet and drop it in one of the cells in the comparison table (b), and mark whether it is positive (green thumbs-up) or negative (red thumbs-down) or just informational (yellow \"i\").

Crystalline will actively look for and remind users of evidence for the same or similar criteria from pages that users have visited but have not yet paid attention to (d).
