During the course of COVID-19, patients develop an increased respiratory drive, which may induce high mechanical strain a known risk factor for Patient Self-Inflicted Lung Injury (P-SILI). We developed a novel Electrical Impedance Tomography-based approach to visualize the Dynamic Relative Regional Strain (DRRS) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and compared these findings with measurements in lung healthy volunteers. DRRS was defined as the ratio of tidal impedance changes and end-expiratory lung impedance within each pixel of the lung region. DRRS values of the ten patients were considerably higher than those of the ten healthy volunteers. On repeated examination, patterns, magnitude and frequency distribution of DRRS were reproducible and in line with the clinical course of the patients. Lung ultrasound scores correlated with the number of pixels showing DRRS values above the derived threshold. Using Electrical Impedance Tomography we were able to generate, for the first time, images of DRRS which might indicate P-SILI in patients suffering from COVID-19.",

Respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia may progress rapidly to an ARDS-like clinical picture with an extremely inhomogeneously damaged lung [2] . CT scans show a lung morphology ranging from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations [3] . These patients often develop, even in the early phase, a severe hypoxemia [4] and a pathologic respiratory drive with high respiratory load. During the course of the disease this increased respiratory drive, which induces high tidal strain and energy loads on the vulnerable lung tissue, increases the risk for Patient Self-Inflicted Lung Injury (P-SILI) [5] . Data from the ROSE trial in patients undergoing assisted spontaneous breathing suggest that high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) might reduce the risk of P-SILI [6] . To date, very little is known about the impact of the high respiratory drive or P-SILI on the fragile lung tissue in COVID-19 patients [7] . It is expected that in COVID-19 lungs the same size of tidal volume will meet a significantly smaller functional lung size and an inhomogeneously distributed lung damage [8] .",

It requires an electrode belt placed around the patient's chest to apply alternating unnoticeable electrical currents in the low mA range. These electrical currents pass through the chest creating low voltages at the electrodes, from which up to 100 tomographic images per second are reconstructed. These high timeresolution images reflect the regional electrical properties within the lung tissue, which are influenced by the respiratory and cardiac cycles. In contrast to CT scans EIT-images do not display morphological but functional information showing regional tidal ventilation, local lung recruitment, expiratory time constants and the distribution of lung perfusion to name but a few. EIT also measures end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI), a parameter which correlates with FRC not only at the global but also on a regional or pixel level [14] . This impedance at end expiration has a significant influence on the breath-induced changes in the electrical properties to be presented in this study (Fig. 1) .",

We identified the regions of interest (ROI) within the chest contours of the right and left lung based on a three-dimensional thoracic model. This model was created from computed tomography (CT) scans [16] . Knowing that absolute tidal volumes in milliliters cannot be obtained by EIT without prior calibration [17] , it has been shown that impedance change (dZ) increases linearly with change in lung volume (dV) [18, 19] . Thus, EIT pixel values should reflect impedance changes that are proportional to the regional change in volume during tidal ventilation. In addition, Reinartz et al. and other groups showed that end-expiratory lung impedance increased linearly with end-expiratory lung volume [20] [21] [22] . Based on the above proportionalities it is further assumed that in healthy lungs the ratio of dZ to EELI is constant, also. Therefore, after determining breath-wise dZ and EELI values for each pixel, normalized distributions for dZ and EELI were calculated and dZ plotted against EELI. Based on the data points of each lung two regression lines representing the physiological DRRS within each one of the lungs were plotted. From these regressions, for each pixel and EELI value an ideal dZ was calculated and an image showing the distribution of ideal dZ was generated. The term ideal dZ was chosen to indicate the ideal matching of EELI and dZ reflected by the regression line representing the behavior of healthy lung tissue in both, healthy and sick lungs. The term ideal although reflects the therapeutic goal of maintaining the ideal relationship between tidal volumes and end-expiratory lung volumes by avoiding excessive PEEP-induced lung volumes (static strain) or excessive tidal volumes (dynamic strain) [9, 23] . Finally, the normalized dZ image was divided by the ideal dZ image, the result of which is an image of DRRS. The calculation of DRRS is schematic shown in Fig. 2. ",

DRRS values higher than 2 seem to reflect pathologies caused either by the disease itself, P-SILI or both. Our sequential measurements showed that high and increasing DRRS values appear to be indicators of increasing lung injury while decreasing lower DRRS seem to indicate the recovery of patients. Furthermore, the sequential measurements taken three days apart reveal that the location and pattern of the DRRS distribution within the lungs were reproducible despite the removal and reapplication of the EIT belt. The individual correlations for both lungs may have contributed to this apparent robustness. These findings confirm the reliability of EIT shown in previous studies [27] Therefore, EIT in general and the parameter DRRS in particular may offer the potential as monitoring tool for regional strain during the course of the disease.",

At this time, the histogram showed an overall reduction and narrowing of the DRRS values despite a decline of her clinical status. We speculate that this interesting finding might be explained by a PEEP-induced increase in end-expiratory lung volume while tidal volumes remained constantly low. However, no tidal volumes were measured during the initial examination under spontaneous breathing to compare with. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the small VT as part of the lung protective ventilation strategy applied in this patient might have caused this effect alone or in conjunction with the high PEEP.

It is however questionable whether this gain in lung volume should be considered a strain enhancer or rather a factor decreasing the strain [29] .
