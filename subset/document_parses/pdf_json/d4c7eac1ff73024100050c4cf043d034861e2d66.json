Nonetheless, several benefits, proliferation of vigor and anonymity of the Internet create a permanent breeding ground for all forms of cyber threats globally and the UAE in particular including all sorts of online crime like sexual harassment, deception, cyborgs, compromised safety and fraudulent engagements among others leading to manipulation of user credentials, perceptions, exposure to offensive content, financial losses, psychological and physical harm. In this paper, we examine a variety of Cyberbullying offensive and preventive strategies available globally giving particular attention to the UAE, examine the phenomena of risky Internet use of ICT tools and its relationship to Cyberbullying and assess the effectiveness of existing anti-Cyberbullying strategies used in the UAE. The findings and recommendations of the paper can be useful to government policy-maker and online crime regulators who intend to effectively curb Cyberbullying in the region.",

Meanwhile, the UAE has upgraded its cybercrime legislation to take account of technological and social change (from Federal Law No. 2/2006, to Federal Law No. 5/2012) by imposing new fences and strict penalties on information technology crimes. Bullying is normally intended to gain power over a victim especially in the case of students in primary, secondary and higher institutions of learning. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is more severe compared to traditional bullying due to the fact that it attracts a wider scope and the bullies are anonymous. Moreover, with cyberbullying, detection may require organizations and government to recruit experts with the necessary experience to manually classify online content, whether it is harmful to the online users or not and applying unsupervised tools and learning algorithms to automatically perform the classification. Meanwhile, most Cyberbullying incidents occur away from school campuses driven by technology which allows information to spread in a short spell triggered by conflicts within schools and may lead to violence which disrupts learning and concentration of the students. Research shows that females are more emotionally offended by the inappropriate online content than males.",

For instance, Abaido [1] conducted a quantitative study on the extent of Cyberbullying by collecting and analyzing data from over 200 university students in the UAE especially considering the prevalence rates of Cyberbullying, the different forms of podiums predatory to Cyberbullying, the views of the youth and whether they preferred to remain silent after different forms of Cyberbullying incidents among others. Moreover, Abaido's research revealed that social and cultural restraints among most societies in the region create the biggest impasse toward reporting and declaration of Cyberbullying incidents in university students. Further, Abaido [1] analysis revealed 91% of the students confirmed the The findings from Abaido's research revealed that 72% of the respondents agreed that the Cyberbullying issue was very common among the youth between 14 and 18 years with several negative outcomes like depression, school dropouts, substance abuse and sleeping disorders among others, and the same was in turn reported by Diener West and Leaf and Privitera and Campbell [14] . Despite the previous findings deliberations and efforts narrowing down the Cyberbullying problem to the youth, the researcher envisages a deeper penetration of this problem in all age groups from 8 to over 60 years fueled by the high penetration of the Internet in the UAE to the tune of 90% by 2020, the widespread use of smart devices, the explosion of online gaming and betting, the intensification of IoT technologies and the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 that limited the public and the entire global population to working from home with the jobless limited only to social media platforms for chatting and bullying others as the only way to kill boredom, hence escalating the Cyberbullying problem globally, the UAE in particular.",

Additionally, Robertson and Amna [15] emphasized that Cyberbullying can no longer be ignored by any school management in the UAE by urging management in all schools to enforce and communicate appropriate use of Internet policies to all teachers, students and parents from time to time. Moreover, any school that fails to observe such policies shall be punished under the new Dubai schools law (Executive Council Resolution No. 2 of 2017) which requires all schools to have an obligation toward \"student's safety and protection online\" through due care and protection of student's rights intensified by existing telecommunication regulatory authority's Internet access management policy that sets appropriate measures, restrictions and approach through which Internet content containing pornography, nudity, gambling and any other unacceptable content to be blocked sets clear ramifications for perpetrators.",

Moreover, the prevalent form of such incidents includes (i) harassment by sending offensive messages; (ii) sexting especially by sharing nude pictures of someone online illegally; (iii) flaming or sending vulgar messages online; (iv) cyberstalking or online threatening messages; (v) impersonation by illegally breaking into someone's account and (vi) trickery or forcing someone to reveal sensitive information online among others [9] .

Broadband Internet penetration figures are even higher in the GCC, for instance Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are ranked among the world top ten with Internet penetration at 98.7%, 95% and 95.7%, respectively [7] . Meanwhile, most victims report poor interpersonal relations, low self-esteem and depression among others [5, 6, 12] .

Besides, the Dubai government established a new schools law on Cyberbullying which requires all schools to establish and implement student's online safety and protection policy as part of their cybersecurity programme (Executive Council Resolution No. 2, 2017) in addition to efforts from the UAE Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to block unauthorized sites and those with profane content in the region.",

This claim implies cyber addiction for children which increases exposure to profane content, nudity and joining wrong groups that may persuade them into committing online crime and in turn lead to an overall change in lifestyle, poor performance in school or dropping out completely. Addiction is also fueled by the fast paced growth of cyber technology, ambient home environments with 24/7 high-speed Internet connectivity which facilitates engagement of students into off campus Cyberbullying activities and the lack of proper legislative guidance among others.",

Additionally, it is worth noting that everything done online leaves a digital footprint upon which investigation and prosecution can start or be evidenced, therefore, parents need to be vigilant to report any form of bullying incidents in the community to the nearest police station for further investigation and traceability despite the fact that victims are always surrounded by a deep sense of fear, loneliness and helplessness with psychological and emotional scars that need the attention of experts.",

Moreover, significant gaps still exist in the body of literature especially in terms of detection and identification of the victims and bullies with little efforts invested into technologies and mechanisms for uncovering accurate and reliable information on the trends and impact of Cyberbullying, limited forensic investigations and efforts into protecting the chain of custody log to ensure admissibility in courts of law. Moreover, if the integrity of evidence collected after Cyberbullying incidents is not handled by following the right forensic evidence collection and integrity protection guidelines, then most of the perpetrators will go unpunished leading to further escalation of the Cyberbullying problems globally, the UAE in particular. Therefore, efforts are needed in designing strategies to improve digital forensic investigation, efforts to properly handle the Cyberbullying chain of custody log and tools for accurate prosecution of perpetrators by the UAE government in addition to enhancing partnerships between federal entities, private and public sector organizations, parents, schools and universities to develop consolidated efforts for identification of the bullies and victims. This will in turn address the anonymity problem, harness the jurisdictional boundary challenges through international cooperation and collaborations, hence reducing the Cyberbullying problems in all Emirates of the UAE. In the future, the researcher intends to explore the extent of the Cyberbullying problem in the UAE public and private sector organizations.",
