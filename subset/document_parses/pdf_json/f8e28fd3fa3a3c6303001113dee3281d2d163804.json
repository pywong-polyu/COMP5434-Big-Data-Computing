The second hurdle was to coordinate testing at multiple drive-through sites in the 3-day window before surgery, to minimize exposure to patients and staff and to ensure the tests were resulted before surgery. Third was the challenge of rapidly iterating the protocols to a dynamic situation and communicating evolving changes effectively to the clinical team. Finally, before the shelter-in-place mandate, only selected groups of patients scheduled for surgery underwent advanced preoperative evaluation before sedation and anesthesia. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the need for establishing consistent standards for preoperative assessment of any patient undergoing sedation and anesthesia. As a result, all patients, regardless of anesthesia or sedation class, were evaluated virtually by the APEC staff, which also allowed for universal COVID-19 symptom screening. FIGURE 1.

We present 2 transformative and sustained changes to our preoperative assessment process initiated during the COVID-19 surge that were pivotal to our success in resuming elective surgeries. These preoperative interventions are the ''overnight'' transition to 100% virtual clinic appointments and the widespread implementation of multiple COVID-19 testing pathways. The improvements were accomplished by redeployment of preoperative clinic staff to a work-at-home model, moving to preoperative video visits, incorporating universal COVID-19 screening, and the development and refinement of previously non-existent preoperative respiratory pathogen testing protocols.",

Staff made every attempt to obtain prior medical records and testing results, limiting the need for new testing. Efforts were also made not to use commercial labs for standard preoperative testing to minimize patient travel and maximize social distancing.

Earlier challenges to video visit adoption became more evident including enrolling patients into our electronic health portal, patients' lack of adequate internet access or usable electronic devices, and access to interpreter services. Patients previously deemed too complex for virtual visits now had no in-person option for preoperative assessment. Vital signs such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate were rarely assessed during the virtual visit. Consistent with published studies on telehealth visits, 10 our patient experience surveys showed strong acceptance for virtual preoperative appointments.",

The inability to test certain patients, either due to patient refusal or other contraindication, poses ethical concerns. Clinician agreement on the appropriate preoperative testing windows continues to evolve as testing availability and accuracy improves, best-practice patterns emerge from increased preoperative testing, and as our local prevalence changes over time. Additional considerations in the post-surge COVID-19 era include increasing access to telehealth and testing in underserved areas or for vulnerable patient populations, assessing efficacy of telehealth versus in-person evaluations on clinical outcomes, establishing sustainable reimbursement models for virtual health visits, and expanding options to obtain reliable remote physical examination and vital signs. 11 Our multipronged approach led to successful and widespread implementation at our health system with universal preoperative virtual assessments and accessible COVID-19 testing for all patients presenting for any procedural intervention. These protocols may provide guidance when determining emerging best practice COVID-19 pathways for preoperative optimization during the post-surge era while ensuring patient and health care provider safety.",
