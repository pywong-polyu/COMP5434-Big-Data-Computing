            "text": "Over the last decade, advances in gaming technology, increased availability and affordability of high-speed internet have made internet gaming more engaging and attractive than ever (1, 2) . There has been a growing recognition of internet gaming disorder (IGD) as a psychiatric condition that is associated with significant impairment and distress (3) . A review by Mihara et al. reported that the global prevalence of IGD ranged from 0.7 to 27.5% (4), while another review by Stevens et al. reported the global prevalence of IGD to be 3.05% (5) . The variation in prevalence of IGD has been attributed to the lack of consensus in the diagnosis of IGD, with there being heterogeneity in the choice of instruments, the diagnostic and intervention processes for IGD (4) (5) (6) . However, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases 11 (ICD-11) do provide guidelines to identify individuals affected by IGD. The DSM-5 has proposed IGD as a condition that warrants further research evaluation. The DSM-5 states that an individual is likely to have the disease if they have at least 5 out of 9 diagnostic criteria: preoccupation, psychological withdrawal, tolerance, failure to cut down or stop, loss of interest in previously enjoyable pursuits, constant gaming despite ramifications, lying about the extent of use, and gaming to cope with negative affect, or that gaming has led to significant psychosocial impairments. More recently, the ICD-11 formally recognizes Internet gaming as a disorder. Based on the ICD-11, gaming disorder could be classified into either online or offline gaming disorder, and individuals are diagnosed with the disorder if they cannot control the use of games, or have been prioritizing gaming over other activities, or have had exacerbated gaming behavior despite negative life consequences. Prior to these characterizations and the inclusion of gaming disorder in the respective diagnostic manuals, researchers have investigated into the issues of problematic Internet use (PIU) In fact, gaming-related disorder might be one of the subtypes of PIU, as highlighted by Fineberg et al. (7) . Other issues related to PIU include that of compulsive sexual behaviors, purchasing items on the Internet, gambling or the excessive use of social media (7) .",

Today, the Internet is freely available in university campuses for the promotion of academic activities. However, this has made internet gaming an easily accessible and popular recreational activity, making university students vulnerable to IGD (9) . A study of 7,022 1st-year college students in Mexico found a IGD prevalence rate of 5.2% (9) . In China, a study of 922 university freshmen in Hunan province found an IGD prevalence rate of 5.5% (10) . One study of 221 Italian university students found a prevalence rate as high as 14.9% of IGD (11) . Medical students may be more vulnerable to developing an addiction to games, due to the additional and unique challenges they face as compared to other university students. A study conducted in Ain-Shams University, Egypt found that the prevalence of IGD was 10.9% among students in the medical faculty, as compared to 9.3% in the overall university student body (12) .",

The increased emotional and academic demands of medical school can have a negative effect on medical students, and can precipitate psychopathologies such as depression, anxiety, and burnout (14, 15) . This is reflected in the higher rates of anxiety (14) and addictive behaviors in medical students compared to the general population (16) . A previous metaanalysis found a high pooled prevalence of internet addiction (30.1%) among medical students, approximately five times that of the general population (16) . With many medical students turning to the internet as a potential coping strategy, potential effects of IGD and its co-morbidities on medical student's academic and professional performance should be considered. Pathological use of video games may have negative consequences for those affected such as relationship conflicts, sleep problems or occupational functioning (17, 18) . Additionally, IGD typically does not present in isolation. Previous research has reported an association between IGD and anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms as well as social phobia/anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5, 19, 20) . IGD and its co-morbidities may also have repercussions on patient care in the long run as psychological distress in medical students is associated with cynicism, decreased empathy and an unwillingness to care for the chronically ill (21) .",

With stress symptoms being a risk factor for developing IGD (34) , the stress of the transition period could contribute to higher rates of IGD in younger medical students. The meta-regression analysis which we have undertaken revealed that male gender was not a significant moderator, and it did not account for the high heterogeneity in the pooled prevalence of IGD we reported. This is not congruent with the findings of prior studies, in that they reported the rates of IGD to be higher amongst males, in comparison to females (5) . Prior studies explained the discrepancy in the rates by highlighting that males tend to be prone toward gaming (5), whereas females tend to be prone toward the use of social networking sites (4, 35, 36) . One of the other contributing factors is that the gaming industry has been focused mainly on targeting males, and this could have increased the vulnerability of males in developing IGD (37) . In spite of this, in our results, we found an exception to this trend. Few empirical studies have specifically studied female gamers, with almost all research on IGD focusing on male gamers (38) . However, one study found that there were gender differences in how IGD scores were predicted by several variables. Female gamer's IGD predictors included higher time spent online and higher scores in competition as gaming motives. In contrast, male gamer's IGD predictors included higher scores in coping and higher depressive symptoms compared to females (39) . More can be done to research potential links between IGD and female medical students, such as the differing motives and predictors that female medical students may have. Several factors with regards to the studies included could possibly explain this as well. Kurnianingsih et al. (30) reported the lowest proportion of males (37.13%) but the highest prevalence of students with IGD (16.67%). This study had a large sample size of 438, which was around 19.6% of the total pooled sample size used. This could have influenced the results.",

However, it should be considered that both Middle Eastern studies used Lemmen's IGD 9-item Short Scale (40) which was found to have report higher prevalence estimates in a previous meta-analysis (5) . This could be due to the dichotomous nature of the IGD 9-Item Short Scale. The scale consists of 9 yes-or-no questions based on the DSM-5 criteria for IGD, with a point awarded for each question answered with \"yes.\" A score of 5 or higher indicates a disordered gamer.",

Firstly, to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that examined the prevalence of IGD among medical students in different countries. Secondly, our search strategy has included a wide range of databases. Despite these inherent strengths, one of the major limitations of this review was the number of studies that could be identified. We were limited to the identification of only 6 studies, and this small nature might be since medical students are a rather unique population of interest, and this being a niche area for scientific investigation. In addition, the studies used are based on 4 different countries (2 from India, 2 from Indonesia, 1 from Saudi Arabia, 1 from Egypt). We could not locate studies conducted Europe, North America, East Asia, and Australia during the search. This limitation is noteworthy because it limits the generalizability of the results. Further studies focusing on the prevalence of IGD among medical students are required from these continents. Secondly, the studies included in this meta-analysis were all cross-sectional. Hence, this meta-analysis is not able to demonstrate causality or temporal association between IGD and medical studies. Thirdly, we could not perform subgroup analysis to compare the prevalence of IGD between undergraduate and postgraduate medical students due to the nature of the reviews available. The study by Balhara et al. (27) included in the review had a mixed sample of both undergraduate and postgraduate medical students.",

Estimates of prevalence of IGD continue to be associated with significant variability (5) . While many assessment tools may appear to be quite similar, they have been found to demonstrate varying psychometric properties (41) . Research regarding IGD is a rapidly evolving field and findings may change with new studies being conducted. More studies involving medical students could be conducted in areas with high internet prevalence rates that were not included in this review. Notably, East Asian, North American, European and Australian cohorts. With the subgroup analysis finding differences in prevalence of IGD across different regions significant, further studies could be done to compare cohorts in such regions. Moreover, with the onset of COVID-19, there is likely a change in the usage patterns amongst individuals, and greater reliance on the Internet for academic purposes. In a recent narrative review by Gjoneska et al. (7), the authors have also highlighted several research priorities upon consideration of the impact of COVID-9 on such problematic behaviors. Some of the research priorities that might be relevant to this current study include the need to also examine the psychological well-being of medical students who are gaming excessively.",

With a greater understanding of the signs and symptoms of IGD, prompt recognition could allow for early referral and intervention by mental health professionals. This would allow for further deterioration of the student's IGD and potential negative effects (42) . It is also of importance to screen for other psychiatric comorbidity including sleep deprivation. With IGD having links to poorer sleep quality (43) and increased psychological distress (20) , this could lead to impairments in medical student's ability to perform academically and professionally. With sleep deprivation's detrimental effects on medical student's attention performance (44) and decision making (45) , this is of concern for medical students and patient safety as well. By teaching about IGD, medical educators can raise awareness of the condition amongst medical students. They can also offer cognitive behavioral therapy as a firstline therapy, to improve IGD symptoms and comorbid depression (42) .",
