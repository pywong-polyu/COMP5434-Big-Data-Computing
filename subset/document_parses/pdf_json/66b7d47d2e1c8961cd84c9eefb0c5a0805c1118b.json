But, if not treated promptly, the asymptomatic or mild cases may develop severe pneumonia, even end up dead. The therapeutical emphasis of COVID-19 was to antiviral early that would decrease the peak viral load and delay the progression of lung lesions; thus this would reduce the hospitalization-fatality ratio [25] .The mean time from illness onset to severity for H7N9 was shorter than COVID-19, the key to controlling disease progression was early detection and timely treatment.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection is triggered by binding of the spike protein of the virus to ACE2, which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs [26] . There have been hypothesized that the use of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (ARBs) may have effect the course of COVID-19 [27, 28] . Nevertheless, further evidence are required before any recommendations are made about starting or withdrawing ACE-inhibitor and ARB medications.",

This may imply that there was a therapeutic window that could be exploited before developing into severe cases. Besides, we found that chronic heart disease was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severe cases compared with H7N9 and H1N1. Also, the factor that the mild symptoms may contribute to the pandemic of COVID-19. Furthermore, according to the neutrophil responses and the typical CT findings, SARS-CoV-2 infections were less likely to develop secondary infections, which maybe suggest that the progression of COVID-19 is more insidious.",
