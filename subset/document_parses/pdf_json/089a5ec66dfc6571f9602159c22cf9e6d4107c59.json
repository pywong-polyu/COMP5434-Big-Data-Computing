            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most economically important viral diseases that can affect livestock. In the last 70 years, use of an inactivated whole antigen vaccine has contributed to the eradication of disease from many developed nations. However, recent outbreaks in Europe and Eastern Asia demonstrated that infection can spread as wildfire causing economic and social devastation. Therefore, it is essential to develop new control strategies that could confer early protection and rapidly stop disease spread. Live attenuated vaccines (LAV) are one of the best choices to obtain a strong early and long-lasting protection against viral diseases. In proof of concept studies, we previously demonstrated that \"synonymous codon deoptimization\" could be applied to the P1 capsid coding region of the viral genome to derive attenuated FMDV serotype A12 strains. Here, we demonstrate that a similar approach can be extended to the highly conserved non-structural P2 and P3 coding regions, providing a backbone for multiple serotype FMDV LAV development. Engineered codon deoptimized P2, P3 or P2, and P3 combined regions were included into the A 24 Cruzeiro infectious clone optimized for vaccine production, resulting in viable progeny that exhibited different degrees of attenuation in cell culture, in mice, and in the natural host (swine). Derived strains were thoroughly characterized in vitro and in vivo. Our work demonstrates that overall, the entire FMDV genome tolerates codon deoptimization, highlighting the potential of using this technology to derive novel improved LAV candidates.",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals. Its etiologic agent is the FMD virus (FMDV), a member of the Picornaviridae family (Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . The virus genome consists of a single-strand positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 8500 nucleotides in length that encodes for a long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5 and 3 ends. The ORF is mainly divided in four regions, the Leader protein, and P1, P2, and P3 immature polyproteins. Processing of the polyproteins by three viral encoded proteinases (Lpro, 2A, and 3Cpro) yield four structural proteins, namely 1A (VP4), 1B (VP2), 1C (VP3), 1D (VP1), and non-structural (NS), Lpro, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3 distinct copies of 3B (VPg), 3Cpro, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3Dpol, mature proteins. FMDV can infect over 70 animal species including domestic and wild animals, mostly cattle, swine, sheep, goat, and deer (Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . FMD is listed by the International Organization of Animal Health (OIE) as a reportable disease and upon disclosure of an outbreak, severe limitation of movement, and trading are imposed (OIE, 2018) . Control of disease in FMD-free countries usually involves culling of infected and in-contact animals, animal movement restrictions, thorough disinfection of affected premises and, sometimes, vaccination with an inactivated virus vaccine (Pluimers et al., 2002) . Animals are prophylactically vaccinated in countries where the disease is endemic. Although harmless to human health, FMD outbreaks cause severe economic loss. For example, the 2001 United Kingdom outbreak carried an economic burden that exceeded US$12B and impacted the economy of affected areas and the nation as a whole (Mahy, 2004) .",

            "text": "The commercially available vaccine is a preparation of binary ethylenimine (BEI)-inactivated whole virus formulated with adjuvants (Doel, 2003) . However, novel recombinant vaccines are under development. Among the most advanced, a replication defective human adenovirus 5 that delivers empty FMDV capsids (Ad5-FMD) has been evaluated in recent years obtaining a conditional license in the United States (Grubman et al., 2010) . Similarly to the inactivated vaccine, the Ad5-FMD vaccine requires about 7 days to protect cattle and swine against FMDV infection providing a relatively short-lived immunity as compared to the immunity induced by natural infection (Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . The Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Research Alliance (GFRA), an international organization whose ultimate mission is eradication of FMD, has set the development of next generation improved vaccines and biotherapeutics, as one of their five most important goals. Historically it has been shown that live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) confer rapid and long-lasting protection against viral infection (Minor, 2015) . Indeed, LAVs against smallpox and rinderpest viruses have resulted in the eradication of these viruses (Glynn and Glynn, 2004; Roeder et al., 2013; Greenwood, 2014) . Similar approaches have been used for measles to reduce virus propagation in some parts of the world (Moss and Strebel, 2011) . We and others have explored this possibility by introducing mutations or deletions in different regions of the viral genome that encode virulence factors Uddowla et al., 2012; Kloc et al., 2017; Rai et al., 2017; de los Santos et al., 2018) . For instance, substitutions of two conserved amino acid residues in SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS (SAP) domain within the NS viral protease L pro coding region of FMDV A12 rendered a highly attenuated mutant virus (de los Santos et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) . Interestingly, when the modified attenuated strain was evaluated as a LAV candidate in swine, complete protection against challenge with wild type virus was observed even at 2 days post vaccination (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2012) . However, the small number of attenuating mutations in the SAP mutant poses a considerable risk for reversion to virulence. This is not surprising, given the high rate of mutation for RNA viruses; ergo, a larger number of attenuating mutations should be considered in the design of the ideal LAV candidate. More recently, and based on previous studies done for FMDV A 12 (Mason et al., 1997; Chinsangaram et al., 1998) , a FMDV A 24 vaccine candidate engineered with a deletion of the L pro coding region (leaderless virus, FMDVLL 3B3D ) containing DIVA markers built in the NS proteins 3B and 3D, and with capacity to swapping capsid-coding sequences, has been described (Uddowla et al., 2012) . The FMDVLL 3B3D virus was incapable of causing FMD in cattle and pigs and failed to spread the disease to contact animals when applied live (Uddowla et al., 2012; Eschbaumer et al., 2020) . However, BEI inactivated FMDVLL 3B3D vaccine was very effective in cattle and is currently at early stages of development as a safe chemically inactivated vaccine platform (Hardham et al., 2020) , but not as a LAV due to its limited replication and therefore low induced immunity when applied as a live virus in the natural host.",

            "text": "A relatively new approach for the construction of LAVs involves the use of synonymous deoptimization. All biological systems are characterized by a determined frequency of unequal synonymous codon usage for each amino acid, resulting in a particular codon bias (Ikemura, 1981) . Independently of the \"codon bias\" concept, synonymous codon-pairs might also be used at frequencies that differ from those statistically predicted, a phenomenon that has been defined as \"codon-pair bias\" and is species specific (Moura et al., 2007) . By applying this technology to recode the nucleotides of polio, influenza, respiratory syncytial and dengue viruses, viable viruses were derived by reverse genetics displaying severe attenuation in vitro and in vivo (Coleman et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013; Le Nou\u00ebn et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2015; Stauft et al., 2018 Stauft et al., , 2019a . Furthermore, applying codon-pair bias deoptimization to other viruses such as, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (Park et al., 2020) , classical swine fever virus , human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (Martrus et al., 2013) , Zika virus (Li et al., 2018) , or vesicular stomatitis virus (Wang et al., 2015) , has also resulted in attenuated strains with potential for LAV development. In proof of concept studies, we demonstrated that codon-pair bias deoptimization is tolerated by FMDV (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2016) . Deoptimization of the P1 structural protein coding region resulted in a highly attenuated FMDV strain (A12-P1Deopt) in mice that when administered at relatively low doses induced a protective immune response against lethal challenge with wild type (WT) FMDV, offering a \"safety margin\" of about 10,000. Virulence studies demonstrated that A12-P1Deopt virus was also attenuated in the natural host. A 100x higher dose of A12-P1Deopt relatively to A12-WT virus, was required to induce similar disease in swine. Additionally, significantly high levels of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) could be detected in sera predicting protection against FMD.",

The high level of variability in FMDV capsid proteins, as represented by the multiple serotypes and subtypes of this virus, reflects FMDV exposure to selective pressures and adaptation (Domingo et al., 2003; Carrillo et al., 2005) . In contrast, other regions of the viral genome are more conserved and can be substituted between serotypes in infectious FMDV clones without affecting viability (Almeida et al., 1998; Uddowla et al., 2012 Uddowla et al., , 2013 Lee et al., 2017) . Manipulation of more conserved regions of the viral genome to generate attenuation would allow synthesis of a viral backbone that could be consistently used to generate chimeras with the P1 structural regions of the different serotypes. In fact, Uddowla et al. (2012) described the use of restriction enzymes flanking the P1 region that could be used for high throughput capsid swapping.",

Among the different obtained viable mutants, A24-P2/P3Deopt was the most attenuated and induced an adaptive immune response in vivo, in mice and swine. These results confirm the use of codon deoptimization to recode FMDV nucleotide sequences as a strategy to reduce its virulence.

In order to test if deoptimization would work for the highly conserved P2 and/or P3 regions of FMDV, we designed viral genomes in which codon usage was deoptimized by replacement with a non-preferred codon (Burns et al., 2006) . Deoptimized sequences contained 320, 367, or 687 nucleotide substitutions throughout P2, P3, or P2/P3 coding regions, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1) . In addition, negative antigenic markers were constructed in the 3B and 3Dpol viral proteins, (Uddowla et al., 2012 ; Supplementary Figure 2B ). Modified sequences were synthetically obtained from a commercial supplier and subsequently replaced into the pA 24 -WT FMDV infectious cDNA clone (Rieder et al., 2005 ; Supplementary Figures 2A,B) . CpG odds ratio analysis, which normalizes the CpG incidence to the expected CpG frequency, was performed on the full polyprotein ORF of all three deoptimized candidates, the parental sequence and 1055 independent full length FMDV ORF sequences downloaded from NCBI. Under no selective pressure, the CpG odd ratio should be 1, while values of 0.78 and 1.23 have previously been proposed as representing under or overrepresented CpG odds ratios within a particular RNA virus sequence (Cardon et al., 1994; Karlin et al., 1997; Cheng et al., 2013; Xia, 2020) . The CpG odds ratio of A 24 Cru (0.80) was very similar to the average CpG odds ratio calculated for the ORF sequences downloaded from NCBI (0.81 \u00b1 0.028) (range = 0.74-0.96) indicating that CpG dinucleotide is underrepresented in A 24 Cru and has been negatively selected considering the multiple FMDV genomes (Supplementary Figure 2C) . In contrast, the A24-P2Deopt, A24-P3Deopt, and A24-P2/P3Deopt had CpG odds ratios of 0.96, 1.03, and 1.22, respectively, representing values larger than the average calculated from the database (Supplementary Figure 2C) . It has previously been observed that CpG odds ratios increase when the GC % of a viral genome increase, however, the increased CpG odds ratio observed in the deoptimized mutants actually occurs with a slight decrease to the overall GC % of their genomes (Supplementary Figure 2C ; Cheng et al., 2013) .",

In BHK-21 cells viruses with P2 or P3 deoptimized sequences displayed a plaque morphology similar to WT, however, viruses containing both deoptimized P2 and P3 displayed a small plaque phenotype ( Figure 1A) , suggesting that the bigger the deoptimized region the greater the attenuation, as previously described for other picornaviruses (Coleman et al., 2008) .",

A similar phenotype was detected in IBRS-2 cells but the end point titer of the A24-P2/P3Deopt virus was about one log lower (10 6 pfu/ml) in comparison to the titers of A24-WT or A24-P2Deopt or A24-P3Deopt viruses ( Figure 1C) . Interestingly, in cells that have a functional innate immune system, such as secondary kidney cells derived from swine or bovines, all deoptimized viruses had an end point titer that was between 2 and 4 logs lower than the yield attained by WT virus (Figures 1D,E) . These results indicated that all, specially A24P2/P3, mutant viruses were attenuated in vitro, with stronger phenotypes under selective pressures presumably driven by cellular immune responses.",

To determine the dynamics of these cleavage events in cells infected with deoptimized viruses, the lysates from LFPK\u03b1v\u03b26 time course infection were subjected to Western blotting analysis ( Figure 1F) . A significant delay in the expression of the structural protein VP1 was detected for the P2 and P3 deoptimized viruses as compared to A24 WT at 4 and 7 hpi. Detection of VP1 was minimal in samples infected with P2/P3 deoptimized viruses which correlated with lower viral titers (6.6 \u00d7 10 e1pfu/ml) at those time points. Initial cleavage of eIF-4G was detected in all infected samples, as evidenced by the disappearance of the full length 220 kDa protein and the appearance of cleavage products of about \u223c120 kDa. However, cleavage of these secondary products was delayed for all deoptimized viruses when compared to A24 WT. Interestingly, cleavage of G3BP1 cellular protein was not detected in any of the samples infected with deoptimized viruses while processing occurred as expected for the WT virus. These results suggest that the slower rate of eIF-4G full degradation and the inability to cleave G3BP1 by the deoptimized viruses may result in the induction of a stronger cellular antiviral response thereby leading to attenuation in host cells.",

(2005) that showed consistency for multiple serotypes including A, C, and O (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2013). Animals were inoculated with different doses of FMDV: A24-P2Deopt, A24-P3Deopt or A24-P2/P3Deopt or FMDV A24-WT, monitoring clinical signs, survival rate and the presence of virus in blood for a week after infection. As previously described (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014) , animals inoculated with 10 5 pfu of WT FMDV A24 developed clinical signs, including sluggishness and rough fur, and died by 2 days post inoculation (dpi) (Figure 2A) . In contrast, deoptimized A24 viruses displayed different levels of attenuation depending on the virus variant and the dose. All animals inoculated with A24-P2/P3Deopt (independently of the dose), and animals inoculated with A24-P2Deopt at 10 6 pfu survived, while 80% of the animals inoculated with 10 7 pfu of A24-P2Deopt survived. Mice inoculated with A24-P3Deopt did not survive, however, disease progression was significantly slower as compared to WT FMDV A24 (P \u2264 0.05). Consistent with the survival data, animals inoculated with A24-P2/P3Deopt virus developed the lowest viremia levels (\u223c10 4 pfu/ml), followed by A24-P2Deopt (\u223c10 6 pfu/ml), A24-P3Deopt (\u223c10 7 pfu/ml), and A24-WT (\u223c10 8 pfu/ml) ( Figure 2B ). Viral titers of all the groups were statistically significantly different than the titers in the animals inoculated with A24-WT. As expected, following infection with the deoptimized strains, surviving mice developed protective levels of neutralizing antibodies with titers of about 2 Log 10 starting at 7 dpi, reaching the peak by 14 dpi, with a strong anamnestic response after challenge with WT virus (Figure 2C ).",

In this study, we focused on codon deoptimization of highly conserved non-structural genes encoded in P2 and/or P3 regions of a more environmentally relevant A 24 Cru field FMDV strain. The deoptimization algorithm targeted specific regions circumventing areas in which secondary and tertiary RNA structures had been predicted to avoid possible interference with virus replication. The hypothesis behind this approach was the creation of a viral strain that could display attenuating factors within the P2/P3 highly conserved coding regions serving as the basis for development into FMDV LAV candidates. Accordingly, the vector was created with convenient restriction sites added to the 5 and 3 regions of the variable P1 region to allow for strain/serotype specific capsid swapping (Uddowla et al., 2012) . Three viable strains of virus (A24-P2Deopt, A24-P3Deopt, and A24-P2/P3Deopt) that maintained the mutations were generated.",

In general, those strains had an aberrant growth rate, a decrease in end point titer, an increase in specific infectivity and produced small size plaques. The specific level of attenuation achieved in our experiments was dependent on both, the particular deoptimized region/s and the cell type used in the analysis. As previously observed for many attenuated mutants, the highest levels of attenuation were detected in cells (EBK and PK) that contain an intact innate immune system.

            "text": "The cumulative data suggests that the simultaneous deoptimization of both P2 and P3 achieved the highest levels of attenuation. These observations are in concurrence with data observed in IAV, RSV, DENV, and poliovirus using similar technologies, or in HAV where \"natural deoptimization\" has evolved to make tRNA pools more available for the virus; in the simplest sense, attenuation seems to be dependent on the number of deoptimized codons, and on the specific regions or gene/s (Burns et al., 2009; Aragon\u00e8s et al., 2010; Stauft et al., 2018; Le Nou\u00ebn et al., 2019 , 2020 . Mechanistically, the cause of attenuation seems to be more complicated and less definitive. Previous research has outlined that codon or codon-pair deoptimization can result in an increase of immunogenic molecules (CpG and UpA), decreased stability of the genome, loss of RNA secondary structures, a decrease in the rate of translation, co-translational misfolding, and a decreased rate of replication (Burns et al., 2009; Tulloch et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Le Nou\u00ebn et al., 2019; Groenke et al., 2020) . Apparently, for FMDV, codon deoptimization of the NS coding regions affected the rate of replication/translation, and also inhibited the ability of the virus to cleave cellular host factors such as G3BP1 involved in modulation of antiviral responses. All these events may have contributed to the observed levels of viral attenuation. These results are supported by the evidence of reduced virulence, in particular in primary cells that have an intact innate immune system such as EBK and PK (Chinsangaram et al., 1999) . Consistent with these results, increased expression of poIFN-\u03b1 and poIL-6 was detected in pigs inoculated with A24-P2/P3Deopt. Although the increase of CpG presumably led to a more active innate immune system response, the contribution of other factors (genome instability, cell-specific decreased translation, etc.) remains to be examined. To this end, the exact mechanism that led to the attenuation of these viruses, still remains unclear, and warrants further studies.",

Furthermore, induction of the adaptive immune response successfully protected mice against challenge with virulent FMDV. Unfortunately, unlike in mice, A24-P2/P3Deopt was too attenuated in swine and did not induce a strong antibodymediated protective response. All animals inoculated with A24-P2/P3Deopt at doses that were not sufficient to cause disease, were not protected against subsequent challenge with wild type A 24 Cru FMDV. In general for FMD, high antibody production induced by vaccination correlates with protection (Pay and Hingley, 1987; McCullough et al., 1992) , although protection against challenge has been observed for experimental vaccines with relatively low levels of neutralizing antibodies, presumably mediated by cellular immune responses (Moraes et al., 2011) . The average levels of serum neutralizing antibodies elicited in the group inoculated with the highest dose of A24-P2/P3Deopt (10 5 pfu/pig) that did not cause clinical symptoms, was still lower than the levels of antibodies induced by the previously reported A12-P1Deopt strain (10 5 pfu/pig) (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2016) , and also A12-SAP (10 5 pfu/pig), an attenuated FMDV strain with a double amino acid substitution in viral Lpro (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2012) . Lack of detectable viable virus in serum could contribute to the overall lack of antibody induction; however, previous studies have shown induction of neutralizing antibodies without viremia (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2016) . In recent studies with other deoptimized vaccine candidates for other viral disease, i.e., DENV, Stauft et al. (2019a) showed that promising candidates initially tested in mice, were also too attenuated to induce a protective immune response when tested in more relevant species (Rhesus macaque). Accordingly, if deoptimization in the P2 and/or P3 regions is to be used as a vaccine backbone, further refinement of the deoptimization parameters to \"de-attenuate\" the strains used in combination with other well-established attenuating mutations in FMDV NS proteins (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2012) might be required. In fact, this strategy has recently been applied to develop a new vaccine platform for poliovirus which is currently on Phase II study in adults, toddlers, and infants (Konopka-Anstadt et al., 2020) .",

Further studies that pair, in vitro infections at low multiplicity, thus encouraging multiple rounds of replication and consequent accumulation of mutations, together with, in depth analysis using next generation sequencing, should be performed as a measure of evaluating the genomic stability of deoptimized viruses, both in vitro and in vivo.

As mentioned in the introduction previous work with a FMDV leaderless virus, showed high degree of attenuation, both, in cattle and pigs (Mason et al., 1997; Chinsangaram et al., 1998) . In contrast, inoculation of pigs with an intertypic chimeric leaderless FMDV variant caused low, but detectable disease in pigs (Almeida et al., 1998) . However, the newly developed leaderless vaccine candidate, FMDVLL 3B3D, was very attenuated in both, cattle and pigs, providing optimal conditions for development as a safe inactivated FMD vaccine platform (Uddowla et al., 2012; Hardham et al., 2020) .

It is known that over 50% of bovines that are exposed to FMDV usually become asymptomatic persistently infected/carriers (reviewed by Stenfeldt and Arzt, 2020) . Commercially available FMD vaccines, such as inactivated whole virus, or recently developed vector delivered virus like particles, have failed to preventing persistence. Except for limited proof of concept studies with the FMDV SAP mutant that were performed in pigs (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2012) , no LAV candidate has been evaluated for FMD in the last 30 years, therefore there are no studies reporting efficacy in preventing persistence. One interesting point, however, is to consider that animals may become persistently infected only if their upper respiratory tract is exposed to live virus (Sutmoller et al., 1968) . Remarkably, the same authors reported that no FMDV carrier state could be detected when animals were intramuscularly infected with the same virus, emphasizing the critical involvement of the bovine upper respiratory tract in the establishment of primary and persistent FMDV infection. These studies suggest that, as long as a LAV candidate is parenterally inoculated, vaccinated animals will unlikely become carriers. However, further experimentation is required to confirm this hypothesis and verify reproducibility, if any, for multiple virus serotypes.",
