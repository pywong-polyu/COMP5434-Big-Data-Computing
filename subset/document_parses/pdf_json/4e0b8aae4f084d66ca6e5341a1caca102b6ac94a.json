            "text": "Public parks serve an important societal function as recreational spaces for diverse communities of people, with well documented physical and mental health benefits. As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor's state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.",

Public parks have always served a critical function as free recreational spaces [9] [10] [11] [12] , particularly for low income and immigrant communities [13] [14] [15] [16] .

Because of their function as recreational spaces for diverse communities, policymakers worried that parks could serve as transmission hotspots for SARS-CoV-2 [1, 6, 23, 25] . Parks, especially those tailored towards children, have many shared surfaces, which has been hypothesized to result in increased disease transmission [1, 24] . Furthermore, parks are often unsupervised and lack guidelines for visitor capacity, making it difficult to regulate their usage [1, 24] .",

Park shutdowns have been criticized somewhat for cutting people off from the benefits of publicly available outdoor areas [1, 6] , disproportionately impacting lower income individuals with limited access to green spaces [13, 16, 27, 28] . That said, it is unclear how effective these park shutdown orders were at reducing public park usage and achieving their purpose of diminishing transmission risk. On one hand executive orders shutting down parks may indeed act as a deterrent, but alternatively people may knowingly or unknowingly ignore the park shutdown orders. Attempts to discern the effects of these park closure policies have been limited, hindering the ability of policy makers to effectively evaluate their implementation [6, 21, 26] .",

The state had to lead the charge in crafting and instituting policies to respond to the pandemic, including an executive order by New Jersey's governor Governor Murphy shutting down state and county parks [25, 26, 30] . This executive park shutdown order did not go into effect until nearly a month after stay-at-home restrictions were put in place and was subsequently lifted about a month later ( Fig  1) [30] .

We evaluate three questions. First, how did park usage in New Jersey change with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? Second, how did the New Jersey governor's executive order to shut down parks affect the use of public parks? And finally, how did the lifting of the park shutdown order impact subsequent park visitation? We predict that (1) park usage increased significantly with the start of the pandemic, given the crucial role that parks play as widely accessible recreational spaces; (2) the executive order then significantly decreased park visitation to closed parks, but parks that remained open saw higher visitation as people congregated in the remaining open parks; and (3) the withdrawal of the executive order caused park visitation to increase again, possibly exceeding visitation before the closures as people compensated for the lack of access to parks (Fig 1) .",

We predict that the stay-at-home order (period 2) caused people to use parks more (relative to baseline usage before quarantine; period 1). We predict that the subsequent park shutdown order (period 3) was largely effective at reducing park usage in closed parks but possibly concentrated people in the parks that remained open.

First, we were only able to use geotagged photos from public accounts using this method, though we can see no obvious reasons this would bias our findings; there is no reason to expect that people with private accounts would post preferentially at specific parks or on certain days. Secondly, Instagram has a feature called 'Instagram stories' in which users can post photos temporarily (24 hours) for their followers to see [45] . Instagram stories have increased in popularity since the feature's introduction in 2016 [45] . As stories are transient and not public, our method could not capture data from Instagram stories. However, if users increasingly created stories rather than making posts, this would lead us to underestimate park visitation in 2020, thereby underestimating any differences we find between 2020 and previous years. As such, we feel our data are able to accurately capture changes in relative park visitation, both within and across years [38] [39] [40] [41] .",

For instance, park usage would be expected to increase during quarantine simply because of concomitant increases in temperature [46] . To account for this, we gathered daily temperature and precipitation data for Ewing Township, NJ, which is located in central New Jersey and therefore broadly representative of weather conditions across all parks [47] . We used weather data to detrend visitation data and compare park usage across time periods when applicable (see Statistical analyses).

To assess whether the onset of the pandemic and the stay-at-home order were associated with increased park visitation, we compared park usage during the first month of the pandemic (period 2) to park visitation during the same time period in previous years (with the date range adjusted slightly to include the same number of weekdays and weekends). We first detrended PUD data using annual estimates of the number of active US Instagram users to account for increased popularity of the platform over time (S2 Fig) [41] [42] [43] . To accommodate the non-normality of the data and the negative noninteger detrended PUD values, we calculated bootstrapped estimates of model coefficients for all our analyses. For this research question, we modeled detrended PUD, aggregated across parks, as a function of year, maximum daily temperature, and daily precipitation rate (Fig 3A) . We considered a model variable to have an effect on park visitation (i.e., 'be significant') if the 95% confidence interval did not overlap zero.",

To determine whether the New Jersey governor's park closure order was associated with changes in park usage, we compared visitation patterns before the shutdown (period 2) and during the shutdown (period 3) in parks that were made to close and parks that remained open (Fig 4) . However, closed parks vastly outnumbered open parks (n closed = 79, n open = 12). To account for this, we simulated 1,000 datasets with equivalent numbers of open and closed parks (n = 12) and calculated bootstrap estimates of the effect of park closure for each dataset. Furthermore, the parks that closed had substantially higher historical visitation rates than parks that remained open, as they were the more widely used county and state parks (S2B Fig) . Therefore, we evaluated the percent change in visitation levels from before and after the executive order, rather than absolute visitation, and how this related to park status (open vs. closed).

This increase indicates that people used public parks more during the beginning of the pandemic for the diverse services that parks provide [1, 6, 23, 49] . Most immediately, people probably visited parks more during the beginning of quarantine due to their accessibility: many public parks are free recreational spaces that are accessible (at least in theory) to diverse communities of people [9-12, 16, 17] . These aspects of parks make them particularly appealing in the face of the widespread financial uncertainty and decreased mobility of quarantine [1, 2, 7, 50] . In addition, with COVID-19-related school closures, many parents were left to engage and educate their children [8] . As such, parks likely served as an outlet for families with children in particular, enabling families to get out of the house and entertain their kids during the pandemic [7, 8, 50, 51] . Finally, parks are known to have positive impacts on mental health (e.g., [9, [17] [18] [19] [20] .). Therefore, some of the observed increases in park usage during the initial stages of quarantine were likely driven by heightened anxiety and depression as the pandemic became more serious [3] [4] [5] . Our findings are consistent with other work demonstrating that people increasingly made use of outdoor spaces for recreation during the pandemic [7, 23] . A study in Oslo, Norway that used mobile phone tracking data found that outdoor recreational activity increased during lockdown [23] . Altogether, such findings emphasize that people increasingly relied on parks during the pandemic for the important and dynamic services that they provide.",

We observed substantive declines (-76.1%) in visitation to closed parks associated with the executive order, suggesting that the order was largely effective at deterring park visitation. Likewise, the executive order seemingly did not induce panic and overcrowding; in contrast to our predictions (Fig 1) , people did not concentrate in open parks, though a few open parks did see visitation increases. Altogether, this underscores that clear guidance and policies from governing bodies do influence peoples' behavior during moments of crisis [2, 21] . Indeed, this finding parallels other research emphasizing the importance of strong leadership and clear guidelines for handling the pandemic: a recent study found that mask wearing and mask buying both significantly increased following the CDC's formal recommendation that Americans wear face masks [2] . As such, clear leadership and policies are crucial for influencing behavior and managing moments of crisis.",

Other work has suggested that parks are not the transmission centers for SARS--CoV-2 that some have supposed [1, 6, 25] . and may instead even help to mitigate the spread of the virus [23] . Indeed, we note that reopening parks did not appear to be associated with increases in SARS-CoV-2 cases in New Jersey. In fact, new cases continued to decline even after public parks were reopened in New Jersey and park visitation went back up (Fig 1) , though by then additional policies for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were in place. Still, given such findings and the aforementioned benefits that parks serve, we suggest that park shutdowns may not be the best means of curbing the pandemic. Instead, we should continue to expand our public park infrastructure and increase the accessibility of existing parks so that more people can access the multifaceted benefits that parks provide, particularly in moments of crisis such as those created by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The immediate return to parks suggests that peoples' relationships to parks are quite plastic, depending on social and recreational context, and that the observed increases in park visitation during the onset of the pandemic were driven largely by the paucity of other recreational options [1, 7, 23, 49] . Likewise, our results suggest that the effects of the executive order were largely reversible; once lifted, the executive order did not cause people to visit parks any more than they had before the order. That visitation quickly returned to pre-restriction levels further emphasizes that people are highly responsive to such orders and policies [26] , and also makes clear that policy decisions do not need to be thought of as final or irreversible. Policymakers and leaders can and should explore policy options in real time to evaluate which policies are most effective for dealing with the specific situation at hand. We should not be beholden to the first response we try; there is space to experiment.",

            "text": "It is possible that other changes in behavior may have contributed to the patterns we observed here, particularly the observed reductions in park visitation to closed parks during the shutdown period. The park shutdown order was instituted during a peak in the number of new SARS-CoV-2 cases in New Jersey (Fig 1) . As such, people may have decided to avoid public parks independent of the park shutdown order because they were increasingly nervous to leave home as the situation grew more serious [26, 52] . In addition, observed declines in park visitation with the shutdown order may reflect decreases in Instagram posting rather than declines in park usage itself. People may still have been visiting parks, but not posting photos for fear of social or legal repercussions [53] . To further complicate matters, this effect could be counteracted by retrospective Instagram posts during the shutdown. While we removed all Instagram photos whose captions and tags indicated that they were posted retrospectively, any remaining retrospective posts could have driven some of the observed park usage trends, particularly the usage we observed when parks were closed. However, because such photos would serve to inflate visitation during the shutdown, actual reductions in park usage would be even greater than what we capture here. While we cannot directly evaluate the contribution of these factors to observed patterns, our results suggest an awareness of the executive order regardless; the executive order clearly changed peoples' behaviors, even if not necessarily in the intended way. This result is reassuring, as it means that people clearly knew about the shutdown order. Thus, if the shutdown order had failed, it would not have been for lack of knowledge of the policy. As such, disseminating knowledge of policies such as this is not a major barrier to their effective implementation.",

Communities composed mainly of people of color resultantly have less access to parks and outdoor recreational spaces (and other public infrastructure more generally), despite increased reliance on such spaces for the services they provide [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . A notable aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been its disproportionate impact on these marginalized communities, particularly Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities [54, 55] . In light of our results, we suggest that the lack of access to parks and other public infrastructure may contribute to the disparities in COVID-19 burden observed in these communities, as others have speculated [54, 55] . By having reduced access to parks, these communities are barred from the aforementioned physical and mental health benefits associated with parks at a time when these services are particularly critical [14, 15, 17, 22] . As such, increasing the accessibility and equitability of public infrastructure such as parks may be one avenue for curbing this and future pandemics [27, 54, 55] . To better understand this relationship, further research should focus on how access to public infrastructure relates to SARS-CoV-2 burden, particularly within marginalized communities.",

Some have speculated that the pandemic will have lasting impacts on how people interact with public spaces, causing people to both avoid certain public spaces and aggregate in others [6, 49] , but our findings suggest that this may not be the case. We observed that people returned to parks quite quickly once they reopened, and that park visitation rates were comparable to those before the shutdown. Therefore, once restrictions are lifted, many people will likely go back to their alternative forms of recreation [6, 49] , and our results suggest that these behavioral changes could be quite immediate [3, 6, 22] . Overall, our findings serve to underscore the adaptability and resilience that people have exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic [3, 6] .",

Still, our results underscore that there is space for exploration; policies are not final and can be reversed with little adverse effect. We should therefore continue to enact exploratory policies for regulating public space use and consider diverse, creative options for dealing with crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As extreme situations become more frequent with expanding global populations and accelerating land use conversion [56] , such an understanding of how people react to policy decisions will be crucial for planning our responses to future crises.
