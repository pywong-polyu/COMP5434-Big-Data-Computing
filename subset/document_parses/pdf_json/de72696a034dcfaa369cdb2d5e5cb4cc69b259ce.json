            "text": "Purpose: Erythroferrone (ERFE) is well acknowledged for its inhibitory function on hepcidin synthesis in the liver during stress erythropoiesis, thereby ensuring sufficient iron supply to bone marrow erythroblasts. Hepcidin plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Thus, ERFE was suggested to protect against ACD in various diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is commonly involved with ACD and high hepcidin levels, with a further increase of the latter in active states. The present study is a case-control study that aimed to determine the pattern of ERFE expression in RA patients with concomitant ACD and study its relationship with hepcidin, erythropoietin (EPO) and disease activity. Patients and Methods: Fifty-five RA patients with ACD were categorized into active and inactive RA using the disease activity score (DAS28); 15 healthy subjects were included as control subjects. ERFE was measured for patients and control subjects using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, in addition to testing for CBC, ESR, CRP, iron profile parameters and hepcidin. EPO was assessed for patients of both active and inactive RA groups. Results: ERFE and hepcidin showed the highest levels in active RA; ERFE values were similar in control subjects and inactive RA patients, while hepcidin was significantly higher in inactive RA than control subjects. Patients with high ERFE levels had higher RBC, Hct, MCV, hepcidin and EPO levels. Stepwise regression analysis has identified DAS28 and disease duration as the best predictors of ERFE values, whereas ERFE and hepcidin were independent predictors of disease activity. Conclusion: We introduce ERFE as a novel marker of RA activity. Although the inhibitory effect of ERFE on hepcidin is not evident, our results still indicate that ERFE may have a beneficial erythropoietic effect in the context of ACD in RA disease activity.",

            "text": "Erythroferrone (ERFE) plays a central role in the release of stored iron during stress erythropoiesis, being an effective inhibitor of hepcidin synthesis by hepatocytes. 1 ERFE is a member of the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) family, encoded by ERFE (FAM132B) gene, and is synthesized by erythroblasts upon erythropoietin (EPO) stimulation. 2 When ERFE is released into the circulation, it sequesters BMP6-a potent inducer of hepcidin transcription-resulting in the inactivation of hepcidin signaling. 3, 4 The ensuing reduced hepcidin level results in restoration of normal intestinal iron absorption and iron efflux from mature iron-metabolizing macrophages with an accordant increased iron supply to bone marrow erythroblasts. 5 A different aspect of the ERFE role in human diseases lies in its alternative source of synthesis, namely skeletal muscle (formerly called Myonectin). 6 Muscle ERFE is a myokine that is secreted in response to physical exercise and nutrients, lipids and glucose, through unknown myocyte mediators that may include the Akt/PI3K pathway. 7 There is evidence for the role of muscle ERFE in lipid and glucose metabolism. 1 Disturbance of iron transport, by the hepatic hepcidin, is a leading feature in anemia of inflammation/chronic disease (ACD). 8, 9 In inflammatory or chronic diseases, immune cells release inflammatory cytokines, among which IL6 is considered to be the necessary and sufficient cytokine for hepcidin increase in inflammation. 10 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the chronic inflammatory diseases in which prolonged immune activation and cytokine synthesis are characteristic hallmarks and are largely responsible for the development of ACD. 9, 11 An added IL-6-driven increase in serum hepcidin was also reported in the active states of the disease. 12 Hence, these high-hepcidin conditions in RA, whether in quiescent or active states, provide potentially suitable targets to be acted upon by ERFE.",

The majority of patients received methotrexate (MTX) (12.5-25mg) once weekly injection. Patients not tolerating MTX received leflunomide 20mg daily. Patients also received hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily. Steroids were given in small doses with a maximum of 10mg daily for short duration as bridge therapy. In addition, patients received calcium, vitamin D and folic acid.

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between ERFE levels and iron or hematopoietic determinants, as well as activity-related parameters, to comprehend its role in anemic RA patients. The rapid hepcidin production in inflammation allocates it as a hallmark in the pathophysiological diagnosis of ACD. 8 In our study, the difference in hepcidin values between healthy control subjects and anemic RA patients supports the inflammatory element of the RAassociated anemia. 12, 24 Hepcidin median was highest in active RA and lowest in control subjects, with significantly different intermediate levels in inactive RA patients. In a study by Sahebari et al (2018) , the authors found no relation between hepcidin levels and RA activity; they categorized RA activity using the 5.1 DAS28 cutoff limit. 25 Another study reported a significant increase of serum hepcidin with the active status (DAS28>3.2 was used to define disease activity). 12 The results of the latter study are similar to our results.

Patients with ERFE levels above this cut-off exhibited significantly high RBC, Hct, MCV, EPO and hepcidin. The latter finding has undermined the supposed inverse relationship of ERFE with hepcidin. Hepcidin-inhibitory effect exerted by ERFE might have been counterbalanced by other hepcidin determinants. An important and direct determinant of hepcidin is the state of inflammation that coexists with particularly high levels of IL-6. This cytokine plays a critical role in both the pathogenesis of active RA as well as the secretion of hepcidin from hepatocytes. 28, 29 Due to its actual release from muscle cells (myonectin), the value of ERFE in human diseases is not restricted to anemia. In addition to being elevated in \u03b2-thalassemia major patients and associated with iron overload, 30, 31 it has also been studied in CKD where EPO is the main treatment modality. 14,15,32 Furthermore, the metabolic effect of myonectin has been addressed in the study of Seldin et al, 6 and a tight relationship was found with glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in diabetes mellitus patients. 33 In order to discern the source of ERFE in the study patients, ie, whether from muscle or expanding erythroblasts, we measured EPO level in 25 RA patients, both RA activitybased groups were represented. The significantly higher EPO levels in active RA patients suggest an erythroid origin of ERFE. However, a non-erythroid source of ERFE might be suggested based on the following observations:",

We believe that the value of this hypothesis is questionable since total body fat increases in RA that usually shows altered distribution. 37 Moreover, adiponectin, one important member of the adipokines family, was found to positively correlate with activity parameters of RA and increase in RA patients treated with anti-TNF agents (eg, infliximab). 38 However, low adiponectin levels can occur ",

In two previous studies conducted on rats, a sustained erythropoietin treatment has provoked insulin sensitivity and improved glucose metabolism. 43, 44 So, because erythroid ERFE is the one that is released in response to erythropoietin, a united function of ERFE, encompassing that of erythroid ERFE and muscle ERFE, was suggested to exert this metabolic effect. 1 Likewise, the high ERFE found in active RA patients in our study, whose muscle source is being proposed, might have traversed its scope of action to stimulate erythropoiesis.
