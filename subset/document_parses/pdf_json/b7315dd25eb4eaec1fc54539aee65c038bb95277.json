            "text": "Although the increasing responsiveness of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the 'ECJ') jurisprudence to western Member States' concerns regarding Central and Eastern European ('CEE') nationals' mobility has garnered academic attention, ECJ discourse has not been scrutinised for how it approaches the CEE region or CEE movers. Applying postcolonial theory, this article seeks to fill this gap and to explore whether there are any indications that ECJ discourse is in line with the historical western-centric inferiorisation of the CEE region. A critical discourse analysis of a set of ECJ judgments and corresponding Advocate General opinions pertaining to CEE nationals illustrates not only how the ECJ adopts numerous discursive strategies to maintain its authority, but also how it tends to prioritise values of the western Member States, while overlooking interests of CEE movers. Its one-sided approach is further reinforced by referring to irrelevant facts and negative assumptions to create an image of CEE nationals as socially and economically inferior to westerners, as not belonging to the proper EU polity and as not quite deserving of EU law's protections. By silencing CEE nationals' voices, while disregarding the background of east/ west socio-economic and political power differentials and precariousness experienced by many CEE workers in the west, such racialising discourse normalises ethnicity-and classbased stereotypes. These findings also help to contextualise both EU and western policies targeting CEE movers and evidence of their unequal outcomes in the west, and are in line with today's nuanced expressions of racisms. By illustrating the ECJ's role in addressing values pertinent to mobile CEE individuals, this study facilitates a fuller appreciation of the ECJ's power in shaping and reflecting western-centric EU identity and policies. Engaging with such issues will not only allow us to better appreciate-and question-the ECJ's legitimacy, but might also facilitate a better understanding of power dynamics within the EU. This study also makes significant theoretical and methodological contributions. It expands (and complicates) the application of postcolonial theory to contemporary intra-EU processes, while illustrating the usefulness of applying critical discourse analysis to exploring differentiation, exclusion, subordination and power within legal language.",

It has become acceptable for mainstream western politicians and the media to refer to CEE mobility as 'benefit tourism' and 'poverty immigration' (Galg\u00f3czi et al. 2011; Poptcheva 2014) of 'foreigners' (Kostakopoulou 2014) , 'criminals' and 'drunks' (e.g. Financial Times 2011) , and to denigrate CEE States as backwards and parasitic (Sobis 2016; Bell 2015) . In a 2013 letter to the European Council for Justice and Home Affairs, representatives of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK complained about the alleged financial abuse of western 'benefit magnet' Member States by CEE 'immigrants' (Miki-Leitner et al. 2013 )-a term that, under EU law, applies only to those from outside the EU. This backlash has relied on 'regimes of representation that portray' CEE movers 'as the bearers of alien customs and practices', suited for 'permanent exclusion \u2026 from \u2026 the imagined national communit[ies]' (Virdee and McGeever 2018, p. 1808) .",

            "text": "Despite frequent rhetoric about equality, fundamental rights and unity (Smismans 2010; Myslinska 2019a) , EU bureaucrats have also been disseminating western-centric discourse. For example, this has been observed in EU cultural policies (Sassatelli 2009) , and in official statements made before (B\u00f6r\u00f6cz and Kovacs 2001) and on the eve of the Eastern Enlargement rights afforded to all categories of movers (Myslinska 2019) . Since post-04 mobility has been largely east to west (Ritzen et al. 2017 ), all such initiatives would have had a disproportionate effect on CEE nationals (Myslinska 2019) . 5 Moreover, the negative impact of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union ('ECJ') on CEE movers' rights has garnered increasing academic attention (e.g . Currie 2009; Dougan 2013; O'Brien 2015; Myslinska 2019; Zahn 2015) . Notably, the ECJ has become more responsive to EU-15 States' arguments that they have served as magnets for CEE movers due to their (allegedly) generous welfare policies, despite the lack of data to support such claims. 6 All such rhetoric and policies are in line with the long-standing mainstream scholarly and popular constructions of European history (Gatrell 2019) and of the concept of 'Europe' (Hansen 2002) , which have been replete with popular anti-Slavic sentiment. In such representations, the west is portrayed as a superior site of civilisation, wealth, peace and modernity (Bhambra 2019; Burgess 2002; Sassatelli 2002) , and the east as primitive (Korek 2007; Todorova 2003; Verdery 2002) peripheries of 'Europe', filled with inhabitants 'fit only for slavery' (Wolff 1994: 10ff) . 7 This view has been propagated throughout the Middle Ages (Delanty 2003) and the Enlightenment (Wolff 1994) , through the concept of Mitteleuropa a century ago (Meyer 1955) , during the Cold War (Todorova 2003) , and as part of the process leading to the EU's Eastern Enlargement in 2004 and 2007 (B\u00f6r\u00f6cz and Kovacs 2001) . Similarly, European lawyers and legal academics have traditionally tended to privilege the concerns of north-western EU States (Kukovec 2015) .",

            "text": "Unlike the substantive impact of ECJ rulings, the Court's discourse has not been scrutinised 8 for how it approaches the CEE region or CEE movers. This is likely in part due to the fact that the ECJ's role is commonly understood as to uphold the checks and balances built into the EU constitutional legal order, without intruding into the political sphere (Lenaerts 2013) . 9 It is true that ECJ judgements, akin to the civil law tradition, tend to focus on detailed statutory analyses with little background or contextual discussion and little obiter dicta, 10 and the language used by the ECJ tends to be formal and sparse (Kalimo et al. 2018) , likely reflecting the fact that rulings are reached through a consensus of judicial panels 11 that speak with one voice, without issuing concurring or dissenting opinions. However, studies of ECJ discourse have revealed some fruitful findings that shed light on the Court's legitimacy and on what values it propagates (e.g. id; Dabbagh 2017) . More generally, by exposing unformulated 5 Moreover, Kukovec (2015) has shown how EU competition rules and case-law have ignored the concerns of workers from CEE and other 'peripheral' Member States (i.e. Portugal, Greece and Cyprus). 6 E.g. Case C-67/14, Jobcenter Berlin Neuk\u00f6lln v Alimanovic; Case C-333/13, Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig; Case C-308/14, Commission v United Kingdom. 7 It was not until 1996 that a major western history of Europe systematically included CEE cultures and nations (Davies 1996) . 8 Despite the fact that the EU is 'primarily a textual enterprise' and a 'print community' (Williams 2003, p. 666) , EU discourse generally remains under-studied (Shore 2000) , in part because the EU is assumed to be a pragmatic construct (Della Sala 2013) . 9 The ECJ's role should not be underestimated, of course. The Court is the final interpreter of EU legislation. Moreover, it is expected to facilitate European integration by protecting fundamental rights and providing solutions to problems that EU political institutions are unable to tackle collectively (Lenaerts 2013) . 10 That is, judges' expressions of opinion and contextual details not essential to their rulings. 11 The Court's composition varies between a Full Court of all judges (currently 27), a Grand Chamber of 15 (and formerly, 11 or 13) judges and Chambers of 5 or 3 judges. Only the judges who form the bench in a particular case address it. The Court sits as Grand Chamber if a case raises particularly complex or important issues (or at the request of the Member State or EU institution that is a party), and as Full Court only in exceptionally important cases. legal bases and hidden assumptions behind judicial decisions, close scrutiny of dicta supplements and contextualises doctrinal analysis (e.g. Zalesne 2013) . Such insights are especially helpful to understanding how case-law reflects cultural assumptions and how it is used to maintain social power and dominant ideologies.",

Engaging with such topics will not only allow us to better appreciate the ECJ's legitimacy and its role in shaping and reflecting EU identity and policies, but might also facilitate a better understanding of today's nuanced expressions of racisms within Europe and of any shortcomings of the EU project's promises of equality. As explained below, I rely on critical discourse analysis and postcolonial theory in this study because they are particularly well-suited to explorations of how dominant values, ideologies, identities and positions of power get re-produced.",

            "text": "Post-colonialism does not imply that colonialism is over. Rather, it looks at the continuing effects of historical practices and constructs on present racial stratifications, political dominations and systems of knowledge and power (Go 2018), and seeks to disrupt them by recognising non-western histories, interests and voices (Chakrabarty 2000; Spivak 1999 ). Europe's idea of itself still depends on (western) imperialist attitudes (Balibar 1991; Fitzpatrick 2001) . Notably, postcolonial theorists question western-centric European identity (Hansen 2002; Hipfl and Gronold 2011) and the use of western-centric constructs as idealised yardsticks of EU norms (Kinnvall 2016; Fitzpatrick and Bergeron 1998; Zielonka 2007) . Recent explorations applying postcolonial theory to Europe have focused on the role that race, ethnicity and economic differences play in constructing contemporary identity and policies 12 Although I look at the CEE region collectively, each CEE State's unique history, migration patterns, stereotypes and identity affect how its nationals experience mobility and belonging within the EU. For example, Poles have been especially subjected to the superficially positive stereotype about their strong work ethic (MacKenzie and Forde 2009), while their large numbers in western States have made them the face of CEE mobility. Moreover, CEE countries do not all share the same economic, security and political aims (Zielonka 2019) . That being said, western rhetoric has tended to inferiorise the whole region (e.g. Cook et al. 2011; Fox et al. 2015; Kofman et al. 2009 ). All CEE States experienced similar power imbalances with the west during their accession processes, and all are treated alike under formal EU laws. And, within the broad EU backdrop, all CEE nationals have been relatively poor in comparison to EU-15 nationals, as indicated, for example, by their GDP per capita (e.g. Eurostat 2004 Eurostat , 2018 , and the CEE block's average minimum wages (Dascalu 2017) . (Ponzanesi and Blaagaard 2011) . They have tended to be grounded in cultural (rather than legal 13 ) studies and to focus on domestic (rather than supranational) practices.",

For example, scholars have critiqued the Eastern Enlargement process for its neo-colonial export of governmentality and economic control, and its framing as a civilising mission (e.g. B\u00f6r\u00f6cz and Sarkar 2005; Bohle 2006; Kuus 2006; Behr 2007; B\u00f6r\u00f6cz and Kovacs 2001; Buchowski 2006; Engel-Di Mauro 2006) . Embedded within the long-standing western othering of the east, these colonial-like processes have supported accession practices that have incorporated CEE nationals as 'secondclass' EU citizens (Currie 2009 ) and a subordinate cultural group (Tutti 2010) , and which might be linked to long-term unequal outcomes experienced by CEE movers in EU-15 States (e.g. Currie 2009; Kubal 2012; Engbersen et al. 2017; Myslinska 2019; Myslinska 2019a; Keskinen and Andreassen 2017) . The postcolonial agenda has also been helpful in analysing western exclusionary politics targeting CEE movers (Kinnvall 2016) , and CEE nationals' self-colonising consciousness of inferiority (e.g. Kuus 2004; Samaluk 2016a) . My aim is to expand such postcolonial critiques to ECJ discourse.",

Such racialisation 14 is often further complicated by class (Balibar and Wallerstein 1991; Keskinen and Andreassen 2017; Barker 1981) . Groups dominant on the global stage-historically, economically, politically or culturally-construct and re-produce other groups as inferior (Grosfoguel 2004) . Implicit and explicit discourses, propagated by individuals and by institutions belonging to or reflecting the dominant group, define inferiorised groups' identities and affect their outcomes (Rattansi 2005; Kushner 2005) . Inferiority gets ascribed to not only groups as a whole but also individuals within them, and is reinforced by essentialising all purported group members as inherently similar (Keskinen and Andreassen 2017) .",

When this methodology is used to scrutinise the relationship between language and power (including its abuse), it becomes critical discourse analysis ('CDA') (van Leeuwen 1993) . The connection between language and power is mediated through ideology, that is, shared social beliefs-for example, about class or ethnicity-associated with the dominant group's identity and position, which re-produce its power, while influencing the actions and beliefs of those who are subjugated (van Dijk 1998) . Ideology also encompasses the construction and legitimation of practices that further the dominance of the group in power (Chouliaraki and Fairclough 1999) . Both the social elites (such as judges or politicians) and the public disseminate ideology (van Dijk 1998; Wodak 2018) . When individuals speak, they express the ideology of the group that dominates knowledge production, and this discourse constitutes them as speakers (Wandel 2001 CDA has been widely used in research pertaining to the creation of polities and policies, including studies of identity politics and discriminatory rhetoric and practices (van Dijk 1998). Recently, CDA has been increasingly applied to studies of 'European' identity, especially as impacted by the fall of the Iron Wall and by ongoing migration debates. Much of such analysis has focused on EU-level politics (e.g. Carta and Morin 2014; Lynggaard 2019; Wodak 2018) and on transformations of western national identities due to political and media discourses (e.g. Mole 2007; Bayley and Williams 2012) .",

Although CDA has rarely been applied to analyses of case-law, it is well-suited for revealing value-laden aspects of judicial reasoning, its underlying assumptions, as well as power dynamics between various actors affected by case-law (Kalimo et al. 2018) , thus complementing dogmatic and doctrinal studies (Ervo 2016) . By prioritising and naturalising certain ideologies underlying legal arguments (Kalimo et al. 2018) , jurisprudential discourse conveys specific world views, which in turn construct social reality (Ervo 2016) . Notably, US critical race scholars have engaged in analyses which resemble CDA approach, to expose how judicial reasoning in select tort, criminal and contract cases perpetuates race-and class-based stereotypes and inequalities (e.g. Spence 1993-4; Kastely 1994; Zalesne 2013) .",

The most common types of results were as follows, in this order: observations submitted by CEE governments regarding cases that did not relate to their nationals' rights; references for preliminary rulings 18 from CEE courts in cases between CEE companies and CEE governmental entities; references by CEE courts in cases between CEE nationals and CEE governments or CEE companies; Commission actions against CEE States (for not following EU legislation); and cases regarding inter-state cooperation in criminal proceedings or the enforcement of civil judgements (particularly in matrimonial matters). After skimming all these results, I was able to eliminate types of cases that did not pertain to my research aims. For example, I did not find any value-laden comments about CEE States or their nationals in actions brought by the Commission against CEE States. Arguably, both the Commission and the ECJ tend to be deferential when discussing national governments. Furthermore, such cases-as well as actions brought by CEE States against EU institutions-are not especially politicised. Cases pertaining to CEE companies were also very laconic. I focused my review on judgements in cases where CEE applicants were asserting their rights against western governments before EU-15 courts. 19 I cite the most data-rich ones below, limited to only four cases due to article length constrains.",

Although earlier cases might also be illuminating, I decided to focus on post-2004 cases only-not only for pragmatic reasons (to limit the scope of my data set), but also because the cases pertaining to CEE nationals to which I cite in this paper are all post-2004.

Although non-binding, AG opinions are valuable for my purposes because they tend to address legal issues more comprehensively than the Court does, often get cited by later AG opinions, and are followed by the Court in the majority of cases (Arrebola et al. 2016) .

For example, the 1990 Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement ('CISA'), to which all Schengen area 22 Member States subscribe, pertains to supporting police and judicial cooperation. Under Article 54, which adopts the ne bis in idem principle, a person whose trial has been disposed of in one Member State may not be prosecuted in another for the same acts. 20 Moreover, I only searched for demonyms rather than country names because my search of CEE claimants had revealed that using this approach was more fruitful. 21 I did not look at Greece, Italy, Portugal or Spain because Southern Europeans have faced their own history of negative stereotyping and racialisation by north-western Europeans (Dyer 1997; Ignatiev 2008) . Any such racialisation of Southern Europeans presents a separate, albeit likely overlapping, research question. 22 All EU Member States other than Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus and Croatia. Four non-EU countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) also belong to the Schengen area. Furthermore, under Council Framework Decision 2002/584 ('Framework Decision') , 23 which has been transposed into national laws by all Member States, national judicial authorities may issue a European Arrest Warrant ('EAW') to require other Member States to transfer a criminal suspect or sentenced person to the issuing State so that the person can be prosecuted or complete a detention period. 24 Such persons are provided numerous procedural protections. For example, the executing State must refuse to surrender a requested person who had been acquitted or had already served a sentence for the same act (Article 3). Moreover, the executing authority may refuse to surrender a person who has been prosecuted in that State or a third country for the same act, if the prosecutorial authorities in the executing State could not or had decided not to prosecute the person, or if the alleged offence was committed in the executing State (Article 4). Notably, under Article 4(6), the executing State may refuse to surrender a requested person who is 'staying' in or is a 'resident' of the executing State, if the State undertakes to execute the sentence in accordance with its own law.",

Next, the ECJ instructed that in interpreting 'staying in', national authorities must make a holistic factual assessment-based on factors such as the length, conditions and nature of presence, and any family or economic connections-to determine whether 'a stable period of presence' had resulted in acquiring connections of a similar degree as those resulting from residence.

In its discussion, the AG drew on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights, which do not appear to have been discussed by the parties, increasing its appearance of authority as a moral arbiter.

Moreover, throughout the opinion, the AG refers to him by his surname, and often paints background details in a somewhat less negative light than the ECJ does. For example, instead of specifying that Mr. Kozlowski had been convicted of 62 fraud offences, the AG mentions his 'numerous fraud offences' (para 31); instead of pointing out that he had received unemployment benefits in Poland for 1 year, the AG notes that he had gotten by with his parents' assistance and his receipt of 'limited unemployment benefits' in Poland (para 30). Unlike the ECJ, the AG also mentions that Mr. Kozlowski had trained as a chef (para 32). Thus, the AG presents a fuller picture of his background and creates an impression of someone who might had experienced some difficulties but nevertheless belongs to the EU polity or at least deserves a chance to be rehabilitated.

How can such discourse differences in how the Court approaches CEE and EU-15 applicants be explained? Both sets of cases were decided within the same time frame (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) , so within the same socio-political context. 40 One might wonder whether negative discourse appears correlated with negative substance. After all, court credibility is better maintained when there is no dissonance between discourse and the substantive outcome (Myslinska 2019a) . See also n 46 infra. of its rulings. It is true that the actual rulings produced negative outcomes for both Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Turansky, whereas three of the four western claimants discussed (Kretzinger, Van Esbroeck and Kraaijenbrink) benefited from the respective ECJ rulings in that the ne bis in idem principle was found to bar their later prosecutions. However, even in the one western case with a negative outcome (Mantello), the Court did not adopt inferiorising discourse. Moreover, the underlying crimes were less morally reprehensible in CEE than in western applicants' cases: suspected robbery (in Turansky) and property destruction and fraud (in Kozlowski); versus drug-related crimes, including a drug ring (in Mantello, Van Esbroeck and Kraaijenbrink), and smuggling contraband goods (in Kretzinger). Also, all four western applicants had already been convicted of crimes central or related to their ECJ applications, whereas only one of the two CEE claimants (Mr. Kozlowski) had been. Thus, negative discourse is not clearly correlated with the underlying substance of the cases discussed. Importantly, what both postcolonial theory and CDA emphasise is that both implicit and explicit language is power, by re-producing and naturalising inferiorisation, along with concomitant subordination and unequal outcomes. Thus, it does not matter whether inferiorisation affects or offers additional support for the actual case outcomes or is related to the substance of underlying domestic cases. What matters is that such discourse exists.",

After 5 years of lawful residence in a host State, movers gain the right of permanent residence (Articles 16-17). From day one of qualifying as a 'worker' or a jobseeker in a receiving State, access to that State's social security benefits, 43 social and tax advantages 44 and social assistance (Article 24(2)) follows. After the first 3 months of residence, economically inactive movers are also granted equal access to social assistance, as long as they can demonstrate financial self-sufficiency (Article 24). Although host States are permitted not to grant first-time jobseekers from other States any social assistance (Article 24(2)), the ECJ has mandated that they be given equal access to financial benefits 'intended to facilitate access to the labour market'. 45 Notably, the free movement right has been a highly politicised issue in the context of CEE nationals' mobility. It constituted one of the most contested topics during the Eastern Enlargement process, unpopular among western citizenry and officials (Currie 2016) . Allegedly fearing 'welfare tourism'-although studies indicated that such concerns were not warranted (Dougan 2004 )-EU-15 States imposed temporary restrictions on CEE workers' mobility for up to 7 years after the Eastern Enlargement. 46 When these transitional limitations were coming to an end, renewed popular and political debates about 'benefit tourism' and 'poverty immigration' spread across EU-15 States (Galg\u00f3czi et al. 2011; Poptcheva 2014) . Reflecting such western concerns, the ECJ has been limiting the rights of economically inactive movers, starting with its decisions in Brey 47 and Dano (discussed below) (Myslinska 2019) . This recent line of cases, consistent with the increasingly restrictive EU-15 policies targeting CEE movers (Eurofound 2014) , propagates the notion of EU citizens' need to 'earn and deserve' their right to move and to draw on social benefits (Kramer 2016) .",

In 2005, Mr. Ziolkowski, Mrs. Szeja, and her two children (born in Germany) applied for permanent residence in Germany. Their applications were refused because they were found unable to support themselves economically. The German court referred the following questions to the ECJ: (1) whether periods of residence in the host State completed in compliance with national law alone may be regarded as periods of legal residence under the Directive; and (2) whether periods of residence completed by nationals of a Member State before its accession to the EU must be considered in calculating the 5-year period for acquiring permanent residence under the Directive. The Court was presented with the parties' arguments, the AG's opinion, and observations submitted by three Member States and by the Commission. The Court concluded that the term 'legal residence' referred only to periods of residence in compliance with the Directive conditions (that is, being a worker or having sufficient resources). Although the Court answered the second question in the affirmative, it noted that any pre-accession periods of residence also had to be completed in compliance with the Directive's conditions. Due to this formalistic reading of the Directive's residency requirements, the Applicants could not prove their right to residence.",

For example, the AG mentions that Mr. Ziolkowski had resided in Germany since the age of 12, had undertaken part of his education there and had a child of German nationality, and that Ms. Szeja had lived in Germany for 20 years and had children born there (para 56). Although such factual details might have been included simply for pragmatic reasons-to support the AG's conclusion that periods of residence completed on the basis of national law alone should also be taken into account for acquiring residence right under the Directive-they also tap into negative stereotypes of movers who have children in host States and expect host State support, despite having lived there for decades. Furthermore, the AG does refer to numerous negative factual details not clearly relevant to his analysis. For example, although the AG does not mention the ethnicity of Mrs. Szeja's children's father, he does note that the father lives separately (para 24).

To support this view, the AG relies heavily on portions of the AG Opinion from Brey, 54 which addressed host States' prerogative to prevent economically inactive movers from 'using the welfare system of the host Member State to finance their livelihood' (para 94).

For example, the AG mentions that she had been 'convicted for crimes against property and assets' (fn 5). The AG then acknowledges that such details, which had been noted by the referring court, do not bear on the questions before the Court (id). It begs the question of why the AG restates them. Also like the Court, the AG explicitly attributes negative intentions to Ms. Dano-that she had moved 'solely in order to benefit' from the German welfare system (para 118) and 'without intending to integrate' in Germany (para 131).

Instead of relying on legal arguments, the AG resorts to citing academic work to support his assertion that Member States should be afforded discretion in awarding social benefits to 'prevent \"abuses of host law\" in the form of benefit tourism' (fn 47 referring court 'provides no precise information about the existence of such a risk', the AG points that allowing movers to access social benefits 'might encourage immigration of Union citizens whose average income is considerably lower' than that in the host State (para 133). In addition to mentioning 'immigration' in the aforementioned statement, the AG also refers to persons in Ms. Dano's position as 'migrants' (para 133, fn 47)a concept that does not apply to EU citizens, who are by definition 'movers'. Thus, in line with western exclusionary politics (Kinnvall 2016) and negative media portrayals (Garner 2012) , Ms. Dano and potential movers from poorer (such as CEE) States are characterised as welfare spongers and outsiders to the EU polity. The image of her otherness is strengthened by, incorrectly, setting her apart as an immigrant (Balibar and Wallerstein 1991) , reminiscent of how some members of the western public conflate CEE movers with undocumented migrants (Halej 2014) . Moreover, without relying on any evidence, the AG asserts that it is 'likely that, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, recourse to the social assistance system will not be temporary but will be prolonged indefinitely' (para 134). By portraying Ms. Dano and movers of similar backgrounds as hopeless and as permanent drains on western States' purses, this rhetoric conceptualises them as threatening outsiders, not deserving of EU law's protections or of belonging in EU-15 States. This is also in line with how the CEE region was incorporated into the EUas a subordinate cultural group (Tutti 2010) , populated by 'second-class' EU citizenry (Currie 2009 ).",

After being in the UK for 8 days, he applied for jobseekers' allowance, which was denied.

Moreover, the Court consistently refers to him by his surname and does not express any negative views about his behaviour. Furthermore, the Court does not include many additional facts mentioned by the AG (some of which are relevant to the UK test for jobseekers' allowance), which could have painted a more negative impression of Mr. Collins. Notably, the Court makes it clear that the label 'benefit tourist' could not be applied to him, despite the fact that he sought benefits after having been in the UK for only 8 days and without having any links to the UK. The Court repeats the Commission's observation that, while the UK's habitual residence test for access to some benefits may be necessary 'to avoid 'benefit tourism' and thus the possibility of abuse by work-seekers who are not genuine, \u2026 in the case of Mr Collins the genuine nature of the search for work is not in dispute' (para 50).

Moreover, according to Collins, EU equality protections do not preclude national legislation which makes entitlement to a jobseeker's allowance conditional on a residence requirement (as long as it meets the proportionality test 59 ). Similarly, although Mr. Trojani was deemed a worker, the Court acknowledged host States' discretion in determining under what circumstances to provide movers with access to benefits. 60 In addition, the Court confirmed host States' ability to limit EU citizens' Treaty rights to free movement and residence as long as any such limits meet the proportionality test.

That being said, however, timing differences alone cannot explain discourse differences illustrated above. At the time Collins and Trojani were decided, in 2004, the western public had already expressed concerns over CEE mobility (leading to the imposition of post-accession transitional arrangements). In fact, the notion of 'benefit tourism' had already become a highly contested issue in the west before the first wave of the Eastern Enlargement occurred in May 2004.

Her application for child-raising allowance in Germany was refused because she was not a resident there and was found not to be 'employed' under German legislation (which required at least 15 h of work per week). Despite ruling that EU law did not preclude such national legislation making frontier workers engaged in minor employment ineligible for social advantages, the Court does not portray her attempt to obtain child-raising allowance in a negative light. Neither does the AG. 62 Both voice her interests and refer to her by her surname. Similarly, Bosmann v Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit -Familienkasse 59 The requirement must be justified on the basis of objective considerations that are independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and proportionate to the national policy's legitimate aim (to protect State purse). 60 The ECJ found that Mr. Trojani would be entitled to benefits if the referring court determined that his employment activity was real and genuine. Aachen 63 concerned another western frontier worker's access to benefits. A Belgian national residing in Germany with her two children (who were studying in Germany) had been receiving German child benefits, which were discontinued after she took up employment in the Netherlands because, at that point, only Dutch law was deemed applicable. The Court ruled that it was up to the German court to determine whether she still resided in Germany and hence were eligible for social security there. Both the Court and the AG 64 refer to her arguments and to her by her surname throughout their discussions, and do not portray her attempt to obtain benefits in a negative light. By the time Geven and Bosmann were decided (in 2007-2008) , transitional mobility derogations imposed against CEE States acceding in 2004 had already come to the end of their first 3-year period, which had led to renewed western public and political apprehensions about movers' alleged financial drain on host States.

The Court in Geven notes irrelevant details that portray the Applicant as a respectable mother, mentioning that '[w]hen her son was born \u2026 she was living in the Netherlands with her husband, who worked in that Member State' (para 7). The AG also includes those details. Notably, in Bosmann, the Court never uses the phrase 'single mother', which might carry negative connotations. Instead, throughout its judgement, the Court refers to her as a mother who has been 'bringing up' her children 'on her own' (paras 9, 13). The Court also does not refer to her children's father(s). Although the AG does call her a 'single mother' (paras 11, 32), he does emphasise that national legislation treating a 'single mother' less favourably than 'a mother forming part of a couple' (para 32) would not be permissible. Thus, unlike Mses. Szeja and Dano, Ms. Bosmann deserves equal access to social benefits to help support her children.

CEE movers are portrayed as having little knowledge, limited education and insufficient financial resources, and as lacking the ability to conform to proper middle-class behavioural practices. Both explicit details and discursive strategies used by the Court invite the reader to associate CEE movers with illegality, poverty, poor judgement and defect. Such discourse also encourages the reader to rely on an intersection of negative ethnicity-and classbased stereotypes, 70 creating complex identities that shape access to privilege and intersect with experiences of discrimination and inequalities (Delgado 2011) . These stereotypes are in line with today's nuanced expressions of racisms, based not solely on phenotypical differences, but also on culture, ethnicity and class (Garner 2006; Pruitt 2015) . They reify problematic assumptions about ethnicity, class and migration status, overlooking the fact that rates of both criminality (e.g. Wadsworth et al. 2016 ) and reliance on public welfare (e.g. Dustmann and Frattini 2014; Barslund and Busse 2014) are lower among CEE movers than among western States' native populations.",

By failing to acknowledge such barriers to CEE nationals' mobility, ECJ discourse leaves the reader with a vague sense of CEE movers' own incompetence and inability to be deserving EU citizens.

            "text": "It might at first seem particularly striking that such inferiorising discourse has been propagated in judicial and AG opinions discussed in this article, all of which were written after 2004. Since then, the Court has included judges 71 and AGs from CEE States, 72 which likely serves to inhibit at least some expressions of anti-CEE sentiment. Moreover, since ECJ rulings tend not to restate prior judgements' wordings as much as in the common law tradition, one would expect that the inclusion of CEE members would help to make ECJ discourse less west-centric over time. 73 However, since the Court speaks with one voice, it is difficult for any less westerncentric voices to become prominent, especially given that CEE judges comprise a numerical minority (10 out of 27, currently). Judges of CEE origin constituted the majority of the bench in only one decision discussed in this paper (in Kretzinger). Not a single CEE judge was on the panels in Turansky, Collins or Trojani. Currently, 4 out of 11 AGs have CEE origin. 74 Notably, in the cases discussed here, only one AG was from a CEE State (in Bosmann). Moreover, pro-CEE voices might lack prominence in post-04 ECJ discourse due to self-colonisation. As postcolonial theorists have revealed, local elites from inferiorised countries often assimilate the dominant group's rhetoric in order to conform and improve their status. Behr (2012) has observed, for example, how the success of the EU's eastern 'colonialism' was facilitated by the local elites' embrace of western discourse (see also Szczerbiak 2002) . 75 Importantly, instead of looking at the identities of individual speakers, the focus of CDA analysis is on how power gets re-produced through deeply entrenched institutional discourse. The dominant collective discourse 'speaks through' individuals, both those who are embedded within dominant institutions and the public that propagates discourse in a bottom-up manner (Wodak 2018) . Similarly, postcolonial theory focuses on language as an expression of the dominant group's institutionalised power. This institutional perspective is particularly applicable to an analysis of the ECJ's discourse since the Court's decisions are not attributed to specific judges. 76 Although AGs do issue individual opinions, their identity is also never emphasised by the Court. If the Court actually does mention their opinions in its judgements, it refers to them as 'Advocate General'. Thus, both are best approached as speaking with institutional, rather than individual, voices.",

That same promise underlaid the Eastern Enlargement, framed as a historic task to 'transcend \u2026 former divisions and \u2026 forge a common destiny' (Constitutional Treaty, 78 Postcolonial theory might offer some guidance. Existing scholarship has applied postcolonial theory to explore the lasting effects on identity and on outcomes of post-war east/west relations. The Eastern Enlargement and the broader 'Europeanisation' processes have been shown to prioritise western economic and political interests and to situate western culture as the ideal (B\u00f6r\u00f6cz and Kovacs 2001) . Moreover, scholars have applied the postcolonial framework to explore how CEE workers in the west are approached by employers and by the wider public (e.g. Samaluk 2016; Loftsdott\u00edr and Jensen 2012), and how selfcolonisation impacts their perceptions of themselves (e.g. Samaluk 2016a). This paper expands the application of postcolonial theory to contemporary east-west relations within the EU by illustrating how both CEE individuals and CEE groups are implicitly and explicitly racialised in ECJ discourse based on their cultures, ethnicities, class status and 'immigrant' background. Eastern voices, histories and interests are ignored, helping to continue the effects of ethnic differences in economic, political and knowledge-production stratifications. The historical and contemporary political and economic processes that have supported the creation of these stratifications get overlooked. In the process, such discourse has the power to not only constitute identities, but also affect outcomes through delineating access to privilege and facilitating experience of discrimination.",

            "text": "Of course, application of postcolonial theory to the EU is complicated. I am aware that my analysis might problematise the framework by divorcing it from its original context and stripping it to its bare components. Notably, the CEE region never comprised actual colonies of the west, and west's exploitation of the eastern peripheries of Europe pales in comparison to the great colonial powers' pillaging areas outside of Europe. Both CEE and western Member States are comprised of majority Caucasian populations and imagine themselves as 'white', even if some do have significant numbers of BAME individuals. CEE Member States are formally afforded a proportionate say in EU institutions, and all EU nationals are formally equally protected by EU laws. Of course, formal equality does not ensure equality in practice (Hepple 2014) ; nor does it preclude negative rhetoric. Despite all these differences from the contexts which first inspired postcolonial theory, application of the postcolonial framework to my project has proven fruitful for helping to advance the framework's goalsby exploring institutional racialisation of CEE nationals, and revealing (and hopefully helping to disrupt) the persistent east/west binary within contemporary Europe. According to Said's (1983) travelling theory concept, theories and ideas can be re-invigorated by new contexts in which they are applied. Showing postcolonial framework's usefulness in settings that are novel to its application is a testament to its great malleability, credibility and continuing value. The framework can still generate new insights into how law and society operate in the context of racism and subordination, and can provide a basis from which to examine today's nuanced forms of racial stratifications and splintering axes of disadvantage.",

            "text": "More importantly, this article sheds further light on EU power dynamics. While I acknowledge that 'Europe is a complicated maze with many fault lines, not one single fault line, between the East and the West' 80 (Zielonka 2019) and we should resist any attempts to essentialise the CEE region as one homogeneous block, there are nevertheless key differences between the east and the west which might fuel and be reinforced by inferiorising institutional EU discourse. For one, although economic gaps between the pre-and post-04 Member States have been decreasing over time, CEE States collectively continue to significantly lag behind the others in terms of their GDPs and wages. 81 CEE States have had a history of emigration to the west, and its nationals have faced a history of subjugation to anti-Slavic stereotypes. There is also a fundamental difference in how western and eastern Member States perceive the concept of Europethe former as a way to increase their global power, the latter increasingly as a threat to their identity and very existence (Gallon 2019) . Moreover, even if the east/west divide is more psychological than substantive, it does affect the relationship between pre-and post-04 Member States and has an impact on policy decisions (Lehne 2019) . Western States have on occasion made CEE States feel like outsiders. For example, in a 2013 letter to the European Council for Justice and Home Affairs, representatives of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK had complained about the alleged financial abuse of western 'benefit magnet' Member States by CEE 'immigrants'. During the Versailles summit in 2017, France, Germany, Italy and Spain endorsed a two-speed Europe, prompting irritation in the CEE region (M\u00f6ller and Pardijs 2017) . Furthermore, after Brexit, the two London-based EU agencies will be relocated to Paris and Amsterdam, despite the fact that most of the CEE States had requested to host them 82 and some do not host any EU agencies yet. 83 Notably, analyses of Member States' influence on EU policy-making have revealed that the CEE States tend to wield less power than their western counterparts. It might come as no surprise that, 5 years after the Eastern Enlargement, Germany was overrepresented in the European Parliament's governing bodies, followed by France, Italy and the UK, in line with their voting weight for Council decisions under the qualified majority voting rules (Euractiv 2009 ). What is more troublig, however, is that more recent studies have continued to show similar patterns. For example, Germany, France, Italy and the UK have continued to hold greatest voting weight for Council decisions after 2014 changes to the qualified majority voting rules. 84 According to a survey conducted in 2018, experts perceive Germany and France as by far the most influential Member States, followed by the Netherlands, the UK and Italy (Janning 2018) . As Lehne (2019) notes, Germany and France have always been at the heart of European integration. A study of MEPs' influence over Parliament decisions during the 2017 autumn term revealed that the ten most influential MEPs were, in this 80 Some scholars point that CEE States do not have as many political, economic, cultural and policy commonalities with each other as popularly assumed and share more attributes with western States than is commonly acknowledged (Zielonka 2019) . Moreover, the east-west divide might be further exaggerated by the media, populist politicians (id) and academics (Lehne 2019 order, Italian, German, Italian, Belgian, Italian, British, Spanish, Spanish, Polish and Spanish. Taking State populations into account (since it determines the number of MEPs per State), Germany and Italy exert the biggest level of influence in the Parliament (VoteWatch Europe 2017). Looking at the influence of individual MEPs collectively by country, Germany and Italy are again the most influential (id). When it comes to Member State influence over the Council, a study of votes between 2010 and 2017 revealed that France, Italy and then Germany had the greatest impact (Frantescu 2017) . Inferiorisation of the CEE region and its nationals in EU discourse makes such findings more poignant.",

Due to Brexit, French and German influence is predicted to increase further (Lehne 2019) , and new coalitions and new fractures might arise. Notably, in the case of Poland-which has wielded more influence within the EU than other CEE States 85 -its ally in the EU will depart and its role of bridging differences between the Big Three 86 (Parkes 2013) will end. On the other hand, Poland will become the fifth largest State, with a greater share of MEPs in the Parliament. In addition to Brexit, the lack of a harmonised response to Covid-19 crisis and its predicted economic repercussions are likely to further destabilise the EU integration project. Hence, efforts to better understand and to reduce fractures within the EU have become more urgent than everbased on a better understanding of multiple perspectives, more inclusive policy initiatives and more balanced discourse.",

That being said, I do not dismiss the possibility that multiple and even antagonistic discourses might exist in ECJ and AG opinions. Moreover, texts are open to multiple readings, and this creates space for contestation and change. What is clear, however, is that more academic attention should be devoted to studying discourse produced by ECJ judges and by AGs. Both are in a positions of power to produce dominant discourse as they interpret and legitimise existing legal, political, economic and social arrangements which make such discourse possible in the first place. As this study shows, there are indications that both propagate discourse which others the CEE region and its nationals. The promise of the EU project dictates that we try to make discourse (and policies) more inclusive of contemporary demographic changes and transnational contexts, and more responsive to contemporary varieties of otherings and racismsimperative today more than ever. The first step is to make racialising discourse visible and to begin denormalising it. Both researchers and policymakers should endow CEE nationals with a greater voice and should also explore their agency, an essential part of the postcolonial project. Only then will it become possible to imagine-and ultimately, effectuate-a Europe which comes closer to its lofty goals.",

However, it is the only CEE country to do so, and largely due to its population size (38 million). Moreover, it is not clear how receptive western States have been to Poland's concerns. For example, Copsey and Pomorska's (2010) analysis of the EU's policy towards its eastern neighbours-an issue of key strategic importance to Poland-indicated that Poland's influence on EU policies has been low. Moreover, Euroskeptical policies of its current government have weakened Poland's ability to form coalitions with western delegations and have decreased its potential clout. 86 France, Germany and the UK.",
