Several SARS-CoV-2 gene mutations have been reported. In the current study associations between SARS-CoV-2 gene variation and exposure history during the first wave of the outbreak in Thailand between January and May 2020 were investigated. Forty samples were collected at different time points during the outbreak, and parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence were used to assess genomic variation patterns. The phylogenetics of the 40 samples were clustered into L, GH, GR, O and T types. T types were predominant in Bangkok during the first local outbreak centered at a boxing stadium and entertainment venues in March 2020. Imported cases were infected with various types, including L, GH, GR and O. In southern Thailand introductions of different genotypes were identified at different times. No clinical parameters were significantly associated with differences in genotype. The results indicated local transmission (type T, Spike protein (A829T)) and imported cases (types L, GH, GR and O) during the first wave in Thailand. Genetic and epidemiological data may contribute to national policy formulation, transmission tracking and the implementation of measures to control viral spread. open",

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human betacoronavirus, and its genome is closely related to SARS-CoV which emerged in 2002 and 2003 1 . As of 30 May 2020 there were more than 36,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in the GISAID database (https ://www.gisai d.org/), contributed by numerous laboratories around the world. During the early period of the outbreak genome sequencing revealed two types of viruses based on differences in two single nucleotide polymorphisms in ORF1ab and ORF8; L type and S type 8 . Another analysis categorized SARS-CoV-2 into three types, A, B, and C, based on amino acid changes 9 . As of 30 May 2020 there were seven clades identified in the GISAID database, S, L, V, G, GR, GH, and O.

Of those, one was a 73-year-old woman from Nakhon Pathom Province who had recently returned from China. The first unequivocally domestically contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection in Thailand was documented on 31 January 2020 when a taxi driver who had not travelled outside Thailand tested positive. In January the percentage of confirmed cases in which the patients were travellers from other countries was 89.5% (17/19) , but the corresponding percentage in February was 65.2% (15/23). On 29 February 2020 SARS-CoV-2 was designated a dangerous communicable disease under the Communicable Disease Act. The Act stipulates that all infected people must be hospitalized. On 15 March 2020 COVID-19 spread within a boxing stadium and drinking venues in Bangkok, then it spread throughout Thailand 12 .

The second assay used the LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV (TIB-Molbiol, Berlin, Germany) incorporating primers and probes corresponding to the RdRp and E genes. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5L of sample using a magLEAD 12gC instrument (Precision System Science, Chiba, Japan) with a magLEAD Consumable Kit (Precision System Science, Chiba, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA specimens were transferred to the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology at Chulalongkorn University for conventional PCR and sequencing, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, S, N and E genes were amplified via a primer set specific for SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1 ). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The one-step RT-PCR reactions were conducted using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, the PCR reaction mixture contained 2-3 \u03bcL of RNA, 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer, 12.5 \u03bcL of 2X Reaction Mix (Invitrogen) and 1 \u03bcL of SSIII RT/Platinum Taq Mix, and was adjusted to a final volume of 25 \u03bcL with nuclease-free water. Amplification was conducted in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) via a protocol including reverse transcription at 45 \u00b0C for 30 min, initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s of primer annealing at 53 \u00b0C, 90 s of extension at 68 \u00b0C, and further extension for 7 min at 68 \u00b0C. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel with a 100-base pair DNA ladder and visualized on an ultraviolet trans-illuminator. PCR products were gel-purified using the HiYield Gel/PCR DNA Fragment Extraction kit (RBC Bioscience Co, Taipei, Taiwan). DNA sequencing was performed by First BASE Laboratories Sdn Bhd, Selangor, Malaysia. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Phylogenetic analysis. The SeqMan II component of the DNAStar software (v. 6.0) was used for nucleotide sequence assembly. Genome sequences were aligned using ClustalW, implemented via the BioEdit program (v. 7.2.0). The MEGA program (v. 6.06) was used for phylogenetic tree construction, which was performed via the neighbour-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Evolutionary distances were calculated using the maximum composite likelihood method. Representative sequences from different areas of the world available in the GenBank and GISAID databases were utilized in phylogenetic analysis. Sequences were deposited in Gen-Bank (Accession no.

Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of worldwide SARS-CoV-2 isolates revealed five main clusters (Fig. 2a) . Based on genetic variations and amino acid changes the clusters were defined as L, S, G, V and O types. The types and patterns of nucleotide substitution are shown in Fig. 2b . Type L originated in China during the first period of the outbreak. Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) is the reference type L strain. Type S was detected during the early period of the outbreak, and it has nucleotide substitutions at position 8,782 in ORF1ab (C8782T) and 28,144 (T28144C) in ORF8. Types G and V evidently branched off from type L. Type G has single nucleotide changes in ORF1b (C14408T) and S (A23403G). There is also a GR strain In the present study WU5 was identified as type L, which was closely related to Wuhan-Hu-1. Ten strains were identified as type G, including seven GH strains and three GR strains. Two strains were identified as type O. Most of the samples (27/40) were clustered within the distinct type S branch. This branch was defined as type T based on a nucleotide substitution in the S gene (G24047A) and an amino acid change in the Spike protein (A829T). Therefore, type T was the most prevalent in the samples collected in Thailand in the present study.",

Therefore, we may have missed some genetic polymorphisms, which could potentially be of interest and reveal novel subclades to SARS-CoV-2. Due to the small sample size, a significant correlation between clinical symptoms and the viral genetic variation was not obtained. The samples we obtained encompassed the peak outbreak activity in Thailand at that time, so although they are limited in numbers, we believe that they may be sufficiently representative despite the relatively low sample size compared to other studies.",
