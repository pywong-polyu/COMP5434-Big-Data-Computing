It has led to the use of temporary isolation systems and less-then-optimum patient placement configurations because of inadequate number of isolation rooms, both of which can compromise provider safety. Three key elements require special attention to reduce the maximum and average aerosolized contaminant concentration exposure to a healthcare worker in any isolation system: flow rate; air changes per hour; and patient placement. This is important because concentration exposures of aerosolized contaminants to healthcare workers in hospitals using temporary isolation systems can reach levels 21-30 times greater than a properly engineered negative pressure isolation room. A working knowledge of these three elements can help create a safer environment for healthcare workers when isolation rooms are not available. [West J Emerg Med. 2020;21(6) 93-98.] respirator (PAPR), if their face is near or inside the opening of the isolation device their N-95 mask now has to filter air 21-30 times more contaminated then when wearing the N-95 mask in a standard NPIR. Therefore, the inhaled contaminants are 21-30 times greater than when the patient is in a NPIR without an isolation box. Second, when the isolation box is removed after intubation there is a release of air 21-30 times more contaminated than that of a patient in a NPIR without an isolation box into the local environment exposing nearby healthcare providers to these higher contamination levels. 2 Furthermore, the use of an isolation box in a hallway could expose this highly contaminated air to other patients or visitors in the hallway.",

Equation (3) shows this is achieved by having the highest flow rate, Q out , possible. The CCR will be identical for any given number, n, of patients in any two isolation systems as long as Q out is identical in each system. For this reason, Q out is a key element to pay attention to when assessing an isolation system. Equation (4) shows the role of ACH in determining the time it takes to reach T 99% . A larger ACH shortens this time. of 0.5 liter and respiratory rate (RR) of 40/minute or a q breath of 1.2 m 3 /hour. Therefore, this standard NPIR will reach 99% of its steady state aerosolized CCR of 0.33% in 0.4 hours (24 minutes). Simply put, the final room contaminant concentration will be 0.33% of the single patient-source contaminant concentration. The source contaminant concentration could be the patient's exhaled breath directly, the breath exhaled after passing through a mask, or even nebulized contaminants. As previously stated, standard NPIRs require an ACH =12. For comparison ACHs for operating rooms (OR), general medicine rooms, and hospital hallways are 15, 6 and 2, respectively. An OR is kept at positive pressure while rooms and hallways are kept at equal pressure with respect to the surrounding areas. 3 The maximum and average CCR exposures for steady state conditions, assuming equal exposure time and identical patients, are given for three configurations of an overwhelmed healthcare environment without an adequate number of NPIRs (shown in Figures 3, 4 , and 5).

They are not intended to be used for an aerosolized infectious disease environment when there are a sufficient number of properly engineered NPIRs available to meet patient demand. Figure 3 shows an overwhelmed system without a sufficient number of NPIRs where all five patients require isolation. Note the inverse relationship between the Q out values and the corresponding steady state CCR. Looking at the temporary isolation room (IR) and small portable isolation devices, for example, this same relationship does not hold for the ACH values. ACH does have an inverse relationship with the T 99% values. The small portable system in the hallway could represent a tent or isolation box and is assumed to have a passive air exchange of 12 ACH in this setting. Realize that 360 ACH would be required to achieve a standard NPIR Q out of 360 m 3 /hour. This won't directly affect the hallway until the 10% CCR small portable container, which is not actively ventilated, is opened when a provider needs access to the patient or is removed after the patient is intubated. The temporary IR is capable of 0.8 ACH, and the CCR will also reach a 10% CCR. Twenty-four ACH would be required to achieve a standard NPIR Q out of 360 m 3 / hour. The maximum CCR exposure of 10% to the healthcare worker occurs in the portable and temporary isolation systems and is 30 times the standard NPIR level. The average CCR exposure to the healthcare worker who spends equal time with each patient would be (0.33% + 0.67% + 2% + 10% + 10%)/5 = 4.6%, or 14 times the standard NPIR.

They are flow rate (Q out ), air changes per hour (ACH), and patient placement, which affects the maximum and average contaminant concentration ratio exposure. Q out determines the magnitude of the CCR.

The magnitude of the ACH determines the time the isolation system will reach 99% of its steady state value (T 99% ). A larger ACH will result in a smaller T 99% . Matching the ACH of any two isolation systems, regardless of their size, will ensure the T 99% are equal in both systems. Understanding these different effects of Q out and ACH are important to avoid maximum CCR exposures that can reach 21-30 times that of a standard NPIR as was shown with the small volume portable isolation box. The third key element (patient placement) becomes important when a hospital system is overwhelmed and it is not possible to place a patient requiring isolation into a standard NPIR.
