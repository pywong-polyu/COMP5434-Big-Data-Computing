We aimed to analyse spatial and seasonal changes in air pollution-related information-seeking behaviour in response to nationwide reported air quality in Poland. Google Trends Search Volume Index data was used to investigate Poles' interest in air pollution-related keywords. PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations measured across Poland between 2016 and 2019 as well as locations of monitoring stations were collected from the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection databases. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients were used to measure the strength of spatial and seasonal relationships between reported air pollution levels and the popularity of search queries. The highest PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations were observed in southern voivodeships and during the winter season. Similar trends were observed for Poles' interest in air pollution-related keywords. Greater interest in air quality data in Poland strongly correlates with both higher regional and higher seasonal air pollution levels. It appears that Poles are socially aware of this issue and that their intensification of the information-seeking behaviour seems to indicate a relevant ad hoc response to variable threat severity levels.",

It can be divided into indoor and outdoor (ambient) air pollution. The most common indicators of air pollution are the atmospheric concentration of particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less and 2.5 microns or less, described respectively as coarse particulate matter 10 (PM 10 ) and fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5 ). These particles are composed of organic and elemental carbon, nitrates, sulphates and trace elements, including nickel, cadmium, arsenic and lead particles [2, 3] . The World Health Organisation (WHO) sets the guideline values at 20 \u00b5g\u00b7m \u22123 annual mean and 50 \u00b5g\u00b7m \u22123 24-h mean for PM 10 concentration and 10 \u00b5g\u00b7m \u22123 annual mean and 25 \u00b5g\u00b7m \u22123 24-h mean for PM 2.5 concentration [4] .",

            "text": "In 2016, about 90% of the world population was breathing polluted air [5] . The highest levels of air pollution are found in low-income and middle-income countries. In Europe, the value of the PM 10 annual mean concentration set by the WHO guidelines was exceeded at 51% of the stations supervised by the European Environment Agency and in all the reporting countries, except Estonia, Finland and Ireland [5] . As 36 of the 50 most polluted cities in the European Union are in Poland [6] , the issue of air pollution is of particular importance in this country. The greatest contributors to the problem are the coal-based economy and household heating systems [6] . Ambient air pollution is estimated to cause about 4,200,000 premature deaths worldwide [1, 4] . 2 of 17 It is of high importance that individuals exposed to polluted air take active steps to reduce associated risks. To reduce direct exposure to high outdoor particulate matter concentrations people can, for example, avoid exercising outdoors or close to high-traffic areas [7] , stay indoors and close windows, or utilise air purifiers. Studies carried out in China and the US found that people reduced their outdoor activity when atmospheric PM 2.5 concentration rose [8] [9] [10] . Moreover, an increase in PM 2.5 concentration in China is associated with higher online searches for anti-PM 2.5 masks and air filters [11] . Other research showed that individuals limited their transportation-related physical activity and spent more time at home when particulate matter concentrations increased [9, 12] . These results show that people not only search for the information on their local air quality index but use it as a guideline to adapt their behavioural patterns. To date, no such study has been carried out in Poland [13] .",

A voivodeship represents the highest-level administrative division of Poland and is a regional administrative unit of Poland [28] . The area, population and population density of each voivodeship was extracted from Statistics Poland (Table 1 ) [29] . Moreover, in each voivodeship, a capital was selected to investigate potential differences in air quality and SVI values between rural and capitals. The latitude and longitude of each capital were extracted from LatitudeLongitude.org (Table 1 ) [30] . The data collected by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection between 2016 and 2019 inclusive were included in the analysis [3] . To analyse seasonal air quality changes, data for daily 24-h (24 h) mean PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations for each monitoring station between the years 2016 and 2019 were taken into account. Moreover, the number of PM 10 and PM 2.5 monitoring stations operating in a given year in a given voivodeship was determined, too (Tables 2 and 3 ). In total, for this period, records from 284 monitoring stations reporting PM 10 concentrations, and 130 monitoring stations reporting PM 2.5 concentrations were analysed ( Figure 1 ). To analyse spatial relationships, the same data points collected in the same monitoring stations were used. However, due to the availability of straightforward summary data, to minimize the risk of miscalculations, a database that summarises air pollution in Poland for the years 2000-2019 was used [3] . ",

Moreover, a strong linear correlation between the annual level of air pollution in a given area and the frequency of air pollution-related search queries is observed (Table 6 ) [32] . This means that the higher the mean yearly concentration of PM 10 and/or PM 2.5 concentration in a given area, the more frequently people are looking for their local air quality indexes, for example searching online for \"air quality\" or \"air pollution\". It was also found that the Google Trends GTSVI have higher correlations with PM concentrations for capitals' than for voivodeships'. Of all calculated PCCs, the highest one was observed for the correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and capitals' SVI. On the other hand, the weakest correlation was observed for PM 2.5 concentration and voivodeship's SVI. The correlations observed for PM 10 concentration and voivodeship's GTSVI as well as capitals' GTSVI are placed in-between the PM 2.5 -related correlations. Thus, it cannot be stated whether changes in PM 2.5 or PM 10 concentration are more connected with changes in Poles' air pollution-related information-seeking behaviour.",

Interestingly, except for GTSVI people's response to changing air quality levels can be also monitored via Twitter or Sina Weibo interactions [44, 46, 47] . Moreover, efforts are being made to inform people about the poor air quality more effectively [48, 49] . However, the general public may not link air pollution with its potential to increase the prevalence and/or exacerbation of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Therefore, they do not show enough interest in local air quality levels. In addition, society may not recognize the symptoms in an early stage of chronic disease exacerbation. Late admission to the hospital increases the probability of death which results in greater mortality rates [14, 15, 20, 21] . Thus, the general public may not be aware of secondary and tertiary prevention measures, which aim to reduce the impact of a disease that has already occurred [43] . For example, some researchers propose that there is no link between chronic inflammatory skin diseases symptoms and air pollution, which has been shown with the use of Google Trends GTSVI analyses [50, 51] . In addition, increased air pollution levels may exacerbate the course of ongoing chronic diseases [52] and affected individuals may not know that. Therefore, starting with chronically ill patients and individuals who live in the most polluted regions worldwide, there is a need for health promotion programs focused on air pollution-related secondary and tertiary prevention strategies, including accurate symptom recognition. Such interventions would result in faster responses to rapid, acute exacerbation of chronic disease symptoms and would probably reduce the cause-specific mortalities related to high air pollution levels, both in the short and long term. When it comes to seasonal air pollution distribution, the WHO-recommended annual PM10 concentrations were met in June, July, and August (Figure 4a,b) . On the other hand, in the November-March period, the WHO guidelines were greatly exceeded. Annual Last but not least, the greatest contributors to the problem of air quality in Poland are the coal-based economy and household heating systems [6] . To reduce the hospital admission and mortality rates potentially caused by air pollution as well as to comply with WHO air quality guidelines, there seems to be a very urgent need for a shift towards more ecological energy production sources.",

This may have generated bias in the data, as the concentration of particulate matter is highly dependent on measurement location and locations of the monitoring stations analysed in this study are city-centred. However, as such a pattern is observed in all voivodeships the data are uniformly biased. In addition to that, similar trends in air quality observations were made by other studies which used their measurement stations [34] [35] [36] . In addition, as mentioned in the Google Trends methodological framework [27] sometimes Google Trends SVIs may differ, even though the keywords used are the same, for example, because the search query was embedded in quotation marks. To reduce this bias, all keywords analysed in this study were always entered without quotation marks, plus signs or any other special characters. Only spaces were used to separate double-word keywords, allowing for the broadest tracking possible. Moreover, Google Trends GTSVI shows the relative, not the absolute number of search queries. However, correlation coefficients can be calculated from either absolute or relative values, thus the calculations in this study remain valid.",

Moreover, the seasonal and regional intensification of their informationseeking behaviour seems to indicate a relevant ad hoc response to the variable threat severity levels. However, the correlations presented in our study do not indicate causal relationships and the need for further research to answer the foremost question of causality is strongly endorsed.",
