Data from the 2015 Chinese Social Survey (CSS) (N = 4,605) demonstrated that objective uncertainty negatively predicted the happiness of young people (aged 18-45 years). However, this negative relationship was attenuated among those who evaluated the institutional system (e.g., social security, local government effectiveness, and trust in government) positively; in other words, positive institutional evaluation may have protected people's happiness from the threat of uncertainty. In addition, participants from different age groups evaluated the institutional system differently. The first generation born after the Chinese economic reform, which includes young people born in the 1980s (aged 26-35 years), had unique experiences compared to the preceding (aged 36-45 years, born in the 1970s) and succeeding (aged 18-25 years, born in the 1990s) generations. Among the three age groups, young people born in the 1980s held the least positive evaluation of the institutional system. The institutional evaluation also showed the weakest moderating effect on this group's happiness.",

The cumulative effects of uncertainties result in negative, or even extreme, psychological responses among people.

Internalizing the legitimacy of social systems could elevate the sense of control in individuals and satisfy their need for structure and order (Jost and Banaji, 1994) . A given social system comprises various social arrangements, such as those constituting families, institutions, organizations, governments, and nature. These arrangements include both institutions and social norms, such as de facto institutional structures, systems of allocation, and socialization, as well as governments, judicial systems, and other substantive forms of social existence (Jost and Banaji, 1994) . When uncertainties in life lead to perceptions of randomness and fluctuating perceptions of personal control, the social system as a robust external order could reduce the randomness (Kay et al., 2008) . According to the Human Development Report (United Nations Development Programme, 2014) , active governmental response to the needs of citizens, comprehensive public policies, and instructive social norms are beneficial to reducing psychological vulnerabilities, feelings of injustice, and other negative emotions and exclusionary behaviors. A positive institutional evaluation may buffer the negative effects of uncertainty in life and enable people to gain positive psychology.",

Studies from China have found that there are differences among young Chinese people based on their values, social participation, trust, democratic consciousness, and sense of fairness (Li, 2019) .

It is possible that subjective uncertainty is more significant than objective uncertainty, as the former may have a greater impact on the responses of individuals. However, a relationship between objective uncertainty and happiness could be more powerful considering a less individualized measure of uncertainty and its broader practical implications. For example, it could remind policy-makers to modify existing systems to tackle objective uncertainty. In the present study, we examine, among other factors, unemployment, real estate purchases, illness, and parental caretaking responsibilities as our measures of objective uncertainty with the aim of bridging the gap in extant literature.",

Research has also focused on the trust of individuals in social institutions to examine the effects of institutional evaluation on happiness. Portela et al.

Governmental agencies and systems can serve as robust and stable sources of external order, motivating individuals to reestablish their sense of control. In turn, these external systems can satisfy the need for structure and order among individuals. Individuals with a lower sense of control are likely to be more reliant on external social systems and defend the legitimacy of such systems (Jost and Banaji, 1994) .

In the statistical analyses of existing literature, two approaches-considering age as a continuous variable (age) and a categorical variable (age group)-have been used. Grouping people by age is a common statistical strategy, especially in sociological literature (Nan and Heath, 1995; Matthijs and Kalmijn, 2017) . In this article, we regard age as a grouping variable, with the aim of examining heterogeneity among young people based on the analysis of the overall situation of the demographic. If age is used as a continuous variable, only onedimensional coefficients can be obtained, which would not allow the internal heterogeneity of young people to be assessed in detail. In addition, our sample size is large enough (N = 4,605) to support our analysis of heterogeneity among younger groups. Based on the Chinese context, at the age of 25 years people usually complete their master's education and begin their career. Cohorts aged 25-45 years may exhibit certain in-group differences since within this time period individuals often transition from holding entry-level jobs to having an established career; similarly, individuals often transition from seeking relationship partners to having a stable family life. Hence, we divided the sample population into three age groups: 18-25 years (young people born in the 1990s), 26-35 years (young people born in the 1980s), and 36-45 years (young people born in the 1970s). Subsequently, we examined the moderating and optimizing effects of institutional evaluation on the relationship between objective uncertainty and happiness, separately for each age group. Prior to our analysis, we compared demographic factors across the age groups (Table 3 ) and found statistically significant differences in employment and marital status, whereas the three stable demographic factors (i.e., gender, ethnicity, and Hukou status) were evenly distributed. The results further justify our current method of splitting the sample based on the age of the respondents.",

When the institutional evaluation of individuals is relatively positive, the slope of the curve is at its flattest (\u03b2 = \u22120.05); in other words, the negative association between uncertainty and happiness is at its most minimal. In contrast, when the level of institutional evaluation is relatively low (\u03b2 = \u22120.392), the slope of the curve is the steepest. When the level of institutional evaluation is at the intermediate level (\u03b2 = \u22120.202), the negative association between uncertainty and happiness also lies between the two extremes.

A plot representing the potential three-way interaction is illustrated in Model 3. We presented the moderating effect of institutional evaluation on uncertainty and happiness in three groups that were split according to the age of the respondents, which included cohorts of 18-25-year-olds, 26-35-year-olds, and 36-45-yearolds, respectively. In examining the interaction coefficients, the moderating effect of the institutional evaluation was significantly different between the cohort of 26-35-year-olds and the cohort of 18-25-year-olds (see Table 4 ). The moderating effect was stronger in the cohort of 18-25-year-olds, which is reflected in Figure 2 . In the cohort of 18-25-year-olds, specifically, the top curve is almost horizontal to the x-axis, suggesting that when individuals rated the institutional system more positively, the negative association between uncertainty and happiness was weaker, and when individuals rated the institutional system less positively, the negative association between uncertainty and happiness was more pronounced (the third curve on the plot for the cohort of 18-25-year-olds shows a steep negative slope). In other words, the moderating effect of institutional evaluation on uncertainty and happiness was most salient in the cohort of 18-25-year-olds. From a policy-making perspective, increasing institutional evaluation in young people aged 18-25 years yielded the highest rate of return in terms of increasing subjective happiness. Conversely, the three curves are most closely clustered for the cohort of 26-35-year-olds, suggesting that the moderating effect of institutional evaluation on uncertainty and happiness was the weakest for this cohort. Additionally, the three-way interaction coefficients showed that there was no significant difference between the cohort of 36-45-year-olds and the cohort of 18-25-year-olds in terms of moderating effect (see Table 4 ). Thus, the moderation of institutional evaluation on uncertainty and happiness was also effective for the cohort of 36-45-year-olds. The three curves show clear divergence; the negative association between uncertainty and happiness was noticeably weaker under high institutional evaluation in comparison to low institutional evaluation. Taken together, this shows that the moderating effect of the high institutional evaluation was more pronounced for the cohorts of 18-25-and 36-45-year-olds. Consequently, improving their institutional evaluation would help them achieve higher levels of happiness.",

This finding can be applied in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic; through institutional construction, people's trust and evaluation of the system can be improved and the negative psychological consequences caused by the pandemic can be mitigated. Previous studies have also found that people's dependence on and expectations of external systems have increased during the pandemic. For example, the uncertainty caused by the pandemic led to increased support of Donald Trump, the President of the United States (Jones, 2020) , as well as enhanced trust in the formal social system (Kye and Hwang, 2020) .",

As a special group and social generation, young people have their own characteristics. Their lives have been marked by major social changes, such as the one-child policy, rapid economic growth, the rise of the Internet, education expansion, marketization, urbanization, and globalization, which have had a considerable impact on their living circumstances and opportunities, shaping their generational characteristics while widening the intergenerational gap between them and previous generations (Li, 2019) .",

This generation also had to deal with high real estate prices (Fan, 2012) .

The buffering effect of lower institutional evaluation on higher uncertainty was not too strong. Moreover, the weaker buffering effect could be due to the age stage or generation experience of the people born in the 1980s. From the perspective of the age cohort, they are at a stage where employment, marriage, and childbirth issues arise simultaneously; while 18-25-year-olds are yet to enter the stage completely, and most of the people aged 36-45 years have completed the major life tasks. From the perspective of generation difference, the institutional evaluation of young people born in the 1980s was weaker.

The group of 26-35-year-olds is economically active and faces pressures related to the market and economy, which may be the reason for their lower institutional evaluation and the weaker effect of institutional evaluation. A recent survey on institutional trust amid the COVID-19 pandemic showed that respondents aged 26-39 years were the least satisfied with the government's behavior, which may explain the commonality of institutional evaluation in this age group around the world (Chamier et al., 2020) .",
