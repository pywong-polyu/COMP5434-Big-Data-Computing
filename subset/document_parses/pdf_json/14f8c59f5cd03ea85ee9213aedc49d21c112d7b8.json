Due to their biological complexity and the long generation time of their keystone tree species, genetic adaptation in these ecosystems might not be fast enough to keep track with conditions changing at such a fast pace. The study of adaptation to environmental change and its genetic mechanisms is therefore key for ensuring a sustainable support and management of forests. The 4-day conference of the European Research Group EvolTree (https:// www. evolt ree. eu) on the topic of \"Genomics and Adaptation in Forest Ecosystems\" brought together over 130 scientists to present and discuss the latest developments and findings in forest evolutionary research. Genomic studies in forest trees have long been hampered by the lack of high-quality genomics resources and affordable genotyping methods. This has dramatically changed in the last few years; the conference impressively showed how such tools are now being applied to study past demography, adaptation and interactions with associated organisms. Moreover, genomic studies are now finally also entering the world of conservation and forest management, for example by measuring the value or cost of interspecific hybridization and introgression, assessing the vulnerability of species and populations to future change, or accurately delineating evolutionary significant units. The newly launched conference series of EvolTree will hopefully play a key role in the exchange and synthesis of such important investigations.",

Among many others, the European Research Group EvolTree (https:// www. evolt ree. eu) has widely contributed to various aspects of forest genomic research. This self-supporting network of research institutes across mostly European countries has recently launched a new conference series to address a broad palette of topics in the context of genetic and genomic research in forest ecosystems, be it at the level of single species, communities or trophic interactions. The inaugural conference of this series was held at the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Birmensdorf, in mid-September 2021, entitled \"Genomics and Adaptation in Forest Ecosystems\". Under the restrictions given by the COVID-19 regulations, the conference organizers were challenged by establishing a hybrid event, allowing both onsite and online participation. This format enabled scientific exchange and personal contacts even across continents and the opportunities for interaction given by this conference were well received by the 132 participants from 27 nations. Over 4 days, the six topical sessions with 34 oral presentations and 23 posters (Table S1) covered complementary facets (Figure 1 ) of how individuals, populations and species cope with their environment. A wide range of approaches highlighted how diverse not only forests and their organisms are, but also the methodological toolboxes applied in forest genomics research. The latter was exemplified by two complementary teaching lectures on the availability and practical use of environmental data by Benjamin Dauphin (WSL, Switzerland) and on the population genetic simulation tools Nemo and Nemo-age by Fred Guillaume (University of Helsinki, Finland; Rougement 2006, Cotto et al. 2020 ). The conference also included an excursion for on-site participants to the Forest Lab Z\u00fcrich (https:// www. waldl abor. ch/).",

Although quantifying fitness in forest trees can be challenging, adaptive loci can still be identified by studying how allele frequencies change along environmental gradients through genotype-environment association (GEA) studies or are associated to adaptive phenotypic variations using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). An example of the former was provided by Jill Sekely (Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany) that identified the main climatic drivers of adaptation of Nothofagus pumilio along a 2000-km latitudinal transect in the Andean. Domitille Coq--Etchegaray (INRAE, France) used a GWAS on metabolomics data to evidence that micro-characters, such as leaf specialized metabolites that are notably involved in response to abiotic stress, can have an oligogenic architecture in sessile oak (Quercus petraea). Gaining insight into the relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and environments can help refine predictive models of species distribution under various climate change scenarios. Brandon Lind (University of British Columbia, Canada) compared the performances of various models of genetic offset by confronting their predictions with actual data from extensive common gardens of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).",

Long-lived trees as the foundation species of forest ecosystems provide a matrix of resources and habitats for associated organisms, with interactions ranging from beneficial to detrimental. The session \"Genomics of interactions\" addressed these complex interplays at the intraspecific and inter-kingdom levels and at diverse spatial and temporal scales. At the intraspecific level, Matthieu Tiret (Uppsala University, Sweden) discussed implementing group selection in tree breeding programs, because intraspecific competition of neighbouring trees proved to affect stand performance. At the interkingdom level, focusing on the mycorrhizal symbiosis, the keynote of Annegret Kohler (INRAE, France) highlighted how symbiotic lifestyle and interaction with host plants have shaped fungal genomes and transcriptomes. Besides a reduction in plant cell wall-degrading genes as a consequence of symbiosis, a heterogenous set of conserved genes that predate mycorrhizal evolution as well as new, lineage-specific genes were independently adopted for symbiosis function in diverse fungal lineages. This talk also showed that genes expressed in symbiosis setup seem not to point towards a mutualistic relationship, but rather resemble pathogenic interactions. For example, effector-like proteins are secreted also by mutualists and interfere with signalling pathways to reduce the hosts' defence reactions. An elegant approach of finding the genetic basis of ectomycorrhizal traits was presented by Benjamin Dauphin (WSL, Switzerland). Progenies of a single fungal fruitbody interacting with a poplar clone revealed wide variation in phenotypic traits such as the proportion of roots colonized, ranging from incompatible to fully compatible strains. Transcriptome data from symbiotic tissues supported these strain-specific differences, and GWAS analyses are underway to detect responsible gene variants. Similarly, Isacco Beritognolo (CNR, Italy) presented an extreme-phenotype GWAS identifying genetic determinants that underlie the resistance of sweet chestnut to one of its most damaging pests, the Asian chestnut gall wasp. Such studies may assist in the genetic improvement of chestnut and development of effective methods to control this parasite. Renate Heinzelmann (University of British Columbia, Canada) finally made clear that not only genetic variation in host trees and associated organisms, but also the environment determines the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. Dothistroma needle blight in North American pine forests indicates spatial patterns of genotype-genotype-phenotype interactions, the knowledge of which might help predicting disease outbreaks in future climate as well as managing forests using assisted migration.",

At the species level, there are indications of past population growth, e.g. in the widely distributed Pinus sylvestris, during the past million years and after the last glacial maximum (Chedly Kastally, University of Helsinki, Finland). On the other hand, in species with a more restricted distribution and niche, like Pinus cembra, the current speed of change seems more rapid than the capacity of genomic change, and there is a risk of non-adaptedness over a short time scale (Felix Gugerli, WSL, Switzerland; Dauphin et al. 2021) .",

The proposed solution is the joint inference of both demographic and selection parameters, e.g. using approximate Bayesian computation. In many tree species, this may be challenging because fragmented reference genomes limit the acquisition of informative linkage disequilibrium estimates and other statistics on physical proximity of different loci and genes. However, as genome assemblies get better with long-read sequencing techniques, this may be a passing problem.",

These results will provide a basis to support future seed transfer and breeding strategies. Focusing on another North American conifer, red spruce (Picea rubens), Susanne Lachmuth (University of Maryland, USA) demonstrated how standardized genomic offsets can be used to inform climate-smart seed transfer.

In the case of the European sessile (Quercus petraea) and downy oak (Q. pubescens), highly informative sets of SNPs enable accurate species identification and assessment of genetic introgression. Oliver Reutimann (WSL and ETH, Switzerland) showed that not only species composition, but also the degree of admixture between these two interfertile species can be predicted using environmental and topographic variables.

In the 2010s, next-generation sequencing (NGS) increasingly gained importance in forest genomic research (Holliday et al. 2017) . Reference genomes of several ecologically and economically important forest trees have now been assembled (e.g. Nystedt et al. 2013 , Plomion et al. 2018 , Mosca et al. 2019 ).

Moreover, understanding the underlying demography and population structure not only is crucial when assessing adaptation, but also further exacerbates the detection of adaptation signatures in the genome. It is evident that long-term common-garden experiments, covering a wide ecological amplitude of provenances and field sites, remain indispensable in forest genetics. Hence, a better support by funding agencies in forestry research is needed for establishing such trials or maintaining existing ones to ensure the availability of this important tool for the next generation of forest genomics researchers. Their combination with analyses of genomic data appears to be a very promising and powerful way to predict environmental responses of forest trees. New computational and modelling methods have expanded the available toolbox for this purpose (e.g. Fitzpatrick et al. 2021) . To this end, advances in phenotyping methods, including dendrochronological and remote sensing approaches, enable a detailed, more efficient and accurate identification of traits under selection (e.g. Depardieu et al. 2021 , d'Odorico et al. 2020 .",

Symbiosis greatly affects adaptive variation of both forest tree species as hosts and organisms interacting with them, like mycorrhiza, pathogens and parasites. Such interactions may directly or indirectly mediate between trees and their environment with all types of effects from positive to negative. Interactions among individuals of the same species and temporal changes in allele frequencies within a forest stand are topics that certainly deserve more attention. The evolutionary significance of interspecific hybridization was stressed in several talks dealing with various genera of forest trees (firs, pines, oaks). In these genera, considering a species as a fixed evolutionary unit is most likely not purposeful in view of climate-driven dynamics, because adaptive introgression from a sister species might actually facilitate adaptation to a changing environment. Hybridization and introgression will therefore be important topics in future research of climate change genomics.",
