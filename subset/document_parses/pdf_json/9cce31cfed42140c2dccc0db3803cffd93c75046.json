            "text": "The highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the use of widespread testing to control the spread of the virus. Presently, the standard molecular testing method (reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) is restricted to the laboratory, time-consuming, and costly. This increases the turnaround time for getting test results. This study sought to develop a rapid, nearpatient saliva-based test for COVID-19 (Saliva-Dry LAMP) with similar accuracy to that of standard RT-PCR tests. A lyophilized dual-target reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) test with fluorometric detection by the naked eye was developed. The assay relies on dry reagents that are room temperature stable. A device containing a centrifuge, heat block, and blue LED light system was manufactured to reduce the cost of performing the assay. This test has a limit of detection of 1 copy/\u00b5L and achieved a positive percent agreement of 100% [95% CI 88.43% to 100.0%] and a negative percent agreement of 96.7% [95% CI 82.78-99.92%] relative to a reference standard test. Saliva-Dry LAMP can be completed in 105 min. Precision, cross-reactivity, and interfering substances analysis met international regulatory standards. The combination of ease of sample collection, dry reagents, visual detection, low capital equipment cost, and excellent analytical sensitivity make Saliva-Dry LAMP particularly useful for resource-limited settings.",

            "text": "Due to the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals 1 , widespread testing for COVID-19 is critically important to preventing the spread of the virus 1 . The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense demands on molecular testing infrastructure 2,3 . Presently, the standard method for COVID-19 diagnostic testing is reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 4-6 . This method cannot be deployed outside of a laboratory. However, for the sake of contact tracing and self-isolation, the utility of a test relates to how quickly one can receive the results of the test after the sample is obtained 7,8 . Tests which require transporting samples to a centralized laboratory increases this time. Not surprisingly, governments have pushed for the immediate development of rapid, near-patient tests for COVID-19 9,10 . Near-patient tests must yield straight-forward results which are easy to interpret. For remote settings, these tests should not be reliant on cold-chains and sophisticated equipment. To meet this immediate need, we developed Saliva-Dry LAMP, a rapid, near-patient saliva test for COVID-19 that uses lyophilized dual-target reverse transcriptase-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with fluorometric detection by the naked-eye 11 . This test can be performed on a portable and low-cost device that we manufactured.",

The RNA extraction method was tested with undiluted saliva (neat saliva), however, this resulted in the spin columns getting clogged. Instead of adding additional steps to overcome clogging, saliva was collected in UTM. Saliva diluted in UTM (approximately 25% saliva, 75% UTM, 140 \u00b5L total) was mixed with 560 \u00b5L of a concentrated preparation of lysis buffer and spiked with 2 \u00b5L of 50,000 pfu/\u00b5L MS2 bacteriophage (Zeptometrix, Buffalo, NY). Buffers used are described previously by Zainabadi et al. 13 . This lysate was hand shaken, then incubated at 61 \u00b0C for 5 min. The lysate was applied to a spin column (Omega Bio-Tek Inc., Norcross, USA) and spun in a mySPIN\u2122 12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) for 110 s at a peak speed of 11,300 RPM. The flow-through was discarded and 500 \u00b5L of wash 1 was applied to the column. The column was centrifuged again (110 s, 11,300 RPM) and the flow-through discarded. Next, 500 \u00b5L of wash 2 was applied to the column before centrifugation for 170 s at a peak speed of 11,300 RPM. Columns were then transferred to new collection tubes and 50 \u00b5L of elution buffer was added. RNA was eluted with a final spin (110 s, 11,300 RPM).",

The Biobox comprised of three components-centrifuge, heating block and transilluminator (470 nm light emitting diode, LED, arrays). The design was prepared using Solidworks\u2122 2020 (Dassault Systems, Waltham, USA). All housing parts/fixtures were fabricated using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer (Anycubic C, Commerce, USA) with poly-lactic acid (PLA) filament unless specified. The centrifuge rotor was fabricated using polycarbonate filament. The transilluminator consists of two LED arrays-a 6 \u00d7 8 LED array mounted inside the Biobox and a pair of 2 \u00d7 8 LED arrays mounted on the sides of the cap to provide illumination from the sides. A second cap was placed on the transilluminator with acrylic sheet window to block the wavelengths emitted by the LED's but not the intercalating dye. The aluminum heating block was machined to house both 2 mL and 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The temperature of the heating block was maintained at 61 \u00b0C using three heating elements and three thermocouple sensors. The centrifuge was made with a direct current (DC) powered brushless motor (T-motor F40 Pro3 2600 kV, Nanchang, P.R.C.) mounted on an aluminum bracket. The centrifuge rotor was mounted on the brushless motor and achieved 8000 RCF. All components were controlled by an ESP32 microprocessor. The device is operated through the user interface using an LCD display and pushbuttons. A DC power supply of 21-23 V was used to power the device.",

In terms of limiting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the advantages of Saliva-Dry LAMP are its superior sample-to-result time (~ 105 min) compared to RT-PCR, near-patient deployment, ease of application, and cost 8 . The performance characteristics, limit of detection, and ease-of-use of Saliva-Dry LAMP are comparable to some near-patient nucleic acid COVID-19 tests. STOPCovid is a rapid diagnostic test that employs LAMP and CRISPR technology but relies on NP swabs 26 . Saliva-Dry LAMP achieved similar sensitivity as STOPCovid (93.1%, 188/202) and specificity (98.5%, 197/200) 26 . Lalli et al. developed an extraction-free RT-LAMP test for COVID-19 using saliva with colorimetric detection 27 . Lalli et al. achieved a slightly higher limit of detection than Saliva-Dry LAMP (59 copies/reaction or 21.6 copies/\u00b5L of saliva) but the clinical validation achieved a sensitivity of 85% (17/20) and a specificity of 90% (9/10) 27 . A limitation of this study is that the Saliva-Dry LAMP limit of detection experiments were conducted with a quantified high titre NP swab sample (which was diluted in 25% saliva, 75% UTM) instead of diluting a high titre saliva sample. Further limit of detection experiments should be done starting with a quantified saliva sample to eliminate any artifacts caused by the NP swab.",

The benefit of using Illucidx RT-LAMP reactions is that they do not require the external addition of dye and resuspension buffer requiring refrigeration. With regards to the MS2 external amplification controls, these reactions have a limited ability to serve as controls for RT-LAMP inhibitors in the SARS-CoV-2 reactions as they use a smaller volume of extracted RNA than the SARS-CoV-2 reactions. Any inhibitors present would be more diluted in the MS2 reactions, attenuating any inhibitory effects.

In particular, the silica spin column-based RNA extraction has many pipetting steps which increases both the required time, and the risk of introducing laboratory contamination. Finally, the equipment developed here still requires electricity and further refinements to increase portability. A second prototype of the Biobox relying on a lithium-ion battery is feasible and is currently being evaluated. Future studies will aim to port Saliva-Dry LAMP onto a microfluidic cartridge, improving speed, and point-of-care feasibility.
