COVID-19 clinical studies play a crucial role in controlling the virus. Yet it is unclear what types of patients were considered by these studies. This study analyzed 3,765 COVID-19 clinical study summaries downloaded from a major clinical trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov. We employed natural language processing techniques to parse the study description and eligibility criteria of these studies and then performed descriptive and clustering analysis on the parsing results. We found that older adults were not systematically excluded but pregnant women were often excluded. It was also found that the known risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma, which may lead to serious illnesses, were considered by less than 5% of the studies according to their study description and eligibility criteria. This study provides an evidence that natural language processing can be applied to examine the design of clinical studies and identify issues that may cause delays in patient recruitment and the lack of real-world population representativeness.",

Globally, more than 2 million people have died due to COVID-19 and 472,000 in the U.S. alone. In April 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership to prioritize and speed up the clinical evaluation of the most promising treatments and vaccines [3] . In July 2020, NIH released its strategic plan for COVID-19 research to speed up the development of treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics [4] . Traditionally, it may take years to discover, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic agent; nevertheless, for COVID-19, the goal has been to compress the timeline to months while continuing to apply rigorous standards to ensure safety and efficacy.",

Regardless of the techniques (e.g., in vivo, in silico, or in vitro) used for drug discovery and development, the therapeutics and vaccines have to go through three phases of clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy and safety before approvals (e.g., by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) can be granted for mass production and use in the general population. In the past few months, many COVID-19 clinical studies have been launched around the world, leading to situations where studies have to compete for participants from the same pool of eligible participants. Trials such as those for the promising drug -Remdesivir -were suspended due to the lack of trial participants in China [8] . Other issues such as population representativeness are also critical. In the past, older adults are often excluded from clinical trials with overly restrictive exclusion criteria, which lead to concerns on the generalizability of those clinical studies across many disease domains [9] . A recent New York Times article conjectured that older adults are left out from COVID-19 trials [10] . It is therefore important to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and further identify the gaps and issues that may cause delays in patient recruitment and the lack of real-world population representativeness, especially for older adults.",

While most of these studies analyzed the basic characteristics of the included trials, some studies further analyzed the interventions [18] [19] [20] [21] , locations [13, 14, 18] , data monitoring characteristics [14] , timing of the registration and enrollment [15, 21] , outcomes [19, 20] , risk of biases [16] , Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords (Words or phrases that best describe the protocol) [19] , sample size [17] , and a subset of eligibility criteria [16, 22] . Nonetheless, existing studies have not comprehensively investigated the categorical eligibility criteria and the consideration of known risk factors of severe illnesses in COVID-19 clinical studies. To do so, advanced approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) are necessary. As such, we can gain a better understanding of the landscape of COVID-19 research and answer a number of important research questions: (1) What eligibility criteria are used in COVID-19 clinical studies? (2) Further, as more COVID-19 cases have been identified and treated in the past 8 months, we have accumulated important knowledge on the underlying health conditions and other risk factors that may cause severe illness among COVID-19 patients (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) [23] . Have existing clinical studies considered these known risk factors? (3) Last but not the least, because of the concerns on study generalizability in older adults, it is of interest to assess whether the COVID-19 clinical studies excluded subjects with common chronic conditions that are prevalent in older adults, potentially leading to their underrepresentation.",

To do so, we used the risk factor terms as the input and identified their corresponding Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) using QuickUMLS [28] with the default setting (Jaccard similarity threshold > 0.8, all semantic types included). As a concept of the UMLS is associated with its synonyms from UMLS source ontologies, we were able to unify all the terms mentioned in the text. Table 1 lists the risk factors that may lead to severe COVID-19 and their associated UMLS CUIs. This list was used as a dictionary in QuickUMLS [28] to identify risk factors from the study description. As reported in Soldaini et al.

The CFG module uses a lexer to divide criteria into tokens and a modified Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm to build parse trees from tokens, which are subsequently analyzed by removing duplicates and subtrees. The IE module uses an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random field layer for named entity recognition to extract MeSH terms from criteria text. Based on the evaluation in [29] , its performance is competitive in entity recognition, entity linking, and attribute linking. As it only extracted MeSH concepts from eligibility criteria but not their temporal constraints and other qualifiers, we called them \"eligibility features\" in this paper. To evaluate its concept extraction accuracy, we manually reviewed a random sample of 300 rows of extracted results along with their original criteria. In the extracted results, there are cases where a term was identified but was not matched to a MeSH concept. In such cases, we considered them to be false negatives. The precision is 98.9%. The recall is 81.1%. The false negative ones were mostly quantitative criteria (29.3%) or due to missing concepts in MeSH (48.3%). We also identified the parsing errors of the frequent concepts and used Python to correct them in the whole parsing result. For example, we corrected the parsing results of the criterion \"men\", which was parsed as \"multiple endocrine neoplasia\". It is fine to miss some quantitative criteria as they were extracted by Valx [30] with a high sensitivity and specificity. We also merged similar concepts in the parsing results based on (1) is intuitive, we explain the process of (2) and (3) in details as follows.",

After the inclusion and exclusion criteria are parsed by the aforementioned tool [29] , we utilized the parsed concepts as features to construct clinical study representation. For inclusion and exclusion eligibility features, we first removed the duplicated concepts for each clinical study. For example, if \"pregnancy women\" is mentioned multiple times in the exclusion criteria, only one was kept. Then, we append the prefixes 'inc' or 'exc' to the concepts extracted from inclusion or exclusion criteria respectively to differentiate them. After data preprocessing, we constructed the data representations by treating each clinical study as a text document that contains concepts from inclusion and exclusion eligibility features.

The optimal k was chosen when the silhouette value average of all instances is high and there are at least 20 instances for each cluster. To visualize the clustering result, we employed the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [32] to project the high dimensional data into twodimensional space for visualization. The UMAP reduces the dimensions by estimating the topology of the high dimensional data. It considers the local relationships within groups and global relationships between groups. UMAP can be applied directly to sparse matrices. In addition, we also clustered only the interventional studies considering both the extracted eligibility features and the enrollment values. The reason we included only interventional studies in this analysis is that observational studies often have a huge enrollment value, thereby dominating the clustering results. In addition, the eligibility criteria of observational studies are usually broad and unrestrictive. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of eligibility features (weighted by TF-IDF) to k and then added two more features: the enrollment value (normalized to 0-1) and the intervention type, due to their importance deemed by the study team. The original dimension is 2608 presenting the total number of eligibility features. Since we add two study features, in order to avoid biases and preserve the data distribution on eligibility features, we experimented with k value from 10 to 15. There is no significant difference between the clustering results based on the optimal silhouette and the cluster distribution. Hence, k value was set to 10 in this study.",

Even though a majority of studies did not exclude patients with these chronic conditions, some highly prevalent chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and COPD are among the most frequently used exclusion criteria in 3.64% -9.99% studies. Few studies purposely included patients with a risk factor that may lead to serious illnesses, but many studies explicitly excluded them, especially pregnant women. According to the results of the statistical tests, on average, interventional studies used more risk factors in eligibility criteria than observational studies (mean: 1.19 vs. 0.22, p<0.001, two-tailed t-test).

Pregnancy is the most frequent exclusion criterion in all the 7 clusters. Cluster #0 and #1 are the largest clusters with low silhouette value and the trials in these clusters often excluded patients with different diseases. Studies in Cluster #0 often included patients with pneumonia and excluded patients with cognition/cognitive behavioral therapy/cognitive dysfunction. Studies in Cluster #1 often excluded patients who are on therapeutics, kidney diseases, and cancer. Studies in Cluster #2 often included patients with polymerase chain reaction. All the trials in Cluster #3 excluded pregnant women. Studies in Cluster #5 often excluded HIV/HIV Infections, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Cancer. Cluster #6 has the highest silhouette value which indicates that the studies in it are more cohesive than those in other clusters. Most studies in Cluster #6 have no exclusion criteria. Through the clustering analysis, we can help classify studies on relationships not available a priori and identify sets of clinical studies focusing on different study population.

Visualization of the 7 clusters using UMAP] Discussion As the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has significantly impacted our lives and even taken lives of almost 3 millions of people so far, we must quickly identify repurposed drugs or develop new drugs and vaccines to safely and effectively control the spread of the virus and save lives. Clinical studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are a fundamental tool used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medical interventions for disease prevention or treatment. Many clinical studies are being conducted to find safe and effective treatments and vaccines. Thus far, significant efforts have been devoted to repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs including immunosuppression (e.g., Hydroxychloroquine, Tocilizumab), anti-virus (e.g., Fevipiravir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir), anti-parasite (e.g., Ivermectin, Nitazoxanide), antibiotics (e.g., Azithromycin), and anticoagulant (e.g., Enoxaparin). In our analysis of the COVID-19 clinical studies, we found that the use of eligibility criteria and consideration of risk factors in these studies did not change much from June 18, 2020 to November 27, 2020 even though the number of COVID-19 studies in ClinicalTrials.gov grew from 2,192 to 4,028.",

            "text": "The US National Institutes of Health and the National COVID-19 adequately considered the representation of real-world populations. Based on our analysis, most clinical studies consider both genders (97.4%, N=3,667), do not have an upper age limit 67.3% (N= 2,534), and have a lower age limit of 18 (75.9%, N=2,856). The exclusion of children in these studies may be due to lower susceptibility and lower rates of mortality and hospitalization for children with COVID-19 compared to adults[35]. As serious illnesses of COVID-19 mostly occurred in older adults with underlying health conditions, it is not surprising that they are in general considered by most COVID-19 studies, based on our analysis of their eligibility criteria. Most studies did not set an upper age limit (67.3%, N= 2534) and did not exclude older adults with common chronic conditions. This is contrary to the recent New York Times articles conjecturing that older people are left out form COVID-19 trials[10]. As older adults are the most likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19, clinicians may be more likely to choose to include them to fulfill the sample size requirement of the trials. Nonetheless, conducting COVID-19 clinical studies could still be challenging in the traditional clinical trial eco-system, where patient accrual is often delayed due to logistical constraints[36]. The generalizability of the study results to the real-world population should be evaluated with state-of-the-art techniques[9]. Older adults could have still been underrepresented in COVID-19 clinical studies due to logistical reasons, which can only be assessed with the published results after the completion of the studies[37]. In addition, pregnant women are often excluded in COVID-19 studies. Even though pregnant women are in general excluded in most clinical trials due to the potential risks to both the women and the unborn babies, observational studies should carefully evaluate the vertical transmission of the virus and negative impact of COVID-19 on the well-being of mothers and infants[38].Recently, Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development published a viewpoint article in JAMA to call for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in COVID-19 vaccine clinical research[39]. Clinical studies should adequately evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments and vaccines on vulnerable population groups.A few limitations should be noted. First, some data in ClinicalTrials.gov are missing. For example,33.8% (N=775) of the interventional studies miss study phase information. 39% (N=1,470) of studies do not have primary purpose information. Second, we relied on the search function of ClinicalTrials.gov when retrieving COVID-19 studies. There may be study indexing errors, but the scale should be minimal and would not impact the findings. Third, we used the QuickUMLS and the new eligibility criteria parsing tool[29] to extract risk factors, chronic conditions, disorders, and procedures from study records. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the term extraction and normalization are dependent on the quality of the UMLS Metathesaurus and the eligibility criteria parsing tool. Nonetheless, we have carefully curated the term extraction results to ensure that our results are as accurate as possible.",
