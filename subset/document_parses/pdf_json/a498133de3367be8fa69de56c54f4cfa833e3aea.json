In four cases, the cystic changes were associated with adjacent reticulations similar to honeycombing observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In one case, the entire lung was replaced by multiple cysts of variable sizes (Fig. 5 ). GGOs predominant lungs were seen either diffuse GGO occurring in both lungs or as multifocal patchy lesions. In two of the cases, we observed that GGO was seen replacing the consolidation patches present during the active COVID course and there was an increase in the involved area compared to previous CT. Four of the cases in our study showed \"atoll sign\" in the follow-up HRCT with central GGO surrounded by an incomplete rim of fibrosis (Fig. 3 ). Table 2 shows the association of dyspnea with patients' age, sex, and coexisting illnesses. Out of 40 cases in with radiological follow-up, 18 patients presented with persisting dyspnea in the follow-up period. The presence of dyspnea was significantly associated with male sex and a history of smoking. Age, history of systemic hypertension, diabetes, and history of other chronic illnesses had no significant association with the presence of dyspnea at follow-up. Dyspnea was absent in 12/14 (85%) of patients with age < 40 years and was present in 61% of patients with age > 40 years. The incidence of dyspnea was significantly higher in males (66%) compared to females (12.5%). 18 patients had a past history of chronic cigarette smoking of which 16 (89%) had dyspnea which was significantly higher than non-smokers (9%). The incidence of dyspnea was similar in patients with or without diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic illnesses. Table 1 shows the association of dyspnea with HRCT findings. Of the various radiological findings present in the follow-up CT of COVID-19 patients, the presence of cystic changes was significantly associated with dyspnea with 100% of the patients having cystic changes having dyspnea. Ground-glass opacities, consolidations, reticular opacities, bronchiectasis, fibrotic bands, and subpleural stripes were similarly distributed between patients with or without dyspnea. Distribution of the CT findings had a more significant impact on the presence of dyspnea. The involvement of 10 or more segments was significantly associated with dyspnea (69%) while none of the patients with involvement < 10 segments had dyspnea.",

With a constantly increasing population of COVID 19 survivors, clinicians are increasingly getting cognizant of the fact that many of the patients experience persistent respiratory symptoms. Attention is now shifting toward the follow-up of COVID 19 survivors and the identification of any long-term sequelae [3] . A study performed on 110 survivors of a global outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 revealed significant impairment of exercise capacity and surface area for gas exchange in as many as 15.5% of survivors [4] . Residual HRCT findings such as GGO, coarse reticular opacities, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, predominantly in anterior lung segments were persistently noted years after recovery from SARS [5, 6] . Predicated on the semblances between ongoing (COVID 19) and previous SARS coronavirus infections, and a few of the isolated case reports, there is speculation of significant fibrotic lung disease that might result in functional disabilities in the among survivors [7] . HRCT, in combination with pulmonary function tests, can be an irreplaceable tool to evaluate the COVID-19 survivors and to elucidate the long-term effect. Moreover, the early recognition of the fibrotic and other lung changes on CT and the categorization of the accompanying risk can prompt the initiation of antifibrotic treatment to prevent further progression.

            "text": "Isolated case reports and few studies have shown various HRCT changes in the survivors of COVID 19. A study by Liu et al. who found interlobular septal thickening, fibrous stripes, GGO, and subpleural lines in the early follow-up period [10] . In our study, the majority (55%) of cases presented with reticular and fibrotic predominant changes while diffuse or multifocal GGO was the predominant finding in 25% of cases. Also, we found that 20% of patients presented with predominant cystic changes, a finding that has not been reported in previous studies. Cystic changes were found in 10 patients in our study and were the predominant pattern in eight of them. Cystic changes in our cases were either in the background of GGO similar to the changes in microcystic NSIP or within the adjacent reticular fibrotic changes similar to honeycombing in IPF. One patient showed cystic changes resembling primary cystic diseases of lungs, like cystic fibrosis. These changes have not been described in the existing radiological literature on COVID 19.",

            "text": "Cystic pattern (n = 8) 2 6 imaging findings of fibrotic predominant changes resembled that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In four cases, GGO with surrounding incomplete ring of fibrosis is similar to the atoll sign observed in organizing pneumonia. The predominance of interstitial lung changes can be attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (ACE2) as a receptor causing interstitial lung damage at first before involving lung parenchyma [11] . Studies have found a similar cytokine profile in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID 19 suggesting similar histopathological processes and explaining similar HRCT findings [12] . Grillo et al. have performed cryobiopsy in eight patients who died of COVID 19 and observed marked fibrosis, characterized by fibroblast proliferation, airspace damage, and microhoneycombing [13] . The cause of fibrosis may be virusinduced changes, ventilation associated lung injury, or sequelae to acute respiratory distress syndrome as 85% of patients with ARDS show anterior reticulation on HRCT and experience long-term pulmonary function abnormality [9] . Tractional bronchiectasis and cystic changes were more common in patients with > 1-month presentation, whereas patchy consolidations, subpleural fibrous stripes were more common in early (< 1 month) presentations. This might be attributed to the fact that the lesions were not fully resorbed in patients who presented earlier than 1 months for follow-up. This was further supported by the observation that the involvement of > 10 segments was more common in early (< 1 month) presentation. GGO was seen as a tinted sign which is a dispersion of the opacities with an increase in the overall area of involvement and a decrease in the degree of opacity. This might be due to the re-expansion of alveoli and the resolution of inflammation. A study by Liu et al. evaluating short-term changes in discharged patients of COVID 19 has observed replacement of GGO with fibrotic patches which eventually are resorbed or show reduced density [10] . GGO occurring in combination with fibrotic changes can also represent non-specific interstitial pneumonia.",

The involvement of < 10 segments in the follow-up was not associated with dyspnea in any of the cases. Moreover, the CT severity score was calculated using the same method as is done in the active COVID course and a score of 7 or less was not associated with dyspnea in any of the cases. This information is of importance to assign the extent of involvement that can translate into clinical breathlessness. Of the various CT findings, the presence of predominant cystic changes was associated with dyspnea. A study by Yu et al. showed that fibrotic changes in follow-up CT were significantly associated with dyspnea and higher respiratory rate compared to those in the non-fibrosis group [14] .",

Moreover, we could not compare the HRCT findings of all the patients during and after their infection as many of these patients did not undergo HRCT during their active infection course. Furthermore, the complete clinical assessment of the patients in their follow-up could not be done owing to the current pandemic situation. A comprehensive clinical assessment including spirometry, carbon monoxide transfer factor, inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength, 6-min walk distance would have probed a more meaningful correlation with HRCT findings.",
