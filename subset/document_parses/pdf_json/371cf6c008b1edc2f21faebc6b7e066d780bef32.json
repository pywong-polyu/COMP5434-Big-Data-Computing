            "text": "In this work, we have developed and tested in vivo a dry powder form of niclosamide made by thinfilm freezing (TFF) and administered it by inhalation to rats and hamsters. The niclosamide dry powder, suitable for inhalation, is being developed as a therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection. Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with a specific pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the past, clinical trials for other indications were terminated prior to completion due to low and highly variable oral bioavailability. In order to quickly address the current pandemic, targeting niclosamide directly to the lungs is rational to address the COVID-19 main clinical complications. Thin-film freezing technology was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 \u00b5m and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute threeday, multi-dose pharmacokinetic study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, but also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC50 and IC90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model. To conclude, we successfully developed a niclosamide dry powder inhalation formulation by thin-film freezing for further scale-up and clinical testing against the COVID-19 infection. This approach overcomes niclosamide's limitation of poor oral bioavailability by targeting the drug directly to the primary site of infection, the lungs.",

More recently, in 2019, niclosamide was shown to inhibit the viral replication of MERS-CoV by more than a 1000-fold by interfering in pathways related to the proteasome and autophagy mechanisms [6, 7] . Now, in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, niclosamide has shown very promising effectiveness against the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 with a reported IC50 of 0.28 \u00b5M (~91.56 ng/mL) by similar reported mechanisms of action as that reported for SARS-CoV, and the mechanisms of anti-viral activity may include potentially direct intermolecular interactions between the drug and SARS-CoV-2 proteins [7] [8] [9] [10] . Based on the data reported by Joen et al., Arshad et al. (2020) estimated an IC90 of 153.7 ng/mL for niclosamide [11] . This evidence supports niclosamide as a candidate for repurposing as an antiviral for the current pandemic.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, niclosamide is a poorly water-soluble molecule with limited oral bioavailability, thus limiting its ability to be repurposed for other clinical indications. The clearest example of this limitation is clinical trial NCT02532114 that was terminated prematurely due to the low and variable bioavailability of niclosamide, reportedly only reaching Cmax values between 35.7-182 ng/mL when administered orally at 500 mg three-times-daily. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the pulmonary airways; the virus has a tropism towards alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes (type I and II) [12] . Here the virus leads to breathing difficulties, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, among other complications [13, 14] . A way to overcome niclosamide's severe bioavailability limitation and deliver the drug directly to the lungs is by the development of niclosamide as an inhaled product. Niclosamide has been reported to be safe for inhalation after 24 h of administration [15] . However, to the best of our knowledge, a pharmacokinetic evaluation of inhaled niclosamide has not previously been reported.",

The TFF technology generates these powders by fast supercooling of drug-carrier solutions (sometimes suspensions) [17] . The frozen material then is lyophilized to remove the employed solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, 1,4 dioxane, tert-butanol or water). TFF technology has proven to be useful in generating powders for delivery by DPI, and currently, there are two formulations in phase I clinical trials (i.e., voriconazole and tacrolimus) using this established technology [18] [19] [20] [21] . For these reasons, the development of an inhaled niclosamide powder by TFF is hypothesized to offer a new therapeutic option and route of administration in the fight against COVID-19.",

The post run column equilibration was 4 min. The column was held at 40\u00b0C for the analysis. The injection volume for MS was 10 \u00b5L. The specific details about the ionization can be found in Table S1 (supplemental materials).",

The TFF-mannitol was used as reference material, as shown in Figure 2B . In the DSC, a transition was observed between 110-140\u00b0C, which was previously reported by Peters [30, 31] . This endothermic transition is related to the conversion of \u03b4-mannitol into endothermic \u03b1-, \u03b2 or eutectic combinations of both polymorphs of mannitol, followed by melting at ~172 \u00b0C. It is important to mention that depending on the freezing/drying conditions and the presence of other excipients, different polymorphs of mannitol and its mixtures can be generated [32, 33] .",

The steady-state plasma drug concentration after three days of daily dosing was chosen to assess the accumulation and absorption of niclosamide. The results of the plasma and lung concentrations of niclosamide are provided in Table 3 . The amount of niclosamide in the lungs at 24 hours following administration of the last dose was undetectable in two out of five rats and less than 1 ng/mL in all five of the tested rats. Concentrations in the ng/mL range were still detected in the rat plasma samples from four out of five rats. All rats survived between administration and sample collection. The histopathological examination of the liver, kidney, and spleen from the treated rats appeared normal. However, examination of the lung tissue indicated mild signs of inflammation after daily dosing for three days, which is likely related to the relatively high doses of niclosamide inhalation powder that were administered (niclosamide, leucine, and mannitol). In all animals, the air space and interstitial space were found to be normal. The examination also indicated a few to moderate eosinophils in the lung tissue with rare to scattered polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells observed. This was accompanied by some bronchitis in most of the rats. The specific findings in each animal are presented in Table 4 . A representative image from Rat 4 is provided in Figure 5 , depicting normal alveoli ( Figure 4A ) and some bronchial inflammation ( Figure 4B ) with mixed granulocyte and eosinophils present.

Based on the measured niclosamide concentrations in Sprague-Dawley rat plasma from Table  4 after 24 h of administration (~ 4 x T1/2 ), there appears to be a prolongation in its apparent half-life as it was possible to detect and quantify niclosamide in rat plasma. Moreover, our group recently reported that the oral administration of niclosamide suspension had a T1/2 of approximately 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 h in Wistar rats [36] . So, the results of niclosamide inhalation powder and those concentrations above the limit of quantification support the idea of once-daily administration. This may be attributed to an extended residence time in the lung resulting from the avoidance of the extensive first-pass effect that niclosamide undergoes after oral administration [37] . Despite the fact that some drug remains in the plasma, it is reasonable that niclosamide does not accumulate in the lungs following three consecutive days of daily dosing as supported by the low concentrations measured in the lung tissue (Table 4 ).",

The Syrian golden hamster model is relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a complete pharmacokinetic analysis is required in order to evaluate the proper dosing for further efficacy studies [39, 40] . The hamsters were administered niclosamide inhalation powder prepared at a lower niclosamide concentration in order to have a dose of 145 and 290 \u00b5g/kg niclosamide. As can be seen in Figure 5 , there was fast absorption of niclosamide that was rapidly cleared to steady low levels; in general, this is considered an advantage of inhaled drug products in terms of safety and reduction of systemic side effects [41] . A non-compartmental analysis of the plasma data was performed; the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 5 . This analysis showed dose proportionality between the doses as evidenced by the AUC/dose of both administered doses are similar (8.6 and 8.4), and clearance was in the range of ~116-119 mL/h. All hamsters survived between administration and sample collection. Furthermore, in the lung tissue ( Figure 6 ), a similar trend was observed, and the steady-state level of niclosamide exceeded the IC50 for at least 24 h. Unfortunately, the lung concentration profile was not possible to determine using the non-compartmental analysis model, probably due to the inability to observe the elimination phase of niclosamide in lung tissue between 4 and 24 h. Therefore the only parameters reported are Cmax, AUC 0-24h, and Tmax (Table 6 ). There was a notable difference in the plateau concentration achieved by the two different administered doses in terms of the concentrations reached in the lungs after 2 h. The lower administered dose had a higher AUC0-24 h without achieving a higher Cmax. We hypothesize that the administration of a higher dose of powder caused a change in aerosolization properties from the dry powder insufflator used to administer the dose of powder to the hamsters. Molina et al. (2016) compared different methods of pulmonary administration of nanoparticles, and they found that with dry powder insufflation, the nanoparticles were cleared faster because the powder was deposited in the larger airways and trachea with higher variability among the animals (i.e., 188%). Moreover, they detected higher amounts of their formulation in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting mucociliary clearance from the upper respiratory tract. They speculated that the deposition in the trachea was related to issues in the synchronization between the insufflation and the inhalation cycle of the animals and not due to properties of the drug [42] . The work of Duret et al. (2012) confirms that the DP-4M\u00ae insufflator (used in this study) is reliable for delivering different drug doses of the same powder in mice, but unfortunately, in their work, the animals were immediately sacrificed to measure drug deposition [43] . So, no relationship between deposition in different regions of the lungs and their effect on pharmacokinetics was established. Moreover, Hoppentocht et al. (2014) proved that the insufflator is not consistent or efficient in deaggregating powders using 200 \u00b5L of air pulsed at different doses [44] .",

            "text": "Based on these reports of using dry powder insufflators in animal studies, the differences observed between the dose amounts administered in our study and the expected lung pharmacokinetics is likely related to the efficiency of deaggregation of the two-dose amounts delivered from the dry powder insufflator and not related to niclosamide itself. This is because changes in powder deposition caused by the insufflator can lead to different emitted particle sizes from the device and subsequent different dissolution/solubility of the emitted particles, mechanisms of clearance, and drug permeation [45] . The Cmax of niclosamide following dosing by insufflation to the lungs is nearly doubled as the dose was doubled, which agrees with the studies that showed that the insufflator is reliable for delivering the loaded dose. [43] However, it is known that particles deposited in the trachea and larger airways are cleared faster. [46] This is supported by the plasma AUC0-24 h that was more than double when the dose was doubled. So, a greater amount of niclosamide from the powder formulation was absorbed and cleared by the plasma instead of being retained in the lung tissue (Table 5) . Huang et al. (2018) used the coefficient Clung/Cplasma to describe the biodistribution of an itraconazole dry powder inhalation product in a pharmacokinetic study [47] . Due to the differences in concentrations from Huang et al., we used the reciprocal coefficient, Cplasma/Clung to describe the distribution between plasma and lungs. As can be seen in Figure 7 , niclosamide inhalation powder behaves differently after being administered at two different dose amounts to the hamsters; a greater amount of the drug was detected in plasma than in lungs after increasing the administered dose. This supports our argument that at the higher dose amounts loaded and delivered from the dry powder insufflator, the insufflated powder was likely deposited in the larger airways, which can impact the pharmacokinetics of the administered dry powder by increasing the clearance of particles [48] .",

It is relevant and informative to compare our results to pharmacokinetic studies reported that delivered niclosamide by other routes of administration and animal model. Ye et al. (2015) administered niclosamide intravenously (2 mg/Kg) through the jugular vein to Sprague-Dawley rats using a mixture of solvents and measured the drug's biodistribution in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and intestines. The concentration in the lungs and heart were consistently the lowest based on intravenous delivery [49] . Tao et al. (2014) reported the concentrations of niclosamide in male C57BL/6J mice after oral administration of niclosamide ethanolamine at 40 mg/Kg. In their work, the lung concentrations following oral administration were decreased from 87.2 \u00b1 70, 23.8 \u00b1 13, and 13.3\u00b1 5 ng/g at 2, 4, and 8 h, respectively. Interestingly, the ethanolamine salt form of niclosamide mainly distributed to the liver, and higher levels of metabolites were detected in the kidneys. Therefore, neither intravenously administered niclosamide nor orally administered niclosamide ethanolamine provided therapeutically relevant lung levels of niclosamide, thus emphasizing the importance of the inhaled route of administration of niclosamide directly to the lungs for lung infections like SARS-CoV-2.",

The development of niclosamide inhalation powder avoids first-pass metabolism and reduces the exposure of the drug to being metabolized by hydroxylation and glucuronidation [50] . Finally, in further considering administration to infected patients, the inhaled niclosamide powder should also achieve concentrations above the IC90. In our hamster studies, we administered a TFF inhaled powder formulation containing a reduced amount of niclosamide (i.e., 1.66% (w/w) dosed at 145 and 290 \u00b5g/Kg to hamsters compared to 22% (w/w) dosed at 827.22 \u00b5g/Kg to rats). Based on the reported inhibitory effect of niclosamide on SARS-CoV-2 and an IC50 of 91.56 ng/mL (0.28 \u00b5M) following the work of Jeon et al. (2020), Arshad et al. (2020) estimated the IC90 of 153.7 ng/mL (the paper considered IC50 = EC50). To be truly useful as a therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2, the niclosamide inhalation powder should achieve a concentration higher than 0.154 \u00b5g/g, assuming that the wet tissue has a density of 1 g/mL (assumed to be equal to the density of water). We exceeded this concentration in lung tissue using both administered doses by more than 2-fold over the 24 h period (the lower dose was ~15-fold) as seen in Table 6 . Further supporting our analysis, comparisons with the report of Gassen et al. (2020) is helpful. The paper reports an IC50 of 55.6 ng/mL (0.17 \u00b5M) [51] . Therefore, niclosamide inhalation powder is also above this concentration.",
