The focus is on smart specialisation strategies and partnerships between agri-food business and research organisations, established under the open innovation paradigm. An exploratory study is carried out on recent (2010-19) agri-food R&I activity in Puglia (Italy), covering both projects and patents carried out by 47 research centres (affiliated to any of 11 research institutions) and 40 agri-food enterprises. Beside project data analysis based on categorisation, the methodology applied social network analysis to partnerships. Findings point to Sustainable Manufacturing and Human and Environmental Health being the prevalent target areas of innovation activity, thus resulting in some form of sustainable agricultural intensification, with a bias towards Industrial Biotechnology, Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology. Open innovation approaches seem to be still phasing in, and the innovation potential of agri-food enterprises appears to be largely untapped. Future research may address the friction between industry-driven smart specialisation strategies and place-based innovation patterns that harness the intangible potential of social and relational capital.",

By way of an example, within the framework of a prominent prevalence of a few cultivations at the regional level (with arable land accounting for almost 50% of the total utilised agricultural land, olive groves for about 33%, and vineyards for somewhat less than 10%), these are unevenly distributed across the provincial territories. Moreover, some specialisations on individual agri-food products -which would not stand out in regional statistical accounts of crop categories -are worth an in-depth analysis to screen for innovation potentials, given their remarkable share even at national level (it is the case of, among others, cherries, tomatoes and artichokes, which accounted, respectively, for 35%, 35% and 31% of the overall national production in 2012).",

Moreover, although their average betweenness centrality is lower, they don't show the polarisation that may be observed for research organisations, whose average values are driven by a few very high values. When the analysis is limited to the sub-network based on those R&I projects that involve at least one firm, the number of active research organisations drops from 47 to 25 (since 22 research centres only collaborate with other research organisations) and a relatively more fragmented network structure emerges (Fig. 9) , as corroborated by the moderately higher value of average path length (2.47 vs 2.17) and the considerably lower value for the clustering coefficient (0.48 vs 0.83).",
