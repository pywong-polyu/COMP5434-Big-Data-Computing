Although the morbidity and mortality from HAAP is of global concern, the burden is highest in low-and middle-income countries, among the poorest populations, and in women and children living in housing with only a single room for shelter [8] , contributing to the global widening of health inequalities. Further, women are overwhelmingly responsible for fuel collection and cooking, further increasing their health risks, but also limiting their economic opportunities [9] .",

Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more disruption to the energy sector than any other event in recent history with reports that access to cleaner household fuels has become variable and disrupted, which is likely to worsen the outlook in terms of progress to cleaner fuels [14] . This emphasises the importance of increasing access to clean and safe household energy ensuring the delivery of genuine health gains [15] . This paper reviews the available evidence on improved biomass stoves in relation to household air pollution (HAP) reduction using the widely accepted International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) guidelines, and discusses the findings in relation to evidence from systematic reviews in the field, outlining the practical options available to support the global poorest communities to reduce their personal exposure to air pollution within the household.",

            "text": "HAP results from a number of different sources, but the main focus of much research and scale-up programmes in the field in low-income countries has been on access to cleaner cooking. For the poorest communities who do not have access to gas and electricity, there are numerous clean stoves on the market in low-income settings, including solar, biogas, and ethanol stoves. However, evidence suggests that these stove options are unlikely to be the answer to large-scale HAP reduction for a number of reasons, including not being adequate to meet user cooking needs, cost, lack of infrastructure to supply cleaner fuels required, and, in the case of biogas, the prerequisite for parcels of land and animals, to enable use at scale [16] . However, the WHO IAQ Guidelines have highlighted the limitations of ICS in that they cannot sufficiently reduce HAP to levels low enough to prevent ill health. Nevertheless, they do recommend ICS as a transition option from traditional stoves to clean fuels [12] . There are currently hundreds of biomass stoves available to choose from, each with different characteristics, levels of performance, efficiency, indoor emissions, affordability, safety considerations, ability to meet household cooking needs, and importation and shipping costs depending on location. It is therefore a complex question to identify which stove or stoves might be most suitable for specific communities, taking all these aspects into account. This raises an important question for those working in the field; which stove or stoves are most effective at reducing HAP, and are likely to be acceptable and affordable to the global poorest in specific geographical settings?",

The targets are based on exposure-response evidence from studies of child ALRI, which demonstrate that due to the non-linear shape of the curve, exposure has to be reduced to 'at or below 35 \u00b5g/m 3 ' to prevent most cases of disease attributable to HAP exposure. In tandem with this recommendation, the guidelines also demonstrate that even where improved cookstoves have been tested, they are almost exclusively incapable of reducing emissions to a level even close to the interim target. Estimates based on observed concentrations in kitchen field studies published at the time, suggested that approximately 60% of traditional stoves had PM 2.5 concentrations in the range of 500-1800 \u00b5g/m 3 , with a mode of 800 \u00b5g/m 3 , and that 60% of improved stoves still had concentration levels in the range of 200-1500 \u00b5g/m 3 , with a mode of 500 \u00b5g/m 3 , highlighting the inability of the ICS to achieve WHO targets for PM 2.5 and CO levels able to benefit human health. Despite this limitation, most ICS have been shown to be better alternatives to the traditional stoves or three stone fires in terms of emissions for communities without access to cleaner fuel. Therefore, given that the transition to cleaner fuels will take time, and access to the more expensive technologies available is not feasible to these poorer communities in the near future, the ICS would be an appropriate intermediate step.",

            "text": "The WHO Guidelines led to a greater awareness of the huge variation in emissions from different types of ICS. There are a number of different types of ICS designed to assist better combustion and heat transfer, thereby improving emissions and efficiency performance. The most common types are rocket stoves, a direct combustion-type stove, and gasifier stoves where combustion takes place in two stages. Stoves may also be built with or without a chimney. The chimney stoves tend to be slower, and consume more fuel, but they are generally more effective than non-chimney stoves at reducing household emissions [17] . These different types of stoves demonstrate differing levels of performance, which can be measured using voluntary performance targets. Published in 2018, by the \"International Organisation for Standardisation\" (ISO) Technical Committee comprised of experts from 45 countries and 8 liaison organizations, these ISO guidelines provide an easily understood ranking of stove performance to allow comparison between different types of stoves [18] . The ISO guidelines allow stoves to be ranked into five tiers based on five different areas of performance: thermal efficiency, CO emissions, PM 2.5 emissions, safety, and durability, with fine particulate matter being the most important in relation to measuring the health impact in terms of reduced emissions. The emission rates for Tier 5 stoves, the cleanest available, are designed to align with the interim target of WHO Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for PM 2.5 (35 \u00b5g/m 3 ). These ISO guidelines allow an assessment to be made, regarding which biomass stove(s) offer the best performance, and can be combined with data available on cost and availability, in order to assess performance alongside availability by geographical region, and also affordability to the poorest communities [19] .",

Considering those stoves which are most effective at reducing HAP, there are no Tier 5 biomass stoves listed, and only two Tier 4 stoves suitable for household use. Of these two stoves, one uses pellets and one stove uses untreated biomass, the Malena (Tier 2 for efficiency and Tier 4 for indoor emissions). The Malena is a chimney stove developed with the Latin American market in mind, so significant work would be needed to explore whether this stove could be adapted and/or produced cheaply enough for an African and Asian market to merit its implementation at scale. Even then, without significant national or international investment, it would need to be built at considerably less cost than the current price of 50 to 70 dollars to fall within the price range of the poorest communities globally. The wood pellet stove is the Mimi Moto manufactured in China, (Tier 4 for efficiency and Tier 4 for indoor emissions) at US$40-65. However, establishing manufacturing and distribution of biomass pellets at scale in Africa would be a costly and complex undertaking [21] , and even assuming it could be achieved in a relatively short time period, these stoves are highly unlikely to be affordable to the poorest communities, many of whom do not currently purchase the biomass that they use, making the sustained use of a wood pellet stove even less economically viable [21] .",

Given that there is also the need to potentially consider additional factors, such as importation and shipping costs, and whether a stove meets community cooking needs for example, it is clear that there is a major gap between the SDG7 targets to reduce HAAP among the world's poorest communities and the affordability and availability of suitable effective interventions to support efforts in the field. As a result, stoves that are shown to be ineffective in reducing indoor emissions are being promoted across low-income countries. In some cases, stoves with recognised improved fuel efficiency, but no reduction in indoor emissions, have been promoted: the Gyapa in Ghana (Tier 2 efficiency and Tier 0 indoor emissions) and the Chitetezo deployed in Kenya, Malawi Mozambique, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Tier 2 efficiency and Tier 0 indoor emissions), for example. Other promoted stoves, such as the Upesi portable in Kenya (Tier 0 for efficiency and Tier 0 for indoor emissions), the Makaa in Uganda and Kenya (Tier 0 for efficiency and Tier 0 for indoor emissions), and the unrated Mirt stoves disseminated in Ethiopia, show neither a reduction in fuel efficiency nor indoor emissions.",

Since the publication of the WHO Guidelines, a number of systematic reviews have been carried out in different geographical settings assessing various designs of ICS in relation to health outcomes and indoor emissions reduction. Unlike laboratory measures of stove performance, these studies offer estimates of real-world cooking performance, which differ considerably from performance in the laboratory [22] . These estimates are an important part of assessing the extent to which ICS will reduce HAP in practice. As part of the wider scoping review protocol [20] , we identified six relevant systematic reviews that had been undertaken since 2014 when the WHO IAQ Guidelines were published. These reviews focused either on whether ICS are effective in reducing the average concentrations of, or exposure to, particulate matter, or on health outcomes. The reviews include more widely used, relatively high-emission rocket and ceramic Jiko stoves as well as more recently developed low-emission advanced combustion stoves, such as forced draft or semi-gasifier stoves. Some of the reviews provide measures of HAP for specific stoves and others provide measures by stove type. The stoves may or may not include a flue and chimney or smoke hood for ventilation. Table 2 summarises the main findings of systematic reviews that have been carried out since 2014 in relation to HAP estimates from biomass stoves and health outcomes.

The Global Alliance Clean Cookstove Catalogue [19] is the most comprehensive source currently available and includes data on 500 stoves (325 biomass stoves available on the market), including price and laboratory performance, but it does not provide a comparison of performance in the field, information on user perspectives, or information on importation costs and availability of ICS in different international settings. Further, whether or not improved cookstoves can realistically meet community cooking needs in the field, is a critical factor when it comes to sustained and exclusive use of ICS.",

In tandem with this approach, a number of researchers have called for a greater focus on the importance of behaviour change approaches [32] [33] [34] [35] alongside the introduction of new technologies, suggesting that emphasis on the technology alone has been a major issue in the success (or lack thereof) of many programmes. According to Sesan et al. [33] , the overwhelming focus on distributing stoves in the cookstove sector rather than on why households would want to use a cookstove or prioritise a smokefree household is a significant potential barrier to success. Essentially, communities are unlikely to change their practices when clean cooking ranks well below other priorities or needs. Sesan et al. also argue that research is required into intrinsic motivators for change in different local contexts, and that these motivators may be used as the starting point for responsive multi-level interventions in the cookstove sector. The Multi-Tier Framework for measuring access to cleaner cooking offers one approach to measuring the household-level impacts of a suite of different approaches, as it measures exposure, efficiency, convenience, safety, and affordability. If convenience is interpreted as the ability of an intervention to meet household cooking needs, this is a useful framework with which to consider different actions and interventions aimed at supporting the move towards cleaner energy [36] .",

Local communities provide valuable insights into the barriers and facilitators they face in relation to the use of cleaner cooking and lighting practices.

Research funding focusing on producing affordable stoves that reduce HAP would improve the current availability of stoves to the poorest communities globally. \u2022 ICS with HAP benefits should be promoted where possible. Where no stove is available which reduces HAP, the promotion of stoves that increase efficiency and reduce fuel use could be considered an intermediate step, although it must be recognized that they offer no direct health benefits to the user. \u2022 Clear guidance is required to enable the identification of the most appropriate cookstove to promote to a community. This guidance should take into account the type and characteristics of the stove, stove sustainability, safety, emissions performance, efficiency, in-field performance, affordability, availability in different settings, and also the ability of the stove to meet community cooking needs. Further, it is important for field studies to outline the stove brand, model, and price to aid in knowledge translation and stove recommendations. A detailed scoping review is required to bring all of this information together in a format that is accessible for the clean cooking sector. A toolkit that supports community and programme leads in making local decisions by taking into account affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and sustainability issues alongside relevant national and legal policy would enable a more systematic approach to be taken to the introduction of HAP-reducing measures. \u2022 Currently, of the 343 biomass ICS listed in the Clean Cookstove Catalog and available on the market, 185 (almost 60%) do not show evidence of any testing at all, either via the IWA tiers or by individual testing centres. Undergoing IWA tier rating testing and performance testing in the field should be a requirement for any ICS being promoted in the field. \u2022 A suite of interventions should be promoted alongside cleaner stoves, including cleaner lighting, alternatives to burning crops and rubbish, drying of wood and adequate wood storage, smoking reduction, improved ventilation, outdoor cooking, and behavioural interventions, such as smoking cessation, reduced time spent close to the fire, use of pot lids and wonderbags to reduce cooking times, and burning of rubbish away from households.
