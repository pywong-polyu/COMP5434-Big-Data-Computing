            "text": "Because infectious diseases like COVID-19 can be spread through respiratory droplets from being near and communicating with infected individuals, researchers have taken advantage of contact tracing to help mitigate the spread of the virus. Contact tracing is the process of retrospectively identifying persons who may have made interpersonal contact with a confirmed infectious individual [1] . The overall logic of contact tracing is to prevent individuals who made contact with the focal individual from further spreading the disease themselves and thus, to break the chain of infection within the larger system. At its core, contact tracing is a form of egocentric network analysis (ENA) and, thus, one type of social network intervention to influence public health. ENA is the study of individuals (i.e., egos) and people in their immediate social environment (i.e., alters). Conducting a reliable and valid ENA study is challenging, and there is a rich academic literature dedicated to improving the rigor behind these efforts [2, 3] . Indeed, the effectiveness of contact tracing is only as good as the data that can be extracted. If ideal standards are not followed for collecting contact tracing data, then most efforts to take advantage of this data will likely fall short. Potential at-risk contacts may never be discovered for treatment/quarantine and they could continue to propagate COVID-19. Likewise, hotspots and clusters are likely not to be discovered, preventing the public from being informed to follow social distancing. Moreover, recent simulation research has shown that in order for contact tracing to be effective for COVID-19, individuals must be able to successfully recall at least 80% of their contacts [4] . As such, the purpose of the proposed research is to test Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1466 2 of 11 the effectiveness of three different egocentric survey methods for extracting contact tracing data.",

First, face-to-face interviews are risky endeavors because the interviewer may put themselves at risk for contracting the infectious disease, especially when diagnoses specifically require a patient to quarantine. Second, interviewers need to be appropriately trained and inevitably vary in how skilled they are, resulting in interviewer effects [3] . As such, it is not surprising that there is a shortage of contact tracers appropriately trained to do such research [5] . Finally, as technology mediums continue to alter social environments [6] , preferences for communication modalities must be continually monitored. For instance, in the food service industry, more people are using mobile food delivery apps on smartphones rather than calling in orders directly to restaurants [7] .",

Especially when an individual has just learned that they are infected with a potentially fatal virus, it can be easy to forget nonchalant interactions from the past several days. Furthermore, data from egocentric designs rely on self-reported network interactions, which are cognitive representations that may differ from actually observed interactions (for a review, see [8] ). Moreover, prior literature has suggested that successful recall (i.e., remembering all of your contacts) is influenced by a number of factors because contacts tend be cognitively stored in clusters or what Brashears and Quintane [9] call chunked substructures. Likewise, there may be individual differences in recall pertaining to demographic and social identity factors like gender, age, and race [10, 11] and psychological factors like mood and well-being [12, 13] .",

For instance, Mossong and colleagues [15] define a contact as \"EITHER a two-way conversation with three or more words in the physical presence of another person, OR physical skin-to-skin contact (for example a handshake, hug, kiss or contact sports).\" Then, they ask each participant to \"Write down every person that you contact during the day, regardless of whether the contact was long or short, and whether you know the person or not.\" In addition to baseline approaches, other more complex methods for ENA exist as well.",

A retrieval cue is any additional piece of information that helps an ego remember a past event. The retrieval cue approach mirrors Tulving's [16] theory of cue-dependent forgetting, which assumes that forgetting, the inability to recall something in the present that could be recalled in the past, does not mean that the memory is lost, but only temporarily inaccessible. In Hsieh's study, participants were randomly assigned to a retrieval cue condition in which they were instructed to look at their (1) cellphone contact list, (2) last 30 emails, and (3) friend list on Facebook and Twitter as retrieval cues.

Then, once relevant contexts are triggered, contact names corresponding to those contexts are generated by the individual (see also [18] ). As Bidart and Charbonneau explain, the context-based approach is motivated by field theory [19] . Field theory regards \"situated action\" as a key unit of analysis (i.e., action that is not stripped away from a larger context). One of the premises of field theory is that most interpersonal interaction occurs because of shared activity foci. Activity foci are simply \"aspects of extra-network social structure that systematically produce patterns in networks\" and include \"social, psychological, legal, or physical entities around which activities are organized\" [19] (p. 1016). Indeed, subsequent research has shown that priming individuals with social context can help improve network recall [11, 20] . As such, we hypothesize the following:",

Practically, the study begins to shed light on more effective ways to design egocentric contact tracing surveys. Each of these realms are discussed further below.",

The current study nearly replicated Hsieh's [10] study, which found that a retrieval cue approach elicits more contacts than a baseline approach (p = 0.13). However, a few caveats much be mentioned before any premature conclusions. First, Hsieh [10] elicited affective contacts (i.e., contacts whom the ego discusses important matters with) not interaction contacts as compared to the current study. Second, there could be selection bias in that the current study only looked at college students from a single university. Because different age groups and generations tend to use technology in different ways and have different attitudes on such technology (e.g., [33] ), it may be the case that the retrieval cue approach may not be as effective with younger participants. Future research may be served well by including a more generalizable sample with larger diversity of age groups, locations, and socio-economic status. Likewise, because of the convenient sampling strategy used, we cannot exclude that there may be some levels of volunteer bias, meaning that those who chose to participate in the experiment differ in some characteristics than those who chose not to. Future research may consider more probability based methods of sampling to rule out such biases.",

Following field theory, Corman and Scott [34] theorize a similar network reticulation theory for explaining the relationship between perceived and observable networks (see also [35] ). Again, the key here is to activate relevant activity foci to stimulate network recall of observable interactions. However, a key limitation for adapting the context-based approach of Bidart and Charbonneau [17] is determining relevant activity foci. Similar survey adaptations of the approach are typically contextual, including foci relevant to education paths, youth foster care, and individuals who live alone (see [17] , fn. 7). The four foci here are by no means a final set and will need to be continually refined in order to create a gold-standard survey to elicit alters for contact tracing. Finally, just because an instrument elicits more contacts and places, this does not necessarily mean it performs the same as a face-to-face interview. Further studies might consider comparing survey-based approaches to more intensive qualitative approaches to really see how much they differ.",
