With the rising prevalence of diabetes, the occurrence of DN is likely to hit pandemic proportions. The current treatment strategies employed for DN focus on the management of blood pressure, glycemia, and cholesterol while neglecting DN's molecular progression mechanism. For many theranostic uses, nano-technological techniques have evolved in biomedical studies. Several nanotechnologically based theranostics have been devised that can be tagged with targeting moieties for both drug administration and/or imaging systems and are being studied to identify various clinical conditions. The molecular mechanisms involved in DN are discussed in this review to assist in understanding its onset and progression pattern. We have also discussed emerging strategies for establishing a nanomedicine-based platform for DN-targeted drug delivery to increase drug's efficacy and safety, as well as their reported applications.",

            "text": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a frequent consequence of diabetes, has become a hazard to human health as diabetes prevalence has increased globally during the previous few decades (Kakitapalli et al., 2020) . Diabetes affected more than 400 million people worldwide in 2014, and the World Health Organization predicts that diabetes is expected to become the seventh greatest leading cause of mortality by 2030 (WHO, 2016) . In developed countries, the prevalence of diabetes has been observed to rise in tandem with the rise in living standards and subsequent changes in lifestyle (Calvo-Hueros et al., 2021) . DN affects about one-third of all diabetics (whether they have type 1 or type 2), causing major social and economic hardships (Akhtar et al., 2020) . Kidney fibrosis, clinically defined as microalbuminuria resulting from an early rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the pathogenic basis of DN (Sharma et al., 2021) . Various evidences have indicated that genetic susceptibility, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension are all involved in the onset and DN progression. Even though DN is being recognized as a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the majority of renal disorders, no therapeutic options directly target the pathophysiology of DN. On the contrary, elevated blood pressure and glucose levels are the primarily addressed issues. Nonetheless, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation have been continuously pointed out as the major links in the progression of DN, in the investigation that took place over the last 5 years, providing researchers with quite a few possible targets Wu et al., 2021) . Hence, the direction of anti-DN agent research has been shifted to focus on the multiple mechanisms related to DN. These include interruption of cell signal transduction pathways, targeting interrelated enzymes, and lessening in the extracellular matrix (ECM) aggregation (Cure and Cumhur Cure, 2020; Garc\u00eda-Prieto et al., 2021) . The drugs developed should have a high affinity for multifactorial pathogenesis, allowing them to limit ECM formation and hasten its disintegration. Although kidney diseases cause a significant burden upon the health care system, effective therapeutics for kidney disease are only a few, making kidney disease one of the most serious dangers in the twenty-first century Yan et al., 2021) . As a result, novel techniques, drugs, and technology to identify and treat renal illnesses more efficiently, accurately, and conveniently are in high demand.",

A variety of kidney illnesses, including DN, chronic kidney disease (CKD; Figure 1 ), and acute kidney injury (AKI) can benefit from the use of NPs for diagnostic imaging and molecular targeting. Owing to their efficacy, specificity, and diversity nanomedicines and NPs may be able to address the challenges related to the treatment of renal diseases . However, despite the amazing promise of nano-based therapies for treating renal disorders, their use has been rather limited on account of the hurdles faced during systemic administration, and tailored distribution (Kamaly et al., 2016) . These obstacles can be encountered in the bloodstream, as well as when entering the kidney and accessing the target areas in the real tissue. It is rather fortunate that recent outcomes (Zhou et al., 2014; Kamaly et al., 2016) have indicated ways for increasing NPs transport from the circulation to the kidneys, as well as to improve their retention in the kidney, potentially resolving the aforementioned issues. Nefzger et al. (1984) (Lien et al., 2021) first demonstrated that polymeric NPs made of poly (methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) are capable of reaching renal tissue via systemic circulation. In the 1990s, research on kidney-targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs) began, and in 1994, actinomycin D loaded poly (isobutylcyanoacrylate) NPs were developed as a targeted DDS for glomerular mesangial cells that could be concentrated in rat mesangium . The rapid expansion of nanomedicine, in general, has tremendously accelerated subsequent discoveries in this field of research. Targeted NPs have recently been established as prospective carriers for targeted therapeutic delivery in preclinical as well as clinical studies, in both academic, and industrial labs (Bidwell et al., 2017; Oroojalian et al., 2017) . However, there are quite a few challenges that must be effectively handled before they can be widely evaluated in clinical studies.",

This disrupts the oxidation-reduction balance and damages the autoregulatory oxidation-reduction regulating mechanism, resulting in oxidative stress. Furthermore, multiple research studies have shown that ROS leads to direct and indirect damage to the renal interstitium as a consequence of oxidative stress in the case of long-term hyperglycemia conditions such as 1) renal vascular sclerosis; 2) increased vascular permeability; 3) structure and function damage; 4) activation of downstream mediators including nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), p38 mitogenactivated protein kinases (p38 MAPK), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK). Subsequently, a set of cellular responses is triggered which are presumed to take part in the development of DN (as shown in Figure 2 ). The polyol pathway, increased production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOX) are the key ROS resources (Lv et al., 2015; Yabuuchi et al., 2020; Lien et al., 2021; Thallas-Bonke et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "As previously stated, oxidative stress is the first stage of DN and initiates several pathogenic pathways. Fibrosis, on the other hand, is a fundamental and visible hallmark of DN, and inflammation seems to have a key function in the genesis and advancing of kidney fibrosis if left unchecked (Xu et al., 2020) . The accumulation of macrophages, lymphocytes, mast cells, inflammatory cells (e.g., neutrophils), and dendritic cells within the renal tissue is intimately related to DN in animal models and live specimens with DN (Wen and Crowley, 2020) . These inflammatory cells synthesize and secrete fibrogenic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-a), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and ROS in the local microenvironment, which directly harm the kidney architecture or stimulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which tends to result in ECM accumulation (Qaseem et al., 2018) . Other components engaged in the mechanisms of DN include chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), also referred to as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). Renal fibrosis is a common result of kidney illnesses that results in severe loss of the normal structure and function of the kidney, regardless of whether the injury is caused by oxidative stress or inflammation. The thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), glomerular hypertrophy, and a rise in the mesangial matrix are all major pathogenic factors in kidney fibrosis and are the key features manifested by DN. Excess ECM is created as a result of prolonged cytokine stimulation, and its breakdown slows down. Moderate ECM is generated in normal circumstances to preserve normal cellular structure and function. Nevertheless, in case of a persistently existing injury, as an outcome of inflammation or oxidative stress, profibrotic cytokines are over-released to activate fibroblasts to express \u03b1-smooth-muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), thereby contributing to ECM overproduction, and deposition in renal tissues. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) has a significant impact on downstream signaling, particularly the Smad pathway, during the fibroblast activation phase (Gewin, 2020) . The pathogenic Smad signaling pathway is activated when TGF-\u03b2 binds to receptors in mesangial cells, thereby upregulating the transcription of target genes including Mix2, speeding mesangial expansion, creating excessive ECM, and increasing kidney tissue fibrosis.",

A large randomized controlled trial published in 2011 suggests Benicar \u00ae (olemesartan) improves early microalbuminuria when compared to placebo to placebo (whereas both groups met their blood pressure goals). A follow-up study published in 2014 found that this benefit is maintained over time (Haller et al., 2011; Menne et al., 2014) . Dual therapy with ARBs and ACE inhibitors provides a little additional benefit, although the threats of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and kidney failure increase (Makani et al., 2013) . Moreover, aldosterone antagonists show better therapeutic benefits when used in conjunction with ARBs or ACE inhibitors, but they come with a high risk of hyperkalemia, therefore they must be recommended with caution. Similarly, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers exhibit good cardioprotective effects but they do not appear to be as effective in preventing DN development (Bangalore et al., 2016) .",

Prodrugs modified with amino acids, folate, and sugar moieties have the potential to be used for renal targeting (Association, 2019b) . There are specific receptors in the renal tubules, such as folate receptors and other enzymes, which are involved in the prodrug's uptake. Wang et al. (1997) investigated the absorption of folate-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid conjugate. They noticed that the kidney has a high concentration of folic acid conjugates when compared to other organs. The impact of altering prednisolone on its absorption in HK-2 cell lines was observed by Li et al. (2019) (Lin et al., 2012) . When compared to unmodified prednisolone, the glycated prednisolone demonstrated a greater than four-fold increase in sugar prodrug of prednisolone absorption. Using the tetrapeptide SS-31, Golshayan et al. developed a peptidase targeting peptide-conjugated prodrug (Wyss et al., 2019) . Angiotensin receptors and aminopeptidase A are important regulators of renal function in the RAAS. The SS-31 tetrapeptide prodrug reduced AT1R mRNA expression while increasing AT2R expression. Prodrugs based on the SS-31 tetrapeptide act as aminopeptidase A substrates and avoid injury to the kidney. Curcumin and hyaluronic acid were linked in a hyaluronic acid-curcumin prodrug developed by Du et al. (Hu et al., 2018) . Hyaluronic acid not only helped target the CD44 receptors (overexpressed on renal tubular cells in instances of injury), but it also enhanced the solubility of the curcumin. Biodistribution studies revealed that the hyaluronic acid-curcumin prodrug accumulates disproportionately in the kidney to the other organs.",

These are reabsorbed in the renal tubules after being filtered at the glomerulus. The presence of LMWP overrides the drug's kinetics (Desai et al., 2021) . Peptide, disulfide, ester (polyhydroxy acids), and amide (oligopeptides and lysine-amino group) bonds can be used to combine LMWP with drugs to produce the conjugate, which can then be broken down to release the drug via enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis. Because LMWPs contain several active groups that aid in LMWP self-aggregation, careful reaction control is required during the synthesis of drug conjugate with LMWP (Ramos et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "In recent times, the significance of polymers in drug delivery has become high because of their biocompatibility, which allows for precise and controlled delivery. Polymer distribution, functional groups, charge, molecular weight, and accumulation throughout the body are all important factors that affect their therapeutic efficacy and targeting. A few polymers have been identified as drugs transporters at the renal site. With increasing molecular weight, polymer clearance generally declines. The drug-polymer complex has several advantages, including improved specificity, fewer side effects, and improved efficacy (Pradeepkumar et al., 2018) . Low molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC) is frequently used to develop DDSs for targeting renal-related diseases. When compared to lysozyme-drug conjugates, LMWC-drug conjugates have been found to have a faster renal clearance and thus a safer pharmacokinetic profile (Zhou et al., 2014; Sarko and Georges, 2016) . Yuan et al. (2009) and Yuan et al. (2011) designed a study to determine the chitosan's renal targeting capability by conjugating prednisolone to LMWC. Prednisolone was delivered to the kidneys more efficiently owing to this conjugate's specific accumulation in the kidney. Gao et al. (2014) nanoparticles with polyanionic siRNA duplexes of approximately 450 nm in size. Using an injection of the LMW chitosan nanoparticles loaded with siRNA duplexes specific for water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) into mice, they were able to target more than 50% of the proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). Megalin was used to target PTECs, and the expression of AQP1 was reduced in the targeted PTECs. This proof of principle experiment demonstrated the potential of LMW chitosan siRNA duplex nanoparticles. A conjugate of superoxide dismutase with poly (vinylpyrrolidone-co-dimethyl maleic acid) (PVD) can be used as a drug molecule in renal diseases . PVD has a high affinity for the kidneys and accumulates in the kidneys. When combined with superoxide dismutase, PVD has the potential to build up in the kidneys and be used to treat kidney disease. As suggested by an in vivo investigation based on male BALB/c mice, the distribution of the polymer is influenced by the molecular weight and charge of the PVD. In vivo results showed that 6-8 kDa molecular weight polymers accumulate rapidly in the kidneys, with around 80% of the polymer being selectively delivered into renal tissues following intravenous delivery. PVD's negative charge indicates how long it takes for it to be eliminated from the kidneys. The renal targeting capability of different polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) derivatives was investigated by Tsutsumi et al. (Kodaira et al., 2004) . They observed that carboxylated-PVP was more efficiently immersed by proximal tubular cells in comparison to sulfonated-PVP in vivo. The results of this investigation show that carboxylated-PVP possesses excellent renal targeting characteristics.",

Adriamycin induces a podocyte injury, leading to proteinuria and, subsequently, glomerulosclerosis. Bai constructed a sensor by introducing amino head groups to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through fluorophore proteins for monitoring and evaluating the process of Adriamycin Nephrosis. Using the linear discriminant and principal component analyses, the protein/AuNPs-based sensors classified the nephropathy progression into seven stages and assessed the Huangkui capsule's protecting potential. A significant difference in podocin and nephrin expression as well as the morphological variations in podocytes further validate the reliability of the sensing method. This sensing approach may be used to track nephropathy progression and assess protective medications, thus speeding up research into clinical diagnosis and nephropathy treatment.",

Antibodies against MHC Class II RT1 were utilized to specifically focus on the rat renal medulla, a region of the kidney where MHC Class II, an inflammatory protein, is highly expressed. An increase in the binding of the NPs to the renal medulla implies selectivity for the medulla, which could lead to a proper diagnosis or the delivery of therapeutics to this region. Yasuhiko et al. modified silica NPs with anti-CD11b for selective diagnostics of renal diseases (Shirai et al., 2012) .

The particle size of 80 nm resulted in the greatest glomerular accumulation. There are, however, exceptions. For instance, the liver can eliminate ultra-small particles (up to 2 nm) because they cannot pass through the glycocalyx. Mesoscale NPs (MNPs) (up to 400 nm) were observed in proximal tubular cells, apparently delivered there through endocytosis as their size is larger than fenestrations. Manna et al.

In hyperglycemic animals, PPE-AuNPs significantly decreased serum TG and TC, renal toxicity indices, and fasting blood glucose. PPE-AuNPs normalized streptozotocininduced pancreatic-cell dysfunction, as evidenced by an increase in plasma insulin levels. The PPE-AuNPs treatment dropped the production of iROS and LPO, restored the streptozotocin mediated inhibition of endogenous antioxidant response. Furthermore, the application of PPE-AuNPs reduced the hyperglycemia-mediated augmentation of protein glycation, followed by NOX4/p-47phox activation. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PPE-AuNPs were protective against streptozotocin-induced renal fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis. Additionally, it decreased the proinflammatory burden by modulating the MAPK/NFk B/ STAT3/cytokine axis. Simultaneously, activation of Nrf2 via PI3K/AKT was observed following PPE-AuNPs application, enhancing the antioxidants responses, and maintaining hyperglycemic homeostasis. El-Khalik et al.

After 6 weeks of treatment, zinc oxide NPs significantly improved histopathological, biochemical, and renal parameters. Additionally, zinc oxide NPs significantly decreased TXNIP gene expression and increased Nrf2-DNA-binding potential, resulting in redox status restoration. Zinc oxide NPs increased autophagy activity, decreased AGE levels, and inhibited inflammasome activation through IL-1\u03b2 reduction and NLRP3 downregulation. They concluded that zinc oxide NPs may be a promising agent for decelerating the progression of DN through the Nrf2/TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. Kumar et al. (2014) investigated the protective effect of SeNPs on diabetic nephropathy progression. SeNPs exerted biological activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy by decreasing oxidative stress, increasing the activity of the longevity protein Sirt1, the cytoprotective protein Hsp-70, and modulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the apoptotic protein Bax in the apoptotic kidney. Yu et al. (2021) synthesized gold NPs by a hydrothermal method to evaluate their anti-DN effects by mitigation of oxidative stress. They investigated the effects of 50 mM high glucose treatment on the toxicity of HK-2 cell lines as well as the protective effects of hydrothermally prepared gold NPs on AGEs and free radical formation. Gold NPs with a size of about 30 nm Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 870049 6 and that are colloidally stable at pH 7.4 were found to significantly reduce high glucose-induced toxicity in HK-2 cell lines by enhancing cell viability and decreasing the formation of AGEs and free radicals. Gold NPs also downregulated the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 at both the protein and mRNA levels.",

By draping the GBM, the FPs form highly selective filtering machinery after separating from the cells (Greka and Mundel, 2012) . Podocytes make use of these filtration incisions with a size cutoff of around 10 nm to stop plasma proteins from entering the urine filtrate, enabling only tiny solutes to pass through. Podocyte function must be ensured properly to ensure optimal renal function and glomerular filtration (Mathieson, 2012) . DN initiates albumin leakage because of a decline in podocytes, self-effacement of podocyte FPs, and failure of filtration incision (podocin and nephrin). Damage to podocytes and the resulting albuminuria have been seen as essential events in DN (Lin and Susztak, 2016) . Many studies have been conducted to find novel targeted therapeutics that can effectively treat DN by preventing or reversing the consequences of podocyte injury. Wu et al. (2017) reported the development of nanoconjugates by linking albumin (as a carrier) to methylprednisolone via an amide bond (an acid-sensitive bond) to avoid the side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy in patients with nephrotic syndrome (a result of DN). The nanoconjugates had monodispersed and homogeneous size distribution, with a size of about 10 nm, could pass through the glomerular filtration barrier. Albumin is a portion of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) over-expressed in podocytes, allowing for localized administration into cultured human podocytes. The nanoconjugates displayed dose-dependent and receptor-mediated absorption in human podocytes. Cellular lysosomes cleave the acidsensitive connection, facilitating the release of drugs from the nanoconjugates after cellular absorption. Colombo et al. (2017) synthesized a series of biocompatible polymeric NPs with specific surface properties and controllable sizes with the same goal of delivering glucocorticoids locally to treat injured podocytes.",

The renal artery transports drug-carrying nanoparticles to the afferent arteriole, where they remain in the bloodstream or are filtered out of the blood by the kidneys in the glomerular capillaries for further processing. Renal components such as the endothelial cells, GBM, and glycocalyx can all be modified to assist in the selection of NPs for filtration. Following filtering, NPs can interact with podocytes in the Bowman's lumen. The NPs are transported to the proximal tubule, where they interact with proximal epithelial cells and may be reabsorbed (Merlin and Li, 2021 cells modulate the surface of glomerular filtration and the glomerular capillary flow (Scindia et al., 2010) . Any damage to mesangial cells, whether direct or indirect, is a key function in the growth of ESRD, resulting in hypertrophy, mesangial enlargement, extracellular matrix buildup, and cell proliferation (Tung et al., 2018) . The potential of selectively regulating mesangial cells with a therapeutic drug administered externally is appealing as a novel treatment approach because they are important in the onset and DN progression (Alpers and Hudkins, 2018) . Zuckerman et al. (2015) developed siRNA-loaded NPs from polycationic cyclodextrin for targeted delivery of siRNA to the glomerular mesangium. Since mannose receptor (MR) is only expressed in the mesangium, siRNA-loaded NPs were able to remain in the glomerulus for longer when mannose was used as the surface targeting ligand. The significant uptake of targeted siRNA-loaded NPs by mesangial cells was qualitatively confirmed through epifluorescence experiments. After the intravenous injection of siRNAloaded NPs, gene suppression in the mesangium was assessed by measuring the level of production of downregulated green fluorescent proteins in mesangial cell lines and transgenic mice with elevated EGFP-expression. This study exhibited that both human and mouse mesangial cells rapidly internalized siRNA-loaded NPs instead of free siRNA. Surface targeting ligands can help mesangial cells by allowing better absorption of siRNA-loaded NPs. The NPs accumulate within the renal corpuscle in a size-dependent manner due to their particular anatomy. NPs with a size of 80-150 nm passively aggregate in the fenestrated endothelia pore during their circulation. This size-dependent accumulation opens up the possibility of developing new therapeutic approaches.",

In the diabetic environment, the podocyte-GBM interaction is disrupted, with GBM thickness serving as an early indicator of DN development. Positively charged NPs concentrate rapidly in the GBM, a factor aiding drug delivery. The anionic character of the basement membrane, which originates from the existence of a considerable quantity of heparan sulfate carrying glycocalyx, is one probable explanation (Scott and Quaggin, 2016) . Zuckerman et al. (2012) reported positively charged cyclodextrin-based siRNA NPs (potential, +10 mV) with specific anionic GBM interactions. TEM analysis showed that after siRNA NPs delivery, the kidney tissue had an abundance of darkstaining, round globules that were consistent with the size and form of siRNA NPs. Most NPs were located within the lamina rara interna, while a few of the smaller NPs were located within the limina rara externa. The accumulation of the siRNA NPs was also observed along the glomerular capillary walls by the corresponding high-intensity siRNA fluorescent signals in confocal microscopy studies. These findings established that intact NPs in circulation crossed the glomerular endothelial fenestrations and accumulated in the GBM. In earlier work, Bennett et al. (2008) made use of the electrostatic attraction between anionic GBM and cationic NPs to deliver metal oxide NPs as a contrast agent for identifying the breakdown of the basement membrane during illness. Ex vivo and in vivo MRI revealed selective localization of cationic ferritin but not native ferritin. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence revealed that this cationic ferritin accumulation occurred exclusively within the GBM. MRI revealed a decreased accumulation of cationic ferritin in single glomeruli during focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, but a dispersed accumulation of cationic ferritin in the kidney tubules was observed because of the cationic ferritin leaking from the glomerulus. Cationic contrast agents can be used to target the basement membrane and look for changes in the basement membrane in disease.",

Almost all the small peptides, amino acids, and glucose that have been filtered are reabsorbed in nephrons. The renal proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC) portrays a critical role in the pathophysiology of DN (Tang and Lai, 2012) . PTECs coordinate kidney injuries in the course of DN by triggering major fibrogenic and proinflammatory signaling pathways through the activation of numerous important DM substrates. Fibrosis in renal tubules is caused by the accumulation of fibronectin, AGEs, and other inflammatory mediators. Tubulointerstitial inflammation can be triggered by microalbuminuria activating the PTECs (Gewin, 2018) . Advanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a widely known cause of chronic renal failure in all kidney disorders. Gao et al. (2014) developed siRNA-loaded chitosan NPs as a conceptual design to target PTECs for suppressing genes overexpressed in PTECs during DN. While siRNA therapy has garnered considerable attention for its specificity and efficacy, its therapeutic utility remains challenging due to unsatisfactory circulation time and the dependence of its biodistribution primarily based on its carriers. By exploiting PTECs' affinity for LMW chitosan through receptor megalin, a specific distribution of chitosan polyplex NPs in PTECs has been confirmed by immunohistological analysis and fluorescence bioimaging. Furthermore, the NPs successfully suppressed AQP1 in PTECs via absorption through the endocytosis of a megalin-dependent pathway. Williams et al. (2018) reported mesoscale NPs composed of a diblock copolymer (PLGA-PEG) for targeting the kidneys. The NPs were found to have a 26-fold higher efficacy in the kidneys (particularly in the proximal tubules) than in other organs. The NPs were shown to be biocompatible and safe (as expected by the incorporation of FDA-approved polymers that constituted the NPs). In another study, Williams et al. (2015) reported cationic and anionic mesoscale NPs composed of PLGA functionalized with PEG. For biodistribution studies, the NPs were loaded with a fluorescent dye. After the injection of cationic or anionic mesoscale NPs into mice, images were obtained daily for the first 7 days, then biweekly for the next 3 months. Fluorescence in vivo biodistribution was used to track the degradation and localization of NPs over time. NPs were found to be concentrated in both the kidneys and the chest region. The analysis confirmed that the fluorescence intensity in the kidneys was significantly higher than in other organs. Fluorescence and computed tomography imaging of the kidneys of a mouse treated with anionic mesoscale NPs confirmed their localization and relatively uniform distribution throughout the kidneys.",

Vasopressin levels rise in diabetes and have been linked to the development of DN via V2 receptor (V2R) activation in a type 1 diabetes experimental model (El Boustany et al., 2017) . It has been suggested that the vasopressin II (V2) receptor, a G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) with seven transmembrane domains, would be beneficial for targeted drug administration via active targeting in the epithelial cells lining the connecting tubule, distal tubule, and collecting ducts (Robben et al., 2004) , Megalin receptor-mediated endosomal absorption of various drugs and safe release of the active substance from endosomes are important in renal fibrosis (Nastase et al., 2018) . While characterized NPs may be able to accumulate passively in the kidneys, active targeting NPs such as peptides and antibodies are also being studied to improve renal targeting (Nastase et al., 2018) . In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, it was recently demonstrated that vasopressin contributes to albuminuria and glomerular hyperfiltration via the V2R. It establishes the causal relationship between vasopressin and renal damage in diabetic patients (El Boustany et al., 2017) . To tackle diabetes and Polycystic Kidney Disease, a highly promising technique would be to guide therapeutic payloads to cells overexpressing V2R. Jung et al. (2012) utilized the peptide vasopressin analogue desmopressin (dDAVP) conjugated with nine D-arginines (dDAVP-9r), YFQNCPdRGGGGGRRRRRRRRR, serving as a peptide delivery platform tp deliver siRNA against aquaporins to collecting duct cells (Jung et al., 2012) . FITC-siRNA/dDAVP-9r was found to bind to Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and pig epithelial-like kidney cells (LLC-PK1) in vitro at a level one order of magnitude higher than when FITC-siRNA alone or FITC-siRNA/9r was used. In monkey kidney (Cos-7) cells, which are negative for V2 receptors, no significant differences in cellular uptake of FITC-siRNA/9r and FITC-siRNA/dDAVP-9r were found, indicating that targeting the V2 receptor was required for cellular uptake of the payload siRNA (Rothbard et al., 2002) .",

As evidenced by the abundance of NPs already in the market and more are being tested in clinical trials to see if they can be approved, the field of nanomedicines will almost certainly hold a large market share soon. In the case of DN, nanomedicine-based techniques with designed biophysical features allow for enhanced interaction with kidney cells and improved cellular uptake inside proximal tubule cells, mesangial cells, podocytes, GBM, and epithelial cells resulting in improved retention. Valuable pioneering investigations have already begun, but additional targeted pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic research in clinical states that mirror typical albuminuria, as well as the modified GFR found in DN, are needed to assess nanomedicine's relevance. Understanding the structural and functional aspects of the kidney and insights into the pathophysiology of DN can be used to improve drug delivery methods for clinical therapy and the study of DN. It's high time for nano-technological researchers and nephrology professionals to work together to devise promising nanomedicine-based methods for the targeted therapy of DN.",
