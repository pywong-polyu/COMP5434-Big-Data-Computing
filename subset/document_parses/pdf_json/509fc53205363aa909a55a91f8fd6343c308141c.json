            "text": "The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is considered the current gold standard for the detection of coronavirus disease , although it suffers from some shortcomings, namely comparatively longer turnaround time, higher false-negative rates around 20-25%, and higher cost equipment. Therefore, finding an efficient, robust, accurate, and widely available, and accessible alternative to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis is a matter of utmost importance. This study proposes a complete blood count (CBC) biomarkers-based COVID-19 detection system using a stacking machine learning (SML) model, which could be a fast and less expensive alternative. This study used seven different publicly available datasets, where the largest one consisting of fifteen CBC biomarkers collected from 1624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive) admitted at San Raphael Hospital, Italy from February to May 2020 was used to train and validate the proposed model. White blood cell count, monocytes (%), lymphocyte (%), and age parameters collected from the patients during hospital admission were found to be important biomarkers for COVID-19 disease prediction using five different feature selection techniques. Our stacking model produced the best performance with weighted precision, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and F1-score of 91.44%, 91.44%, 91.44%, 91.45%, and 91.45%, respectively. The stacking machine learning model improved the performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Finally, a nomogram-based scoring system (QCovSML) was constructed using this stacking approach to predict the COVID-19 patients. The cut-off value of the QCovSML system for classifying COVID-19 and Non-COVID patients was 4.8. Six datasets from three different countries were used to externally validate the proposed model to evaluate its generalizability and robustness. The nomogram demonstrated good calibration and discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.961 for the internal cohort and average AUC of 0.967 for all external validation cohort, respectively. The external validation shows an average weighted precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity, and overall accuracy of 92.02%, 95.59%, 93.73%, 90.54%, and 93.34%, respectively.",

It is the worst pandemic that afflicted humanity since the Spanish flu of 1918, which overwhelmed the global healthcare systems and caused a worldwide economic crisis. Unlike other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), SARS-CoV-2 can infect an individual without causing any symptoms or very mild and non-characteristic ones for a prolonged duration. This increases the risk of spreading the disease and early identification of patients becomes crucial [2] . To detect SARS-CoV-2 infections, the current gold standard tool is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, it requires specialized equipment and reagents (at least 4-5 h under optimal conditions), trained personnel for the samples collection, and proper genetic conservation of the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences used for annealing the primers [3] .",

            "text": "The data science community has proposed several machine learning (ML) based methods to assist the diagnosis and contain the transmission of COVID-19 [4] . In several studies, a number of biomarkers have been found to identify COVID-19 patients at the risk of severe infection and death by providing insight into their underlying health conditions. Zheng et al. [5] found that neutrophil, platelet, and white blood cell counts were typically normal in the COVID-19 patients at the time of admission (87.9%, 85.1%, and 88.7%, respectively). However, the majority of the patients developed lymphopenia right after the onset of symptoms, and it became more pronounced with the progression of the disease. They also showed that the neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet (NLP) counts are clinically useful in stratifying patients. However, the dataset was small, and they did not test the model on any external dataset. Moreover, Wang et al. [6] used 301 adult patient data to develop a new prediction score called ANDC for evaluating the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients. LASSO regression was used to identify age, D-dimer, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and C-reactive protein as death predictors for COVID-19 patients [6] . Although several clinical studies [5, 7] have shown blood test-based diagnosis as an effective and low-cost solution for the early COVID-19 detection, only a few ML models have been applied to hematological parameters [4, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] . Weng et al. [12] developed a nomogram using a logistic regression classifier on a single dataset collected from a hospital in Wuhan. Ramachandran et al. [8] used multivariable logistic regression analyses on a single dataset collected from a tertiary care academic medical center in New York City and found the deviations in the Red Blood Cell distribution width (RDW) among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A similar study was done by Foy et al. [10] using a dataset collected from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Gong et al. [9] developed a nomogram using logistic regression on a dataset collected from Wuhan. A different study has developed several machine learning (ML) models to improve diagnostic capabilities to prevent the spread of the pandemic [4] . The majority of these models [4, [13] [14] [15] [16] employed computed tomography (CT) scans and chest X-rays. However, the CT scan-based diagnostic approaches showed higher false-negative results that caused concern for real-life applications [17] . Moreover, CT imaging solutions are expensive, time-consuming, and require specialized equipment; hence, they are not feasible for frequent testing.",

Furthermore, we develop a nomogram-based scoring technique using the machine learning approach and the scoring technique uses complete blood count (CBC) parameters to diagnose COVID-19 patients in resource-constrained situations and countries, where the availability and application of RT-PCR are limited. Moreover, the developed method can be utilized in combination with the RT-PCR to improve its sensitivity. Different biomarkers have been used in several recent works on machine learning-based early mortality prediction systems [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no prior work employing such biomarkers to diagnose COVID-19 patients that are trained with a large dataset and validated externally on datasets from different countries. Fast screening of COVID-19 with high sensitivity is crucial for both resource and treatment planning [19, 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Therefore, this study proposes a reliable COVID-19 diagnostic technique that can be generalized in other health care settings. It adds to the body of knowledge for developing a framework using a stacking machine learning technique and validates the performance with six completely unseen datasets.",

We proposed a stacking-based ML model leveraging the top-performing classifiers and performance compared with other conventional ML classifiers to identify COVID-19 positive patients.

Moreover, a nomogram-based scoring system (QCovSML) using this stacking technique was developed, which provides 91% overall accuracy. The nomogram-based scoring system was validated with six external datasets. The overall average accuracy for the six datasets is 93.34%. The QCoVSML technique requires only easy-to-obtain biomarkers, which makes it useful for the diverse environments for both in and out-patient settings.

As a result, the most common CBC biomarkers for identifying COVID-19 individuals, and potentially categorizing its severity are reduced neutrophil count, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia. Liu et al. [44] recently suggested that decreasing lymphocyte counts can help for predicting the severity of COVID-19 infection early. Both lymphocytes and neutrophils are essential components of our immune system since they play a vital role in infection clearance and host defense. Lymphopenia is a common symptom among COVID-19 patients, which is caused by the reduction in the number of lymphocytes in the blood [45] . We used the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils in this study, and similar to the previous research [46, 47] , found a correlation between a lower percentage of these two concentrations with extremely ill COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, bone marrow increases neutrophil production, as cytokines induce immunosuppression and lymphocyte apoptosis, which results in a rise in NLR [48] .",

Similarly, Avila et al. [49] developed a Bayesian model, reporting 76.7% sensitivity and specificity. In our study, we have used a large CBC biomarkers dataset to develop our proposed model and used multicenter and multicountry datasets for external validation. Firstly, WBC count, monocytes (%), age, and lymphocyte (%) parameters were selected as important biomarkers out of eleven different biomarkers for COVID-19 disease prediction using five different state-of-the-art feature selection techniques. Moreover, we developed a stacking-based ML model which produced the best performance with weighted precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity, and overall accuracy of 91.44%, 91.45%, 91.45%, 91.44%, and 91.45%, respectively. The stacking model provides a 2% performance gain over the other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Finally, developed a nomogram-based scoring system using this stacking approach and the study validated the QCovSML scoring system with six other external CBC datasets from three different countries and the average weighted precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity, and overall accuracy for the six external datasets are 92.02%, 95.59%, 93.73%, 90.54%, and 93.34%, respectively.

Moreover, the proposed model has a high degree of sensitivity to predict the COVID-19 positive patients in both internal and external datasets. The model was tested on completely unseen six external clinical datasets from three different countries -making this model helpful for clinicians to effectively optimize patients' stratification, devise efficient management strategies, and better resource utilization. Finally, this ML-based solution can be applied in both in-patients and out-patients as an alternative to the RT-PCR test for fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients. This is especially useful in the low-resource environment, where screening of patients can be done using the proposed method and selective RT-PCR tests can be carried out to minimize RT-PCR test and selective RT-PCR tests.",
