Here we report the discovery of suramin, a 100-year-old drug, as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 \u00c5 cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells. These results provide a structural mechanism for the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a rationale for repurposing suramin for treating COVID-19.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, several related betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are highly pathogenic, which infections can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome exacerbated by loss of lung function and death. Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have much higher capacity of human to human infections, which result in a rapidly growing pandemic (Sanche et al., 2020) . Finding an effective treatment for SARS-COV-2 through drug repurposing is an urgent but unmet medical need.",

            "text": "Suramin ( Figure 1A ) is a century-old drug that has been used to treat African sleeping sickness and river blindness (Brun et al., 2010; Hawking, 1958) . Suramin has also been shown to be effective in inhibiting the replication of a wide spectrum of viruses, including enteroviruses (Ren et al., 2014) , Zika virus (Albulescu et al., 2017) , Chikungunya (Albulescu et al., 2015) and Ebola viruses (Hen\u00df et al., 2016) . The viral inhibition mechanism of suramin appears to be very diverse, including inhibition of viral attachment, entry, and release from host cells in part through interactions with viral capsid proteins (Wiedemar et al., 2020) . Recently, suramin has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, which was proposed to act through preventing entry of the virus (Salgado-Benvindo et al., 2020) . Here we report that suramin is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an essential enzyme for the life cycle of virus. The potency of suramin is at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the current FDA approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. Cryo-EM structure reveals that suramin binds to the RdRp active site, blocking the binding of both RNA template and primer strands. These results provide a rationale for repurposing suramin for COVID-19 and a structural template to design next generation drugs of suramin derivatives.",

            "text": "Incubation of the purified nsp12-7-8 complex (Figure S1A-1B) with a 30-base template and 20base primer (poly-A in Figure 1B ) allowed the primer extension to the same length as the template in the presence of saturated concentrations of UTP as illustrated in a gel-based assay (lane 1 in Figure 1C ). Addition of 8-32 \u00b5M suramin nearly abolished the elongation of the primer strand while it required 100-1000 \u00b5M of remdesivir in its triphosphate form (RDV-TP) to achieve the same degree of inhibition under the same condition (Yin et al., 2020) . Interestingly, addition of 100 \u00b5M of higher concentrations of suramin completely blocked the formation of RdRp-RNA complex, while it required more than 5 mM of RDV-TP to inhibit the binding of RdRp to RNA ( Figure 1D and Figure S1C ). Solution based assays of the RdRp inhibition determined that half maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) of suramin is 0.26 \u00b5M ( Figure 1E ), and the IC50 for RDV-TP is 6.21 \u00b5M under identical assay conditions ( Figure S1D ), suggesting that suramin is at least 20-fold more potent than RDV-TP. Cell-based experiments indicated that suramin was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50)of~2.9 \u00b5M, which is about the same range as remdesivir in the same assay ( Figure 1F and Fig. S1E ) (Wang et al., 2020) . The apparent weaker inhibition of suramin in cell-based assays than in enzyme inhibition assays may be due to the highly negative charges of suramin that may prevent its efficient uptake by the host cells. In addition, the CC50 (concentrations of drug required to reduce cell viability by 50%) of suramin is over 1000 \u00b5M, indicating its relatively low cytotoxicity, which is much safer than remdesivir ( Figure 1F and Fig. S1E ).",

            "text": "One suramin molecule (suramin #1) is fit into a cavity formed by conserved motif G and the Nterminus of motif B ( Figure 4A and Figure 3 ). The chemical structure of suramin has a two-fold symmetry with a urea linker at the center ( Figure 1A ). The EM density map for this suramin is very clear defined but only for half of the suramin molecule without the urea linker ( Figure 4A and 4B). The key interactions of suramin #1 with RdRp were summarized in Figure 4C and Table 1 , including hydrogen bonds, charge interactions, and hydrophobic packing interactions with conserved RdRp residues, which restrain the naphthalene-trisulfonic acid head in a relative narrow cavity. Two out of the three sulfonates (positions 3 and 5) form hydrogen bonds with the side chains from N497, K500, R569 and Q573, and the main chain from N497, while the sulfonate at positions 1 points toward the solvent and forms only one hydrogen bond with the side chain of N496. The K577 side chain forms cation-\u03c0 stacking with the naphthalene ring, and also forms a hydrogen bond with the amide bond linker between the naphthalene and benzene rings. The amide bond linker between the benzene rings C and D forms a hydrogen bond with main chain NH of G590. In addition, the suramin # 1 is in van der Waals contact with several residues, including L576, A580, A685, Y689 and l758. The other suramin molecule (suramin #2) is fit into the cavity near the catalytic active site formed by conserved motifs A, C, E, and F ( Figure 4B and Figure 3 ). Also, only half of suramin was observed in the structure with clear EM density map. The key interactions of suramin #2 with RdRp were summarized in Figure 4D and Table 1 , including hydrogen bonds, charge interactions, and hydrophobic packing interactions. Different from suramin # 1, the sulfonate at positions 5 of suramin # 2 points toward the solvent and forms only one hydrogen bond with the side chain of R555, while the other two sulfonates at positions 1 and 3 form hydrogen bonds with the side chains from K551, R553, R555 and R836, and the main chains from A550 and K551. Meanwhile the side chain of R555 also forms a hydrogen bond with the amide bond linker between the naphthalene and benzene rings. The R836 side chain forms cation-\u03c0 stacking with the benzene ring C. The NH of the benzene ring D forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of D865. In addition, suramin # 2 is in van der Waals contact with several residues, including H439, I548, S549, A840, S861 and L862. Sequence 6 alignment with RdRp from several viruses indicated that these suramin-contacting residues are conserved ( Figure S5 ), suggesting that suramin may be a general inhibitor of viral RdRp, which implies that suramin could be used as a drug for treating infections of these viruses.",

If the base position of remdesivir was defined as +1 position, then the binding of the first suramin molecule occupies the same space of -1 to -3 positions of RNA template strand (suramin #1 in Figure 5B ). The second suramin molecule at the active site occupies the space of the primer strand ranging from -4 to +1 positions (suramin #2 in Figure 5C ). The binding of these two suramin molecules would thus block the binding of the RNA template-primer duplex to the active site as well as the entry of nucleotide triphosphate into the catalytic site, which results in the direct inhibition of the RdRp catalytic activity. The direct inhibition mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by suramin is different from the suramin-mediated inhibition of the norovirus RdRp, which also contained two binding sites for suramin binding (Mastrangelo et al., 2012) .

To determine the structure-activity-relationship (SAR), we screened a set of 8 different suramin derivatives using in vitro RdRp primer extension assays ( Figure 6A and Figure S1F ). All 8 tested suramin derivatives showed efficient inhibition of RdRp activity ( Figure S1G ). NF157, NF279, and NF449 are most potent inhibitors with IC50 of 0.05 \u00b5M, 7 which are about 5-fold more potent than the parent drug suramin ( Figure 6B ). Cell-based assays showed that NF110 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with EC50 of 2.87 \u00b5M ( Figure 6C ), while NF157 and NF279 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with EC50 of~10 \u00b5M. The CC50 values of all suramin derivatives are over 1000 \u00b5M, indicating their good safety window and their potential use for treating COVID-19. However, there is a 200-fold separation between their biochemical potency in inhibiting RdRp activity and their potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell-based assays, suggesting the difficulties of these suramin derivatives to be uptake by host cells (Alsford et al., 2013) . Future drug formulation such as with glycol chitosan-based nanoparticles (Cheng et al., 2019) may improve their bioavailability to lung tissues and their potency in inhibiting viral replication.",

In this paper, we showed that suramin is a direct potent inhibitor of the viral RdRp, the essential enzyme for the viral life cycle.

Both suramin binding sites in norovirus RdRp did not clash with the RNA strands but one of the suramin binding site is overlapping with the proposed nucleotide entry channel, thus indirectly blocking RdRp polymerization activity, a mechanism different from the direct blocking of the binding of the RNA template to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by suramin (Figure 5). In addition, structural comparisons of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-suramin structure with the structures of the norovirus RdRp bound to other suramin derivatives show that the suramin and suramin derivatives bind to the RdRp with diverse conformations and orientations(Croci et al., 2014; Mastrangelo et al., 2012) (Figure S6B, S6E and S7), indicating the possibility for other suramin derivatives to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as tested below.",
