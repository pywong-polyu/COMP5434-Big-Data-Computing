Mini-Mu unit {[FRT-Km R -FRT]-Sm R } was used for amplification as a model. It was already known that a single copy of strAB under the control of P17 promoter can provide the resistance of M. methylotrophus to 500 \u03bcg/ml of Sm, whereas methylotrophic cells that contained this gene on a moderate-copy-number plasmid were resistant to >2 mg/ml of Sm (Tokmakova, unpublished) .

The fact that the elevated resistance of the selected clones was due to the mini-Mu unit amplification was proven by the Southern hybridization (Fig. 5 ). The selected clones had at least two copies of mini-Mu unit in their genomes. Unfortunately, the presence of two mini-Mu units in the chromosome has already provided resistance to such high antibiotic concentrations (up to 10 mg/ml) that selection of variants with higher copy number was made impossible. 1 However, the possibility of mini-Mu unit intrachromosomal amplification in the presence of Mu transposition factors was demonstrated. It seems probable that this amplification based on the known intrachromosomal replicative transposition resulted in cointegrate formation leading to chromosomal rearrangements due to the inversion of the chromosomal fragment located between two obtained copies of transposon (Metzler 2001) . The combined action of replication and site-specific recombination between two copies of transposon is necessary to restore the original position of the first copy during the transposition which 1 The real reason of nonlinear dependence of the level of cell resistance to Sm on the copy number of mini-Mu unit in M. methylotrophus chromosome is unclear. One of the possibilities could be a limitation of antibiotic transport facility, and so at the determined Sm R genes expression level, the corresponding protein products could degrade all Sm penetrated in the cell independently on extracellular Sm concentration. Genomic DNA, prepared from 15 colonies selected on 2.0 mg/ml of Sm and from the control strains was digested with EcoRV, separated by gel electrophoresis in agarose (right) and hybridized with the internal fragment of kan used as the probe (left).

Lane 1 DNA ladder, lane 2 a control clone with non amplified mini-Mu unit, lanes 3-7 clones with amplified mini-Mu unit, lane8 a negative control a wild-type clone seems less probable in the absence of the specific counterselection against chromosomal rearrangements. Thus, in our experiments, we were unable to detect clones with the restored positions of the original copy of mini-Mu unit in the chromosome: both chromosomal DNA fragments carried mini-Mu unit and selected by Southern DNA hybridization in new strains differed in size from the corresponding fragment in the strain progenitor (Fig. 5) . In case of restored position of the original mini-Mu unit, the new fragment had to be added to the previously detected one at the hybridization's pattern of the new strains.
