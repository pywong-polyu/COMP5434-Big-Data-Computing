Lumbalgia, for example, accounts for a considerable portion of economic losses due to disability and is estimated to affect over 60% of the Saudis (a percentage similar to other countries in Saudi Arabia's (SA's) demographic, but a far larger percentage than several Western countries like the United Kingdom or Canada). 3 ",

Early exposure of internal medicine residents and students to rheumatology training is suggested to influence their sub-specialty decisions. 7 The Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) adopted the CanMEDS framework 8 to establish a core curriculum for all training programs including rheumatology. 9, 10 Under the SCFHS rheumatology curriculum, Saudi physicians undergo two years of full-time supervised training in which they are actively involved in patient care, with responsibility increasing as further experience and competence are gained. 10 The aim of this qualitative work is to explore the future directions of rheumatology training in SA. Our country is approaching a new era in its history outlined in the Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious Saudi government initiative to diversify the national economy and to make public sector improvements in the areas of health, infrastructure, education, tourism, and other areas. Saudi Vision 2030 is expected to result in a massive overhaul of Saudi healthcare delivery, including reforms in the supervision of medical education. 11 This innovative vision of development should be accompanied by clear strategies for training programs in different specialties. This manuscript is an initiative from the Alzaidi Chair of Research in Rheumatic Diseases (ZCRD) at Umm Alqura University and is produced in collaboration with SCFHS.",

A Saudi study by ZCRD in collaboration with MOH was conducted to validate the parameters that should be used in a referral criteria. 24 There was a total of nine variables identified as having high specificity and good predictive value: loss of appetite, swelling of metacarpophalangeal joint 2 or 5, swelling of proximal interphalangeal joint 2 or 3, wrist swelling, wrist tenderness, a positive test for rheumatoid factor, and a positive test for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. 24 This work needs to progress to validate a core set of a criteria used for referral.

A nationwide cross-sectional study of residents and fellows in several specialties in SA reported that 84.6% of the respondents reported a reduction in training activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 28 The authors of the study recommended the use of e-learning platforms to continue some educational activities. 28 The presence of COVID-19 has accelerated the creative usage of digital communication and dissemination of educational materials. Social media channels have become instrumental to the future of rheumatology education, with online journal clubs, more opportunities for interactive educational formats, and other benefits. 29 Though this study was conducted before the global spread of COVID-19, the pandemic has changed the fundamental delivery of rheumatology education, perhaps irrevocably.",

The clinical and research benefits of this collaboration have been previously described to contribute to a better and more sustainable health-care system. 35 The panel has also recommended the implementation of an outpatient disease specialised clinic to provide better health-care privileges for patients affected by one disease like RA or SLE. The idea was studied by Rubio et al in Spain to assess the clinical practice in a clinic model specialising in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They emphasised that the COPD patients who were treated in a specialised clinic showed greater clinical control of COPD compared to those treated at conventional clinics, despite the specialised clinic seeing patients with more advanced disease. 36 The panel also encouraged the implementation of local registries for RA. The registries can present information on several aspects including clinical guidelines and quality of care, drug safety and benefit-risk data, and healthrelated outcomes, including quality of life and clinical effectiveness. 37 There are successful examples of local efforts in building registries in SA like the efforts conducted by ZCRD to build the Rheumatoid Arthritis Saudi Database (RASD). 4 However, collaboration of efforts is greatly needed to expand the impact of these initiatives.",

The meeting yielded ten recommendations that tackle all persisting challenges through developing MSK core capabilities framework, increasing the number of trainees and training centres in the underserved cities, standardising the training centres, and merging rheumatology clinical practice with training and research. Implementation of these recommendations has the potential to increase the reach, quality, and sustainability of current Saudi rheumatology training.",
