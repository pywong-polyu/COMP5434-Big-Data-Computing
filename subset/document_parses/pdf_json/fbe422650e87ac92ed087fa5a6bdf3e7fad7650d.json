[1] [2] [3] The concept has been around since copyrighted by Humana Health Plan 4 ; drawing the attention of scientists to enhance collaborations and cultivate access to resources essential for advanced research. 5 It has been shaping institutions with ways to consolidate and build on their expertise and develop the capacity for scientific and financial gains. 6 Organisations that work under the CoE model have been pooling existing highly skilled expertise and resources to work hard on their focus area and bring in superior performance and productivity over the others. 7 The organisations leverage CoE as a specific mechanism to establish and drive world-class excellence within their technical or functional space.",

In the area of healthcare, CoE has been looked at as a specialised programme with potential expertise and resources focusing on particular medical areas and providing exceptional outcomes. 9 10 Some experts in the field pinpoint particular fronts that distinguish CoE from traditional healthcare delivery models-organisation design, servicescape design, personnel, medical care, marketing and finance. 9 11 Moreover, many research and higher education institutions [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and healthcare institutions 17-20 across different countries have pursued a CoE status with claims that such institutions have bold distinctions in capacity, resources and outcomes even among themselves. For instance, the African Research Universities Alliance (ARUA) establishes CoEs within its member universities where worldclass researchers from member universities assemble to carry out joint researches in 13 priority thematic areas. Drawing on existing university infrastructure and human resources, each CoE needs to bring together leading researchers from Africa and elsewhere in working groups and conduct cutting-edge research that is innovative and with the potential for transformation. ARUA explains CoE as an assembly point for good and committed researchers and students seeking to do cutting-edge work. It conceptualises CoE as a team, a shared facility, or an entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for a focus area which might be a technology, a business concept, a skill or a broad area of study.",

The review was conducted following the stages described below: To ensure that all relevant information were captured, we searched the Google engine for grey literature including conference proceedings, working papers, newsletters, business documents, presentations and reports, government documents, technical documents, white papers, policies and bulletins.

There were some existing frameworks that the CoEs used as a benchmark to shape the establishment and implementation of their CoEs; however, there were some important limitations with the frameworks: 1. The frameworks were limited to demarcating the unique features of a CoE as compared with an ordinary institution. 2. The frameworks were limited to specific facilities or services without analysis at a larger scale. 3. The frameworks lacked parameters and levels of indicators to use to follow-up or improve the performance of the CoEs, unlike many accreditation requirements for different research and education ventures. 4. The frameworks were not sufficient to enhance CoEs to acquire excellence in both research and education when these two ventures are allied. There were many CoEs tagged as 'CoE for Research and Education'. As one compliments the other, it could be possible to achieve excellence in both as a singular goal. 5. Giving particular emphasis to CoEs in developing countries, the frameworks did not recognise the issue of resource potential and stewardships in such settings. The scoping review indicates that highly specialised expertise is one of the layers on top, with the number and multidisciplinary nature of the experts influencing the competency of a CoE with the rapidly changing knowledge and development landscape. The CoE needs to ensure that it has the right technical, administrative and operational functions in place, bringing in the right subject-matter expertise at the right time to deliver targeted outcomes. The appointment of expertise needs to be merit based, taking into account each member's education, training, experience and the broader vision of long-term requirements.",
