Phylogenetic clusters including SARS-CoV-2 Tunisian genome sequences were detailed in (b to g). The sequences reported in this study are shown in red bold, and indicated by the accession number, laboratory code, district, country code, week and year of isolation. The sequences downloaded from GISAID and NCBI database are indicated by their accession number followed by the country code and the year of isolation ",

The six Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were non identical with 0.1% nucleotide divergence between each other. Compared to the Wuhan (NC045512) reference, the reported Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 sequences showed several synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, distributed over the entire genome. A total of 43 SNP mutations were identified with 27 and 16 SNPs in the non-structural and structural region respectively. Each sequence showed a different SNPs profile; the number of detected SNPs in each sequence ranged between 6 and 13. Most of them were located in the non-structural region affecting 08 out of the 16 non-structural genes ( Table 1 ). In the structural region, most of SNPs were detected in the S gene encoding for the spike protein.",
