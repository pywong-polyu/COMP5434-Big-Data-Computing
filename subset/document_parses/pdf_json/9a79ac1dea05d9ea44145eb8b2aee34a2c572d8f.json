Therefore, we can deduce the values of K 27 and K 13 , respectively, since all the other key nibbles in f 2 and f 3 are determined during the previous steps. 6. After step 20, we have 2 60 \u00d7 (16/7) 9 possible values for K 0 , K 1 , K 2 , K 3 , K 4 , K 5 , K 6 , K 7 , K 9 +S(K 8 +S(K 20 )), K 10 , K 11 , K 12 , K 13 Fig. 3 , we have 37 round keys involved in the analysis rounds. According to the key schedule, these 37 round keys take only 2 124 possible values (see step 21 in Table 3 ). As mentioned in step 21, we remove on average 2 60 \u00d7 (16/7) 9 = 2 70.734 out of 2 124 possible values of these 37 round keys involved in the attack for each pair of the 2 m+44.266 remaining pairs. Hence, a wrong key is not discarded using one pair with probability 1 \u2212 2 70.734\u2212124 = 1 \u2212 2 \u221253.266 . Therefore, we have 2 124 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 2 \u221253.266 ) 2 m+44.266 \u2248 2 124 \u00d7 (e \u22121 ) 2 m+44.266\u221253.266 \u2248 2 124 \u00d7 2 \u22121.4\u00d72 m\u22129 remaining candidates for 124bit of the key, after processing all the 2 m+44.266 remaining pairs. We evaluated the computational complexity of the attack as a function of m, as illustrated in Table 3 , to determine the optimal value of m that leads to the best computational complexity. As steps 20 and 21 dominate the time complexity of the attack, see Table 3 , we choose m = 12 in order to optimize the time complexity of the attack. Therefore, we have 2 124 \u00d7 2 \u22121.4\u00d72 12\u22129=3 = 2 124\u221211.2 = 2 112.8 remaining candidates for 124-bit of the key. The remaining key nibbles can be retrieved by guessing K 8 and exhaustively searching the 2 112.8 remaining key candidates using 2 plaintext/ciphertext pairs. This step requires 2 \u00d7 2 4 \u00d7 2 112.8 = 2 117.8 encryptions. Therefore, the time complexity of the attack is 2 120.245 + 2 119.245 + 2 117.8 \u2248 2 120.83 encryptions. The data complexity of the attack is 2 m+4\u00d713 = 2 64 chosen tweak/plaintext combinations that can be generated using 2 m+48 = 2 60 chosen plaintexts.

We initialize an array H of 2 18\u00d74=72 entries to \"0\", where each entry is 1-bit and the index of the array is 18 key nibbles involved in the attack, as we will see later. Then, we generate 2 m structures as described above. Therefore, we have 2 m+63 pairs of plaintext/ciphertext pairs generated using 2 m+28 chosen plaintexts. Next, we ask the encryption oracle for their corresponding ciphertexts. The plaintext/ciphertext pairs that satisfy Observation 4 are 2 m+63 \u00d7 2 \u221213.119 = 2 m+49.881 pairs. After the ciphertext filtration, we have only 2 m+49.881 \u00d7 2 \u221212\u00d74 = 2 m+1.881 remaining pairs. For each remaining pair, we perform the following steps: Fig. 4 , we have 22 round keys involved in the analysis rounds. According to the key schedule, these 22 round keys take only 2 72 possible values (see step 12 in Table 4 ). As mentioned in step 12, we remove on average 2 28 \u00d7 (16/7) 11 = 2 41.119 out of 2 72 possible values of these 22 round keys involved in the attack for each pair of the 2 m+1.881 remaining pairs. Hence, a wrong key is not discarded using one pair with probability 1 \u2212 2 41.119\u221272 = 1 \u2212 2 \u221230.881 . Therefore, we have 2 72 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 2 \u221230.881 ) 2 m+1.881 \u2248 2 72 \u00d7 (e \u22121 ) 2 m+1.881\u221230.881 \u2248 2 72 \u00d7 2 \u22121.4\u00d72 m\u221229 remaining candidates for 72-bit", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1, "end": 2, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 292, "end": 294, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 511, "end": 514, "text": "1 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1112, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1969, "end": 1975, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2138, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}]}
