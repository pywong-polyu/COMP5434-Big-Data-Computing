            "text": "Nomo-centric understanding means that the individual is captured, dependent and subdued by his environment, namely that one's existentiality is constructed through belonging, membership, duty and external values. Auto-centric understanding implies a self-reliant approach, where the individual strives for selfrealisation based on his personal judgement and rationality. Thus, auto-centric values characterise a modern approach, whereas nomo-centric values characterise a more traditional approach. Rokeach (1973) views values as hierarchical and distinguishes between two types of values: (1) terminal values (personal or social values) that individuals aspire to achieve throughout their lives; and (2) instrumental values (capacity values and moral values) that are expressions of forms of behaviour. He maintains that instrumental values may sometimes be a means for achieving terminal ones. Levy (1999) explains the possible ambiguity of Rokeach's (1973) definition by relying on facet theory: \"a terminal value relates to a goal that is a destination in itself, while an instrumental value addresses a goal both as a destination in itself and as a more primary destination\" (p. 81). Lamm (2001) maintains that a value is a criterion for preference (for example beauty, love of one's country, the sanctity of life) in a reality of conflict (that is, where there is no a priori consensus) between motivations of equivalent power (between two entities perceived as good or bad). If one is considered good and the second bad, there can be no consensus.",

The term values education developed later, but the two concepts were initially considered to be almost identical. However, in traditional societies, the values which religious education focused on were established by God and obedience to them stood at the centre. These values are based on inexplicable but definable mystical principles and are based primarily on the believer's basic belief that because they come from a transcendent source they are true and do not need justification. The French Revolution introduced and implemented the concept of separation of church and state leading to increasing secularisation throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This move to the secular state was further reinforced in the same period by the processes of modernisation, with the economic revolution, urbanisation, improved transportation and increasing literacy through the introduction of free, compulsory secular schools. As well, the rapid technological developments further contributed to a change of priorities and attitudes towards values, which brought about a fundamental change in the concept and the role of education.",

In his book Moral Education (1925) , Durkheim posits that in a modern world ruled by rationality, the moral elements hidden within the messages and agendas and religious teachings must be identified, assimilated and separated from the religious mystical world and made accessible to the modern-secular society in rational language. Durkheim focused on exploring what he called \"social facts\" that is, phenomena that exist only in society and do not exist in each individual. He argues that the definitions of moral behaviour should not be changed, but the context and language with which they come to educate needs to be modernised. In relation to moral principles (Shachar 2019, p. 40), Durkheim argued that they are rational and functional principles that aim to preserve social order.",

As the child matures and throughout adulthood, his moral thinking becomes more independent and \"autonomous\". Kohlberg (1973 Kohlberg ( , 1976 ) developed Piaget's intellectual development stages further. Within his two cognitive-developmental and moral reasoning stages, he delineated three more sub-stages in each phase (a total of six steps) that more accurately indicate the transition from heteronomy to autonomy. His theories did have some impact on Australian scholars and the private religious school system, particularly the Catholic system (Rossiter 2011).",

Schwartz (1994) defined values as \"human goals that go beyond one condition or another, which have a different order of importance and name as guiding principles in the lives of individuals or groups.\" Schwartz (2009) identified ten values and defined them: self-directedness (thinking and independent actions: choice, creation and discovery); stimulation (excitement, novelty challenge in life); hedonism (pleasure and self-satisfaction); achievement (personal success and public proof of standards-appropriate skills); social power (social status and prestige, control over people or resources); safety (protection, harmony, confidence in the security of relationships with others and self); conservatism (avoidance of actions, tendencies and impulses that may or may not harm others, violation of laws, social expectations or norms); tradition (respect, commitment and acceptance of customs and beliefs that culture or religion holds); generosity; the well-being and promotion of people with whom there is a lasting personal connection; and universality (understanding, appreciation, tolerance and protection of the welfare of all people and nature).",

According to Schwartz's approach, there is no ideal concept of values and no absolute values, but values include a range of motives and behaviours ranging from self-centred to universal perception. Whereas Dewey, Piaget, and Kohlberg completely disregard the religious component Durkheim sees it as a sociological foundation and a central point from which universal social values derive. Schwartz and his colleagues suggest a midway where they identify in their theory a component they call \"tradition\" which they consider to be a value. However, according to their empirical findings, this value is connected to the conservative and conformity pole. While Durkheim sees religion as a source of reference and a point of departure for a meaningful life, Schwartz and his colleague see religion as an old-fashioned relic which they call traditionalism which resonates with the opposite of modernity, representing the conformist aspect of man. As such, they presents a unidimensional approach to tradition. This view of Schwartz and his co-researchers is, in our opinion, a limited approach that is imprisoned in the conception of the secular thesis that sees a temporally conformism stemming from outdated religious beliefs. This is completely detached from the dynamic view that perceives religion as a lively, relevant and dynamic matter (see Gross 2015; Gross and Rutland 2014; Jackson 1997) . Durkheim understood that religion still has a central place in the functional paradigm that he developed even though he did not develop a compatible educational approach because he was a sociologist, not an educator. The sociologists who followed him have abandoned this approach in favour of post-modern paradigms that centre on conflict theory and the question of power. These approaches and the theoretical paradigm shift in sociology from a functionalist approach to conflict paradigm have ignored the fact that, de facto, religion is still a central component in the regulation of social and political issues and has a central place in the human psyche of religious people who choose to lead meaningful religious lives albeit within modernity. As Salman (2002) has pointed out, whilst there is largely consensus about the core, secular educational values, \"the concept of incorporating spiritual and religious values continues to generate a greater level of ambivalence and discord among different groups\" (Salman 2002, 116) .",

Qualitative studies, on the other hand, answer broader questions and allow for a \"thick description\" and a broader spectrum of answers beyond Likert's scale, allowing for a deeper discussion of questions of religious values education (Gross 2013) and as seen in the current study.",

This positioning reflects the lack of understanding that religious education can intersect with values education and can enrich it. Thus, this chapter aims to investigate further the role of religion in terms of values education across six main faiths in the postmodern era in Australia. In addition, it will investigate the role of parents who are actively choosing to send their children to SRE/RI classes, given the voluntary nature of these classes and family/school partnerships.",

Thus, Gross concluded that a strong ideological and spiritual connection between the home and the school setting, which students are exposed to, impacts on their spiritual, ideological and value-laden development.

When the home resonates with the school values and vice versa, schools become an abridged version of home, a safe place. Schools can act as a comfort zone as long as there is no dissonance between the school and home values.

Such an alignment between the behavioural codes and cultural values of schools and parents needs to be reflected in the \"pedagogical commodities\" (Bunar 2010) that are exchanged in the educational market. The increase in home schooling also shows the need of parents to be involved in their children's values education. This is even more apparent in the hybrid home schooling where parents are looking to \"gain a fuller picture of their values and motivations\" (Wearne 2016, p. 378) .

However, efforts to introduce courses about the different religions, which could have at least enabled a better understanding about the role religion plays in terms of the meaning of life, in addition to developing intercultural competence which is part of values education (Lovat et al. 2002) , have largely failed in Australian government schools.

(2009), who undertook an extensive empirical research project and concluded that \"religion is still an attractive candidate as a system for cultural belonging and offers distinct lifestyle patterns including moral standards\", have argued that religious education still has a role to play. This is highlighted by the Australian experience. Surveys show that currently in Australia only 60% of the population identify as religious, but in New South Wales 70% of parents are choosing to send their children to SRE/RI classes. According to the teachers' testimony, one reason behind this parental choice, both secular and religious, is because parents believe that values education can be best transmitted through religious education. Their evidence demonstrates that some parents who come from a Christian background may choose a different faith tradition for their children's SRE/RI classes, such as Buddhism or Baha'i, rather than Special Ethics Education in New South Wales or non-scripture, indicating that they still want a religious education, including religious values for their children.",

Researchers also argue that moral education, values education, ethics, virtues and morality is best taught through the medium of RE (Moran 1989; Stern 2018) . Moran argues that \"Moral education needs religious education neither as lord and servant but as thoughtful colleague\" (Moran 1989, p. 189) . Stern (2018) posits that values education and ethics enriches the RE curriculum and enables the development of student's virtues: \"(t)he dispositions of pupils will be developed using the treasury of faith\" (Birmingham City Council 2007, p. 5) . He contends that in the United Kingdom values education is embedded into RE as it is expected that RE will \"have a personal influence on pupils\". Values education through RE builds the student's character from a more holistic approach, a point stressed by our interviewees. Thus, our findings add to this growing body of data that special religious education can complement and strengthen the values curriculum in the secular classrooms in the government school settings.",

We also found that there were some differences in the understanding of values from the different faith traditions. There was a commonality in terms of the main values listed by the interviewees, even though there were differences in emphasis. For example, Hinduism and Buddhism explicitly included taking care of the environment as part of their students' responsibilities. Jewish SRE teachers used Jewish history to explain different values, with the Holocaust being used as an example of not being a bystander but rather standing up for the rights of others, particularly in relation to playground bullying. These different understandings actually strengthen the educative aspect of SRE giving it a broader scope and impact.",

In particular, there was less emphasis on Value 2: students \"doing your best\u2026 and pursue excellence\" because the focus in SRE/RI tends to be more within the sphere of social good, rather than individual educational attainment. Another important difference relates to Value 4: \"freedom\", in particular regarding enjoying one's rights. This was due to a greater emphasis on duties and responsibilities in SRE/RI classes. While one Hindu interviewee referred to \"privileges\" as part of the concept of dharma, this was within the framework of responsibilities, so that privileges emerge from duty. Again, the importance of standing up for the rights of others, as noted above, was stressed by a Jewish interviewee, but the concept was embedded in other responses from the different faith traditions. This reflects the difference between the individualism of postmodern society, as compared with the focus on community good within religious traditions. Understanding these differences relates to the issue of extrinsic and intrinsic values (Selman 2003; Beit-Hallahmi and Argyle 1997) , where extrinsic values were found to be stronger in people who were religious. There is a tension between the attitude to the social values rather than to the values which are more self-centred on the individual. Even though the teachers think that adolescents tend to support more extrinsic rather than intrinsic values (Gross 2013) , the prominent values that students endorse in the overall picture are intrinsic rather than extrinsic. Yet, this tension is an integral part of the pedagogical discourse in the SRE/RI arena and makes SRE more attractive to parents.",

These differences reflect the findings of Klages (1988) that the auto-centric values characterise a modern approach, with its focus on individual self-realisation, whereas nomo-centric values characterise a more traditional approach with its focus on communal wellbeing and belonging.

This approach is supported by research that has revealed the educational power of following religious precepts (Gross 2009 ), as well as the impact of prayer (Kohn 2020) .

They found that, despite this lack of commitment, there was an improvement in student attitudes regarding the education segment of the values education program. Yet, the studies recognise the key role teachers play as role models and the SRE/RI teachers perceive their task in this domain as very important. As well, because they are teaching the values through the lens of their faith tradition, they are authentic in their approach. Authenticity has also been seen as an important component in values education (Forgasz 2002) .

Our interviewees also recognised these factors and believed that SRE/RI classes can further extend these elements due to the synergy between home values and those of the respective faith traditions. According to the teachers from all the religious faiths, there is a synergy between the child's environment, the religious and moral aspirations of their parents and their demands from schools as is discussed in Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory (1979) . In terms of values education, for many families, the values from their religion are of central importance. Hence, SRE/RI classes help to reinforce values education because this provides the added level of spiritual and religious understandings, which reinforces the connection between home and school. Even when parents are no longer practising in terms of attending religious services, the evidence reveals that they still want their children to learn the basic religious values that they grew up with, regardless of which faith tradition we are talking about. The graduate students' voice from those we interviewed strongly echoed their family background and in a number of cases these interviewees became SRE/RI teachers as they understood the importance of these classes and wished to maintain the tradition.",

Robert Selman (2003) perceives that the school environment, its values and approach is a direct product and reflection of parents' priorities. Again the existence of this alignment was a point raised by a number of our interviewees across the faiths. Parents are actively choosing SRE/RI for their children but are also specifying which faith tradition, which for parents from a Christian background is sometimes one of the Eastern religions rather than Christianity. However, the teachers believed that the parents were making this choice because teaching spiritual and religious values is seen as the core of these classes.",

Hence \"within RE ethics will include 'daily moral dilemmas' linked to different kinds of ethical reasoning\u2026 and ethical concepts\" (Skolverket 2011, p. 180) . Stern claims that \"teaching ethics as part of RE means that ethics education can draw on the richness of religious as well as non-religious traditions\" (p. 139). It also means that \"ethics is assessed as part of RE\" (Stern 2018, 140) . These observations apply to the SRE/RI curricula in Australia, where attendance at these classes is voluntary, depending on parental choice, but they are clearly recognised as adding to the richness of their child's education by a majority of the parent body.",

Our research demonstrates that the Buddhist teachers, in particular, were aware of this challenge and stressed the importance of their students practicing the key messages which they teach in order to transform their behaviour. This applied especially to skills in meditation which the students learn and are encouraged to practice during the week. However, it also applied to other aspects of student behaviour-as one of the teachers expressed it just as in a garden you can have weeds that you do not want, so students are encouraged to \"work on their garden\", on their spiritual behaviour, to ensure that \"weeds\", bad behaviour, do not appear. This allows for the possibility of transformation. Other religious faiths introduce similar approaches, but not always as explicitly. This is an area where more professional development could lead to a better understanding of the key concepts of values education, ensuring that the teaching and learning of values can have more of a long-term effect on the students.",

Similarly Casanova (1994) has analysed the public sphere where, she argues, religion is still a major factor, and Davie (2000) has analysed the new social reality with increasing religious pluralism, again stressing the ongoing role of religion. Teachers believe that this is a factor in parental choice, with even non-religious parents, the \"nones\", choosing to send their children to SRE/RI classes. In this way there is a strong connection between values and beliefs, the search for meaning, spirituality and religious identity (Crawford and Rossiter 2006) .",

Yet, our findings in terms of values education indicate that special religious education is still an important factor in terms of children's socialisation and values education as indicated by parental choice of SRE/RI.

Hill quotes from the 2001 Prime Minister's Science Council report that: In spite of Australia's increasing wealth and generally high level of education many indicators of developmental health and well-being are showing adverse trends amongst children and adolescents. Changes which have occurred include [a marked increase in] family breakdown and blended families, [and the] undervaluing and neglect of children. .. Some of these problems (such as. .. suicide) have trebled over the last 30 years and are higher than at any [previous] time in Australia's history. (p. 2)",
