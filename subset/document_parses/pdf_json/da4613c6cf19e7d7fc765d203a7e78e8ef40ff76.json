Hospital patient flow was simplified in all models; however, some considered more complex patient pathways. One model included fatality ratios with length of stay (LOS) adjustments for survivors versus those who die, and accommodated different LOS for critical care patients with or without a ventilator.

This effort created a 50% increase in ICU capacity. 4 However, the pandemic severely taxed New York hospitals in late March and April 2020. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was scarce, isolation capacity was insufficient, critical resource supply chains were strained, emergency departments were overwhelmed, and unstable patients were transferred between hospitals. 5 In a large medical center in New York City (NYC), 23 .6% of the first 1000 COVID-19 patients were admitted or transferred to an ICU. COVID-19 patients in these ICUs required very long length of stays (LOS) with a median of 23 days. Furthermore, the challenges extended beyond bed capacity; 57.6% of patients admitted to ICU needed a ventilator and 35.2% needed dialysis. 6 Naturally, concerns were reported that deaths due to shortages of ventilators and dialysis machines could have been avoided if hospitals had enough critical equipment and personnel to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients. 5, 7, 8 Planning for resources needed to respond to the COVID-19 virus or future pandemic is based on projecting the number and timing of cases requiring various types of treatment. Several tools were developed to assist hospital administrators, physicians, emergency response personnel, and governmental agencies in this planning process. These tools were typically used to consider a variety of possible scenarios at the beginning of the pandemic. In places where the peak of the first wave had already occurred, hospital surge capacity planning tools can help prepare for future waves. Currently, in the United States, a surge of new COVID-19 cases is occurring in multiple states that have not yet experienced a major first wave but nevertheless have relaxed physical distancing measures. Resumption of large group gatherings and the occurrence of mass protests in many parts of the country may be contributing to the current rise of cases. 9 This study highlights planning models that can be used to estimate hospital capacity requirements due to surges of patients with COVID-19. Typically, for a planning horizon of 1 month or longer, the models can be used to consider different scenarios with different parameters. For each user-defined scenario, these tools identify an epidemic curve of the expected number of COVID-19 cases per day and the expected hospital occupancy per day in medical-surgical wards and ICUs.",

            "text": "Public health officials and hospital leaders worldwide continue to face unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainty existed and still exists about the disease's spread over time. This uncertainty makes resource planning exceptionally difficult. Models used to estimate resource needs are based on assumptions of how a pandemic occurs over time. In particular, parameter values used in a specific scenario represent a user's estimate of a possible way that a pandemic and its response might arise. For example, the age-stratified CDC modeling parameters 22 changed from their earliest iterations in mid-February 2020 to the later COVID-19 Models for Hospital Surge Capacity Planning version in April 2020; the \"true\" values for many parameters relating to COVID-19 hospitalization may still be quite different from the CDC estimates. A recent editorial compared Penn's CHIME model with University of Toronto's CAIC-RT model. Comments include: \"As with hurricanetracking models, they make varying projections; yet in the face of uncertainty, they provide useful real-time forecasts to prepare for the pandemic, as evidenced by their broad use.\" 23 It can be misleading to run a single scenario and report it as a forecast of what is going to happen. Instead, multiple scenarios should be run with a variety of parameter values. The models included in this review would be used as intended only if multiple scenarios are examined. Table 1 provides a summary of the similarities and differences of the 6-hospital surge capacity planning models we reviewed. Three of the models have online interfaces only, 2 have spreadsheet interfaces only, and Cornell's C5V has all 3 versions: an online version, a spreadsheet version, and a desktop version. The University of Toronto's CAIC-RT model is available in English, French, and Spanish, whereas the other 5 models are offered in English only. For most models, the planning horizon is limited to 30 days. Exceptions are versions of Cornell's C5V (the spreadsheet version of which covers pre-and post-peak periods up to 180 days, and the online version of which can model up to 360 days) and the spreadsheet version of the CDC COVID-19Surge that supports a 1-year planning horizon. A longer planning horizon is particularly helpful for modeling an outbreak with multiple waves. Most of the tools provide the option to model a single wave, whereas the online version of Cornell's C5V is the only tool that provides the option to model a second wave.",

The online version of the University of Toronto's CAIC-RT model supports the newer 7-strata age distribution, the spreadsheet and desktop versions of C5V support the older 5 age ranges, and the online version of C5V provides the option to use either 7 age ranges or 5 age ranges. The other 3 models do not include agestratification. Hence, they use the same hospitalization and ICU proportions in their models, regardless of a patient's age. For the epidemic curve, some modelers adopted a mechanistic approach. In some cases, this requires inputting a parameter, called the doubling time: the number of days it takes for cases to double. With the doubling time as a parameter, mechanistic models assume that the number of cases will grow exponentially. For example, Penn Medicine's CHIME model uses a doubling time that is configurable and other parameters are based on estimates and the shape of curves observed at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and Italy. The University of Toronto's CAIC-RT model takes a different approach. Instead of the epidemic curve, the model focuses on identifying the maximum number of patients that the hospital can handle in a surge situation.",
