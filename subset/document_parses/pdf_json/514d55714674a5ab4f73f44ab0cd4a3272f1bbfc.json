Specifically, an agent's decision -to be socially active in the midst of an epidemic -is modeled as a mean-field game with healthrelated costs and activity-related rewards. By considering the fully and partially observed versions of this problem, the role of information in guiding an agent's rational decision is highlighted. The main contributions of the paper are to derive the equations for the mean-field game in both fully and partially observed settings of the problem, to present a complete analysis of the fully observed case, and to present some analytical results for the partially observed case.",

Although modeling proved to be invaluable during the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020), primarily by persuading the reluctant politicians to adopt the harsh lockdown measures [1] , subsequent evolution of the pandemic has shone a harsh spotlight on the simplistic SIR models [2] . This in turn has spurred much work on its enhancements by including additional compartments [3] - [9] , considering the effects of heterogeneity [10] , [11] , and modifying the mean-field interaction terms [12] .",

We want to show that the solution to (12) is the following: \u03c6(a) = k(a \u2212 1) + y if a < a thresh \u03c6(a)a + c(1 \u2212 a) 1+b a \u2212b if a \u2265 a thresh where b := \u03b3 \u03bb AI andand the optimal policy is (10) .For all a < a thresh , we haveand then\u03c6(a) = k(a \u2212 1) + y solves the HJB equation with u = 1. Note that this affine formula uniquely solves (12) with u = 1, since the homogeneous solution blows up at\u0101.With u = 0, we already know that\u03c6(a)a solves (12) and c(1 \u2212 a) 1+b a \u2212b is the homogeneous solution for (12) that makes M(a) (and\u03c6(a)) continuous at a thresh . Next we want to show that M(a) > 0 for all a > a thresh . For a > a thresh , M(a) can be expressed asWe readily observe thatwhere the last inequality follows from a thresh >\u0101 which implies \u2212b > \u2212 \u03b3a thresh \u03bb SA\u03b2 . Therefore it remains to showThe lefthand side of the equation above turns out to be exactly 0. This can be shown asand thus M(a) > 0 for all a > a thresh .Step 2: We now show if \u03bb AI > \u03bb SA\u03b2 , andthen 0 <\u0101 < a thresh < 1. Equation (13) could be rearranged asWriting k asand applying (14) givesSince the second term is positive we obtain\u1fb1 > \u03bb SA\u03b2 k which implies 0 < a thresh < 1. Moreover, the former inequality impliesStep 3: It remains to derive a sufficient condition that \u03bb AI > \u03bb AI (\u03b2) implies (13) whereimplies (13) and doing simple manipulations gives \u03bb AI > \u03bb SA\u03b2 \u03b3 (2 \u2212\u1fb1)\u03b3 + \u03bb SA\u03b2 + \u03bb SA\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb SA\u03b2\u03c6 (i) Therefore \u03bb AI > \u03bb AI (\u03b2) implies (13) .
