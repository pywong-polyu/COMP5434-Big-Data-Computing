            "text": "Testing and vaccination have been major components of the strategy for combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we have developed a quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) IgG antibody assay using a fingerstick dried blood sample. We evaluated the feasibility of using this high-throughput and quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) IgG antibody testing assay in vaccinated individuals. Fingerstick blood samples were collected and analyzed from 137 volunteers before and after receiving the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody could not be detected within the first 7 days after receiving the first vaccine dose, however, the assay reliably detected antibodies from day 14 onwards. In addition, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG antibody was detected in any of the vaccinated or healthy participants, indicating that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay is specific for the mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies. The S1 IgG levels detected in fingerstick samples correlated with the levels found in venous blood plasma samples and with the efficacy of venous blood plasma samples in the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The assay displayed a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.59 \u03bcg/mL and was found to be linear in the range of 0.51-1000 \u03bcg/mL. Finally, its clinical performance displayed a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 0.89-1.00) and a Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) of 100% (95% CI: 0.93-1.00). In summary, the assay described here represents a sensitive, precise, accurate, and simple method for the quantitative detection and monitoring of post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG responses.",

As a result, a number of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed against the S1 protein and have been administered to hundreds of millions of people in the United States alone. Among the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines, the Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) and Moderna vaccines (mRNA-1273) are lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccines directed against the S1 protein, while the Janssen vaccine is an adenovirus (AD26) vector-based vaccine [7] . The time course of antibody responses to vaccinations has shown a gradual increase of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein IgG levels after the first dose of vaccination followed by a rapid response after the second dose [8] . In similar studies conducted on the Astra Zeneca AZD1222, an adenovirus-vectored vaccine targeting the S1 protein (formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), Folegatti et al reported that anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 and were boosted following a second dose. In addition, neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 100% participants when measured in the plaque reduction neutralization test titre (PRNT50). In addition, these neutralizing antibody responses correlated with anti-spike IgG responses as measured by ELISA [9] .",

Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) was reported as not all the samples were within the range of the calibrators. Linearity was demonstrated for the interval of 2448-12000 MFI (0.51-1000 \u00b5g/mL). Taking into consideration the estimates of LoB, LoD, LoQ, precision, and linearity, the analytical measurement range of the assay was determined to span 0.59-1000 \u00b5g/mL.",

As shown in Supplementary Table 6 , no difference in the fluorescence signal (MFI) was observed between Control and EDTA-spike samples (t-test, p > 0.05). For hemoglobin, with positive serum #1, although a significant difference was observed in MFI between Control and Hemoglobin-spike samples (p = 0.01), the difference was only 2.85%, well within the average CV% of within-run precision.

The second dose boosted the S1 IgG levels much higher than the 1000 \u03bcg/mL cut off level for the linearity of the assay. As a result, the raw MFI values are presented for these samples as a semi-quantitative measure of S1 IgG levels. Using these semi-quantitative values, the average IgG concentration was found to increase gradually after the second dose and attain the highest level three months post-vaccination. The levels remained stable five months after vaccination and then decreased slightly seven months post vaccination ( Figure 4 ).

The results from fingerstick blood collected on a flocked dry swab are comparable to fingerstick blood collected into an EDTA tube for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG detection following vaccination. In addition, the fingerstick blood collected on a dried swab also showed a high correlation with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG levels found in venous plasma samples. This approach is more convenient for end users as it does not require venipuncture or a visit to a healthcare facility or a diagnostic laboratory. Furthermore, we have also shown that the fingerstick blood can be successfully applied to a quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay, which can be used for monitoring the antibody response status over time after full vaccination and/or boosters with COVID mRNA vaccines. Our study indicated that 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of mRNA vaccine, a significant amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody can be detected in most individuals (with the exception of three individuals who were all over 80 years old) at an average level of 6.9 \u00b5g/mL. This result is consistent with a recent report, which showed that the antibody response increased up to 1016 AUC on days 13-16, compared to 1 AUC on 0-4 days after receiving the vaccine, as determined by ELISA [8] . In addition, the data also demonstrated that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines appeared to be more efficient in inducing S1 IgG antibody responses than cases of mild asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3) .",

When combined with SARS-CoV-2 N protein-coupled microspheres, the assay can be used to distinguish vaccinated individuals from those with a prior infection as the SARS-CoV-2 S1 mRNA vaccines stimulate only an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody response and not an anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein IgG antibody response. In addition, we observed that anti-S1 IgG and anti-N protein IgG levels were similar in COVID-19 recovered individuals, whereas anti-S1 IgG levels were higher than anti-N protein IgG in COVID-19 recovered individuals who had also been vaccinated. Therefore, this test could be useful for identifying vaccinated individuals vs COVID-19 recovered individuals vs COVID-19 recovered + vaccinated individuals if the sample is simultaneously tested for both anti-S1 and anti-N antibodies.",

In general. the antibody became detectable 2 weeks after the first dose, averaging 5000 MFI and increased to about 12,000-13,000 MFI by 7-8 weeks (i.e. 3-4 weeks after second vaccine dose, Figure 4 ). Interestingly, one individual infected with COVID-19 in 2020 showed IgG signal intensity that increased from 1,300 MFI to over 15,000 MFI within 1 week after the first dose of vaccination in early 2021 (data not shown here). This is in agreement with previous observations that seropositive individuals have higher responses after the first dose [8, 22, 23] . Marot et al [24] reported that anti-S1 IgG and anti-S1-RBD IgG antibody levels in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients did not change significantly between 3 weeks and 3 months, despite a slight increase at 2 months. Based on our data, the vaccine induced S1 IgG antibody responses appear to follow the same course, reaching 12,000 MFI to 13,000 MFI 6-8 weeks after receiving vaccine and staying at 14,000 MFI by 15 weeks, followed by gradual decline in levels. Interestingly, Moderna vaccinated individuals on average displayed higher S1 IgG levels than those vaccinated with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. This data agrees with a recent report that demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity with the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared to the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer BioNTech) [25] .",

In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (PRNT50) assay has demonstrated a significant correlation with antibody levels (including anti-S1-RBD IgG) as measured by immunoassays [27] . Our anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG data from the fingerstick blood assay also showed a close correlation with the results of the SAES-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Previous studies have found an average PRNT50 NT 50 value of about 451 for vaccinated people [20] . This is consistent with what we observed, with individuals who had fingerstick blood IgG levels of 2,944 MFI and 8,408 MFI showing PRNT50 NT 50 values of 415 and 596, respectively. Given the fact that after the first dose, vaccinated people displayed an average IgG of 4,000 -5,000 MFI, we estimate that they should have PRNT50 NT 50 values above 451. Taken together, high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies detected by immunoassays could indicate protective immunity against SARS-COV-2.",
