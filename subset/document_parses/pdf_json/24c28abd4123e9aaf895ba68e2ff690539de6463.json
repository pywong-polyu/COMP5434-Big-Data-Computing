Therefore, in this study, we sought to evaluate the potential of Poly6 as a novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor in the human bronchial epithelial cell line, Calu-3, mainly focusing on enhanced IFN-I production. (E) Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 1 MOI, and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. (F) Evaluation of the antiviral efficacy of Poly6, RDV, and HCQ in Calu-3 cells via SARS-CoV-2 NP expression immunofluorescence assay. Calu-3 cells were treated with Poly6 (10 \u00b5M) and two reference drugs, RDV (4 \u00b5M) and HCQ (100 \u00b5M), following SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.1 MOI). At 24 hpi, the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by each drug was measured on the basis of the immunofluorescence of the NP. Nuclei are shown in blue (labeled with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and NP is shown in green (Alexa 488). Scale bar: 100 \u00b5m. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice for confirmation. ** indicates p < 0.01, and *** indicates p < 0.001. The results are presented as mean values \u00b1 SD. Abbreviations: RDV, remdesivir, HCQ, hydroxychloroquine sulfate.",

We found that Poly6 treatment showed inhibitory efficacy, with an IC50 value of 2.617 \u00b5M ( Figure 1C ). To further investigate the antiviral effect of Poly6 against SARS-CoV-2 at the translational level, we performed western blot assays to detect the NP and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Our western blot data consistently showed that Poly6 has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, almost comparable to that of a potent reference drug, RDV ( Figure 1D ). The infection of Calu-3 cells and the anti-viral effects of Poly6 and RDV were further monitored by staining the cells with an antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 NP, analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells were infected with the virus for 1 h at 1 MOI, and the drug-or PBS-treated cells were incubated for 24 h. As shown in Figure 1E , infected cells at a high MOI (=1) yielded infection rates as high as approximately 90%, and treatment of the cells with RDV or Poly6 reduced the percentage of infected cells by approximately 20%.

Therefore, we further investigated the antiviral mechanism of Poly6, focusing on IFN-I as a potential antiviral signaling molecule. Consistent with our previous study, Poly6 strongly increased the mRNA level of human IFN-\u03b2 in Calu-3 cells in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 4B ). Next, IFN-I signaling induced by Poly6 was investigated following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that Poly6 dramatically increased the transcription level of human IFN-\u03b2 genes in a dose-dependent manner compared to RDV and HCQ ( Figure 4C ). Furthermore, we sought to check the transcriptional changes in IFN-I-related genes following treatment with Poly6. To this end, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and infected cells subjected to treatment with Poly6 (12 hpi). We found that transcription of more than 40 IFN-I-related genes, including IFIH1, IFNb1, IFNA1, IFNA4, IRF3, IRF9, TYK2, IFIT2, STAT1, IFI16, JAK1, and IFI6, was upregulated ( Figure 4D and Figure S4A ). We then measured the protein expression levels of two critical genes related to IFN-I signaling, i.e., IRF3 and STAT1. Treatment with Poly6 following SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 and phosphorylated STAT-1, suggesting that the antiviral effect of Poly6 against SARS-COV-2 could be exerted via the IRF3-IFN-I axis ( Figure 4E ). To further clarify the IFN-I-dependent anti-viral effects of Poly6, two IFN-I signaling inhibitors were used. Calu-3 cells were pre-treated with ruxolitinib, targeting JAK/STAT signaling induced by IFN-I or III, and AZD1480, a potent JAK1 inhibitor, and Poly6 or RDV were treated, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that ruxolitinib and AZD1480 treatments significantly reversed the reduced virus replication level induced by Poly6 treatment, but not in the RDV group ( Figure 4F ). We also assayed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of Poly6 after treatment with an IFN receptor-neutralizing antibody (IFNAR1). As expected, the antiviral effects of Poly6 against SARS-CoV-2 were also recovered in the IFNAR1-blocking group ( Figure 4G ). Together, our data indicate that Poly6 exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in an IFN-I-dependent manner in Calu-3 cells.",

Therefore, significant efforts are currently underway to identify pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe cases [21] [22] [23] . Several studies have reported the usefulness of anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with severe COVID-19 [24, 25] . In our transcription profile assay, treatment with Poly6 downregulated pro-inflammatory genes encoding cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 (and relevant STAT3) and VEGFA, which were highly upregulated following SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 5A ). To check whether Poly6 alleviates elevated IL-6 production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection at the translational level, we measured the amount of IL-6 in the supernatant collected from Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated them with Poly6. Accordingly, IL-6 levels were highly elevated by infection with SARS-CoV-2 but mitigated to the average cell level after treatment with Poly6 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5B ).",

In contrast to the two reference drugs, RDV and HCQ, we failed to find evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of Poly6 in the Vero-E6 system by RT-qPCR and plaque assay ( Figure S2) , indicating that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of Poly6 is IFN-I dependent. Of note, we also found that the Poly-6-induced antiviral effect was recovered when inhibitors interfering with IFN-I signaling or blocking Abs were administered, further proving its dependence on IFN-I signaling ( Figure 4F-G) .",

Therefore, IFN-Is have been widely applied to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) [5] , familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) [43] , and Behcet's syndrome [44] . In this study, our transcription profile assay indicated that Poly6 treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells led to the upregulation of the genes STAT1, IRF3, IRF9, JAK1, and IFI16 ( Figure 4D and Figure S4 ) and of two immunosuppressive molecules, IL-10 and SOCS-1, but to the downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. We then confirmed that the downregulation of IL-6 production or transcription of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 induced by Poly6 was recovered by treatment with an IFN-I inhibitor or blocking Abs, due to further blocked type I IFN signals, which are regulators of IL-1 production [45] , suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of Poly6 is also dependent on IFN-I signaling.",
