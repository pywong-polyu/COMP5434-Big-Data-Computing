Previous research has found that certain attitudes and behaviors potentially result in COVID-19 transmission. The Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) conceptual framework has been extensively used throughout the literature as a framework to guide data collection on context-specific public health issues. Knowledge and Attitudes are related to health practices and KAP surveys help to illuminate the relationships between these constructs. Here, knowledge is understood as familiarity with various health topics, thereby relating it to one's health behavior and motivation. Attitudes include components of effect and cognition and these interact with the knowledge to influence behavioral decisions.",

Now, a brief discussion on the linear relationship between CovOp and CovBh is in order. As can be observed from the definitions of these two scores (SI Supplementary Materials), both are calculated based on questions related to lockdown and related measures, but the questions were posed from different angles: one from a governmental intervention perspective and the other from a personal behavior perspective. Consequently, while their linear relationship is quite meaningful, analyzing the two scores is not redundant as they jointly can reveal some interesting insight. For example, the somewhat lower PCC value of 0.67 suggests that people tend to opine/behave differently in a personal vs. government context. Further analysis in this context could be interesting with more data.",

In particular, other studies publishing that stress related to COVID-19 tends to be highest among females who do not have formal education are also consistent with our findings [39, 40] . In terms of age and educational level as significantly predicted by our study, recent literature also suggests that education level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association with knowledge about COVID-19 [41] . However, COVID-19-related lockdowns in participants' cities of residence, social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in health care providers were found to be protective factors of participants' intentions to seek help from mental health services, and this is consistent with our susceptibility score [42] . Similar to our findings, the more recent findings have also consistently confirmed strong associations between the pandemic and increased psychosomatic symptoms and negative emotions [43] . This trend is particularly true for females since psychosocial distress as a result of the pandemic has affected females more than males [44, 45] . In addition to the elderly as a vulnerable group during the pandemic, other published studies and our findings also indicate a need for the design and implementation of psychological interventions for vulnerable populations during COVID-19 [46] . Given the rapidly developing situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, support initiatives grounded in research evidence are essential for maintaining the mental wellbeing and resilience of vulnerable groups. While our study attempted to overcome some limitations of previous studies, it also suffered from the limitation of a limited sample size. Consequently, although originally designed as a global study, we had to limit our analysis to eight countries for which the sample sizes were acceptable for a meaningful analysis. Furthermore, it is likely that our study did not obtain data from a diversified population.",

Furthermore, this relationship results in negative psychological and behavioral responses to the challenges the pandemic presents. Our findings suggest that greater encouragement from the government health authorities alongside the promotion of health education and policies are essential in disseminating of COVID-19-awareness and increased control of the spread of COVID-19.
