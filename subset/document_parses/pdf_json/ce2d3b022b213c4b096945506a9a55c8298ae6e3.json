An elevated IFN\u03b1 signature has been associated with clinically observed neuro-behavioural deficits such as mild cognitive impairment, fatigue, depression and psychosis in these diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric symptoms remain largely unknown, and it is as yet unclear how IFN\u03b1 signalling might influence central nervous system (CNS) function. Aberrant microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and function has recently been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, but whether and how IFN\u03b1 modulates these functions are not well defined.",

Bulk RNA sequencing on sorted microglia from wild type and microglia-specific Ifnar1 conditional knockout mice was performed to evaluate IFN\u03b1 and IFNAR signalling-dependent changes in gene expression. Furthermore, the effects of IFN\u03b1 on microglia morphology and synapse engulfment were assessed, via immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Results: We found that IFN\u03b1 exposure through the periphery induces a unique gene signature in microglia that includes the expected upregulation of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), as well as the complement component C4b. We additionally characterized several IFN\u03b1-dependent changes in microglial phenotype, including expression of CD45 and CD68, cellular morphology and presynaptic engulfment, that reveal subtle brain regionspecific differences. Finally, by specifically knocking down expression of IFNAR1 on microglia, we show that these changes are largely attributable to direct IFNAR signalling on microglia and not from indirect signalling effects through other CNS parenchymal cell types which are capable of IFN\u03b1-IFNAR signal transduction.",

            "text": "Type 1 interferons are a family of cytokines classically implicated in antiviral defence, but also play important pathological roles when their expression is dysregulated, such as in the autoimmune diseases Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [1, 2] . Interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) belongs to the type 1 interferon family, which also include IFN\u03b2 and other lesser studied IFNs; it comprises 14 different isoforms in mice and 13 in humans that are highly conserved in gene structure and amino acid sequence [3] . All type 1 interferons signal through the type 1 interferon receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which dimerize upon ligand binding and activate the JAK1 and TYK2 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Canonically, these RTKs phosphorylate the STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors resulting in their translocation into the nucleus, where, with IRF9 they form the transcription factor complex ISGF3. ISGF3 binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) on promoters, inducing gene expression programmes involving interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are commonly antiviral and antiproliferative [3, 4] . Interestingly, the ISG expression landscape differs across cell types in a manner that is dependent on signalling strength and chronicity, as well as the activation of other non-canonical signalling machinery, resulting in functionally distinct outcomes [3, 4] .",

Aberrant microglial function linked to dysregulated synaptic pruning has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) [14, 15] , schizophrenia [16] and autism spectrum disease [17, 18] . Furthermore, microglia have been shown to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that negatively impact neurogenesis and influence depressive behaviour in response to peripherally derived IFN\u03b1 [19] , and dysregulation of IFNAR signalling in white matter microglia via genetic attenuation of its negative regulator Usp18 causes destructive microgliopathy in the brain [20] . Interestingly, recent sequencing studies have identified a microglial type 1 IFN gene signature in the contexts of ageing [21, 22] , Alzheimer's disease [15, 23] and SLE [24] , suggesting a potential unifying role of type 1 IFN signalling in propagating the neurological and neuropsychiatric pathologies in these variable pathological contexts. However, despite the increasingly appreciated role of IFN\u03b1 in inflammation-associated CNS pathology, it is still unclear how IFN\u03b1 regulates microglial function, and whether it might influence microglia-mediated synaptic pruning as a potential mechanism in driving IFN\u03b1associated neuropsychiatric disease.",

To model acute type 1 interferonmediated inflammation, mice were injected daily for 7 days (Fig. 1a) , and a dose-dependent, titratable effect on interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression both in the spleen (Fig. 1b) and in perfused cortical tissue from the brain (Fig. 1c ) was observed. A working dose of 10 ng mIFN\u03b1/g of body weight was selected and used for all further experiments, which is of similar dosage used in previous studies and also within the relative dose range that has been used therapeutically in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection or various cancers [19, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Furthermore, serum concentrations of mIFN\u03b1 averaged at around 200 pg/mL 3 h post final injection using this dosing schedule (Fig. 1d) , indicating a roughly 600-fold decrease in bioavailability at this time point, assuming a total blood volume of 2 mL for a 25-g male mouse. Given the induced ISG signature, we observed in the spleen and brain cortex at this same time point, it is reasonable to assume that at least part of this large decrease in bioavailability was due to cellular or tissue consumption and signal transduction of mIFN\u03b1 as manifested by their ISG signature.",

Inset in each image shows an example of ISG negative or positive microglia. f, g Quantitative analysis of RNAscope data showing significant ISG enrichment in both microglia (Tmem119 positive) and non-microglia (Tmem119 negative) cell types with mIFN\u03b1 exposure (N = 6 per condition). Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test, assessed by normality of data distribution prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices [40] [41] [42] . Therefore, in order to further investigate mIFN\u03b1-induced genetic changes in microglia in a behaviourally relevant brain region, bulk RNA sequencing on sorted microglia from the anterior cortex spanning the frontal, motor and part of the somatosensory cortices (Supplementary Figure 1) was performed. Analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes revealed the expected upregulation of many ISGs, as well as a few members of the complement gene family, in particular C4b (Fig. 2a) . Additionally, mIFN\u03b1 treatment also altered the expression profile of several microglial cytokine and sensome [44] genes (Supplementary Figures 1D,  E) , the latter being previously defined as a set of protein encoding genes that function as sensors of endogenous ligands and microbes. We next performed gene ontology (GO) analysis using gProfiler2 [31] to identify functional pathways altered by mIFN\u03b1 (Fig. 2b) . As expected, type 1 IFN response pathways, which included the phagocytic and class 1 MHC antigen presentation programmes, were found to be significantly altered. Many significantly altered GO terms relating to cellular metabolism, which included the terms \"autophagy\" and \"cellular catabolic process\", were also observed. Finally, the increased expression of some of the identified DE genes was validated by ddPCR of sorted cortical microglia from mIFN\u03b1-treated mice (Fig. 2c) . Aberrant synapse pruning by microglia has been implicated in both neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease [14, 17] , and it remains unclear whether acute exposure to mIFN\u03b1 would result in any changes to microglia-mediated synapse pruning. It has been previously shown that peripheral IFN\u03b1 injection induces an enriched ISG signature in the hippocampus and cerebellum compared to other anatomical regions in the rodent brain [33] . Given the known associations of these brain regions to the cognitive deficiencies and anxiety behaviours associated with IFN\u03b1 treatment [45] [46] [47] [48] , microgliamediated synaptic engulfment was assessed in the hippocampus and cerebellum in addition to the frontal cortex, which has also been implicated in these sickness behaviours [46, 49] . Using a flow cytometry-based method to detect intracellular presynaptic particles (SV2) within microglia (Supplementary Figure 2) , it was found that peripheral mIFN\u03b1 treatment only modestly increased intracellular SV2 in cerebellar microglia, but not in microglia from either the frontal cortex or hippocampus (Fig. 3a) . To ascertain if there were any changes in expression of Fig. 2 Transcriptional profiling of mIFN\u03b1 exposed microglia. a Volcano plot showing highlights of differentially expressed (DE) genes from bulk RNA sequencing of sorted cortical microglia. Interferon-stimulated genes were identified based on querying the Interferome 2.0 database [43] with the DE gene list. q, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value. Dotted lines demarcate q = 0.01 and fold change = 2.5. b A selection of differential gene ontology pathways identified using gProfiler2 [31] enriched in mIFN\u03b1 exposed microglia. c Validation of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by ddPCR on sorted cortical microglia from an independently treated cohort of mice. N = 6 for all data shown. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; Student's t test markers of microglial activation, flow cytometric analyses of CD68 and CD45 expression levels, which are associated with microglial activation and inhibition of activation, respectively [50, 51] , were performed. There was a statistically significant decrease in CD68 expression in microglia from both the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and a trend towards decreased expression in the cerebellum (Fig. 3b) . CD45 expression was significantly increased in all 3 brain regions assayed (Fig. 3b) , suggesting a classically defined hypo-activated microglial state. Furthermore, immunohistological analyses of microglial morphology suggested a unique mIFN\u03b1-induced morphological state, with microglia displaying significantly increased soma size (associated with microglial activation), and a trend towards increased cell perimeter, which was used as a proxy measure for process ramification (Fig. 3c, d) . These results suggest the possibility that acute mIFN\u03b1 exposure induces a unique phenotypic state within microglia that displays subtle brain region-specific variability, which could potentially be due to region-specific levels of immune signalling module expression in microglia [52] .",

Indeed, significant gene expression upregulation of several of these cytokines and chemokines in mIFN\u03b1-exposed microglia were observed (Supplementary Figure 1E) , which could potentially contribute towards autocrine signalling effects. Furthermore, many ISGs can also be cross regulated by distinct signalling pathways downstream of other cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 [54] [55] [56] [57] . Given the increased expression of some of these cytokines in response to IFN\u03b1 (Supplementary Figure 1E) , it is possible that the observed canonical ISG signature is additionally derived in part by other cytokine signalling pathways.",

Gene expression differences were further characterized by RNA sequencing and showed an expected strong upregulation of genes associated with type 1 interferon signalling. Interestingly, we also found a strong increase in expression of the complement component C4b, which has previously been observed in the contexts of viral infection [61] and ageing [21, 23] , in microglia that also concurrently express a strong type 1 interferon signature. In particular, we also show that IFNAR signalling on microglia results in a unique phenotype characterized by subtle morphological changes and changes in the classical activation markers CD45 and CD68 in a regionspecific manner.

            "text": "It is increasingly appreciated that the complement pathway might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative [14] and neuropsychiatric [16] diseases and that it is also a driver of synapse loss in viral infection-associated cognitive decline [25] . In particular, recent studies have shown that overexpression of mouse C4 within the mouse prefrontal cortex or human C4A in the whole brain is sufficient to induce increased microglial synaptic pruning that results in impaired social behaviour [62] . We observed a modest, but statistically significant, increase in microglial presynaptic engulfment in the cerebellum, but not frontal cortex and hippocampus. While our RNA sequencing and ddPCR validation studies showed an mIFN\u03b1-induced increase in C4b expression on sorted anterior cortex microglia, it is likely that cerebellar microglia also increase C4b expression in response to mIFN\u03b1, given that at baseline they are in a more \"immunologically vigilant\" state with an enriched type 1 IFN regulatory signature, compared to cortical and hippocampal microglia [52] . The increase in presynaptic engulfment by cerebellar microglia compared to microglia from the other brain regions could thus be due to an enhanced signalling response to mIFN\u03b1, a facet of which could include higher C4b expression. Additionally, it is probable that within an acute period of mIFN\u03b1 exposure, most neurons or synapses [58] . Venn diagram sizes are proportional to the numerical values in each category. c Overlap of independently identified gene ontology pathways. Venn diagram sizes are proportional to the numerical values in each category. d A selection of differential gene ontology pathways identified using gProfiler2 [31] enriched in mIFN\u03b1 exposed Ifnar1 sufficient and deficient microglia still express sufficient signals to prohibit synaptic engulfment, such as CD47 [63] and other complement regulatory factors. These regulatory signals and factors could be differentially distributed throughout different regions of the murine brain, resulting in differing levels of inhibition of complement activation and deposition. It should also be noted that our flow cytometric assay for synapse engulfment does not take into account any potential differences in the process of cargo degradation within the phagocytic pathway, although no significant differences in SV2 signal were observed when wild type, cortical microglia were exposed to chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification and acid-sensitive lysosomal proteases (data not shown). Furthermore, a previous study did not observe any differences in sensorimotor behaviour of mice injected daily with mIFN\u03b1 for up to 5 weeks at a similar dose [32] , which suggests that the small increase in synaptic engulfment we observe in the cerebellum might be phenotypically insignificant. However, it is possible that chronic IFNAR signalling within microglia and other CNS cell types could result in elevated C4 production and decreased complement and phagocytic inhibitory factors that over time could lead to the pathologic pruning of synapses. Of note, it was shown in the same study that chronic IFN\u03b1 exposure (~4-5 weeks) in mice adversely affected neurogenesis and resulted in depressive behaviour [32] . Notably, endogenous IFN\u03b1 can biochemically, and presumably functionally, cross signal through \u03bc-opioid receptors to exert anti-nociceptive effects [64, 65] . It would therefore also be possible that the pathological effects of IFN\u03b1 are mediated in part, or in tandem, through these secondary, or non-IFNAR signalling related processes.",

            "text": "In summary, we show that peripherally derived IFN\u03b1 is able to signal directly across the BBB through microglial IFNAR. This results in a unique genetic and phenotypic profile that is primarily dependent on IFNAR signalling with minimal contribution from other secondary cytokine or chemokine signalling pathways. IFN\u03b1-induced upregulation of C4b and other ISGs might regulate various cellular functions and processes such as synaptic pruning in a brain region-dependent manner. These findings would be of further investigative interest given the long-standing association of endogenous and therapeutic IFN\u03b1 with neuropsychiatric symptoms and the emerging therapeutic interest in IFN\u03b1 use for prophylactic treatment of COVID19 [69] [70] [71] .",
