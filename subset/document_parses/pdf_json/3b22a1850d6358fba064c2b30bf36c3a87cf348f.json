COVID-19 can cause symptoms that range from mild to life-threatening. The etiologic agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, infects primarily the respiratory tract of humans, causing different symptoms that range from mild-to-moderate (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, anosmia, and ageusia) to significant hypoxia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe pneumonia [2] . Various factors increase the severity of the disease, disease rate progression, and mortality rate [3] , including demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, pregnancy, post-menopause, poverty, crowding) and certain underlying medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity). These factors might represent key factors in allowing subsequent viral replication and exacerbating inflammatory and immune-pathological responses [4, 5] . Notably, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have also been documented with COVID-19, indicating that the gastrointestinal tract might also be a site of infection [6, 7] . It has been suggested that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms might be associated with a faster reduction of the viral load through fecal shedding, which was partially suspected in resulting in better outcomes [8] .",

Given that antiviral immunity is needed to neutralize the virus, inhibit viral replication, and promote the recovery of patients, severe COVID-19 cases may be associated with a dysregulated immune and inflammatory response [10, 11] . High mortality rates were associated with cytokine storms; an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines that promotes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and extensive tissue damage, resulting in life-threatening conditions [12] . Furthermore, previous studies suggested that the nutrition status played a pivotal role in the progression of COVID-19 disease [13, 14] . A hypothesis suggested that hyperinflammation and cytokine storms observed in severe COVID-19 cases are associated with an increase in nutrition acquisition, which may contribute to lipotoxicity and damage in non-adipose tissues, particularly in obese patients or individuals with metabolic syndromes [15] .",

Non-pharmaceutical prophylactic approaches (such as mask-wearing, washing hands, and physical distancing measures) and COVID-19 vaccines might reduce the amount of virus circulating in and between individuals [17] [18] [19] . However, decreasing viral loads might not affect disease severity in secondary cases [20] . Therefore, despite the recent development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 continues to be problematic, and the probability of exposure to the virus and contracting the disease remains significant across the globe. Notably, vaccinated individuals could potentially still get COVID-19 and transmit live viruses from the upper respiratory tract to others [21] . New variants have rapidly emerged and become dominant worldwide, i.e., the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant causes more infections and spreads faster than earlier forms of the SARS-CoV-2 [22] . These new variants might also be able to escape from vaccine-induced immunity and other treatment strategies (such as Bamlanivimab/etesevimab). Furthermore, recent data highlighted the strong selective pressure imposed by convalescent plasma therapy, potentially leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with a reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in immunosuppressed individuals [23] . Indeed, many aspects of the biology of the virus, its evolution and the epidemiology and ramifications of the disease remain unknown and unpredictable. This is very relevant when evaluating the evolution of the disease in lowresource countries where vaccination rates are predicted to be slow. Taken together, these concerns highlight the need to further investigate COVID-19 symptoms, outcomes, exposure, and severity, especially in developed countries with challenges in medical capacity and pandemic preparedness.",

            "text": "It has been widely suggested that after infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients may sometimes develop gastrointestinal symptoms [24] . This is not surprising, given that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that is expressed on the surface of the epithelial cells that line different organs, including lungs, kidneys, heart, but also the small intestine. Furthermore, it is predicted that altered gut microbiota and associated leaky gut might contribute to severe COVID-19 illness [5] . After all, the gut microbiota provides a wideranging essential health benefits and protection to the host [25] . For example, the gut microbiota is known to significantly regulate immune homeostasis through modulating the development and function of the innate and adaptive immune system [26] . Recent studies on gut microbiota suggested that an alteration in the intestinal microbiota composition (i.e., dysbiosis) contributes to various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [27] . Subsequently, in COVID-19 infections, gut microbiota dysbiosis might play a critical role in determining the clinical outcome of cases with underlying comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity [28] . For instance, gut microbiota diversity is generally decreased among elders, and COVID-19 has been more severe and fatal in this susceptible population which highlights a potential role of the gut microbiota in this disease [29] . In this respect, it was suggested that COVID-19 patients are depleted of gut bacteria with known immunomodulatory potential [30] . A recent report showed that poor gut health might adversely affect COVID-19 prognosis by enabling SARS-CoV-2 to leak into the circulatory system and access the surface of the digestive tract and internal organs [5] . Additionally, the inflammation induced by gut dysbiosis represents an important mediator in cardiometabolic and diabetic pathogenesis and could contribute to aggravated COVID-19 in the most vulnerable patients [31] . Given that diet plays a critical role in modulating the gut microbiota, there has been a serious interest in evaluating the health benefits and disease-preventing properties of diet and dietary habits and their association with a favorable patient outcome [32, 33] .",

However, COVID-19 patients can be highly contagious, and the investigations of gut microbiota in these patients have been secondary, understandably due to urgency in treating patients and the many challenges of combating a novel virus or disease in a pandemic. Therefore, investigations into COVID-19 and gut health are scarce and have not fully analyzed possible associations between gut health and disease pathophysiology. Consequently, the current study particularly aimed to demonstrate a potential association between poor gut health and COVID-19 severe symptoms in the Lebanese community. It should be noted that in parallel to the emergence and spread of the COVID-19, Lebanon has been facing tremendous economic and medical crises, including shortage in healthcare workers, medical supplies, and equipment, together with vaccines in all hospitals across the country. Importantly, Lebanon is currently hosting~1.5 million Syrian displaced people and~0.5 million Palestinian refugees, while the total number of poor among the Lebanese population is currently estimated to be~2.7 million. Given that these populations are known to be susceptible to COVID-19 and the situation of great concern in Lebanon [ 34, 35] , it appears thus important to address COVID-19 in this developing country with severe challenges.",

About two-thirds (62%) of the participants were overweight or obese, and the majority do not take any chronic medications (71%). Moreover, none reported the use of antibiotics. Gut problems were reported by 22.7% of the study participants. Each gut health score item independently was not significantly linked to COVID-19 symptoms except for excessive sugar or fast-food intake; however, participants who reported unhealthy food intake were more likely to experience severe symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = 0.118, p-value 0.049). When all items were taken into consideration, a negative correlation was observed between gut health score and COVID-19 symptoms, where lowest gut health scores were associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = -0.153, p-value 0.004). Table 4 summarized the description of other variables including the participants' medical history, other dietary and lifestyle variables and post-COVID-19 infection variables, and their association with COVID-19 symptoms. Most of the participants (85.9%) had a positive blood rhesus factor and had no history of chronic diseases (80%). Neither rhesus factor nor chronic disease history had an association with COVID-19 severity at the bivariate level. About half of the study participants had 0 or 1 episode of flu-like symptoms per year, and 27% and 21.2% experienced 2 and 3 or more episodes of flu-like symptoms per year, respectively. The bivariate analysis showed that the higher the number of flu-like illness episodes the worse the COVID-19 symptoms (Kendall's tau-b = 0.194, p-value 0.001). Thirty-four percent (45/132) of those who reported a flu-like illness count of \ufffd1 per year did not experience any symptoms compared to 11.6% (8/69) and 16.7% (9/54) for those reporting 2 and 3 or more flu-like illness count per year, respectively. Also, vomiting and diarrhea count were recorded but no linear trend was shown with COVID-19 symptoms. About two-thirds (68.6%) of the study participants reported regularly drinking tea or coffee and a negative correlation was detected with COVID-19 symptom at the crude level. The proportion of participants who did not experience any symptoms was higher among coffee or tea drinkers (28.6% vs 15% for non-tea or coffee drinkers). Furthermore, coffee or tea drinkers experienced less severe symptoms (21.7% vs 30% for non-tea or coffee drinkers). About 1 in 4 (26.9%) of participants who experienced any COVID-19 symptoms reported having residual symptoms after recovery including fatigue (44.2%), anosmia (21.2%), and cough (17.3%) (S2 Table) . No association between residual symptoms and COVID-19 severity was observed at the bivariate level. Although only 16.7% of participants reported not taking precautionary measures post-COVID-19 infection, a positive correlation was found between this variable and COVID-19 symptoms, where the higher the level of COVID-19 symptoms experienced the less likely it is that the participant was taking precautionary measures post-recovery ( Table 4 ).",

However, coffee or tea consumption association with COVID-19 symptoms was lost after adjustments in model 3. Regarding gut health, after the adjustment for potential confounders in model 3, the statistical analysis showed that for every level increase in gut health (better overall gut health) the chances of having worse COVID-19 symptoms (that is having mild/moderate or severe symptoms vs no symptoms or having severe symptoms vs either no symptoms or mild/moderate symptoms) decreases by 33%. Forty-three percent of the study participants were smokers, and no linear trend was detected between smoking and COVID-19 symptoms. However, when comparing participants who experienced any symptoms (mild/moderate or severe combined) vs those who did not experience any, the latter group was more likely to be smokers (and this association remained even after adjusting for potential confounders) ( Table 6) . Interestingly, in contrary to the comparison between the three levels of COVID-19 symptoms (absence, mild-to-moderate, and severe symptoms), coffee or tea consumption association with COVID-19 symptoms has remained significant after the comparison of COVID-19 symptoms (absence vs presence) using simple and multiple logistic regression analyses (Table 6 ).",

This could be attributed to the fact that the participants in this study were mainly young adults (the mean age of the population is 38.3, with an age range from 16 to 85) who normally express lower physical COVID-19 symptoms. Additionally, COVID-19 related death cases were not included in this study [37] . Regarding symptomatic patients, 68% and 32% showed mild-tomoderate and severe symptoms, respectively. Globally, the most prevalent features in patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was fever; experienced by 49% of patients [37, 38] . While dry cough and diarrhea were less commonly reported, anosmia and dysgeusia seem to be frequent findings among COVID-19 patients in this investigation. The data emphasized that the onset of loss of smell and taste symptoms, particularly in the absence of symptoms indicative of nasal obstruction, is a strong indicator for a diagnosis of COVID-19 [39] . Furthermore, dyspnea was the most prevalent severe symptom observed among the included population. This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that patients who are hospitalized with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have shortness of breath [40] [41] [42] . In addition to the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and biological differences in factors such as immune regulation may be associated with COVID-19 disease manifestation, susceptibility, and progression [43] . Gut microbiota is crucial to maintain an anti-inflammatory and healthy environment in the digestive tract ecosystem [44] . The microbiota contributes to the development of the immune system, protecting humans from infectious diseases [45] . The alteration in the intestinal microbiota has been associated with several pathologies, such as obesity, inflammatory bowel syndrome, cancer, and autoimmune diseases [46, 47] . There are numerous factors leading to gut dysbiosis such as aging [48] , diet [49] , chronic medical conditions [50] , probiotic supplementation [51] , and antimicrobial use [52] , which subsequently affects host health. For instance, the gut microbiota of elderly people is rich with pro-inflammatory bacteria at the expense of beneficial microorganisms [48] . Gut dysbiosis could lead to serious chronic inflammation and mucosal tissue damage which increase the risk of developing serious infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections [53] . Unfortunately, few studies explored the association between the gut microbiota status and COVID-19 severity, clinical complications, and related death. However, available literature predicted that the unhealthy status of gut microbiota might represent an underscored risk factor [5, 30, 54] .",

            "text": "Although the determination of gut composition and health status by using biological approaches such as metagenomic analysis is possible, there are many obstacles to reach definitive outcomes. These include the difficulty of taking stool samples from COVID-19 patients who are contagious and therapy which could have effect on patients' microbiota. Therefore, epidemiological studies can be a relevant alternative and can use advanced statistics to provide evidence on potential associations. For this purpose, this study has established a comprehensive gut health score reflecting patients' behavior and gut health status. The first indicator of a potential healthy gut microbiota is the quality of food [55] . Participants were therefore asked about the consumption of healthy and unhealthy food. The non-compliance of regular consumption of dietary fiber has a negative effect on the health status and diversity of gut microbiota [56] , and could be associated with the degradation of the colonic mucus barrier on the gut epithelial lining [57] . In contrast, ingestion of dietary fiber sources stimulates microbial proliferation and produces microbially derived end products such as short-chain fatty acids [58] . These compounds support gut health through a number of local effects, including the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity, production of mucus, protection versus inflammation, and diminishing the risk of colorectal cancer [59] . Moreover, the consumption of either fermented food (e.g., milk, yogurt, pickles, and cheese) or the intake of probiotic and prebiotic supplements have a positive impact on gut health [60] . In contrast, high dietary sugar or processed food were found to decrease gut microbiota diversity [61] , stimulate the overgrowth of gut pathobionts and their virulence factors [62, 63] , and potentially lead to metabolic disorders [64, 65] . Besides the dietary intake indicator, the gut health score depended on body mass index that predicts overweight and obesity and on the use of chronic medications and the occurrence of gut problems. The gut microbiota of overweight and obese individuals are characterized by specific alterations in the composition and function of the intestinal human microbiota compared to healthy individuals [66] . Furthermore, the chronic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), anti-diabetes, anti-obesity non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, and antidepression drugs has direct effects on gut microbiota composition and consequently on gut health [67] . Similar observations were reported in the literature among individuals suffering from gut diseases such as IBS, ulcer, chronic constipation, among others [68] [69] [70] .",

            "text": "To our knowledge, the present study represents the first report describing a significant association between poor gut health score and severe COVID-19 symptoms among Lebanese patients. Although this study did not include COVID-19-related death cases, due to the retrospective design which decreased the percentage of severe cases, COVID-19 severe symptoms were still more common among patients with poor gut health scores. Neither the age nor the gender of the study population was associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Only patients eating unhealthy food or having a low gut health score presented more severe manifestations. Logistic regression models confirmed that poor gut health status was significantly associated with the presence of COVID-19 related symptoms (OR: 1.33, 95%CI: 1.03-1.72; P = 0.029) and their severity (OR: 1.31, 95%CI: 1.07-1.61; P = 0.008). Interestingly, these observations are consistent with previous reports suggesting a putative link between poor gut health and vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illnesses [29, [71] [72] [73] [74] . A recent study stated that COVID-19-positive older people presenting with chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity are at a higher risk for hospitalization and mortality than older people without these chronic conditions [75] . These latter are associated with numerous changes in the structure of the gut microbiota of humans [76] [77] [78] [79] . Interestingly, Gu et al. revealed that a significant reduction in bacterial diversity in gut microbiota among COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls [71] . A depletion in the abundance of beneficial bacteria was reported, particularly those belonging to the class Clostridia [74] and Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families [71] . Furthermore, numerous gut commensals with known immunomodulatory potential including Bifidobacterium species but also Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were underrepresented in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 individuals [30] .",

Participants who had more than one episode of flu-like illness per year are more likely to present more severe COVID-19 symptoms (OR of having 2 vs 0 or 1 flu-like illness count: OR: 3.04, 95%CI: 1.69-5.45, P = 0.001; of having 3 or more vs 0 or 1 flu-like illness count: OR: 2.08, 95%CI: 1.1-3.94, P = 0.028). Flu-like illness and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. The data in this study suggested that becoming ill with other respiratory viruses might worsen the outcome of COVID-19. This could be explained by the fact that viral RNA infections share similar comorbidities or associated with an impaired immune response. Upon infection with RNA respiratory viruses, type 1 immune responses are initiated by sensor respiratory cells such as airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and dendritic cells. Independently of viral infection, these sensors express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize viral pathogens, particularly Tolllike receptor-3 (TLR-3) and RIG-I-like receptors in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection [80, 81] .",

Due to challenges of data collection in Lebanon and the enrollment of a limited number of individuals, the epidemiologic significance of these results requires further experimental investigations. However, given that the country is experiencing economic and political crises, there are limited funding opportunities and logistics are difficult. Therefore, we were unable to collect fecal samples and study gut microbiota using metagenomic and culturomic approaches. Integrating epidemiological data with advanced diagnostic methods is essential to better understand the association between gut health status and severity of COVID-19 illness and predict reliable outcomes.",

For a better understanding of this association, further cohort studies including more individuals and performing molecular tests are needed.
