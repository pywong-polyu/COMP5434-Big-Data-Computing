Materials and Methods: We represent RCT cohort enrollment as random binary classification fairness problems, and then show how ML fairness metrics based on enrollment fraction can be efficiently calculated using easily computed rates of subpopulations in RCT cohorts and target populations. We propose standardized versions of these metrics and deploy them in an interactive tool to analyze 3 RCTs with respect to type 2 diabetes and hypertension target populations in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Results: We demonstrate how the proposed metrics and associated statistics enable users to rapidly examine representativeness of all subpopulations in the RCT defined by a set of categorical traits (eg, gender, race, ethnicity, smoking status, and blood pressure) with respect to target populations. Discussion: The normalized metrics provide an intuitive standardized scale for evaluating representation across subgroups, which may have vastly different enrollment fractions and rates in RCT study cohorts. The metrics are beneficial complements to other approaches (eg, enrollment fractions) used to identify generalizability and health equity of RCTs. Conclusion: By quantifying the gaps between RCT and target populations, the proposed methods can support generalizability evaluation of existing RCT cohorts. The interactive visualization tool can be readily applied to identified underrepresented subgroups with respect to any desired source or target populations.",

The target population for an RCT may be different from the population of all individuals who have a particular health condition. For example, Pradhan et al 19 reported that the level of trial representativeness changes if the target population shifts from patients with type 2 diabetes who are eligible to receive liraglutide to all patients with type 2 diabetes, since the potential subjects become younger and are less likely to have comorbidities. Thus, the first step is to let investigators define the target population based on an appropriate real-world data source, such as an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, or a nationally representative population sample, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).",

In the causal model for truly randomized clinical trials, no dependency should exist between X and Y. Thus, the observed probability of outcome Z given the treatment is a good estimate of whether the treatment causes the outcome. B.

We show how machine learning fairness metrics used in artificial intelligence applications can be adapted to create metrics that quantify the representativeness of clinical trial cohorts with respect to desired trait-specific subgroups. We demonstrate the scalable representativeness metrics by comparing subgroups in 3 landmark RCTs in diabetes and heart disease with corresponding prevalence in national US population. Supplementary visualizations and statistical tests built on our proposed metrics allow a diversity of researchers from different fields such as computer scientists, clinical researchers, and physicians, to rapidly discover and assess potential disparities in representation of subgroups. Our approach enables users to determine underrepresentation, absence, or overrepresentation of subgroups indicating potential limitations of RCTs. Here, we consider a posteriori evaluation of applicability of RCT results to a target population, but the method could be extended to design of new RCTs, and monitoring of RCT enrollment in the future.",

The observed rates of each subgroup, P g x \u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1jy 0 \u00bc 1 \u00f0 \u00de , are estimated from trial data. The ideal rates and variance, P\u00f0g x \u00f0 \u00de\u00de and var g x \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 \u00de, are estimated for the desired target population Pusing surveillance datasets such as NHANES or electronic medical records (EMRs). The required estimates are robust to missing data. Individual privacy can be protected since only summary statistics are required for the proposed metrics, avoiding the pitfalls of alternative metrics requiring per subject calculations. 50 2. Both metrics have a common interpretation for subgroups with very different background rates: 0 means that demographic parity holds, <0 means subgroup is underrepresented, and >0 means subgroup is overrepresented. 3. Statistical tests quantify the significance of observed disparities for each subgroup which take into account the RCT study size and estimation errors of the ideal assignment rate. We use a oneproportion two-tailed z-test to determine whether the observed rate is significantly deviated from the ideal population rate. We use Benjamini-Hochberg to correct for multiple comparisons across all subgroups. If the difference between observed and ideal rates is not statistically significant, the subgroup is treated as representative; otherwise, we will use metrics to quantify the subgroup representativeness. Other statistical tests could be used. See Supplementary Material for details.",

This indicates that some subgroups in the target population are missing or inadequately represented in the RCTs. The decision-making on a subject, for example, aged 40, based on the SPRINT study would require additional evidence beyond this study. Also, participants with lower education levels tend to be more underrepresented in the SPRINT while participants with higher education levels tend to be more underrepresented in the ALLHAT. This points out that potential social determinant confounders may exist in the RCT. We note, across all 3 studies, non-Hispanic black participants are overrepresented, perhaps reflecting efforts to ensure minority participation or reflecting study locations.

Health equity is not just a clinical issue; it is a socioeconomic concern with broad consequences. [60] [61] [62] We developed metrics and methods to evaluate how equitably subgroups are represented in RCTs. Unlike most existing studies which focus on one protected attribute each time (eg, race) for a single disease (eg, type 2 diabetes), our proposed approach can analyze clinical trials designed for several diseases such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes, simultaneously and can additionally report representativeness of subgroups defined by multiple attributes including age and race/ethnicity. Our next steps are to utilize these metrics to monitor existing RCTs, help design new RCTs, and provide tools to disseminate findings to a variety of stakeholders Representativeness of Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes randomized clinical trial (RCT) subgroups in sunburst plot with inner to outer rings defined by demographic characteristics gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education level, respectively. C. Representativeness of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial RCT subgroups in sunburst plot with inner to outer rings defined by risk factors systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking status, respectively. D. Representativeness of Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial RCT subgroups in sunburst plot with inner to outer rings defined by lab results total cholesterol and fasting glucose, respectively. and user groups, including patients, clinicians, data scientists, and policy-makers, who will bring the discoveries into play to advance health equity.",
