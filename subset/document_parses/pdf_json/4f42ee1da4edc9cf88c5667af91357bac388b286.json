The sample included the participation of spirit mediums divided into two groups. The more experienced group (MEG) with 11 subjects had more than 10 years of mediumistic practice, while the other less experienced group (LEG) with 8 subjects had 1-5 years of experience. The inclusion criteria were psychophonic mediums (who have the ability to communication when deceased beings communicate directly via speaking) with regular trance practices for at least one year.

On the FDT, we found statistical significance (p = 0.038) in the choice stage, with higher performance of subjects whose initial age of trance recognition occurred before 21 years old. On the BDI scale, no participant met the criteria for major depression. The SRQ showed an incidence of common mental disorders in 21% of the sample, which was more prevalent in the LEG (p = 0.008).",

In some studies, essential differences between dissociative disorder and mediumship were 221 verified, in which mediumship was considered to be a nonpathological form of dissociation (Mainieri et al., 2017; Vencio et al., 2019) and a protective factor against mental health conditions (Moreira- Almeida et al., 2008) .

Hence, there is a need to analyze the cognitive performance of subjects in other populations with different subtypes of trance beyond possession. The main research question is if mediumistic trance practice may impair the cognitive process. Our research hypothesis is that practitioners of mediumistic trance have preserved cognitive performance. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate cognitive health among practitioners of mediumistic trance. In addition, cognitive performance and cortical functioning can be evaluated by focusing age of the person when the experience occurred, mental health comorbidities (such as previous traumatic experiences), and early recognition of mediumship according to milestones for neuronal specification.",

There is a role of learning this control of the possession phenomenon, which focuses on reading and education, as to the principles of the spiritism and behavioral adjustment to cultural rules (Espirito Santo, 2010) . This process reflects broad acquisition and application of aspects of executive processing, with inhibitory control over the possession phenomenon, as well as cognitive flexibility for changes in relation to the trance state and readjustment to the real environment. Spirit possession cannot be considered pathological in relation to mental health, except when it causes clinically significant discomfort and impairment in social and occupational functioning (van Duijl et al., 2010) . However, in this study, a difference was found in the prevalence of common mental disorders only in the LEG (i.e., in the group with less time of regular study and systematic activities aimed at controlling mediumship). It is inferred that the regularity of practices in the cultural and religious aspects of this practice may favor the concept of spirit possession as a phenomenon and not a disorder.",

In our study, there was statistical significance between the age the medium began to exhibit mediumistic abilities and their scores within the choice process (a lower age of onset was associated with a higher score in this FDT subtest). We are unaware of studies that address such a comparison. There is probably a greater cortical susceptibility to the dissociative mediumistic trance phenomenon in some subjects, or the learning process and cortical specialization are facilitated by the early onset of mediumistic recognition. The phenomenon of neuronal pruning occurs until the age of 21, and is fundamental in the specialization of the functionality of individuals and preparation for the cognitive challenges that the individual will come across (Holguera and Desplan, 2018) .",

            "text": "In general, there was cognitive health among Brazilians who practiced trance mediumship as a cultural experience. However, we observed a higher prevalence of psychiatric impairment in the LEG, and executive dysfunction may be a tendency in LEG. Performance in processing in the frontal cortex was better in the subgroup with early onset of recognition of the mediumistic phenomenon. Diagnosed executive dysfunction may result from a higher prevalence of traumatic experiences, the impairment of frontal circuits on LEG, or the quality of thought content during trance.",
