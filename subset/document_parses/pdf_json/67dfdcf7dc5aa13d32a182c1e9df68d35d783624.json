Even in China where related measures and collective responses have been strong, there were sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks [1] that kept the country highly alert. Despite the expedited development and roll out of COVID-19 vaccination in many countries [2] , issues such as vaccination hesitancy, availability, and distribution which determine vaccine coverage and herd immunity [3] remain challenging and uncertain. The health systems of many countries have been overburdened by the pandemic [4] , and the arrival of peak influenza seasons introduces additional concerns, as influenza shares similar symptoms with COVID-19 (e.g., fever and cough) [5] . A heavy load of influenza infections may increase the already over-stretched demand for COVID-19 related services [6] . Thus, health authorities worldwide have emphasized on the importance in increasing influenza vaccination (IV) during the pandemic period [7, 8] .",

Also, their frequent travels during semester breaks increase the likelihood of transmitting influenza to vulnerable people (e.g., the elderly and young children) [10] . Although older people are more vulnerable to severe negative consequences of influenza and COVID-19 [11] , promotion of IV uptake among younger people is equally important because of their population size and less frequent use of preventive measure (e.g., social distancing) during the COVID-19 pandemic [12] , and yet lower prevalence of IV uptake. A meta-analysis reported that the pooled prevalence of IV uptake was only 6.7% among people aged 18-59 in China, compared against the 26.7% among people aged 60 [13] . Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of IV uptake among university students in China was 4.1%/9.2%/6.1% in 2009/2010/2011 [14] . University students have not been included as a priority group for free IV uptake in mainland China; they are recommended to take up IV at a cost of about RMB150 (USD25).",

The two studies conducted in Italy and U.K. found that about two-thirds of the adults participants had stronger intention of IV uptake due to COVID-19 [17, 18] , while a third study conducted in Greek reported that about one-third took up IV among elementary school and kindergarten teachers during 2019-2020 and over half of this population showed the intention of IV uptake during 2020-2021 [19] .

IV may be seen as a means of reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection through prevention of influenza.

Recent evidence shows that co-infection of influenza and COVID-19 worsened harms of COVID-19 (e.g., lung damages and mortality) [22, 24] . A study conducted in Italy reported that those regions with higher proportion of adults 65 taking up IV tended to report less COVID-19 deaths [25] . Mental distress and stigma are severe psychological consequences of COVID-19 infection [26] ; influenza symptoms may lead to similar negative psychological consequences during the pandemic [27] . As IV uptake can effectively reduce the risk of co-infection of influenza and COVID-19 [6] , it may prevent elevation of the high level of perceived severity of COVID-19. Hence, the present study contended that people with stronger perceived severity would be more likely to take up IV to avoid worse negative consequences because of co-infection of influenza and COVID- 19. This study investigated the prevalence of a) IV behavior prior to the COVID-19 outbreak (from January to December 2019), b) IV behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak (from January 2020 till the survey date), c) intention of IV uptake (next 12 months), and d) self-reported increase in the intention of IV uptake due to COVID-19. It also investigated three cognitive factors of IV behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak and intention of IV uptake in the next 12 months, including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and perceived chance of future outbreak regarding COVID-19 among university students in China. It is hypothesized that such factors would be positively associated with the two IVrelated dependent variables.",

Five universities were conveniently selected from each province and participated in the study. The same methodology was presented in a published paper that investigated probable depression among a different sample [26] . In this study, 165 classes of various grades [e.g., Year 1 to 5 (medical students received five-year undergraduate training in China] within the faculties of arts, sciences, social sciences, economics or management, engineering, and medicine or pharmacy of the participating universities were selected by convenience sampling. The collaborating teachers and student helpers sent an invitation message, the online survey link, and several reminders to all the students in the selected classes via WeChat groups that were being used for regular class administration. The inclusion criteria included being a full-time student and able to read and write Chinese. The online self-administered questionnaire took about 10-15 minutes to complete. It was explained in the invitation message and the online questionnaire that the participation was anonymous, voluntary, and confidential, and that the return of the completed questionnaire implied informed consent. Participants also clicked a button in the electronic questionnaire to provide informed consent. Upon completion, the participants could join a lottery draw which offered eight prizes of RMB10-50 (about USD1.5-7.5) and a symbolic ''lucky money\" of RMB1 for half of the participants in each participating university.",

In literature, behavioral intention is commonly used in vaccination studies, including those of IV [17] [18] [19] [20] and COVID-19 vaccination [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Behavioral intention is known to be one of the strongest predictors of vaccination behavior [34] . Its significance and usefulness have been illustrated in the commonly used Theory of Planned Behavior, which postulates that behavioral intention mediates between the determinants of the behavior of interest (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived control) and the outcome variable of health-related behavior [34] . In simpler words, factors of vaccination uptake need to change intention first; intention would then determinate the behavioral outcome.

            "text": "Intention of IV uptake in the next 12 months but low actual IV rate might be partially explained by the fact that health-related intention is not always translated into actual behavior [35] . It is also plausible that regular IV services might be disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial period in particular. Another plausible explanation is that IV uptake in China is conducted at community healthcare centers. People's tendency to avoid receiving medical services during the COVID-19 period [4] might have stopped some people from translating the intention of IV uptake into action during the COVID-19 period. To alleviate worries about clinic visits, provision of IV services on campus may increase the prevalence of IV uptake; the setting may also increase IV uptake through strengthening subjective norms and observational learning, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior [34] and the Social Cognitive Theory [36] . The history of IV behavior prior to the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited a large OR in its association with IV behavior during the COVID-19 period, implying that most of those vaccinated during the COVID-19 period were those who used to take up IV. Thus, most of these who intended to take up IV in the future had not been vaccinated in the past; their IV intention might be 'newly formed' during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, about 60% of the participants acknowledged that they had an increased intention of IV uptake due to COVID-19. Hence, COVID-19 may have a positive effect on the intention of IV uptake. As COVID-19 has now been put under control in China, a follow-up study is required to see if the increased intention would be translated to actual IV behavior. Future studies are also needed to understand better specific facilitators and barriers that would affect the translation of their intention into vaccination behaviors among those who do not usually take up IV.",

            "text": "This study may inform the design of interventions promoting IV uptake among university students in China, which is warranted because of their lower prevalence of IV uptake and higher risk of influenza. Perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 infection and perceived chance of future COVID-19 outbreak were found to be positively associated with the IV behavior and intention, which corroborates the finding of a positive association between perceived risk of COVID-19 and intention of IV uptake among adults in U.K. [18] . Supporting the study's hypothesis, perceived severity of COVID-19 was also associated with intention of IV uptake (next 12 months). According to the Protection Motivation Theory of fear appeal (PMT) [37] , perceived threat refers to the co-existence of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Those who feel more threatened by COVID-19 are expected to have higher intention of IV uptake, as the fear induced by the perceived threat would trigger off danger control responses (i.e., actions to remove the danger such as IV) [37] . The fear appeal approach has frequently been used in social marketing for health promotion [38] . Thus, health promotion may emphasize on the high risk and severity regarding COVID-19 (physically, emotionally, and socially) in the context of university life, and also, how IV uptake would be able to reduce such risk and severity, i.e., removing the threat of COVID-19. It is interesting that although perceived severity was associated with the intention of IV uptake, it was not significantly associated with IV behavior during the COVID-19 period, possibly because history of IV uptake was the dominant factor in this case.",

It has been used effectively to promote vaccination behaviors (e.g., IV and HPV vaccination) [39] . According to the TTM, people need to go through the pre-contemplation stage, the contemplation stage, and the preparation stage before reaching the action stage that results in behavioral change [40] . In our case, about 1/3 of the sampled university students reported intention of IV uptake and are thus in the contemplation stage of change. Self-efficacy and goal setting are important to advance people of this stage to the prepa-ration and action stages [40] . The action-based models (e.g., the Health Action Process Approach) have similarly proposed that working through planning process (e.g., designating where, when and how to perform the behavior and overcome anticipated barriers) would translate intention into action [41, 42] . Such strategies may be considered in relevant health promotion of IV uptake.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, as it was a crosssectional survey, causal relationship cannot be inferred. Second, social desirability bias may be involved as IV behavior/intention may be considered socially desirable. Third, although the response rate of this study was relatively high (>70%) and the sample covered different regions of China, it might not be representative to the overall university student population in mainland China as there were 1,272 universities in mainland China when the study was conducted. The convenience sampling also requires caution in making generalization to other populations/regions. Besides, the participants may be over-represented by students majoring in medicine who tend to have higher prevalence of IV behavior/intention [43] . Last, this study only focused on three cognitive factors of IV, which are important ones. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 are among the strongest drives for COVID-19 vaccination [33, 44] . In IV research, perceived severity and susceptibility regarding influenza were also frequently investigated [45] [46] [47] . We included perceived chance of having future outbreak in China as COVID-19 was quite well controlled in China. Yet, the participants' worry about the future was still relevant and might be a significant factor. It is, however, a limitation of this study that other potential factors had not been included in this study, such as other factors of the HBM (perceived barrier, selfefficacy, and cue to action). For instance, the cost of IV uptake is a potential barrier against IV that may reduce self-efficacy. Future studies may look at other factors of IV uptake.",

The associations between perceived risk/severity and intention of IV uptake further supports the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced the IV uptake among university students. Such findings are novel. It is, however, uncertain whether the elevated intention would be translated into action. Efforts are greatly warranted to reduce the potential intention-behavioral discrepancy. Applications of behavioral health theories (TTM and fear appeal approaches) are potentially useful. Although this study brings some insights, it is preliminary and exploratory. Regarding future studies, it is important to understand whether the findings can be applied to other populations and investigate other factors related to IV uptake and COVID-19 vaccination. Future longitudinal and intervention studies are also warranted to confirm and validate the findings of this study. In sum, it is important to understand how to utilize the 'opportunity' arising during the COVID-19 pandemic for health promotion of IV uptake.",
