Physical geography and healthcare provider barriers may have negative influences on patients' health outcomes. To explore the perceptions and experiences of cancer rehabilitation in a rural area in northern Iceland. A further aim was to explore patients' physical and psychosocial wellbeing, coping and satisfaction with care. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis was completed with a purposive sample of 21 patients at a tertiary hospital in northern Iceland. Three main themes emerged: 1) Rehabilitation -the need for improved access support and continuity; 2) Coping and quality of life -balancing life as it was before cancer against the present situation in order to achieve normality; 3) Satisfaction -encountering caring behaviours enhances satisfaction and well-being. Specifically targeted rehabilitation programmes need to be included in the treatment options for cancer patients. Survival instinct, coping mechanisms and a strong urge to maintain general functionality are of paramount importance intertwined with patients' ability to cope with the disease and treatment, and their satisfaction with care.",

Climatic conditions are largely unpredictable during winter and may become extremely difficult at times [9] . The distinction between urban and rural, which is most useful in this study, means in the Icelandic context distinguishing between, on the one hand, the capital region in the southwestern part of the island, and on the other hand, the remaining parts of the country. The population in Iceland reached 356.991 in January 2019: 228.231 lived in the capital region, or 64% of the whole population, while 36% lived in rural settlements [10] .",

Furthermore, the incidence rate of cancer among the Icelandic population has quadrupled since registration on cancer diagnosis began in 1954, around 1,500 individuals are diagnosed on a yearly basis [12] . Studies conducted in the Circumpolar North have addressed the diverse and unique healthcare delivery in that part of the world [13] [14] [15] showing that cancer is becoming a significant public health problem. Findings indicate an urgent need for improvement in both access to and delivery of the relevant services [11, 13, 14, 16] . Physical geography, healthcare provider-related barriers, and lack of continuity in care provision are known to have negative influences on patients' health outcomes [17, 18] . Studies have found that rehabilitation is not routinely offered to patients with cancer, the main reasons being lack of patients' referral for physiotherapy and limited exercise resources [19, 20] .",

To some extent, rehabilitation services for patients with cancer are available in Iceland within some hospitals and specific institutions, although it is rather haphazard with the respect to who gets rehabilitation and where [32] . Lack of research on these issues in the specific context of rural areas, Icelandic ones in particular, and the high incidence rate of cancer among the Icelandic population, prompted this study. The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore patients' perceptions and experiences of cancer rehabilitation in rural areas in northern Iceland (Figure 1) . A further aim was to explore these patients' physical and psychosocial well-being, coping and satisfaction with care. In this manner, we can provide an important integration, in the first place to the existing Icelandic research, and in the second place to Circumpolar and Arctic studies, and as well globally. We, therefore, set out to answer the following research questions:",

First, the transcripts were read line by line independently by two researchers who are also authors of the present article (EBB, EH), to get a clear and cogent understanding of the overall contents [41, 42] . Codes were found and grouped into coherent categories, each of which was given a name or a code, to prepare for a thorough examination and understanding of the underlying meanings of the text thus obtained [41] . Then, the quality and trustworthiness of the analysis was secured by all the authors (EBB, EH, \u00deS, GB, FR\u00de) who met on several occasions to discuss the codes and categories, until a final consensus was reached. Lastly, descriptions with similar meanings or related topics were agreed upon by the researchers. A formulation of main themes and subthemes was then completed, reflecting the relationships and interaction between the codes related to the participants' descriptions of their experiences [41] ( Figure 4 ).

The participants' determination was clearly seen in their descriptions, in which they voiced their intention to live in the present and value life despite the severe impact that the cancer and its treatments had on their quality of life and well-being. These findings, characterised by positive thinking and new attitudes towards life, indicate that the patients' acceptance of the situation and their ability to put worries into perspective may reduce anxiety and depression [46] .

As seen in this study the participants were not given adequate information on rehabilitation resources, nor were they referred to a specific rehabilitation centre or institution, unless they had asked for it themselves. Previous studies conducted in the Circumpolar North have elaborated on the lack of access to healthcare services and the consequences it may have for health and well-being [17] . These are great challenges facing healthcare professionals today, due to the growing burden of cancer in some of the inhabited Arctic regions [13] [14] [15] . In the light of results in this study future research should focus on patients' awareness of cancer rehabilitation and resources in his community. Recent studies indicate a need for continuous studies of the benefit of telemedicine with focus on improved function and pain management, patient's satisfaction with such visits and a possible decrease in hospital length of stay [54, 55] . Studies of telemedicine initiatives are highly appropriate in rural and low-resource settings. Furthermore, patients' descriptions of their experiences should be highlighted in continuing studies on communication and establishment of a therapeutic interpersonal relationship as perceived by cancer patients in their stressful period of treatment. Finally, it would be interesting to conduct intervention studies on these issues always aiming for increased quality of care in clinical practice.",

Also, to reduce bias and to ensure reliable data, three trained interviewers experienced in qualitative-study design, and unknown to the participants, conducted the interviews and all the authors reviewed codes and categories until a final consensus was reached. Second, this study is, to our best knowledge, the first study of its kind in Iceland. It, therefore, generates unique data on patients' perceptions and experiences of cancer rehabilitation service in rural areas in Iceland, and the impact of cancer and its treatment on these patients' well-being and coping abilities, and satisfaction with care. The results can only be representative for those patients who took part in the study. Nevertheless, this should be considered as a strength, in as much as the sample is statistically representative of the people diagnosed with various types of cancer in Iceland and the rural communities of the Circumpolar North at large [12, 14] . The use of a qualitative method allowed the researchers to obtain a deeper understanding of the phenomena under study. Further, strength is to be found in the resemblance of its results with the findings of previous studies in analogous settings [19, 23, 29, 51] .",

Those who were judged to be unable to participate, because of some physical or psychological impairment prior to the study, might have provided some valuable information about specific needs regarding rehabilitation and psychosocial support. Consequently, what was lost by not being able to include these individuals in our study remains a gnawing hypothetical mystery. Also, the fact that participation was voluntary, points to a possible selfselection bias in the sample, this was inevitable under the extant ethical and methodological circumstances. The design of our study makes it impossible to obtain detailed information about those who did not respond to the invitation to participate. In addition, the different ages of the participants and the variation in the stage of the disease might have had an influence on the participants' expectations and experiences [57] . Contacting participants for member checking some months after interviewing them, was not an option, we wanted to show respect for those who could now be in a more advanced stage of the disease, or had died, and their families. Finally, the lack of similar studies on patients with cancer in rural areas of Iceland impedes the comparison of our results with those of others dealing with the same subject.",

This gap needs to be monitored closely in future research, bearing in mind that the need for rehabilitation will continue to grow along with the increased number of people with cancer in this environment. Findings in this study also indicate the significant importance of organised and supervised rehabilitation for these patients, while the opposite can be both physically and emotionally devastating. The strong will and determination to handle the situation and maintain normality in life as this was before cancer, were mixed with the patients' coping strategies and the way care was being provided to them. Finally, findings in our study highlight the importance of caring in a sensitive manner, an establishment of positive patient-professional relationships, and an understanding of multiple personal and environmental problems.",
