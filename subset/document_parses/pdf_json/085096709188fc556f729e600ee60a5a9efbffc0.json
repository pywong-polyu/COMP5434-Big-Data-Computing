At right time of writing this review, on 29 April 2020, the number of infected persons worldwide has exceeded 3.01 million, with more than 200 000 reported deaths (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/global.html). At present, there is no specifically targeted, effective treatment for patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need, therefore, to determine how to alleviate the severe clinical symptoms and reduce the morbidity and mortality due to this disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shares the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, in which the viruses' spike proteins bind to the host cell surface. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are an essential regulator of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity. 1, 2 The RAAS is a vital regulator of cardiovascular and renal function, including blood pressure, and which plays a vital role in regulating acute lung injury. 3, 4 The ACE2 level is significantly reduced in patients following SARS-CoV infection, resulting in RAAS system imbalance, and eventually cause severe acute lung injury. Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are ACE2 receptor antagonists that can reduce the activity of the RAAS system and which have been widely used in the past several decades to treat cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 3 However, some animal experiments and clinical trials have shown that ACEIs potentially result in an increase in ACE2 receptors. 5 Some concern has therefore been expressed that the use of ACEIs/ ARBs might increase the risk of COVID-19 infection after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and result in a poor prognosis. 6 On 12 April 2020, the European Society of Hypertension COVID-19 Task Force issued the following statement: the current evidence does not support that RAAS inhibitors aggravate the condition of COVID-19 patients. 5 Accumulating evidence revealed that inflammatory cytokine storm and dysfunction of immune system largely contribute to the severe COVID-19, even cause death. 7 The latest evidence shows that peripheral blood interlekin-6 (IL-6) levels, a critical mediator of respiratory failure, shock, and multiorgan dysfunction, were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients who had used a RAAS inhibitor. 8, 9 Moreover, CD3 and CD8 cell counts were significantly reduced, suggesting that the level of inflammation in patients treated with ACEIs is relatively low. 8 Several retrospective studies have shown that the use of ACEIs/ARBs prior to COVID-19 infection could reduce the severity of COVID-19 and was associated with a better prognosis, especially in patients with both hypertension and COVID-19. [10] [11] [12] However, other studies have shown that there is no significant correlation between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. 10,13-17 Because the affection of RAAS inhibitors on the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients is unclear; in this article, we will review the current evidence and assess the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients with or without hypertension treated with ACEs/ARBs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 905, "end": 907, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 908, "end": 909, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1068, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1070, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1286, "text": "(ACEIs)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1558, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1688, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1867, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2081, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2240, "end": 2241, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2480, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2481, "end": 2482, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2638, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2877, "end": 2881, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2882, "end": 2886, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2887, "end": 2891, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "This study was performed according to PRISMA guidelines (http:// www.prisma-statement.org; Table S1 ). 18 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 105, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 99, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "| METHODS"}, {"text": "Two authors (L.

It is therefore unclear whether the benefit was attributable to the high proportion of patients with hypertension. Moreover, the study only adjusted for age and sex and did not correct for enough of the potential confounding factors, such as drug use and hypertension. Therefore, the benefits of RAAS inhibition in the general population with a lower prevalence of hypertension still needs to be confirmed in future research. Our research has several limitations. First, all of the included articles were observational and therefore cannot confirm the cause-and-effect relationship between ACEI/ARB therapy and the clinical prognosis of patients with COVID-19; a large-scale RCT is needed to confirm our results. Second, coexisting conditions, such as hypertension, have been shown a key prognostic determinant (eg, severity and mortality) in patients with COVID-19. The guidelines recommend that patients with hypertension and COVID-19 continue their ACEI/ARB therapy, and our study reinforced this recommendation and further showed that the use of ACEI/ARB therapy might be associated with better clinical outcomes in the general population with COVID-19 and in hypertensive patients with COVID-19. However, the benefit of RAAS inhibitors in nonhypertensive patients might differ from those with hypertensive patients. Due to data limitations, we cannot analyze the severity and clinical prognosis of ACEI/ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19 without hypertension.
