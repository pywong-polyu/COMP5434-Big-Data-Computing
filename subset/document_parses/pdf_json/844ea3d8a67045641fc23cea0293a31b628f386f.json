            "text": "In March of 2021, as the world marked the first anniversary since COVID-19 altered our reality, graduate social work students in Dr. Carol Tosone's Evidence-Based Trauma class at NYU considered the challenges of learning about trauma treatment while simultaneously living through a global trauma. Students reflected on their home lives, school experiences, field placements, mental health challenges, feelings of burnout, and the added complexities of racial disparities and injustices. Students also shared their coping mechanisms and hope for the future. This paper aims to provide insight into their varied experiences while relating their struggles and demonstrating their pathways toward resiliency. Valencia M.

At the time, it was inconceivable to believe that this potential pandemic would affect our lives any more than other recent health pandemics. However, in March, the announcement of shutdowns and stay-at-home orders began to change our perception of the pandemic. Teaching an advanced trauma class to M.S.W. candidates, Tosone and her students (Tosone, 2021) reflected on the similarities between the current pandemic and the trauma experienced by students after 9/11. In this current paper, a new group of students were tasked with writing about their observations, feelings, and impact of COVID 19 on various aspects of their life from the vantage point having lived with it for a full year. What follows are the students' reflections on the changes in their home situations, school life, field placement, overall mental health, challenges with racial trauma and widespread inequities, past personal traumas, coping mechanisms, and thoughts on the future. Their struggles, insights, and resilience are shared to benefit future social work students and educators.",

Students shared that they felt as though they were regressing and reverting to high school behavior instead of continuing to move forward in their adult development.

It is better that I care for them at home, avoiding the hospital, even if I am emotionally exhausted.\" Another student lamented that her mother needed hospital care but could not get the required assistance due to her social location.

Some were traditional students, completing their second and final year of the program. They benefited from spending twothirds of their first year on campus and at in-person field placement. The other group of students, Advance Standing students, only attended the school for this year. Their entire experience has been online as they have never set foot on campus for class, and many of them had field placements that were also online. From their reflections, it appeared the Advance Standing students, only having this one academic year, reported feeling cheated and questioned if their experience was worth the money they paid to attend New York University.",

Coupled with a lack of motivation and competing home stressors, the learning experience became exceedingly difficult. Students complained about the expectation of \"leaving the Zoom camera on and having to participate.\" While most shared that professors creating a space to discuss current events and experiences was helpful, one student described it as retriggering and not allowing her the chance to focus on something other than the pandemic. While many students liked opportunities to socialize and connect using breakout rooms and group projects, some questioned if it placed a further burden on them. However, many concluded that connecting with others allowed for relief in the universality of shared traumatic experiences and allowed for normalizing among one's community and peers (Tosone et al., 2011) .",

Unplanned termination generally occurs when the client decides to discontinue treatment (Mirabito, 2006) . However, in these cases, it was neither the client nor the therapist initiating termination. The ending of the therapeutic relationship, whether planned or unplanned, can elicit feelings of loss, separation, and guilt, impacting both the client and the practitioner (Ballan & Mera, 2011) . When the shutdown started, students told their clients and their colleagues that this school had put a 4-week hiatus on field placements, but they would be back after that time. That never occurred. Instead, the school permanently halted the field placements for safety, leaving students and their clients unable to terminate properly. Repeatedly, students expressed sadness and guilt about not being able to say goodbye to their clients. As Van der Kolk (2014), explains our memory depends on how personally meaningful it was and how emotional we felt about it at the time. One student said, \"I think about the high school students at my placement that I had to leave. These were students who had difficult home situations. A year later, I still wonder how they are managing.\" Another shared that her guilt stems from the lie she told her students that she would see them soon, but never returned. In both cases, continuing via telehealth was not an option.",

Anti-Asian hate crimes increased 145% in 16 of America's largest cities, while overall, hate crime dropped 6% in 2020 (Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, 2021). Anti-Asian hate crimes significantly increased in New York City and Los Angeles in 2020 (Yam, 2021) Additionally, being an international Asian student during the pandemic had its own complexities. While many domestic students returned home during the pandemic, international students could not easily do so. \"The expense of the ticket back to China together with the 12+ hour time difference would be prohibitive, so I stayed, despite the social isolation.\" Then in July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (2020) issued a new guideline stating that non-immigrant F-1 and M-1 students must depart the U.S. if attending schools operating entirely online, which all schools were at the time. Though the government rescinded the policy eight days later, international students were shaken. This experience added to their overall unease and uncertainty, especially considering the recent uptick in Anti-Asian attacks and hate crimes.",
