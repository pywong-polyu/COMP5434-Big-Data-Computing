This new situation has changed people's habits and significantly affected the pregnant population. Decreased exercise and increased psychophysical stress are associated with excessive weight gain, diabetes, and gestational cardiovascular complications that affect the mother, fetus, and newborn. Recent research shows that the dynamics of maternal blood pressure is one of the most important control factors during pregnancy. Thus, prevention of these type of pathologies through interventions without maternal-fetal risks is important.",

A moderate exercise program was performed as an intervention from 8-10 to 38-39 weeks of pregnancy.

Pregnancy is distinguished by a multitude of physiological, mental and emotional adjustments. Every organ system in the expectant mother is intimately involved in this complex process, to create an optimal environment for fetal development (Artal et al., 1991) . From the circulatory/hemodynamic point of view, the changes begin during the fifth week of gestation and last until approximately 1 year after delivery (Clapp and Capeless, 1997) . Cardiac output increases by approximately 40% (due to an increased stroke volume and heart rate [HR] ). There is a 13% increase in body mass supplied by the maternal blood (Geva et al., 1997) . Important changes in the blood volume, systemic vascular resistance and vascular tone exist during pregnancy (Gilson et al., 1997; Carbillon et al., 2000; Bamfo et al., 2007; Zentner et al., 2012) .",

The use of exercise as one of those preventive columns in general populations is sufficiently supported by scientific evidence; however, the efficacy of exercise in this prevention strategy during pregnancy is still poorly investigated . In that sense, several scientific studies confirm the relationship between exercise during pregnancy and improved pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, international guidelines for exercise during pregnancy recommend an active pregnancy for pregnant women without obstetric complications (Mottola et al., 2018; Barakat et al., 2019; Obstetrics and Gynecology, 2020) .
