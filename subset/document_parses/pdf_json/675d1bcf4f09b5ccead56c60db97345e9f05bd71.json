The disease is modeled by our extended SEIR model with parameters fitted to real epidemics data for Czech Republic. The model is able to simulate a whole range of non-pharmaceutical interventions on individual level, such as protective measures and physical distancing, testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine. The effect of government-issued measures such as contact restrictions in different environments (schools, restaurants, vendors, etc.) can also be simulated.",

Consequently, we evaluated their responses by Saaty method; the results may be seen in the fourth column of Table 8 .

Moreover, these data changed according to the situation during the epidemic. To incorporate these changes, we used surveys (MEDIAN, 2020) , 2020) gives data for each week; however, it surveys only the total number of contacts without discerning their types. Yet additional results of the survey give some information connected to the particular types of contacts, they do not directly provide the numbers of contacts; instead, they give proxy information such as number of pub visits. To quantify the changes for the purpose of the contact model, we proceeded as follows. To each layer, we assigned an item (answer to a question of a survey) from (ME-DIAN, 2020) and a proxy from (PaQ, 2020), see Table 11 . Thus, for each particular layer, we had the restriction m at the fourth week, estimated by (MEDIAN, 2020) , and the series of restrictions n 1 , n 2 , . . . at the individual weeks, estimated by (PaQ, 2020).
