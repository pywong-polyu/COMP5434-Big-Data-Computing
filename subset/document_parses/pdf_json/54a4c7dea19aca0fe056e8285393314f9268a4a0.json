            "text": "Biomedical researchers are progressively applying modern Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to data from electronic health records (EHRs). Despite the natural excitement about the large amount of information presented by EHRs, daunting challenges remain. As the primary impetus for EHR implementation has been clinical care, EHR observations reflect a complex set of processes that further obscure their utility in research. Dimensionality, sparsity, heterogeneity, and quality issues present significant impediments for secondary use of EHR data. [1, 2] In particular, the EHR observation records are often not direct indicators of a patient's true health state, but rather reflect the clinical processes (e.g., policies and workflows of the provider and payor organizations), the patient's interaction with the system, and the recording process. [3] [4] [5] As a result of the biases inherent in EHR data, identifying cohorts of patients with certain health conditions can become complex. In order to make precise assumptions about the presence of a disease, we would need to perform phenotyping. The key task in phenotyping is to identify patient cohorts with (or without) a certain phenotype or clinical condition of interest. [6, 7] Developing specialized phenotypic definitions from EHR data can be expensive and often requires involvement by domain experts. [8] [9] [10] [11] Nevertheless, due to its critical role in re-using EHR data from research, several healthcare institutions are actively involved in constructing and validating electronic phenotyping algorithms. Efforts to curate computational phenotypes and discover clinical knowledge from EHR observations must account for the potential biases introduced through the recording process. [4] Another underutilized aspect of electronic medical records is their temporal dimension. EHRs contain important temporal information about disease progression and treatment outcomes. However, EHR observations are often acquired asynchronously across time (i.e., measured at different time instants and sampled irregularly in time) and include sparse and heterogeneous data. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] These properties challenge the application of standard temporal analysis methods to clinical data recorded in EHRs.",

            "text": "Although electronic health records often include incomplete, inaccurate, or even biased data, the wealth of information they provide is sufficient for constructing clinically-relevant sets of observable characteristics that define a disease or phenotype. [4, 18] The task in electronic phenotyping is to determine patients with (or without) certain phenotypic characteristics based on data from electronic medical records, [7] which is challenging due to the heterogeneity and complexity of multimodal EHR data. [6] As a result, developing specialized phenotypic definitions from EHR data is generally expensive. [8, 9] Approaches to electronic phenotyping include rule-based methods and computational methods, which can be broadly characterized under text processing and supervised/semisupervised/unsupervised statistical learning techniques. [6, 19] Applying supervised and semisupervised machine learning to EHR data for identifying cohorts with clinical phenotypes is rapidly prevailing. [11, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Although, such phenotyping models require a human-annotated gold-standard training set, which remains a bottleneck. [30] In addition, defining clinically-meaningful EHR features for computational phenotyping relies on a heavy dose of domain expert involvement, using complex ad-hoc procedures that are often hard to generalize and scale. [8] [9] [10] [11] Despite the cost, several academic medical centers are actively involved in constructing and validating EHR phenotyping algorithms. Some of the notable efforts include the i2b2-centered efforts led by Harvard University and Mass General Brigham, [20, 21, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] the BioVU led by Vanderbilt University, [22, 23] and the multicenter eMERGE Network consortium, [24] [25] [26] [27] the Phenotype Knowledgebase website, PheKB, [28] and the OMOP-centered Automated PHenotype Routine for Observational Definition, Identification, Training and Evaluation (APHRODITE) [38] , to name a few.",

For example, Perer,Wang, and Hu (2015) used the SPAM algorithm for mining long sequences of events. [25] The a priori property is that if a sequence cannot pass the minimum support test (i.e., is not assumed frequent), all of its subsequences will be ignored. However, for various reasons, temporal patterns that are mined based on frequency may not make clinical sense. For example, low blood pressure readings after the administration of a specific, but irrelevant, medication may be frequently observed, yet have no real clinical meaning. [48] Recently, we introduced the transitive sequential pattern mining (tSPM) algorithm along with an early implementation of the MSMR algorithm. [49] The tSPM algorithm provides a modified sequencing procedure to address some of the issues caused by the recording processes in EHRs. The MSMR algorithm, offers a high-throughput feature engineering technique to improve the frequency-based a priori property in the traditional SPM approach. As a proof-of-concept, we showed that the sequencing approach improves disease prediction and classification in a single disease. In this study, we apply the tSPM algorithm -with an improved MSMR algorithm, -to computational phenotyping in EHR data. We perform a comprehensive comparison of the transitive and traditional sequential representations with the conventional way of using EHR observations as features for computational phenotyping in 10 phenotypes. We also compare the phenotyping performance with the state-of-the-art phenotyping algorithms published in research informatics literature.",

For each phenotype, two pseudo-cohorts are available. Based on a list of ICD-9/10 codes for the respective phenotype, a given patient in the pseudo-cohort has at least one record of the respective diagnosis code(s), as well as an outcome label, which determines the \"true\" presence of the phenotype. We use the term \"pseudo-cohort\" to distinguish these patient cohorts from validated disease cohorts. For each of the phenotypes, a small dataset included patient pseudo-cohorts with gold-standard outcome labels. To create gold-standard labels, teams of board-certified clinicians and/or nurses reviewed clinical notes and other required data of samples of patients selected from patients consented into the MGB Biobank between April 2012 and April 2017 and with 1 or more diagnosis record of the phenotype. The gold-standard phenotype pseudo-cohort datasets include labels for an average of 351 patients (ranging from 163 to 700 patients). For the 10 phenotypes, larger pseudocohorts were also pulled from the Biobank, with an average population of over 6,000 patients. For these patients, silver-standard labels are curated using a generative transfer learning algorithm. [cite: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa215] The average number of phenotype records was 28 in the gold-standard datasets and 20 in the silver-standard datasets.

To address the research question, phenotyping results are presented in Table 2 (also illustrated in Figure 2 ). Overall, we found that temporal sequences provided the best phenotyping performances across all 10 phenotypes (except in CAD where we had a tie). Combining sequences with AVR features only resulted in the best overall performance in COPD and RA. Among the sequential representations, in an overwhelming majority of the phenotypes, transitive sequences were included in the best results. The two exception to this were in CAD (in which the difference was 0.001) and T2DM. For six of the 10 phenotypes, we were able to find AUC ROCs reported from other published phenotyping studies.

Many of the most common sequences were the diagnosis code paired with a risk factor, symptom, complication, or treatment for that disease. It was also common to see the disease code paired with the influenza or pneumococcal 23 vaccination (PPSV23). Table 3 shows a sampling of the identified components that were found to be in sequence with the respective disease for the given phenotype. Each of these components, when in sequence with the diagnosis code, has increased accuracy for identifying the phenotype. For example, in the case of coronary artery disease (CAD), the diagnosis code on its own only identifies true coronary artery disease 34% of the timei.e., based on the chart reviews, only 34 percent of the patients that had the diagnosis code actually had a confirmed case of CAD. However, when the risk factor, hypertension, precedes the diagnosis code, the accuracy increases to 68%. If the symptom chest pain precedes coronary artery disease the sequence accuracy increases to 70%. If the complication cardiac dysrhythmia, precedes the diagnosis, the accuracy of the sequence increases to 71%. And if the treatment clopidogrel, precedes the diagnosis, the accuracy of the sequence is 97%.There are also cases where the diagnosis code is in sequence with a vaccination or a need for a vaccination. This also leads to increased accuracy for the sequence compared to the components. For example, the sequence \"PPSV23 \u00e0 Rheumatoid arthritis\" is 75% accurate for rheumatoid arthritis. Whereas \"PPSV23\" is only 22% accurate and \"Rheumatoid Arthritis\" is only 68% accurate.",

            "text": "We argue that sequences present more precise information by reducing some of the noise in the EHR data. For instance, we might have observations of the diagnosis code in patient 's medical record. When the diagnosis code is deemed a relevant feature for phenotype (whether through our proposed MSMR or expert ascertion), in the conventional (AVR) approach for computational phenotyping is directly incorporated (as a feature) into the classification algorithm. Sequential data representations, instead, provide a more precise way for incorporating the record into downstream modeling, in that only a proportion of the record may hold useful information for classification that precedes another record (e.g., \u2192 ) or follows another record ( \u2192 ). The MSMR algorithm allows for seamless discovery of such precise sequential record combinations. Furthermore, the sequences not only lead to more precise phenotyping but they also uniquely capture two distinct events that reflect the patient's experiences of those events. . For example, \"Cardiac dysrhythmia -> Cognitive deficit as a late effect of cerebrovascular disease\" is an important sequence for identifying the stroke phenotype. This is likely a common narrative for a stroke patient. The individual develops a cardiac dysrhythmia that leads to the formation of a clot in the heart, that then causes a cerebrovascular accident which leads to cognitive deficits. By sequencing the diagnoses and medications, we developed a rich feature set where individual labels can accurately tell a patient's story. Analyzing such sequences could give new insight into disease trajectories. Applying this method to new and emerging diseases (such as Covid-19) and then analyzing the sequence features could help us to understand how the disease progresses.",

Each of these labels when in sequence with the disease also have clinical meaning. For example, \"Hypertension -> Alzheimer's Disease\", suggests hypertension precedes Alzheimer's Disease. The scientific literature supports this relationship. Several longitudinal studies have shown midlife hypertension is consistently associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease implying that hypertension is a risk factor. [62] [63] [64] Another example is the sequence \"Congestive heart failure -> Chronic kidney disease\". Again, the literature supports this relationship. In a systematic review of 16 studies with more than 80,000 patients with congestive heart failure, 29% had moderate to severe kidney impairment. [65] Therefore, congestive heart failure preceding chronic kidney disease makes sense because chronic kidney disease is a known complication. These sequences are not just more accurate, but they tell a clinical narrative that corresponds with the patient's experience.",

The transitive sequences are similar to simple forms of recurrent events in RNN-based models. The difference is that we do not provide any gate or memory constraint and would accept all possible sequences. This resulted in a large dimensional space. The MSMR algorithm is allowed to pick up what is relevant to the outcome of interest. However, in this paper we only studied 2-deep sequences. We envision extracting deeper sequences, which would further increase dimensionality. In that case, future research may need to apply memory constraints on what to remember from the past.",
