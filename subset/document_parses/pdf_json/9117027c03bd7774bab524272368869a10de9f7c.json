These devices display audio and video content, and can interpret human speech, therefore reducing technology burden for patients (i.e., avoiding the need for use of digital inputs to interact with the program).

All interactions between the exercise physiologist and the participants were conducted remotely (i.e. via Alexa device instructions or telephone/ videoconference) and there was no pre-established relationship prior to enrolment in this study. Participants were prescribed an exercise program involving brief (10min) but frequent (up to four times per day) sessions (consistent with an 'exercise snacking' approach) and incorporating simple exercises requiring minimal-tono equipment. Specifically, 'exercise snacking' sessions were completed twice per day for the first four weeks of the intervention, three times per day for the second four weeks, and four times per day for the final four weeks. Each 'exercise snacking' session was 10 min in duration and involved four functional strength, weight-bearing impact and balance training exercises for the upper and lower body. Appropriate exercises were selected by the accredited exercise physiologist based on the principles of the Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life program [12] . Participants were instructed to perform exercise at a moderate intensity of approximately 4-6 on the 10-point modified Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. Participants received a reminder on the Alexa device when a new program was available, and would access this content by saying the phrase, \"Alexa, open my Training Buddy\". Participants were presented an audiovisual demonstration and instructions of each exercise. Participants would then be encouraged to complete the exercise in real-time alongside a visual demonstration provided by the instructor. Following each individual exercise and session, the Alexa device would broadcast questions to the participant to determine whether they completed the exercise, their levels of exertion during the exercise, and whether any potential adverse events/incidents occurred. For example: \"have you completed your exercise session, yes or no?\", \"how hard did you find this exercise out of 10, 1 being very easy and 10 being extremely hard?\", \"did you experience any pain or discomfort when completing this exercise, yes or no?\". Participants' voice responses to these questions were recorded and saved to the Buddy Link database, enabling the accredited exercise physiologist to review the responses weekly to tailor the program accordingly and modify or progress each participants exercise program as required. For example: if the participant self-reported their exertion level during a wall push 1 out of 10, being very easy, the exercise was progressed by increasing the range of movement to a push up off the kitchen bench. A detailed description of the elements specific to the intervention has been reported previously [10] .",

Participants in this standalone intevention reported the user-friendliness of VIPAs while participating in an upper-limb exercise program as an enabler. There is evidence to support the use of blended care, i.e. a multidisciplinary model of care to increase physical activity behaviour among community-dwelling older adults. A recent systematic review of 13,829 older adults over 65 years found interventions employing a combination of cognitive and exercise strategies were more effective than exercise alone to increase physical activity behaviour [15] . A recent systematic review of 56 studies exploring barriers that prevent ubiquitous use of telehealth reported that 17% of older adults identified hand-eye coordination, visual acuity, and mental acuity as barriers to traditional digital health delivery of part of general care [16] . Conversation-based interactions may therefore be helpful in overcoming some of the challenges of traditional digital health modalities, especially when used during exercise sessions requiring use of the hands (e.g., during upper-limb exercises). Future comparative qualitative studies are required to identify whether determinants of adherence to exercise in older adults participating in a remotely-supervised asynchronous program delivered via Alexa, differ to those for exercise interventions delivered using other digital health tools (e.g., tablets and/or smartphones). Furthermore, comparative qualitative studies are required to identify whether determinants of adherence to exercise in older adults participating in a remotely-supervised prescribed by a single exercise physiologist delivered via Alexa, differ to those for exercise interventions delivered using blended care (e.g., exercise physiologist and psychologist).",

A qualitative interpretative study examining human comparison interaction theories and para-social relationship theory with 12 VIPA users found that factors influencing acceptance and usage of VIPAs included functional and hedonic benefits, such as perceived enjoyment [17] . Furthermore, social characteristics of the VIPA, such as mimicking human-like voice attributes, may elicit a sense of social presence and assist in developing a trustworthy relationship with the user [17] .

Using the Alexa device videoconferencing feature to enable instant feedback and reassurance (e.g., regarding correct exercise technique), once a fortnight for example, may alleviate some of these concerns in future exercise trials delivered by VIPAs. However, telephone calls or videoconferencing rely on synchronous contact with a health professional, which is both time and labour intensive (and therefore costly). There is the potential to develop algorithms based on participant voice responses (e.g., regarding correct exercise technique) that can automate delivery of feedback to participants by VIPAs.",

However, this barrier did not deter our participants interacting with the Alexa to adhere to their prescribed exercise program [10] . Participants in our study reported similar themes to those in a qualitative study of nine VIPA users exploring factors influencing consumer trust with VIPAs. Participants in this study reported themes related to the unidimensional model of trust with the willingness of a VIPA user to be vulnerable to third party data monitoring as long as the VIPA can fulfill an entrusted and important task [7] . Participants in our study appeared willing to engage with Alexa irrespective of the ability of a third party (i.e., Amazon) to monitor or control personal data based on the expectation that the VIPA device would perform an action important to the user (i.e., deliver the exercise program). In addition, our participants reported their VIPA interactions outside the exercise program were primarily adopted for daily routine functions, such as asking Alexa for weather forecasts, and not for tasks where privacy and security may be of greater concern, such as for making online purchases.
