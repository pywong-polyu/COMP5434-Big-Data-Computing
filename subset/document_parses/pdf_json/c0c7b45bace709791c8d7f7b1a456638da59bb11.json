NITAGs faced challenges using their routine approach to develop recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic. In response, the WHO Regional Office for Europe (Regional Office), with the support of the Robert Koch Institute, developed an innovative approach of a series of webinars, provision of materials, and remote technical assistance to address these challenges. Polls conducted during webinars were used to tailor future webinars and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. According to poll results, 76% of participants found the webinars and resources shared very useful in their work on COVID-19 vaccination. The Regional Office plans to build further upon the scope of online communication and establish a regional online platform for NITAGs to further support NITAGs and build capacity.",

In April 2021, the WHO European Region (the Region) surpassed 1 million confirmed COVID-19 deaths; 1.6 million new cases were reported every week [1] . Vaccines against COVID-19 offer hope in containing the pandemic, protecting health care systems, saving lives and restoring global economies. Vaccine availability is limited as manufacturing of first vaccines reach full capacity and additional vaccines come to market. As part of defining an appropriate national strategy for COVID-19 vaccination, governments were therefore required to make decisions on the most efficient use of the limited vaccine supply to reduce infections, prevent severe and fatal disease and protect essential services.",

In addition, NITAGs struggled to stay up-to-date on rapidly evolving information about COVID-19 disease, risk factors for developing severe disease and death and the development of multiple vaccines with different profiles and new technologies. This struggle of NITAGs was compounded by a lack of professional networking, usually done through in-person meetings, which could not be held due to the pandemic. In addition, some Member States had an extremely short timeframe between vaccine licensure and rollout, which forced NITAGs to assess available evidence in parallel to national or regional regulators based on partially published or evolving data. The WHO Regional Office for Europe (Regional Office) has been providing constant support to newly established NITAGs to improve their functioning and ability to make evidence-based recommendations.",

To evaluate the usefulness of the webinars and their impact on Member States, the Regional Office asked participants during the 25 March 2021 webinar to indicate the topics of past webinars which were most useful to them and to evaluate the webinars and the materials shared. Most participants found the presentation of SAGE recommendations on BioNTech-Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, the European Medicines Agency preliminary data from postmarketed surveillance on adverse events following immunization and country experiences on recommendations on the prioritization of target groups for COVID-19 vaccination and implementation of COVID-19 vaccination useful (Figure 2).
