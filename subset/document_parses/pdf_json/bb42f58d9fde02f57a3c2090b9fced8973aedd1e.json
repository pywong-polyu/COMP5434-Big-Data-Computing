We recently developed a taxonomy of different ways of coordinating care for rare conditions. It is not yet known which models of care coordination are appropriate in different situations.

Many factors influenced coordination, including those relating to the patient (e.g., condition complexity, patient's location and ability to coordinate their own care), the healthcare professional (e.g., knowledge and time), the healthcare environment (e.g., resources) and societal factors (e.g., availability of funding). We developed and refined ten illustrative hypothetical models of care coordination for rare conditions. Conclusion: Findings underline that different models of care coordination may be appropriate in different situations. It is possible to develop models of care coordination which are tailored to the individual in context. Findings may be used to facilitate planning around which models of care coordination may be appropriate in different services or circumstances. Findings may also be used by key stakeholders (e.g. patient organisations, clinicians and service planners) as a decision-making tool.",

            "text": "Patients and family members are increasingly expected to be involved in the day-to-day management and organisation of their care, due to increased demands on healthcare services and a shift in accountability of healthcare [1] . This is particularly true for patients and families living with rare conditions. Rare conditions (including ultra-rare and undiagnosed conditions) are defined as those which affect up to five in every 10,000 people [2, 3] , affect many different body systems [3, 4] , and require care from a range of professionals and sectors. Previous research has found that care for people with rare conditions is often not coordinated, resulting in them attending multiple appointments, on different days, with different professionals in different locations [2, 5, 6] . Additionally, patients with rare conditions often do not have a designated care coordinator [6] [7] [8] [9] , and thus the role of coordinating care frequently falls to patients and carers [7, 8] . Within this role, patients and carers often undertake tasks such as chasing and organising appointments, chasing test results and passing information between different healthcare professionals [8] .",

Different models of care coordination may be needed for these different types of individuals/families, for example: those who live far away from the specialist centre, or are unable to travel, may require visits to specialist centres to be minimised-e.g., a greater proportion of care to be delivered locally, online or through outreach models.",

For example, condition-specific clinics allow teams to figure out who patients need to see, provide access to condition-specific expertise, ensure that all those involved in a person's care receive the same messages and may reduce travel.

For example, the nature of the condition influences collaboration as the type of clinic used depends on how multisystemic the condition is and how many disciplines it involves. Carousel clinics or MDT clinics may only be suitable for those conditions that affect multiple body systems and MDTs may only work if there is clarity over which professionals need to be seen.

The patient factor that was discussed most frequently was the patient's individual needs and preferences. For example, patient choice on who sees their records, which healthcare professionals they see, who coordinates their care and the extent to which the patient/carer are involved in coordination and meetings. Additionally, individual patient needs influence who is involved in coordination (e.g., the need for coordinated care and who is involved should be tailored and take individual family needs and ambitions into account). For example, a national care coordinator model which takes the person's individual needs into account to determine how much contact they have with their coordinator or the level of coordination. An additional factor relating to individual needs was the patient's ability to self-manage and coordinate their own care: some patients may be able to coordinate their own care, but others may be unable to do this and therefore need a coordinator who is more involved in their care.",

Our findings concur with this and highlight a range of factors that need to be considered when choosing how to coordinate care, including patient, provider, environmental and societal factors. Examples of patient factors included severity and complexity of condition, where patients live, their ability to travel and ability to coordinate care. Findings therefore indicate that it is not 'one size fits all' , and that we should develop models of care coordination that consider a range of individual, organisational and societal factors, rather than just developing different models of coordination specific to certain rare conditions. Models can then be tailored to individual situations; as with the hypothetical models proposed here. This may enable the delivery of care coordination which is equitable and family-centred, as recommended in our previous definition of care coordination [8] . Tailoring care coordination strategies to individual needs would also help to overcome some of the previously aforementioned costs associated with patients and carers coordinating their own care [7] .",

This supports previous research, which highlights the potential benefits of specialist services [22] , hub and spoke models [23, 24] and outreach models [25] for different health conditions. However, for rare conditions, our findings indicated that these models may not be appropriate in all situations, and in some situations patients may prefer specialist care provided locally (e.g., if they are unable to travel or do not live near to a specialist centre). Additionally, specialist services may not be appropriate for every condition. These findings highlight that different models of care coordination are needed for different types of families (i.e., those who live near to specialist centres, those who live far away but can travel, and those who live far away but cannot travel).",

            "text": "These findings indicate that different models of care coordination are needed to consider those who are able and want to coordinate their care and those who cannot. For example, the level/type of coordinator offered (administrative, care coordinator or clinical care coordinator) should vary depending on complexity and the patients' ability and wish to coordinate their own care. However, findings indicate that care coordinator roles do not always exist in practice and that further resources are needed (e.g., specific roles and training pathways for coordinators). Care coordinators are not new and have previously been widely implemented for adults and children with chronic conditions and mental health conditions in other countries and in the UK [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The finding that patients/carers are sometimes unable to, or do not want to, coordinate their own care is consistent with previous research that has indicated the negative impact coordinating care can have on patients and families [7, 31] and of the treatment burden more generally [1, 15] . We found that each mode of communication and coordination has benefits and challenges and findings indicate that the mode of coordination should consider many factors including individual preferences and resources available. Additionally, despite the potential of remote digital methods for use in healthcare delivery [32, 33] , findings indicate that digital appointments must not replace faceto-face appointments completely in terms of care delivery and coordination. In person face-to-face appointments were felt to be integral, particularly at key points of the patients' journey (e.g., initial meetings, diagnosis, potential deterioration), for certain conditions whereby face-to-face appointments are necessary, or for patients requiring more in-depth clinical care coordination due to additional difficulties. This extends previous research by highlighting the limits of remote digital methods of care delivery and coordination whilst emphasising the need to offer the option for multiple modes of delivery when coordinating care for patients with rare conditions.",

However, our evidence-based process and the involvement of patients, carers, healthcare professionals, charity representatives and commissioners throughout data collection and when refining the models appears to closely align with the five phases recommended for process mapping [20] : whereby multiple perspectives from different stakeholders are sought, data are then used to develop a map, the map is validated by stakeholders and then the ideas are implemented/tested.

For example, we present hypothetical models of care coordination that could be developed in practice and evaluated (e.g., in terms of their cost). It is hoped that the CONCORD flow chart (see Additional file 4) together with the findings can be used to facilitate decision-making processes regarding how care should be coordinated. These findings can be used by those involved in service planning, and those wanting to evaluate how care is coordinated. The findings can be used to inform which models of coordination may be suitable for use in different situations.

I think sometimes you can't really put a time on anything like that because, say, if you have a seizure, or something like that, or a fall, or anything, you can't really put a time on it, you need to be seen straightaway. \" (Focus group participant, patient)",
