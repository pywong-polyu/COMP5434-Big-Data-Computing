            "text": "Malaysia is listed as one of Asia's developing countries with high-road accidents rate. The accident involves the most between the motorcyclist and other vehicles such as a passenger car which is 17 times safer than the motorcyclist. Current research reveals that the three major forms of incidents in Malaysia are single-motorcycle incidents, passenger car crashes and carsmotorcycles crash. In general, the lack of accuracy of road geometric design, traffic volumes and overlapping movements of vehicles was the main cause of road accidents in Malaysia, which caused drivers to make mistakes and errors due to road geometric characteristics and traffic environments. However, during our recent COVID-19 pandemic, the traffic volumes are relatively low in the whole country as the government announces the movement control order in March 2020. The country was almost completely lockdown (people and vehicles' movements were controlled). In contrast with the reduction of the traffic volumes, the number of crashes shows relatively high numbers. This phenomenon can be derived so that other factors cause vehicle crashes and fatalities should be considered. Several factors related to road geometric such as lane width, shoulder width, access point, curve length and tangent length are considered in developing profiles of operating speed for motorcycles and cars formed of tangents and curves. The analysis of the geometric factors and traffic environments took place at federal road F0050 from 21 to 25 km in Johor, Malaysia. This study was carried out using GPS where the data (vehicles tracked movements) on the continuous speed profiles used a current method of analysis to determine the profiles of road design consistency for motorcycles and cars. The profiles are used to measure the importance index of the integrated design consistency model of the road. The model depends on parameters such as the confine region of speed profiles, average speed, and velocity deviation standard of the profiles. Therefore, a special software of ACAD was used to build the profile of the consistency model. The design accuracy of the speed profile in traffic and safety assessments are affected by the integrated-consistency model. The highest number of accidents has been identified at 24 km at F0050 based on the area design consistency where poor design is the integrated quality consistency model for car and motorcycle. The study shows that crashes and fatalities are not fully affected by traffic volumes but road design performances and driving behaviors.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one million people are killed each year, three million people are seriously injured for life and thirty million are injured in road accidents. Road accident is expected to be the third significant adding to the global burden of disease and injury in 2020. Furthermore, road accidents in Malaysia are one of the formidable problems when addressing this country's road traffic. Malaysia is also one of the Asia's developing countries suffering from high road accidents which are around 30,000 accidents recorded and for every year 1% of its fatal accidents. Vehicle crashes in Malaysia have risen over the last 30 years with a mean incidence of about 9.7% once a year, consistent with data from the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM). The vast amount of traffic on the road will lead to collisions involving various types of vehicles [1] , the most probable collision between motorcyclists and vehicles. A motorcyclist is 17 times more at risk than a passenger driver; therefore, the driver will be more at risk of injury or death 1 3 22 Page 2 of 7 because the chance of injury is greater than that of a passenger car. In addition, the probability of injury during an accident is estimated to be 12 times greater than that of a passenger vehicle [15] . Research shows that three major types of accidents are passenger vehicle collisions, other vehicle crashes and single-motorcycle injuries in Malaysia. Several cases of cars and motorcycles accidents, most of the injured were passengers, not drivers or motorcyclists where 97% of motorcyclists were killed or injured compared to 50.5% of the drivers. Moreover, 95.4% of motorcyclists were involved in high-speed motorcycles (single vehicle accidents), and 0.9% are likely to be injured and collieded with cars [5] . Some reports confirmed that most road accidents occur because of driver fault and mechanical failures such as breakdown and split of the tire. Yet, due to the road conditions, the high number of road accidents occur [1] . The road accident factor continues to increase in Malaysia due to the lack of geometric road design accuracy where drivers make mistakes on lane geometric features. There is a lack of continuity when driving along the geometric features of the road, which will increase the chance of accident [3, 6] .",

Several studies have been done by using several types of tools to measure the 85th percentile of speed at the two-lane rural roads along the horizontal curves and tangents, which were based on speed limits and types of vehicles. Most of the models produced are supported spot speed data obtained at the actual locations; therefore, the speed calculation used may be a radar gun that can provide less accuracy because the angle of reading is different from zero and drivers can drive (reduce the speed) inconsistently.",

            "text": "The consistency of design is calculated by estimating the variance of speed along successive geometric elements and assessing the deviation of speed from the standard velocity in a geometric feature section of the lane. This could cause drivers to make errors in speed that result in an increased risk of collision [7] . A road with the best quality level will influence the driving force in a safe and careful way to drive, while high speed can be affected by low consistency along a specific path between different drivers and accidents will end [13] . The features of cars, drivers and traffic affect the geometric designs. The volume and width of lanes, the existence and width of shoulders and highway medians are elements of geometric design that affect traffic operations. Therefore, the horizontal and vertical alignment of the movement of vehicles' highways and conflict streams could lead to accidents [14] . The main criteria used to evaluate design consistency are referred to as the 85th percentile vehicle speed evaluation of operating speed, and are obtained through the utilization of predictive models of operating speed. Researchers have expanded in defining the use of continuous speed profiles (area of normalized bounded by altitude). The area is used to assess the variance of vehicle speed along the road sections which are used to determine the profile design consistency for the whole road sections [4, 7, 9] . Methods of consistency assessment are developed by estimating the operating speed profile utilized in other countries such as the United States, Switzerland and Germany. In addition to the previous consistency approach [7] , the following new approaches take into account the consistency of road design. The proposed model represents the parameters as the bounded area between the profiles that are based on the average speed along a two-lane highway segment. It can be seen while the consistency of the design increases, the crash rates will show a significant decrease. The equations correspond with a function of R a (1) R a is the relative area in m/s measuring consistency, \u2211 a i is the total of i bounded area between profiles of speed and operating speed (m 2 /s), L is the segment length (m) in total where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of vehicle operating speeds (km/h), V j is the operating speed of the jth geometric element in tangent/curve (km/h), V avg is the length average weighted of operating speed at a segment (km/h), n is the geometric elements along a road segment (km/h) where V avg V i is the operating speed (km/h), and L i is the length of the segment (km).",

The multiple linear regression approach is used to use the statistical software (Minitab) to construct the 85th percentile speed prediction model. The tangent and curve sections were also considered to estimate the operating speed model for motorcycles and cars. The equation is developed using different variables: length of tangent, curve length, shoulder width, lane width and point of access. The subsequent model shows that the amount of vehicles/volumes of traffic (AADT) did not contribute to the V85 speed. The statistical findings show typical linear functions.",

This could be explained as the typical road geometric features F0050 road with high activities along the edge of a major road. Vehicles tend to slow down and reduce the speed while driving at the wider major road with roadside activities such as shops and illegal parking. However, the study has found that AP would contribute for the higher speed (+). This is true that vehicles did not reduce the speed while driving at the major road F0050 even though several access points/minor roads are found along the side of the major road. Therefore, Eqs.

The model is included with the effect of motorcycles speed profiles on design performances. Figure 6 shows an F0050 speed profile at 21-25 km between motorcycles and cars. The normalized bounded area between the motorcycles and cars speed profiles is calculated by means of the speed profiles. Table 3 demonstrates an integrated feature consistency at 21-25 km per km between motorcycles and cars. Each kilometer road section shows value-integrated consistency in design and their threshold per km. The accuracy of integrated design consistency is evaluated using Eq. (5) . The speed consistency model was developed for every kilometer (21-25 km). The consistency model along 21 km of motorcycles design consistency shows an acceptable design and good performances for cars. Motorcycles-cars integrated speed consistency shows good performances along the road sections surrounding areas with mosque, restaurants. Intersections and access points with no median/ divider were found along the sections which result in conflict movements and accidents on the road. The bounded area of speed consistency motorcycles-cars gives an acceptable performance at 22 km and the integrated consistency cars-motorcycles perform suitable profiles. The study found suitable consistency along the road Ayer Hitam-Batu Pahat Results on IC bounded profiles at 23 and 24 km for cars-motorcycles show poor design consistency while the integrated design consistency also shows poor design for both types of vehicles. This can be concluded based on areas surrounding that the road geometric design considered are not designed properly which is not suitable for traffic flow streams; the roads are located close to several road activities such as shop and illegal parking at road shoulders. Car drivers and motorcyclists commonly drive at the high speed along the federal roads, which can be derived with good performances of integrated speed consistency for cars-motorcycles. However, performances decrease as cars drive through 25 km with poor consistency same as the integrated design consistency cars-motorcycles. Vehicles tend to drive with higher speed along the section of 25 km, and cars-motorcycles travel with comfort due to straight road section which mostly results in a high accident rate.",

The conflicts would results in number of accidents on road traffic movements with particularly motorcycles and cars.

The linear lines pattern shows the motorcycles-cars speed along the segment of roads that depend on the road environmental factors: traffic signal location, access point and intersection along segments. Furthermore, architectural factors were also considered effects on motorcycle and vehicle speeds: shoulder width, lane width, and median and access point. The following model is developed based on the speed profiles establishment which relies on two main parameters: speed and road geometric features. The design consistency of every road sections is based on Eqs. (1), (2) and (3). The equations are assessed for every road segment per km. Furthermore, the bounded area between the profiles, the vehicles' average speed and the standard deviation of speeds along a two-lane highway segment was defined. A consistency model was created based on Eq. (4).",
