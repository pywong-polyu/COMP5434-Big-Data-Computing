None of our volunteers reported any new auditory symptoms following SARS-COV-2 infection. Ototacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements were used to evaluate the auditory function. Main Outcome Measure(s): OAE and ABR measurements. Results: We have found no significant differences between recovered asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients and controls in any of transitory evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), or ABR responses. Conclusions: There is no cochlear dysfunction represented by ABR, TEOAE, and DPOAE responses in recovered COVID-19 asymptomatic patients. Retrocochlear function was also preserved as evident by the ABR responses. A long-term evaluation of a larger cohort of SARS-COV-2 patients will help to identify a possible contribution of SARS-COV-2 infection to recently published anecdotal auditory symptoms associated with COVID-19.

A number of viral pathogens, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), measles, and rubella, have been linked with sensorineural deafness (5) (6) (7) (8) . The pattern of hearing loss associated with these viral infections is variable and ranges from mild to profound hearing impairment, which can be unilateral or bilateral, and may appear from birth to adulthood (9) . Viral-related auditory compromise may also present as progressive hearing loss with gradual deterioration of hearing over years following the initial insult, as is the case for congenital CMV infections (10) . While the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying auditory sequelae of viral infections are not fully elucidated, some suggest direct infection of the inner ear, while others implicate an indirect deleterious effect on the auditory pathway or compromised microvasculature of the cochlea and vestibulo-cochlear nerve (CN VIII) (9).",

In addition, a number of reports have raised concerns that SARS-CoV-2 could have a long-lasting effect on the auditory system. Asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were shown to have significantly lower hearing thresholds at 4, 6 and 8 kHz, as well as lower TEOAE averages compared with matched controls (11) . However, the differences between the groups could be explained by preferential exclusion of patients with abnormal hearing from the control group. Another report described an elderly woman who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection and presented with sensorineural hearing loss (17) . This case prompted speculation that COVID-19 could enhance oxidative stress and promote acute thrombosis, which in turn, could cause irreparable damage to the CNS hearing center (18). Another case report described a 29-year old man who presented with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHNL) and was found positive for COVID-19 even though he displayed none of the known COVID-19 symptoms at diagnosis (19) . In addition, an Iranian case series study concerned three patients who presented with SSHNL and were found positive for COVID-19 (20) . It has yet to be clarified whether the COVID-19 infection in these patients was an incidental finding or whether SSHNL could be a presenting symptom of COVID-19.",

CMV was suggested to trigger an immunemediated response that leads to profound hearing loss (10) . Rubella, on the other hand, is thought to directly damage the cochlear epithelium and stria vascularis (22) , and varicella zoster virus was shown to impair the vestibulocochlear nerve.

The reason that this study did not replicate previously reported results (11) , may be because the reduction in TEOAE previously reported in the COVID-19 group was a consequence of selection bias of hearing impaired individuals specifically in that group (11) . Interestingly, the reported results do not support the AAN theory because in such cases we would expect a normal OAE response coupled with abnormal ABR testing, while the patients in this cohort demonstrated abnormal OAE signals (ABR tests were not done). The normal results of ABR testing and the OAE response of SARS-COV-2 recovered patients in the current study is consistent with auditory pathway integrity.",

Firstly, subtle differences between study groups could be missed owing to the small sample size. Secondly, only patients with asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 viral infection and no previous auditory dysfunction were recruited. It is possible however that patients with severe SARS-COV-2 infection may develop auditory deficits not seen in the asymptomatic patients. Likewise, patients with a known history of hearing impairment before SARS-COV-2 infection may experience an exacerbation of existing hearing impairment. Furthermore, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, some treatment protocols proposed Plaquenil, a known ototoxic drug, that may lead to auditory dysfunction secondary to medical treatment. Patients' comorbidities, dependency on ventilation, impaired oxygenation, and prolonged intubation during SARS-COV-2 infection may potentially lead to long-term neurological sequela including hearing deficit. Lastly, it is possible that idiosyncratic hearing impairment may follow SARS-COV-2 viral infection in selected affected individuals. If that is the case, exploring the prevalence of hearing loss, rather than the mean OAE values, in a larger cohort, is more likely to identify such an effect.",
