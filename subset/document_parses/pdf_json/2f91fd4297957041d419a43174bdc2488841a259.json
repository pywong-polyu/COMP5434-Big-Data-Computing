            "text": "The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals' response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.",

Healthcare services in Brazil are known to be unevenly distributed across the country and also within cities . In this context, it is crucial to map where vulnerable social groups confront poor accessibility to health services. Similarly, it becomes paramount to identify which healthcare facilities are likely to face surges in demand due to the need to hospitalize severely ill patients. In this paper, we combine traditional and novel accessibility metrics to address these questions. Using network-distance metrics, we first estimate the number of vulnerable people living in areas with poor access to inpatient or outpatient facilities able to provide care for patients with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Next, we use a new balanced floating catchment area method (BFCA) proposed by (Paez et al., 2019) to analyze levels of access to hospitals that could treat patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, taking into account healthcare system capacity and competition effects for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds with mechanical ventilators. This new BFCA indicator is used to estimate income and racial inequalities in access to COVID-19 health services while accounting for congestion effects.",

This case was typical of the beginning of the epidemic in Brazil, with other early disease cases imported via international flights coming mostly from Italy and the United States . By early June, Brazil had become, after the United States, the country with the highest number of cases of COVID-19 in the world. In early July, less than five months after the first case of COVID-19 in Brazil, over 1.8 million cases have been confirmed, and over 70 thousand deaths have been attributed to the disease, 45% of which concentrated in the 20 largest cities of the country.",

This is not the case for lower-income groups, who are largely dependent on Brazil's public health system (Castro et al., 2019) , and among whom community transmission rapidly increased the number of infections. This development is particularly worrisome as low-income groups also typically face poor transport services and poor access to health, education, and employment opportunities (Pereira et al., 2019) . In fact, previous research has identified critical spatial gaps in accessibility to emergency services in Brazil . To further complicate matters, other research has linked poor accessibility to higher pneumonia mortality (Zaman et al., 2014) .",

These studies raise concerns about the overload the pandemic can generate to the public Unified Health System (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade -SUS), which already started showing signs of collapse similar to those observed in Italy and Spain (Grasselli et al., 2020; Legido-Quigley et al., 2020) . The work of Noronha et al. (2020) found that even in an optimistic scenario, of an infection level of 0.1% in the first month, roughly half of the nation's health regions would face a grave deficit of ICU beds to meet the demand for admission of COVID-19 patients. Research by Barrozo et al. (2020a) and regional modeling studies conducted by Coelho et al. (2020) and Castro et al.

The common rationale underlying FCA methods is to calculate accessibility levels in sequential steps. The first step is to calculate the provider-to-population ratio (PPR) of each health facility as a ratio between its service supply (e.g., number of ICU beds) and its potential service demand given by the population that falls within some catchment area. The second step is to calculate accessibility levels of each population center by aggregating the PPR of every healthcare provider accessible from each population center.",

Demand inflation occurs when populations that fall within the overlap of catchment areas are counted more than once as potential demand for multiple facilities. Supply inflation, on the other hand, happens when the level of service of a healthcare unit is simultaneously allocated to multiple population centers (Paez et al., 2019) . Until recently, two approaches had been proposed to address this issue. Wan et al. (2012) introduced the Three-Step Float Catchment Area (3SFCA), which deflates demand by introducing an initial step that splits a population center's potential demand over multiple health facilities proportional to transport costs/distances. Meanwhile, Delamater (2013) proposed the Modified Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (M2SFCA), which deflates the supply side by increasing the friction of distance in a way that allocates levels of service more locally. Nonetheless, both methods only partially fix the inflation problem, as they compound the effects of impedance functions to address either demand inflation (3SFCA) or supply inflation (M2SFCA).",

The new BFCA uses a standardized impedance matrix to generate a proportional allocation of demand and service level, fixing both demand and supply inflation issues in FCA calculations. The result is a more intuitive measure of accessibility that 1) accounts for competition effects, 2) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio (PPR) that is interpreted similarly to a regional PPR; and 3) preserves system-wide population and level of service, overcoming inflation issues of both demand and service levels. Estimating accessibility during a pandemic is a suitable application of this method because congestion over the short term is one of the fundamental issues to address. Therefore, the analysis must account accurately for competition for scarce resources if policy interventions are to have any hope of addressing shortfalls effectively. The BFCA approach is described in more detail in the following section.",

This threshold was chosen with a policy assumption that tries to minimize the distance that patients travel as a way to reduce contagion risks for others. In the second part of the analysis, we calculated accessibility considering as a threshold the maximum distance to the nearest hospital in each city.

For ICU beds in field hospitals, we assumed there was at least one ventilator available per bed. A limitation of this method is that it considered the ICU beds and ventilators that are in use, but these might not be the appropriate models for prolonged use as in COVID-19 cases.

The second effect is the underestimation of the demand from people from other neighboring cities who can seek admission to hospitals in the 20 cities analyzed. To minimize this second problem, we applied an adjustment factor for hospital admissions by non-residents (Brasil, 2005) according to the size of the population living in each hexagon, as suggested by Paez et al. (2019) . A factor of 1.5, for example, would simulate that the size of the demand for admission to each hospital is 50% higher due to patients living in other cities. In a recent study, Servo et al.

These health units, particularly primary health and emergency care units play a fundamental role as entry points to the system. As such, the spatial capillarity and longitudinality of these units are very important to facilitate the population's access to health services and to avoid hazardous agglomeration of patients with suspected coronavirus infection. The highest proportion of people in this situation were found in the cities of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Bras\u00edlia, Duque de Caxias, Campinas, and Goi\u00e2nia. These six cities concentrate more than 60% of the vulnerable population who live more than 30 min on foot from a health service point. However, analysis of the proportion in each city reveals that Duque de Caxias, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Bras\u00edlia, Macei\u00f3, and Campinas stand out with more than 10% of their vulnerable population living more than 30 min from a health facility qualified for this triage.",

This value is only slightly higher than the minimum recommended by the Ministry of Health under normal circumstances. The value of 1.06 can be considered insufficient in an epidemic situation, posing a risk of overload in scenarios for COVID-19 contagion indicated in previous studies (Castro et al., 2020; Noronha et al., 2020) .

In Figs. 3 and 4 below we present a set of maps that provide a detailed view of the spatial distribution of hospitals with adult ICU beds and ventilators and the level of access to these services considering competition effects. The maps on Panel 1 show the spatial distribution of hospitals. Each hospital is represented by a circle whose size reflects the ratio between the number of beds/ventilators of that hospital and the population of its catchment area. Although the situations vary across cities, as a rule, downtown areas generally concentrate the greatest number of hospitals, especially the ones with more beds per inhabitant. This is the case, for example, in Fortaleza, Manaus, and Rio de Janeiro. The availability of ICU beds and ventilators to serve patients with severe COVID-19 tends to be considerably lower in the peripheral regions of these cities. In these regions, it is common to observe ratios of ICU beds per 10 thousand inhabitants between 0.5 and 1.0. These ratios can be considered critical against a backdrop of an epidemic with growing numbers of patients needing hospitalization for respiratory complications. The example of cities like Rio de Janeiro also illustrates how setting up field hospitals in farther areas can increase the capillarity of health services in epidemic situations like the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Compared to the results in Panel 1, these maps present in more detail how the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare is particularly higher in central urban areas. This is perhaps more clearly seen in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where accessibility to equipped beds steadily declines from the central parts of the city to the periphery. Considering the average population per tile of the hexagonal grid in S\u00e3o Paulo, this indicates that in the regions with the highest accessibility, there are approximately 0.000012 beds per 10,000 people serving on average 1240 persons. This translates into 9.76e-6 beds per person, compared to 8.74e-5 beds per person average for S\u00e3o Paulo. This shows how the regional PPR can be misleading, by assuming that every person in the region has equal access to medical facilities. Analysis using the BFCA indicator also illustrates how living close to a hospital does not necessarily translate into high levels of accessibility once congestion effects are taken into account. This is the case in cities like Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo, where some peripheral neighborhoods, despite being close to a hospital, face poor access to health services due to the limited capacity of the healthcare system to support the expected demand of much larger areas.",

It is possible to see that even in those places with low accessibility, there are pockets where the situation is made worse by afflicting larger populations. The figures in Panel 3 are useful to differentiate low-accessibility areas with large and small population numbers, which can provide actionable information for policy-makers to choose which low-accessibility areas should be prioritized in emergency situations.",

Combined, the analyses presented provide valuable information that can help local authorities map the areas which should receive more immediate response from local healthcare community agents and perhaps the construction of new field hospitals to address short-term needs induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We mapped approximately 228 thousand vulnerable people (low-income and above 50 years old) living more than 30 min walking from primary and emergency care units. We also found some 1.6 million vulnerable people living farther than 5 km from a hospital with capacity for ICU admission. Because patients suspected of COVID-19 might face mobility constraints due to grave conditions, it becomes crucial to develop strategies to provide transport and health services to these people. This is particularly true of low-income communities on the outskirts of cities, where there are fewer mobility options and where health services are scarce.",
