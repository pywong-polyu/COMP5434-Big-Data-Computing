[8] [9] [10] [11] In Ireland, the first known case of COVID-19 was reported on 29 February 2020. 12 In subsequent weeks, the Irish Government introduced various public health measures to curb the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, cessation of large indoor gatherings, contact tracing for potential cases, and stay-at-home and social distancing measures, in addition to increasing funding for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and re-registering former healthcare workers. 13 Ireland has since undergone several waves of COVID-19, including a substantial third wave during the 2020 Christmas period. 14 Public health measures, including strict lockdown procedures and mask/face covering regulations, were implemented to mitigate these waves. 12 At the time of writing, the nation had recently been heavily impacted by the Delta variant, which brought the total number of deaths from COVID-19 to over 5600 individuals, representing a death rate of approximately 1.1%. 15 However, Ireland has implemented one of the strongest vaccination campaigns in the European Union, which has resulted in over 89% of the eligible population (ie, those aged over 12 years) being fully vaccinated since its launch in December 2020. 16 The National Ambulance Service (NAS) has been at the forefront of the HSE response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland since the first wave. This required NAS to undergo swift and substantial changes, including the urgent implementation of a COVID-19 testing service, which was central to the national COVID-19 screening programme. 17 18 To oversee the delivery of this service, NAS established the COVID-19 Response Room in its headquarters in Dublin. This was the only centre in Ireland dedicated to managing all referrals for COVID-19 tests and organising home testing for patients who cannot attend mass testing centres, as well as on-site testing for individuals living and working in residential facilities, such as nursing homes. It is staffed by a single team who were drawn from a variety of disciplines and professions, including general practitioners (GPs), nurses, administrators, dispatchers and call-takers. Some were recruited from within NAS. Others were recruited from different health service sectors or the Irish Defence Forces and thus had not previously worked in an ambulance dispatch environment. The response room structure and processes have evolved over the course of the pandemic and will continue to evolve while the pandemic endures. Moreover, the response room could be reinstituted in the event of future pandemics or similar emergencies. Therefore, this research aimed to examine the quality of the response room service by identifying practices and innovations that worked well, in addition to those that did not work well, in order to prepare for further COVID-19 waves or new crises, as well as to improve routine service. This examination was guided by a national QI framework: the HSE Framework for Improving Quality. 19 The research will inform the preparation of health services, particularly Emergency Medical Services (EMS), for future crises.",

The research paradigm was pragmatism, as this study was a component of a mixed methods evaluation of the NAS response to the pandemic. 20 The full protocol of this evaluation was published prior to the present qualitative study being conducted. 17 The qualitative method used in this study was the semi-structured, individual interview. This technique entails a discussion between a researcher and a participant that is guided by a flexible interview schedule comprising a shortlist of opening questions and a range of potential follow-up questions and probes. 21 The schedule is typically designed to ensure that data are captured relating to core topics while maintaining sufficient flexibility to allow participants to bring their own perspectives and personalities to the fore. 22 Amendments can be made to the schedule as the study progresses, including removing ineffective questions or adding probes to explore new issues raised by participants in previous interviews. 21 The semi-structured approach enables the researcher to develop rapport, discuss sensitive or complex topics, explore unexpected responses and identify issues valued by the participants. 21 23 In this study, the interview schedule was reviewed and, where necessary, refined following each interview, though its core content remained the same across the interviews (online supplemental file 1). The interviews took place between 7 December 2020 and 5 January 2021, when Ireland had entered a third COVID-19 wave. 14 By this time, NAS had screened many tens of thousands of patients for COVID-19. Physical distancing regulations and travel restrictions meant that participants were interviewed via telephone. The study has been reported in line with the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (online supplemental file 2). 24 QI framework This research was informed by the HSE Framework for Improving Quality, which aims to guide the thinking,",

            "text": "Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted in accordance with an established procedure developed by Braun and Clarke (2006; 2019; 2020) . [30] [31] [32] This procedure comprises six main analytical phases: familiarising oneself with the data, generating initial codes, generating initial themes, reviewing themes, defining themes and producing the written report. A theme represents a pattern of response or meaning within the dataset that is salient to the research question. 30 In this procedure, the analysis is conducted at a point on the spectrum between primarily inductive analyses, which prioritise data-based meaning, and primarily deductive analyses, which prioritise analyst-based or theory-based meaning. 32 33 Inductive analyses are firmly grounded in the data, though they are not purely and exclusively data-driven, as researchers cannot completely free themselves from their assumptions, aims and knowledge of the literature. 30 32 Deductive analyses use existing research and theory as a lens through which the data are interpreted, which includes exploring evidence for themes identified by previous research or using an established framework to inform the coding of the data. 32 They often include inductive elements, such as inductive coding, generating inductive subthemes within deductive themes, mapping inductive themes onto deductive themes or generating both inductive and deductive themes. [33] [34] [35] [36] The deductive approach is commonly used to evaluate, explicate, amend or challenge an existing framework, rather than to simply endorse it. 36 37 The importance of the framework and its components can increase or decrease as the analysis progresses depending on the researcher's assessment of its relevance and utility. 36 37 In the current study, the analysis was conducted by the first author and was supported by QSR International NVivo V.12 software. The analysis was primarily deductive, as it was underpinned by the Framework for Improving Quality. 19 30 This framework had not been developed for or previously applied to pandemic-imposed change. The analysis explored experiences and perceptions of the QI drivers from the framework within a pandemicresponse room. The framework could be amended as part of the analysis because the aim was to ensure that all key patterns from the dataset were adequately represented, rather than to uncritically support the framework. For example, new drivers could be added to the framework or existing drivers could be re-contextualised or removed from the framework. The analysis began with immersion in the interview recordings and transcripts. Subsequently, the entire dataset, including extracts that appeared to be unrelated to the framework, was coded inductively to ensure that nothing of importance was overlooked and that the meaning communicated by the participants was captured. 30 34 The codes were then refined and assigned to relevant themes. Peer debriefing enhanced the trustworthiness of the analysis. [38] [39] [40] Debriefing entailed the first and second authors meeting to compare their interpretations of a subset of four transcripts. No substantial discrepancies were identified, indicating that the analysis was not restricted to the perspective of a single researcher. Additionally, the research team met regularly to discuss the data analysis. Disconfirming evidence analysis was also used to bolster trustworthiness. [38] [39] [40] This involved returning to the dataset to ensure that the themes had sufficient evidence and that any pertinent contradictory evidence was reported. [38] [39] [40] Ultimately, six themes were derived from the QI drivers of the framework. They represented the participants' experiences and interpretations of these drivers in the context of a pandemic response room. Furthermore, a seventh theme, which was also a QI driver, was added so that all salient patterns from the dataset were captured.",

            "text": "This study examined the quality of service in a pandemic response room dedicated to delivering the Irish national COVID-19 home and residential testing programme. It provided unique insights on QI at a time of crisis. Specifically, it explored the experiences and perceptions of pandemic response room staff regarding key QI drivers from the Framework for Improving Quality. The first such driver was leadership for quality. The results underscore the importance of person-centred, rather than task-centred, leadership that entails attending to staff well-being and regularly communicating and consulting with staff, which includes enabling them to openly share ideas and report Open access errors. This finding aligns with best practice recommendations for healthcare leadership in a pandemic, which include distributed leadership and deference to expertise, frequent and open communication, and meeting physical and psychological safety needs. 1 41 42 Moreover, the results indicate that any employee can display leadership in this environment by being self-sufficient, using their initiative to solve problems, and by training and supporting colleagues. This somewhat corresponds with the Safety Differently approach to improving safety, which entails creating a culture where staff are viewed as a source of solutions, rather than problems, and where all employees, including frontline workers, are encouraged to take ownership of safety processes. 43 The second QI driver was person and family engagement. The findings show that staff endeavoured to provide person-centred care, including listening to patients and their families and tailoring the service to their individual needs. However, pandemic pressures impeded formal engagement, such as requesting feedback and making shared decisions about care design and delivery. In line with published guidance, formal engagement was recommended for future pandemics. 44 45 This engagement should be meaningful, rather than tokenistic, such that it entails partnering with patients to design, plan and produce healthcare and sharing leadership, power and decision-making. 44 45 This has the potential to improve the clarity of pandemic-related communications, increase adherence to pandemic isolation measures, and enhance the support provided to caregivers during the crisis. 45 The third QI driver was staff engagement. The results suggest that working in a response room can affect wellbeing, especially during case surges. Previous investigations confirm that the well-being of EMS professionals can be impaired by the pandemic, though they largely focused on paramedics and first responders, rather than dispatch or response room staff. [46] [47] [48] [49] In the current study, staff reported benefiting from organisational and peer support, as well as networking and learning opportunities. Greater teambuilding and training would have bolstered integration and cooperation, particularly for staff recruited from external organisations. Such activities should be virtual, outdoors or distanced to protect staff during the pandemic.",

The substantial workload and uncertainty created by the pandemic, especially the first wave, was frequently cited as the reason for this lack of rigour.

Another limitation was that the participants were recruited via an email sent by a NAS manager on behalf of the university research team. The university researchers did not have access to the contact details of current and former response room staff due to data protection concerns. Additionally, NAS advised that response room staff would be unlikely to respond to an external email from the university, especially when dealing with the third wave. However, a disadvantage of this approach Open access is that the participants could have been concerned about their anonymity, which could have affected their willingness to openly discuss their experiences and opinions. In particular, they could have felt uncomfortable providing negative feedback. To help counter this, they were assured that the interviewers were external to NAS, the interviews would be confidential and would not be used for performance evaluation, and the participants would not be identifiable in any reports produced. They also received a copy of their transcript, which provided an opportunity to raise concerns or make clarifications, though none availed of this.

For example, important themes that do not match the framework could be overlooked. Conversely, inductive approaches typically produce results that are more strongly linked to the participants' responses. However, in contrast with this perspective, it has been argued that existing frameworks and orienting concepts can sensitise researchers to relevant issues and interpretations that they might not have identified themselves using an inductive approach, resulting in a rich description of the phenomenon. 36 Furthermore, no qualitative analysis is entirely inductive because they cannot be conducted in a vacuum isolated from the researcher's preconceptions, including their knowledge of relevant literature and theory. 30 55 56 In both inductive and deductive reflexive thematic analysis, themes are not viewed as residing within the dataset waiting to be discovered by the researcher or to emerge during the analysis. 27 31 Instead, the researcher is regarded as having a central and active role in the construction of themes at the intersection of the data, the analytic process, the research aims and the researcher's subjectivity, theoretical understanding, training, and experience. 27 31 In the current study, efforts were made to minimise the risk of important themes being overlooked due to the deductive nature of the analysis. Specifically, the entire dataset was coded openly, including responses that seemed unrelated the Framework for Improving Quality. 30 34 This led to amendment of the framework through the addition of a seventh QI driver, 'Information and communications technology for quality'. However, it remains possible that some key concepts or patterns were missed. An alternative approach (eg, inductive thematic analysis, grounded theory) would likely have produced different results that were more data-driven, rather than theory-driven. Despite this limitation, deductive analysis has become an established approach in healthcare research, including QI and emergency care research. 37 57-60 For example, a recent study applied an existing health psychology framework to the analysis of interviews with first response volunteers in order to identify barriers to automated external defibrillator use. 60 Ultimately, both deductive and inductive analyses are acceptable provided that the researcher is transparent about which approach is used and what its implications and limitations are so that the findings can be interpreted and contextualised appropriately. 30 35 54 Conclusion This study examined the quality of service in pandemic response room that coordinated the Irish national COVID-19 home and residential testing programme. It provided unique insights on staff experiences in a NAS in the midst of a crisis and represented a novel application of the Framework for Improving Quality in the context of pandemic-imposed change. The findings indicate that the framework, which comprises six QI drivers (eg, staff engagement, governance), should be expanded to include a seventh driver (ie, ICT), especially when used to address pandemics and similar emergencies. The findings also suggest that, while there were many areas that performed well within the response room (eg, personcentred leadership, patient-centred care), there were also areas requiring improvement. In particular, there was a need for a more formal and rigorous approach to patient and staff engagement and the implementation of QI methods and measurement. This follows calls for research that improves the rigour and quality of improvement practices and evaluations. 11 Additionally, there have been calls for clinical research and practice during the pandemic to balance the urgent implementation of change and rapid conduct of studies with the preservation of quality and integrity. 9 This study can inform EMS and other health services in their QI activities and in preparation for and response to future public health crises.",
