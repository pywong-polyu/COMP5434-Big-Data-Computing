EB affects patients and their families physically, socially, and emotionally. Objective: This study aimed to assess the family quality of life of these patients using the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) questionnaire. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled caregivers of patients with EB registered at the Molecular Dermatology Research Center, affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, up to 2020. Participants filled out a demographic data collection form and the FDLQI questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 22. Results: Overall, 80 participants, consisting of 65 mothers (81.2%) and 15 fathers (18.7%) as primary caregivers, were enrolled in this study. The average FDLQI score was 19.88 \u00b1 4.71. The FDLQI scores of caregivers of patients with EB simplex was significantly lower than scores observed in those with other types of EB ( p < .001). There was a significant positive association between the number of patients with EB in the family and FDLQI score ( p = .049). FDLQI scores were lower in caregiving mothers who had a higher education ( p < .001) and those who were employed ( p < .001).",

Although there is no accurate estimate of the prevalence of EB in Iran, available data suggest that the proportion of affected cases, particularly recessive forms of EB, appears to be higher due to a higher number of consanguineous marriages ( Parvizi et al., 2017 ) .",

In this context, a specific instrument to assess the quality of life in patients with EB (QoL EB questionnaire) has been developed and is currently used for patient care and research purposes ( Frew and Murrell, 2010 ; Frew et al., 2009 ) . Furthermore, EB has been shown to have a considerable clinical and socioeconomic impact on patients and their families ( Jain and Murrell, 2018 ) . In this regard, a general approach to evaluating the QoL of patients' families or caregivers is required to evaluate the burden of the disease ( Basra et al., 2007 ) . Generic and specific QoL tools have been introduced for patients with dermatologic conditions ( Horn and Tidman, 2002 ; Tabolli et al., 2009 ) and their families. ( Basra et al., 2007 ; Ferrario et al., 2004 ) . The Family Dermatologic Life Quality Index (FDLQI) is a basic dermatologyspecific instrument that can be self-administered and used as an alternative outcome indicator in clinical practice and research ( Basra et al., 2007 ) . It may be used in conjunction with other health-status indicators to discuss concerns, such as health care funding and resource allocation within and between specialties. It assesses the effect of skin disorders on family members over the previous month. The FDLQI questionnaire has been translated into and validated in many languages, including the Persian language ( Safizadeh et al., 2014 ) . In addition, effort s have been undertaken to specifically assess the burden of disease on families of children with EB, and a specific questionnaire (Epidermolysis Bullosa Burden of Disease) has been developed ( Dufresne et al., 2015 ) .",

All these factors could be associated with the patient's socioeconomic status and the fact that employed mothers could seek outside help (parttime nurses and cleaning personnel) and pay these costs. Angelis et al. (2016) reported that EB in children affects FQoL through repeated medical visits, hospitalizations, and direct non-health care informal costs (i.e., caregivers' dedication time). Moreover, EB in adults affects FQoL by direct health care costs, especially hospitalizations, repeated medical visits, and health-related materials and equipment, as well as rehabilitation, which represented the vast majority of costs. EB's social/economic burden, shared between the high direct non-health care costs arising from informal care and the loss of labor productivity, reinforces the importance of not limiting the cost analysis to the direct costs of health care ( Angelis et al., 2016 ; Flannery et al., 2020 ) . Future public policy decisions and strategies at a national level for EB and other genetic diseases should seek to consider cost inequalities at the patient level and the impact of health-related QoL. To our knowledge, policies that provide allowances and other benefits to caregivers of patients with EB exist in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and possibly other countries ( Murrell, 2010 ) .",

In addition, the study demonstrated that the psychological and social aspects of the life of patients with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses and their families were affected by this disease ( Abeni et al., 2021 ) . Moreover, Dufresne et al. (2013) found that therapeutic educational programs in a neutral place (out of routine therapeutic and health care centers) for patients with ichthyoses improved the patients' and their families' knowledge and social skills, which could be considered in future studies on Iranian patients with EB. Furthermore, in a study by Sjedianfard et al. (2021) on FQoL in patients with pemphigus vulgaris, FQoL was shown to be poorer in families with male patients, older patients, and shorter duration of disease, as well as in lower-educated caregivers.",

Second, we did not evaluate patients' QoL in this study, so we recommend that future studies be conducted to compare patient QoL with their FQoL using the validated QoL EB instrument. Third, our study was conducted with a standard structured questionnaire, but the FQoL of these patients could be evaluated by more items, so we recommend that further qualitative studies be undertaken that could reveal more aspects of FQoL in families of patients with EB. Moreover, the parameters related to the FQoL of fathers as caregivers of patients with EB in this study were not significant. However, as stated previously, this could be due to the low number of fathers who participated in this study. Therefore, we recommend that FQoL be evaluated separately for both the father and mother of each family, irrespective of who is the main caregiver, and compared with each other to obtain better and more comprehensive data.",

Also, we wanted to check FQoL in a real-life setting. In addition, cultural and religious issues and values can also affect QoL and can vary from one place to another; this was not considered in this study. Finally, our study was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and previous studies have shown that COVID-19 has affected the QoL of the Iranian population ( Mirzaei et al., 2021 ; Vahedian-Azimi et al., 2020 ) , so we recommend that this study be repeated after the COVID-19 pandemic to clear any biases. Furthermore, the authors suggest that knowing whether there is any correlation between FDQoL score and EB-specific disease manifestations (e.g., dysphagia due to esophageal strictures or other symptoms) would be of interest in future studies.",

QoL studies help in understanding the impact of the disease on daily life and provide insights useful for treatment and monitoring. This small-scale study showed that chronic and serious skin diseases, such as EB, could cause a significant burden on the patients' family members. Overall, the care and management of these patients needs adequate psychological support to improve patients' and their families' QoL. Families of patients with EB who have a lower socioeconomic status and unemployed caregivers require special attention. Future multicenter studies with a larger sample size are recommended to determine the many parameters these patients and their families face and can help in the design strategies for improvement of their QoL.",
