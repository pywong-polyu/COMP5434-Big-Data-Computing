We found that the growth of COVID-19 cases follows a power regime of (t 2 , t, ...) after the exponential growth. We found the optimal change points from where the COVID-19 cases shifted their course of growth from exponential to quadratic and then from quadratic to linear. After that, we saw a sudden spike in the course of the spread of COVID-19 and the growth moved from linear to quadratic and then to quartic, which is alarming. We have also found the best fitted regression models using the various criteria, such as significant p-values, coefficients of determination and ANOVA, etc. Further, we search the best-fitting ARIMA model for the data using the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and provide the forecast of COVID-19 cases for future days. We also use usual exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters models for forecasting purpose. We further found that the ARIMA (5, 2, 5) model is the best-fitting model for COVID-19 cases in India.",

A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25 to April 14, which was later extended to May 3. The whole country was divided into containment zones (where large number of cases were observed from a relatively smaller region), red zones (districts where risk of transmission was high and had higher doubling rates), green zones (districts with no confirmed case from last 21 days) and orange zones (which did not fall into the above three zones). After the further extension of the lockdown till May 17, various economic activities were allowed to start (with high surveillance) in areas of less transmission. Further, the lockdown was extended to May 31 and some more economic activities have been allowed as per the transmission rates, which are the rates at which infectious cases cause new cases in the population, i.e. the rate of spread of the disease. This was further extended to June 8, with very less rules and especially the states were given the responsibility of setting the lockdown rules. The air and rail transport became open for general public. Post June 8, we see that the restrictions are nominal with even shopping malls and religious places open for general public. Now, the responsibility of imposing restrictions lies with the respective State Governments.",

            "text": "On the other hand, Indian scientists and researchers are also working on addressing the issues arising from the pandemic, including production of PPE kits and test kits as well as studying the behaviour of spread of the disease and other aspects of management. Various mathematical and statistical methods have been used for predicting the possible spread of COVID-19. The classical epidemiological models (SIR, SEIR, SIQR etc.) suggested the increasing trend of the virus and predicted the peaks of the pandemic. Early researches showed the pandemic to reach its peak by mid-May. They also showed that the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the doubling rates are lower in India, with comparison to European nations and the USA. A tree-based model was proposed by Arti and Bhatnagar (2020) and Bhatnagar (2020) to study and predict the trends. They suggest that lockdown and social distancing in India have played a significant role to control the infection rates. But now, as the lockdown restrictions are minimal, the cases in India are growing at an alarming high rate. Chatterjee et al. (2020) suggest growth of the pandemic through power law and its saturation at the later stages. Due to the complexities in the epidemic models of COVID-19, various researchers have been focusing on the data to forecast the future cases. Chatterjee et al. (2020) , Verma et al. (2020) and Ziff and Ziff (2020) suggest that after exponential growth, the total count follows a power regime of t 3 , t 2 , t and \u221a t before flattening out, where 't' refers to time. It can, therefore, be realized that there is an urgent need to model and forecast the growth of COVID-19 in India as the virus is in the growing stage here.",

On the other hand, the individual p values are significant for Fig. 1 Trend of RSS and optimum \u00b5 for exponential-quadratic regression model For Region V, from Table 6 , we see that the R 2 values of all the models are very high (quadratic, cubic, quartic and quintic models have exceptionally high).

After May 15 to May 31, we again saw a spike in the cases that lead to a quadratic growth of the pandemic. And, from June 1 to July 11, we saw a major spike in the growth of the pandemic as it has followed quartic growth. Verma et al. (2020) showed the four stages of the epidemic, S1: exponential, S2: power law, S3: linear and S4: flat. We saw that the course of COVID-19 in India followed this regime till May 15. But after the linear trend from May 3 to May 15, the spread has again reached the quadratic growth and from June 1 to July 11, India is witnessing a quartic growth. This might be attributed to the relaxation of lockdown measures in the country. Though it was much likely that the cases would start to reduce post-linear stage growth as the total cases may start to follow a square root equation, i.e. y(t) \u223c \u221a t. And this might lead to reduction in the daily number of cases (asy \ufffd (t) \u223c 1\u2215 \u221a t ,) leading to flattening of the curve. But, due to reduced restrictions, we see a reverse trend, which might be alarming and suggest the imposition of strict lockdown to reverse this trend of pandemic growth. If we continue to open our economy in this way, we might go back to the exponential growth of the pandemic and this would lead to huge destruction to human lives and cause a greater impact on our economy.",

The basic exponential smoothing is not very accurate for our case, but we see that the Holt-Winters model is around 97.11% accurate. Both ARIMA (5, 2, 5) and Holt-Winters models suggest a rise in the number of cases in the coming days. We observed that both the ARIMA and Holt-Winters models capture the data well and the actual data from 11th July validate the forecasts well as they lie in the predicted confidence intervals. But, while validating the model, the actual values are always near to the Upper Confidence Limits, it might be possible that in further days, our model might underestimate the cases. This might be possible because of the changing trend of the growth of the pandemic in India.",
