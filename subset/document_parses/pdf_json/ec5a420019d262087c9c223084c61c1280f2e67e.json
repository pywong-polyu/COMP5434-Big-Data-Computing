Increased studies have revealed that asymptomatic carriers substantially impact the epidemic and that asymptomatic transmission is very common. erefore, the asymptomatic transmission threat to the spread of the pandemic should not be neglected. Methods. e local outbreak in Taiwan, especially in Taipei City, is unprecedented and paramount and has claimed hundreds of lives, tens of thousands of cases, and enormous economic costs. As care providers and gatekeepers of infectious diseases, Taipei City Hospital has to perform regular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results of admitted patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) to achieve these goals. Results. In this study, the results revealed a low positive rate of less than 1%, but the asymptomatic proportions could range from 42% to 46%, which bolsters that systematic screening was effective in controlling coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) of Novel Coronavirus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and might be an exemplar to other similar scenarios. Universal screening of admitted patients may be important and necessary, especially in asymptomatic patients. Conclusions. Regular screening for healthcare providers is also important during this pandemic, and it is recommended that admitted patients and healthcare providers undergo systemic PCR testing.",

Looking back to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), most infectious patients were febrile (98% percent from a previous report [2] ). Additionally, symptoms other than classical upper respiratory tract infection may occur, such as smell and taste dysfunction [3, 4] . Moreover, some reports [2] revealed that some COVID-19 contraction might be due to asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread, which is quite a different scenario from the SARS pandemic in 2003 [5] . is also means that containing COVID-19 could be more difficult than SARS. us, implementing systematic screening for SARS-CoV-2 to identify potential COVID-19 cases might be a good shot to contain COVID-19, but this would raise the concern of the cost effectiveness as the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests might burn much Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and cost health professional manpower as well. In contrast, overlooked COVID-19 cases may lead to further outbreaks as the transmission is exponentially fast. In this way, morbidities and mortalities could be even more disastrous. Moreover, economic costs are another issue and may result in further losses, such as mental breakdown and other sufferings.",

For example, the caregivers of admitted patients were restricted to only one member per patient based on the guidelines of Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). Moreover, the patient, caregivers, and HCWs were required to undergo routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR); patients and caregivers required a negative RCR test result within 72 hours before admission and after that. Moreover, HCWs need to undergo PCR nasopharyngeal swab tests every week. Nasopharyngeal swabs were performed by a specially trained and dedicated team throughout the study period.

Given the novelty of the virus, the lack of immunity has resulted in a high likelihood of people around the world becoming ill upon the first contact with SARS-CoV-2. Under a pandemic scenario, the management approach of asymptomatic carriers who may spread the virus is one challenge that needs to be mitigated. Asymptomatic carriers are likely to spread the virus. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on the evacuation of German nationals from Wuhan, it can be concluded that transmission of the virus may occur even in SARS-CoV-2 carriers without fever or other symptoms of infection [7] . According to the study, the primary target or receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in type II pneumocyte in the lungs, goblet cells, and epithelial cells in the nose, which causes postinflammatory immunoreaction, so the severity of viral infection is closely related to the maturity and binding capacity of ACE2. erefore, we propose that the lower level and insufficient binding capacity of ACE2 is a biological factor for asymptomatic or mild symptomatic clinical presentation [7, 8] .",

Although the proportion of asymptomatic carriers is important, the transmissibility of asymptomatic carriers is more concerning. e WHO has not yet conducted any large-scale or in-depth research on asymptomatic carriers and even emphasized early on during the epidemic that such population groups were extremely rare.
