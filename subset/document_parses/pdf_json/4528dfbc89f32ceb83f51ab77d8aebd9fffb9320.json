Aims. To describe the efficacy and applicability of a new device (Spyder) in detecting cardiac arrhythmias with midterm ECG monitoring. Methods. A descriptive, prospective study was performed on 26 consecutive patients who underwent midterm ECG monitoring with the novel ECG patch device (Spyder). e study was conducted over a 6-month period from August 2020 to February 2021. Results. Twenty-six patients (mean age, 57.8 \u00b1 12.5 years; men, 77%) wearing a Spyder wireless ECG-monitoring device were recruited. e mean wearing time was 84 hours. e main indications for using the device were detection of recurrent atrial fibrillation after radiofrequency ablation (30.7%) and screening for atrial fibrillation after cryptogenic stroke (23.1%). All ECG monitor recordings obtained during the study period were of good quality. e device detected 12 episodes of atrial fibrillation in eight patients, one episode of ventricular tachycardia, one supraventricular tachycardia event, one case of paroxysmal third-degree atrioventricular block, and five cases of frequent premature ventricular contraction. e time to detection of the first episodes of atrial fibrillation and ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia was 28.8 and 47 hours, respectively. Conclusions. e new wearable wireless ECG-monitoring device (Spyder) is a feasible and effective method for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias.",

            "text": "e worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resultant infections and deaths have necessitated changes in routine cardiology practice. Wireless devices and remote technologies may help cardiologists minimize direct contact between healthcare personnel and patients, which is an integral step in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Detection of arrhythmias poses a major challenge for cardiologists in this regard, and ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring should be considered in patients with suspected cardiac arrhythmias [1] . In clinical practice, the 24 h Holter ECG is commonly used to monitor cardiac-related symptoms. However, it can only detect approximately 1%-5% of arrhythmias, and a number of patients required longer periods of hospitalization to identify the cause of the arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of COVID-19 contamination. Continuous ECG monitoring for more than 24 h is preferred to detect more silent heart rhythm disorders [2] , and external ECG recorders have been shown to be noninvasive and more feasible with high efficacy. Of these, transtelephonic ECG event monitors (e.g., AliveCor and Apple watch) record only snapshot (symptomatic) events, usually over a duration of 30-45 s. In contrast, patch-based ambulatory ECG-monitoring devices record longer ECGs for up to several days or weeks. A number of devices (Zio Patch, SEEQ MCT, and Mypatch) have been shown to be useful for patch-based ambulatory ECG monitoring [3] . However, these devices are still not officially recommended for clinical practice because they often indirectly use pulse signals to record arrhythmias.",

Moreover, in comparison with traditional 3-5-lead Holter ECG devices, the Spyder device allowed real-time detection of arrhythmias instead of a replay. However, the major limitations of the device were that patients were required to be familiar with smartphone usage, and they had to limit bathing while wearing the device.
