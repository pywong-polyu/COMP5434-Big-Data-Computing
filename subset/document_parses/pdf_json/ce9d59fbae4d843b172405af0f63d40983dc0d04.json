This study compares the impacts of standard air-purifying respirators and powered air-purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios. Twenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills, either unprotected (control), or wearing a standard or a powered respirator. Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared. In the wearer comfort evaluation form, operators rated mobility, noise, heat, vision and speech intelligibility. All anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events. Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq TM ; 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively. Videolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used. Anaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group. We conclude that standard and powered respirators do not significantly prolong simulated advanced intubation procedures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Airway management in critically ill patients contaminated with chemical, biological radiological or nuclear substances requires personal protective equipment (PPE) [1, 2] . The past two decades have focused on the hazards for frontline medical staff posed by the deliberate release of weaponised chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances. The occupational hazards of healthcare workers during naturally occurring pandemics, however, have a much longer history. Bio-aerosol infection risks to healthcare professionals may arise from direct patient contact, but are especially high during aerosol-generating procedures such as: intubation; bronchoscopy; noninvasive ventilation; high-frequency oscillating ventilation; induction of sputum; and surgical procedures involving high speed devices. Notably, during the 2003 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome pandemic, 21% of those who had the disease were healthcare workers [3] . In Canada, this was reported as 43%, with anaesthetists being amongst the highest risk group [3, 4] .

Our main finding was that the use of videolaryngoscopy for difficult airway management proved to have certain advantages whilst wearing respiratory protection.

All volunteers had been instructed they could withdraw from the study at any time if they wished. The study started in December 2019 and finished in February 2020. All participants wore a long-sleeved surgical gown and gloves during the procedures. The powered respirator used the 3M Scott-Duraflow platform (Powered Air-Purifying Respirator, 3M Scott Safety Ltd, West Pimbo, Skelmersdale, UK) (Fig. 1). As a headtop, a loose fitting flow-hood was used which was connected via a corrugated hose. The fan-unit, weighting 1.4 kg with filters and battery, provides a guaranteed airflow of 160 l.min \u00c01 , has a battery operating time of 8 h from a single charge and has a sound level of less than 70 dB. The standard respirator was the First Responder Respirator (FRR, 3M Scott Safety Ltd, West Pimbo, Skelmersdale, UK) (Fig. 2). This full-face respirator is the civilian version of the UK Ministry of Defence General Service respirator approved to the regulatory standards of EN136 Class 3 and BS8468-2 for use in a Powered air-purifying respirator with hood. chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear environment. The FRR it weighs 640 g, has a panoramic visor and has rebreathed carbon dioxide levels significantly below 1%. Both respiratory protective devices used the 3M TM Scott TM CFR32 CBRN A2B2E2K2-P3 R filter, with its EN148-1 compliant 40-mm thread, designed for use with defence and public safety respirators. The filter is suitable for military and 'first responder' applications. It protects against toxic industrial chemicals and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare agents, including: gases and vapours from organic compounds with a boiling point above 65\u00b0C; inorganic gases and vapours; solid and liquid toxic and radioactive particulates; and micro-organisms, for example, bacteria and viruses. The third ensemble, which was used as a control, was standard operating department attire and a long-sleeved surgical gown. The airway scenarios were carried out on a Laerdal Airway Management Trainer TM (Laerdal Medical Ltd, Orpington, UK). The manikin was placed on a standard stretcher, and the scenarios were carried out in one of our main operating theatres (in-situ simulation). The airway management protocol was guided by the Difficult Airway Society guidelines for the management of unanticipated difficult intubation [15] and compliant with our local guidelines and the routine airway management equipment used in our hospital. Participants undertook the tasks in all three protection levels (control, plus the two with respiratory protective equipment). The airway tasks remained identical in each group; however, we randomised the order in which the two types of respiratory protective equipment and standard operating department attire was worn, to counter any learning effects. The order of respirator/standard theatre wear use was determined by opening sealed envelopes before starting the simulation. The investigator was blinded to the contents of the envelope and each envelope was externally identical. All volunteers were briefed on the scenario and the sequence of the tasks, and received formal training in the respiratory protective equipment used. A conventional laryngoscope with a size 3 Macintosh blade was used in the control group and a standard Airtraq TM , size green, using the eyepiece, was the device used for indirect tracheal intubation in the Airtraq group (Airtraq, Getxo, Spain). For the videolaryngoscopy group, the standard Airtraq mounted with the Airtraq A-390 camera was used. The Ambu aScope 4 regular bronchoscope was used for the fibreoptic intubation group (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). Times for the completion of each airway management procedure were measured with a stopwatch which was started after the investigator commanded the specific task to commence. The stopwatch was then stopped after the verbal confirmation by the participant that the tube had been correctly placed. Correct tube placement was confirmed by the investigator. After completing all scenarios, participants were asked to complete a wearer comfort evaluation form to rate their perceptions of mobility, noise, heat, vision and speech intelligibility of each respiratory protection system used, on a 5-point scale where 0 represented the worst conditions, and 5, the best (see also supporting information, Appendix S1).The required sample size had been established by our previous studies using the same model[6][7][8][9]. Our power calculation was based on a study that measured a standardised resuscitation scenario using powered respirator hoods[9]. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v26.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, NY, USA).Continuous data were normality tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test; this was followed up by multiple comparisons of the time periods by analysis of variance (ANOVA).

During the current COVID-19 pandemic our hospital, which is a high consequence infectious diseases centre, has found the use of powered respirators most suitable for prolonged airway or surgical procedures and for members of staff who have failed their fit-testing. Quantitatively fit-tested tight-fitting standard respirators, mainly as half masks, are, however, the main respiratory protective device used by our anaesthetic and operative department staff.

Certain medical procedures or treatments carry a higher risk of equipment. Previous studies by our group have highlighted the problems and pitfalls of advanced life support in chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear environments [8-11]. The most commonly used respiratory protection devices are standard respirators, either designed as a half mask or as a full facepiece.

The facepieces used in air-purifying respirators are known to significantly reduce sound transmission by attenuating and distorting sound and by restricting lower jaw movement[14,23].Two aspects which fell outside the scope of our study should be considered. The first is cost; the standard respirator used in this study is 70% cheaper than the powered respirator. The second is decontamination and disinfection.
