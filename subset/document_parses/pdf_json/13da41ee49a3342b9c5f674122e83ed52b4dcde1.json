With the cumulative effects of persistent drought, record-breaking bushfires, limited access to quality health services, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing economic and social challenges, there is much to understand about the impact of adversity on mental health and wellbeing in rural populations. In this conceptual paper, we aim to review and adapt our existing understanding of rural adversity. We undertook a wide-ranging review of the literature, sought insights from multiple disciplines and critically developed our findings with an expert disciplinary group from across Australia. We propose that rural adversity be understood using a rural ecosystem lens to develop greater clarity around the dimensions and experiences of adversity, and to help identify the opportunities for interventions. We put forward a dynamic conceptual model of the impact of rural adversity on mental health and wellbeing, and close with a discussion of the implications for policy and practice. Whilst this paper has been written from an Australian perspective, it has implications for rural communities internationally.",

This six-factor framework highlights that, when compared with urban settings, rural places are impacted by geographic locality, 'rural locale' (the setting wherein social relations are formed), local health responses, broader health systems, social structures and finally the power relations between different levels of government and community members. These structural and cultural factors start to provide some explanation as to why rural mental health outcomes have proved to be enduringly problematic and resistant to attempts at reparation by policy makers and service providers.",

It called for collaborative efforts to improve the mental health of rural residents through research, policy development, service design and delivery, and community members initiatives.

To do this, we need to understand that mental health care systems are complex adaptive systems [10, 11] . Such systems are best viewed through an ecosystem lens [12] in which informal supports are key parts of the system, not just the health professionals and formal services. These informal supports keep people well and support them during illness and into recovery. When this is acknowledged, it highlights the interconnection of carers, family and community in an individual's mental health. The mental health ecosystems approach takes \"a whole-systems approach to mental health care facilitating analysis of the complex environment and context of mental health systems, and translation of this knowledge into policy and practice\" [12] .",

Key to this was to adopt a place-based and population health view and to explore the evidence widely through a literature review and expert deliberation. Our methodology is outlined in Figure 1 , with the brief, or provocation, serving to inform the development of a discussion paper and convening of an expert interdisciplinary group (Supplementary Table S1 ) to review the discussion paper and work towards a consensus understanding of rural adversity. The discussion paper was guided by the brief and a broad-ranging initial search in the fields of rural adversity (including disaster); rural epidemiology; theories and frameworks of rurality; rural risk and protective factors; and the impact of rural adversity on mental health. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for academic papers and grey literature was found via Google and Google Scholar searches, with a date range of 2000-2020. After title and abstract screening across the multiple searches outlined above, 268 papers were selected and read in full by author 1. Of these, 168 were included in the discussion paper with an additional 39 papers included from in-reference citation and 19 papers from separate searches to explore concepts more fully. In total, 193 papers were included in the discussion paper.",

The mental health of those who are left behind is challenged by the disruption to communities, family separation and diminished support networks, loss of businesses, schools and health services.

The inclusion of social categories of difference is important if we are to understand the impacts of power, complexity and inequity on the experiences of individuals [20] . The distribution of power can determine health inequities even unintentionally by not including diversity. Rural communities face many inequities including lower socioeconomic status, lower levels of education, fewer healthcare services, and challenges in accessing services. Individuals who live in rural communities experience these differences (ethnicity, sex, gender, disability) differently than urban communities. An understanding of rural adversity must extend beyond the individual social determinants of health and focus on how intersections impact an individual's experience of mental health and wellbeing and the associated power dynamics.",

Advanced geospatial analyses offer a fundamental capacity to quantify and visualise variations and interaction between contextual factors (i.e., built and social environments, geographic isolation and environmental risk factors, and limited services and resources) and their impacts on rural adversity. This generates evidenced-informed knowledge to design tailored interventions and plans to mitigate rural adversity and empower rural people. We can conclude that rural communities are both diverse and dynamic hence the importance of an ecosystems approach to conceptualising rural adversity more comprehensively. Multi-dimensional representations of rurality reinforce the importance of understanding the effect of context in rural mental health care [46] .",

            "text": "Adversity is commonly understood as a difficult situation or hardship. At some time, everyone faces loss of employment or income, disability, serious illness, bereavement or sudden changes in circumstances. These adverse events are usually borne by the individual, with rippling impacts out to family and community. However, the reverse may happen when global or wider social adverse events have a rippling effect through the community to the individual. Individual adverse life events are met with a sense of loss, different forms of grief and psychological distress, and link to concepts of endurance, uncertainty, suffering, and hope [47] . Traditional approaches to adverse events describe phases associated with the pre-adverse event period (susceptibility) of baseline strengths, vulnerabilities and resilience (adaptability) potential ( Figure 2 , line A) which are likely to be important predictors of individual and community outcomes [48] . Rapid onset adverse events (Figure 2 , line B) may have lasting consequences such as the loss of productive capital, homes, livestock or people. These events may be sequential-for example, in Australia, flood can follow drought, or simultaneously weeds or locusts accompany low rainfall. When long-term adverse events such as drought occur (Figure 2 , line C), the phase edges are less clear, in terms of when it starts, its end point and with a long recovery. Long-term adverse events may be exacerbated by uncertainty about the duration or severity of potential loss and the risk associated with mitigation strategies such as replanting, restocking or taking on additional debt. Individual life-course adverse events such as bereavement, serious illness, relationship breakdown or financial hardship (Figure 2 , line D) may contribute to personal or baseline vulnerability or overlay and exacerbate the impact of other adversities.

Human and material losses may be complex and the risk of poor mental health outcomes is considerable and compounding. The expertise of rural residents and their central role in experiencing and addressing rural adversity should be recognised and incorporated in policy development and action. Approaches such as deliberative dialogue may help in this regard [55, 56] .",
