Relationship between COVID-19 prognosis and the extent of alterations on chest CT obtained by both visual and software-based quantification that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one has been proven. While commercial applications for automatic medical image computing and visualization are expensive and limited in their spread, the open-source systems are characterized by not enough standardization and time-consuming troubles. We analyzed chest CT exams on 246 patients suspected of COVID-19 performed in the Emergency Department CT room. The lung parenchyma segmentation was obtained by a threshold-based method using the open-source 3D Slicer software and software tools called \"Segment Editor\" and \"Segment Quantification.\" For the three main characteristics analyzed on lungs affected by COVID-19 pneumonia, a specifical densitometry value range was defined: from \u2212 950 to \u2212 700 HU for well-aerated parenchyma; from \u2212 700 to \u2212 250 HU for interstitial lung disease; from \u2212 250 to 250 HU for parenchymal consolidation. For the well-aerated parenchyma and the interstitial alterations, the procedure was semi-automatic with low time consumption, whereas consolidations' analysis needed manual interventions by the operator. After the chest CT, 13% of the sample was admitted to intensive care, while 34% of them to the sub-intensive care. In patients moved to intensive care, the parenchyma analysis reported a higher crazy paving presentation. The quantitative analysis of the alterations affecting the lung parenchyma of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia can be performed by threshold method segmentation on 3D Slicer. The segmentation could have an important role in the quantification in different COVID-19 pneumonia presentations, allowing to help the clinician in the correct management of patients.",

The tertiary bronchi are included within the healthy parenchyma during the segmentation provided in a negligible total volume (< 20 ml). Segmentation at this level is difficult due to the size of the bronchi at the parenchymal level. 4. Consolidation was selected manually. As mentioned above, parts of the venous and arterial vessels are involved in the volume. Excluding this mistake is difficult because of the nature itself. The use of the command paints with values of dimensions smaller than the sphere of 10 mm is recommended for accuracy of evaluation. 5. Only one software has been used for lung segmentation.",
