The traditional approach to teaching introductory programming concepts relies heavily on calculation problems where the only output is text output. In contrast, creative coding presents computer science using more familiar contexts [17] and allows students to learn programming in a media-rich way. Using programming, students create games [1] , music [3] , stories [4] , physics-based simulations, and image filters [17] . Creative tasks such as these make programming more interesting, relevant, and engaging [7, 16, 22] , which in turn improves retention [15] , motivates students to learn programming [9] , and broadens participation and diversity in computing by appealing to students who enjoy creative activities and find the traditional programming focus on math and engineering problems overwhelming and/or difficult to relate to [16, 20, 21] .",

Thus it is unclear how to design such assignments, what challenges exist, and how students perceive them. For instance, in collaborative storytelling, individual authors add part of the story following pre-defined constraints (e.g., theme, actions) in order for the parts (contributed by different authors) to form a coherent story. In a text-based, creative coding setting, how do we design storytelling assignments to accommodate such procedures? How do we support creative storytelling in individual and collaborative storytelling assignments? Our experience report presents a first step to addressing these questions as we investigate three types of storytelling-collective, individual, and collaborative-through individual and collaborative assignments.

Specifically, when students executed the starter code, they were shown a simple interactive story, shown in Fig. 3 . The story in the starter project featured a \"hero\" structure common in many narratives [5] , with three characters-protagonist (hero), antagonist (villain), and protagonist's friend. The story has a villain character threatening to destroy the Earth ( Fig. 3a-3b ), the protagonist (Patrick Star) choosing an action among three options-fight, run, or get help ( Fig. 3c) , followed by scenes depicting aftermath or reaction to the chosen action ( Fig. 3d-3e ).

The story setting is introduced in scenes 1 and 2; the story reaches its peak (in narrative arc) at scene 3 (e.g., What should Patrick do? Decisions: [Fight, Run, Get Help]?); the story shows the aftermath of the peak (release of tension) in scenes 4 and 5 [6] .

For S9 6, 7 , their group members did not implement their scenes in Part II, leaving \"the overall project broken and not running smoothly.\" S40 6,7 also noted lack of ownership in a group project-a common problem in group work [14] , saying \"everyone just thinks that someone else is going to do it\". While students like S26 0 were lucky to be \"put into a good group who managed their time well and got [their] respective tasks done on time,\" other students like S10 6, 7 and S27 6, 7 were put in teams with students who did not work to a pre-defined schedule and/or did not communicate well.

To explore three storytelling approaches, we assigned three storytelling assignments. Some students found them repetitive and suggested skipping A6 or A7. Since group chemistry played an important role in collaborative storytelling (A8), team formation needs to be carefully planned or involve students in the process to ensure successful group work and satisfactory experience-in our study, the instructor assigned students to groups to avoid delays from the group formation process. Some students stated that the issues they experienced in A8 such as communication and coordination would not have occurred if it was done in-person, since they would have worked together in the lab. Thus, we expect collaborative storytelling to be easier and more fun for students in an in-person setting.",

As such, administering a storytelling assignment in which students are asked to create interactive narratives from scratch can be a way to address such needs and serve creative coding classes with more experienced students. The collaborative storytelling assignment can also be used as a fun exercise for learning about version control practices, as they need to engage in tasks such as requesting and accepting pull requests. Finally, we can explore different ways to combine other creative coding tasks with these storytelling assignments. For instance, the template code and instructions can be modified to help students embed games-which they could have created for a previous assignmentinto their interactive narratives. For instance, a fighting game a student created can be added so that readers can play them when they choose \"Fight\" in the decision scene.",

Our analysis shows that both individual and collaborative authoring processes allowed students to author creative, interesting interactive narratives based on their experiences, imagination, and existing stories.
