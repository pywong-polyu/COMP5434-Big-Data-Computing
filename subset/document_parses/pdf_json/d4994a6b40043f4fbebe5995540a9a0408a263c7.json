These intentions, in turn, are affected by the control that people perceive they have over their actions, by their attitude toward the behavior and whether they think it is useful, important or desirable, and by the norms they perceive to be prevailing around them. The TPB was previously used to explain dentists' behaviors including delivering prevention [17] , reporting suspected violence [18] , and managing drug users [19] . The change in behaviors among dentists due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be explained by the TPB including the control they perceive they have over avoiding infection by the disease because of previous training they received, worries because of the pandemic which may affect their attitudes and the importance they attach to adopting preventive behaviors, and the prevailing norms around them regarding the seriousness of the pandemic based on the fatalities it causes. Adopting preventive measures to avoid infection protects health care professionals, their families, patients, and the public. It is important to understand the factors associated with these behaviors and if they are impaired by the levels of stress these professionals have. A number of studies have assessed the psychological outcomes of the pandemic on health care workers [20] [21] [22] and the general population [23] [24] [25] [26] but not on dental academics.",

Its internal consistency and validity were previously demonstrated [30] . In the present study, its Cronbach alpha was 0.83 indicating high internal consistency. Items were scored on a 4-point Likert scale; 0 = not at all, 1 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, and 5 = often. Adding the scores of all items gave the total score which was categorized into subclinical, mild stress, moderate stress, and severe stress using cutoff points of 0-8, 9-25, 26-43, and 44+ [31] . Section 2 included 16 items assessing participants' attitudes toward the impact of the COVID-19. Participants indicated how much these items caused them worry on a scale from 1 (not worried at all) to 10 (extremely worried). Section 3 assessed participants' agreement with two statements describing change in behavior because of the COVID-19 pandemic (frequent handwashing and avoiding crowded places) on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). Section 4 was a 9 item close-ended questionnaire about participants' personal and professional background including sex, age, country, living arrangements, highest academic degree obtained, whether the participants coordinate courses, have clinical responsibilities, hold administrative positions, and whether they received training on public health emergencies, the full survey can be found in the S2 Appendix.",

The main sources of stress were fear of contracting infection, restricted mobility due to the lockdown enforced in most countries to control the spread of the pandemic and worries because of professional responsibilities related to teaching and research. Measures taken by individuals to contain the infection included avoidance of crowded places and washing hands more frequently. Training on public health emergencies was significantly associated with stresses but not with change in behaviors due to the pandemic. A dose-dependent relationship existed between severity of stresses and worries related to fear of infection, teaching and research responsibilities and restricted mobility. A direct, dose-dependent relationship also existed between stress levels and change in behaviors due to the pandemic. Dose-dependent associations were suggested by Hill among the criteria supporting causality in observational studies when clinical trials cannot be conducted [34] . However, dose-dependent associations are not proof of causality on their own and the most important criterion of causality; time sequence where exposure precedes outcome, can only be ascertained in a longitudinal study. The study hypothesis was, thus, partly supported: not all components of the TPB were significantly associated with change in behaviors due to COVID-19.",

First, data were collected at different stages of the pandemic in various countries and this may have confounded the assessment of the level of stress. In addition, the study was cross-sectional and thus, cannot prove causality. Also, the response rate was low similar to previous research [35] and this may be attributed to the psychological impact of the pandemic with resulting possible underestimation of the level of stress reported in the study since those with higher levels of stress may be more likely to ignore the survey. The academics were selected in the present study using convenience sampling. Thus, strict statistical representativeness cannot be claimed. However, in the absence of a sampling framework including dental academics in educational institutions all over the world, random sampling may not be possible. Thus, the wide geographic coverage and range of professional attributes represented in the study indicate representativeness of a large segment of the dental academic community worldwide. The study highlights the psychological impact of the pandemic on dental educators who are critical stakeholders in the education and healthcare sectors. As countries pass through the first wave of the pandemic, more attention will need to be paid to the psychological impact of the pandemic on people's lives because of its possible effect on productivity, wellbeing, health, and quality of life [36] .",

This indicates a need to provide support for dental academics' mental health. In addition, fear and anxiety among the educators may have a detrimental effect on dental students with long-lasting consequences on the profession.

Training on public health emergencies was associated with less stress up to a certain level beyond which the higher awareness of risks brought about by training was associated with more rather than less stress. Thus, whether in relation to change in behavior or reducing stresses, training was not associated with greater perceived control. This may be attributed to the generic nature training the academics received which did not address the specific needs related to COVID-19 prevention. This implies that appropriate responses to COVID-19 will require specific and tailored training different from the standard training for public health emergencies. Targeted training programs developed by international organizations such as the World Health Organization may help provide the required skills to deal with this pandemic.",
