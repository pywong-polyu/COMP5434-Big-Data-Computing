During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, 19 countries in the EU/EEA and the UK implemented specific 'stay-at-home' recommendations for risk groups or vulnerable populations. 2 The Swedish Public Health Agency issued a non-mandatory recommendation for individuals aged 70 or over, i.e., the most vulnerable population group concerning severe COVID-19 disease, to avoid contact with persons outside the household and crowded places (e.g., stores, public transportation). 3 It is difficult to predict to what degree the public will comply with recommendations that require substantial modifications in daily life. Compliance depends on many factors, including how the population perceives the risk and the consequences of isolation, the government's credibility, and the clarity of communication. 4, 5 Most people are more willing to protect themselves if they belong to a risk group. 4 However, older adults do not seem more inclined to self-isolate or comply with social distancing recommendations than people in their 50's and 60's, according to data from 27 countries collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 6 The added effect of targeting risk communication at older adults also appears limited. 7 These results raise questions regarding the effectiveness of Sweden's nonmandatory isolation policy for older adults.",

From May 7 to September 29, 2020, the app also included a weekly question about the levels of isolation during the last seven days. The respondents were asked: (i) \"In the last week, how many times have you visited somewhere with lots of people (e.g., groceries, public transport, work)?\", (ii) \"In the last week, how many times have you been outside, with little interaction with people outside your household (e.g., exercise)?\", and (iii) \"In the last week, how many times have you visited a healthcare provider (e.g., hospital, clinic, dentist, pharmacy)?\". As described further below, our analysis focuses on individuals close to the 70-year-threshold. However, it requires data from younger and older individuals to model the relationship between these social distancing measures and age. We decided a priori to include period-specific averages of the social distancing measures for individuals born before 1980 (i.e., age 39 at the end of 2019) in the study, and there were too few participants born each year before 1940 (79 years) to be included in the analysis of the social distancing data. Participants also had to have at least one observation of isolation data from the period when the social distancing questions were asked up until the end of the first wave of the pandemic ([May 7 -July 31 2020]) (n = 96,053). Table 1 contains an overview of characteristics of the entire sample and for individuals close to the age threshold for the recommendations (65-69 years, 70-74 years).",

The design has, for instance, previously been used to estimate the effects of early versus deferred antiretroviral therapy for HIV patients, 18 and the impact of age-specific policies (e.g., minimum drinking age laws and copayments in healthcare). 19, 20 By exploiting abrupt changes induced by arbitrary thresholds, such as an age limit, causal effects can be estimated in observational data without controlling for confounders. 18 RDD estimates reflect local average effects at the threshold (i.e., for people who are 70 years old exactly). The key causal assumption is that nothing else that affects the outcomes changes discontinuously at the policy threshold other than the social distancing recommendation. 11 We are not aware of any other policies that might have affected social distancing or COVID-19 disease at the 70-year-threshold. We note that retirement may affect the tendency to selfisolate, which would be a major confounder in a typical observational study. The retirement age in Sweden is flexible, but the most common is 65. As the probability of retiring does not change abruptly at 70 years of age, the RDD estimates will not be biased by retirement decisions.",

In each analysis, we used a data-driven bandwidth selection method to identify the mean squared error (MSE) optimal window around the 70-year-threshold. 23 The larger the bandwidth (i.e., the age window used in the analysis), the more individuals are included, which increases the precision of the effect estimates.

Results were inconsistent and inconclusive for Stockholm County, where the pandemic hit particularly hard during the first wave in Sweden. We found an indication that men may have been more affected by the agespecific recommendation than women, which is consistent with assumptions that high-risk groups are generally more willing to follow recommendations on protecting themselves. 4 People with other risk factors (especially among women) also appeared to be more willing to self-isolate even at younger ages, which couldat least in partbe a consequence of the recommendations aimed at people with other risk factors.",

The age-specific recommendation was an important aspect of this strategy, and it is conceivable that the effects are dependent not only on the acceptance among those targeted but also on which other population-level measures (such as limiting the size of gatherings and restrictions directed towards non-essential businesses) that were implemented during the same period to limit disease transmission. 25 The Swedish public also has high levels of social trust and trust in its government, [27] [28] [29] which may have played an essential role in the success of the age-specific recommendations. 30 The results also need to be interpreted in the light of concerns about the adverse effects of social isolation on mental health. 8, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] The age-specific recommendations were withdrawn in October 2020 as a result of these concerns. 9 However, the body of evidence on the pandemic's impact on older adults' mental health is inconsistent, according to a recent review. 36 Nonetheless, it is still important to account for adverse effects and other unintended consequences to understand the recommendation's net impact on health and welfare. When the age-specific recommendations were withdrawn, they were followed by recommendations to meet in \"social bubbles\", i.e., limiting one's social contacts by only meeting with the same people, whether family, friends, or co-workers. 1, 37 This approach to mitigate the adverse effects of social isolation has been recommended by authorities in several countries during .

The observed discontinuities were also isolated to the expected outcome variables, suggesting causality. The validity of our estimates also depends on appropriate modeling of the age-outcome relationship. We followed the current best practice recommendations, which is to fit simple models (linear or quadratic) within a datadriven bandwidth (age window) around the threshold. 21, 22 In this modeling framework, the typical concern is that the conclusions may depend heavily on the selected bandwidth. 10 The Supplementary material shows that the main results are robust to other reasonable bandwidth choices. A limitation is that RDD can only be used to estimate effects for persons who are exactly 70 years old. The estimates may not generalize to older parts of the targeted age group, and the calculations in Box 1 should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.",

However, participants in the app study were more healthy than the general population and less likely to be smokers, 12 which may hamper the generalizability of the observed effect on social distancing. Moreover, the general user of the COVID Symptom Study app might be more likely to follow recommendations than the average Swedish citizen, which may lead to an overestimation of the effect in the social distancing data, but this does not affect the disease outcome results. Another limitation was that the social distancing data was only available .

The study was further limited by the selected PCR testing in Sweden during the spring of 2020, which meant that we could not quantify effects on infection rates in absolute terms. In addition, we only had access to data on year of birth, which means that there is likely some degree of exposure misclassification bias in our estimates. We also lacked data on cohabitation, which may have also led to exposure misclassification as it is more likely that someone who lives with a partner belonging to a risk group adheres to the recommendations than someone of the same age who is living alone. In both cases, we believe that the misclassification would lead to an underestimation of the true effect. Another limitation was that we could only stratify effects by medical risk factors for social distancing outcomes and not for disease outcomes, as such register data were not available for the present study.",

The local linear estimates indicate a 16% reduction in both severe COVID-19 cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.84 [95% CI: 0.73, 1.00]) and the number of confirmed cases (IRR = 0.84 [95% CI: 0.69, 1.08]) at the 70-year-threshold, although the confidence interval for confirmed cases overlaps the null (Table 3). For severe cases, the estimate was slightly larger in the quadratic specification (IRR = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.99]). Our calculation in Box 1 uses these numbers to estimate the impact of the recommendations, assuming that the relative effect is the same for everyone older than 70.
