In a clinical setting and when presented with a patient with a combination of traits, a doctor may wonder if a certain combination of symptoms may be especially predictive, such as the question, \"Are fevers more informative in women than men?\" The answer to this question is, yes. We develop here a methodology to enumerate such questions, to learn what are the stronger warning signs when attempting to diagnose a disease, called Conditional Predictive Informativity, (CPI), whose ranking we call CPIR. This simple to use process allows us to identify particularly informative combinations of symptoms and traits that may help medical field analysis in general, and possibly to become a new data-driven advised approach for individual medical diagnosis, as well as for broader public policy discussion. In particular we have been motivated to develop this tool in the current environment of the pressing world crisis due to the COVID 19 pandemic. We apply the methods here to data collected from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional information from online, and then curated to an online publically available Github repository.",

See Fig. 1 . In brief, this approach contrasts directly to the commonly used concept of correlations [8, 2, 7, 10] , that associates a score to describe how strongly measurements go together, whereas, CPIR associates a score to describe how strongly atypical is a new observation, given that a collection of symptoms has already been observed. Often it is the presence of atypical observations that allow the clinician to decide how worrying should be considered the constellation of symptoms presenting in a given patient. Likewise, understanding atypical associations can be especially informative when characterizing a disease across the population.",

Both groups have tested positive for the disease, however, while the majority of the patients shares the same set of symptoms and reaction to the disease, a subgroup will have different reactions that may appear as severe pain and symptoms, and even death. In COVID-19 statistics, we see that more than 80% of the patients have mild symptoms, or they may even be asymptomatic, while a small group have severe pain and risky symptoms, and the global mortality rate of COVID-19 is less than 7% of confirmed cases.",

In green boxes, we show the symptoms associated with typical patients, and in red, we show the critical and risky symptoms that are associated with the atypical set of patients. example is that headaches and body aches are highly informative of atypical patients when they appear in men. More results of this type are shown in Fig. 2 . With such examples in mind, our methods here will allow us a data-driven method to define an informativity ranking of symptoms toward a reliable prediction of disease presence based on the specific combination of informative symptoms. The knowledge gained when observing a specific combination of symptoms relative to the further predictability of the status of other symptoms founds the essential ability to understand how to understand observations in the clinical setting.",

Here, we want to emphasize a major difference between our approach and the commonly used methods from statistical analysis by correlations from data. Statistical analysis based on correlations [8, 2, 7, 10] has a different goal than we have here. Correlations describe variables and outcomes in terms of probability of occurrence, but it is well known that correlation does not imply causation [9] . For example, suppose that 80% of the patients (Y = 1) have a fever, and 50% of them have a cough. Then, fever and cough are the dominant symptoms. However, this analysis neglects the correlation among the symptoms themselves, but most important to our interests here, it does not reveal if the symptoms are informative or not. See Fig. 4 for a detailed example. We are less interested in the cause in this work, and instead, we are interested in developing an Informativity Rank (IR) of the symptoms. That is, for a set of symptoms, what are the symptoms that are Conditionally Predictively Informative (CPI) of an underlying condition such as the presence of a disease.",

There are different ways to answer this question with the conditional mutual information.

The most reliable five informative symptoms are: chills, breathing difficulty, respiratory symptoms, joint pain, and fever. To understand how to read this curve, consider the cough, which is statistically known to be from the main symptoms of COVID-19. However, we see here that the cough is a weak informative symptom, meaning that the cough by itself is not a reliable indication of COVID-19 unless it jointed with a stronger symptom such as fever. See Fig. 1 for more details. On the other hand, if a patient has only chills, that is a more reliable indication than cough or fever alone. We can conclude then that the high informative symptoms jointly, can be a solid indication that the patient has COVID-19, such as having headache and sputum together, or headache and fatigue together, and so on.

It is important to note that this figure is independent of the order and analysis that are shown in Fig. 7 , since here we have a different outcome, and we are investigating the mutual information between symptoms and demographic variables. Low (or zero) CPIR in this figure does not mean that the symptom is not informative, but it means that the symptom has no different (bias) informativity between women and men. (Top) We see the results for symptoms informativity bias in women, and we see the dominant informativity in this figure is that fever and cough, are informative for the atypical set of patients in women, while they are associated with the typical set in Fig. 7 . This indicates that fever and cough are more surprising to appear in women. Then, they are more critical in women, where their presence in women increases the probability that the patient is from the atypical set. (Bottom) Similarly, we see the results for symptoms informativity bias in men, and we see the dominant informativity in this figure is that fever and cough are associated with the typical set of patients. Although that reduces the risk in men who have fever and cough, however, since 75% of patients have a fever, then that indicates that men have a higher probability of infection with COVID-19. We note that our dataset has some missing or unreported information about gender, and that is why we see the difference between the graphs. If we have complete data about the gender, with only male and female entries, then we will see the CPIR for men as rotation (left-right) of the women graph, and that can be seen clearly in Fig. 10 .",
