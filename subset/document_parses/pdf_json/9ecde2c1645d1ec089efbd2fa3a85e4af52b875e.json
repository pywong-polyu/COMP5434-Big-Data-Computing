However, wild foods are not regularly considered in the planning of strategies for food and nutrition security mainly due to the lack of technical and/or scientific knowledge so that they can be considered suitable for human consumption. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary method that estimates the potential of wild foods as alternative resources when planning interventions in favour of food and nutrition security in tropical forest territories. When designing the method, four dimensions were identified in science, technology and innovation (STI) that define this potential as well as ten assessment criteria. The wild foods chosen for applying the method were Alibertia patinoi (a fruit commonly known as Boroj\u00f3) and Proechimys semispinosus (Mouse of thorns), which are two of the main wild foods traditionally used by human communities in a tropical forest territory in the northwest of Colombia. In both cases, although there are significant advances in STI, compliance with some criteria is still required to regard them as viable alternatives for nutrition and food security within this territory. This research is useful for promoting the inclusion of wild food in food security programmes for communities where this food is already included in their traditional pattern of consumption and identifies the progress needed in STI to achieve this purpose. It may also promote the early recognition of possible traditional and cultural practices with high risk of transmission of pathogenic elements by the handling and/or inadequate consumption of wild foods. This early recognition could contribute to the prevention of diseases of wild animal origin, including those of rapid global spread.",

These products may be harvested (gathered or hunted) from within food and agricultural production systems or from other ecosystems (Heywood 1999; FAO 2019; Borelli et al. 2020) . Within this particular group of foods are cereals, vegetables, fruits, tubers, eggs, meats and others (Misra et al. 2013; Schulp et al. 2014; Termote et al. 2014; Erskine et al. 2015; Fa et al. 2015; Acosta-Naranjo et al. 2020) . The sowing or breeding of species under ancestral production schemes does not necessarily eliminate its wild condition. In order for a species to stop being wild, it must be verified that none of its populations exist in its natural state making it a strictly a domesticated species. Domestication species are understood to be species bred in captivity or in an ''artificial'' environment. These species are, therefore, modified from their wild ancestors so that they can be more useful or pleasant to human beings who control their key biological aspects-such as their reproduction and, in the case of animals, their diet (Diamond 2002 ).",

To address the knowledge gap that limits the inclusion of wild foods in food and nutrition security planning, the academic community has been making multiple efforts. These efforts are recognized in various specific disciplinary studies that define ethnobiological aspects (Robinson and Bennett 2000; Townsend and Rumiz 2003; Van den Eynden al. 2003; Asprilla-Perea et al. 2012; Misra et al. 2013; Schulp et al. 2014; Termote et al. 2014; Erskine et al. 2015; Fa et al. 2015) ; evaluate the nutritional value of foods and possible transformation techniques in products with commercial potential (Leterme et al. 2006; Tejada et al. 2006; Bustacara and Joya 2007; Palomino et al. 2010; Torres-Rapelo et al. 2014; Uch\u00f4a-Thomaz et al. 2014; \u00c1 lvarez-Salas 2014; Serpa al. 2015; Alvis et al. 2017; Phan et al. 2020) ; or describe and/or promote ancestral planting or breeding practices (Larraz\u00e1bal 2004; Viloria and C\u00f3rdova 2008; Su\u00e1rez et al. 2009; Cifuentes et al. 2010; \u00c1 lvarez et al. 2015; Sicchar-Valdez et al. 2015) .",

They do not consider nutrition and food security or scientific results in their formulation. Therefore, as in this study, we propose the inclusion of other evaluation factors such as the sustainability of the local harvesting model and the nutritional assessment of foodstuffs. Likewise, the proposed index offers a broader application option over the traditional use of biodiversity, since it not only allows its application to plants, but also to fungi and animals (vertebrates and invertebrates). This proposal is generally considered a contribution to improve the results of these tools to prioritize wild species with potential for safe food and nutrition.",

It also lacks studies on consumption preference over other non-wild foods of the same group; positive results in biological assimilation studies; and advances in processing techniques in products with commercial potential.

These levels indicate the advances in STI on these foods that allow them to be considered viable alternatives in planning food and nutrition security with a rural/local focus, which is consistent with the Integrated Approach for Conserving and Sustainably Using WFPs proposed by Borelli et al.

A criteria for which there are no data is judged as non-compliant in the estimation of the potential of the wild food (see criteria 2.3 in the application to Alibertia patinoi and criteria 1.3 in the application to Proechimys semispinosus). This valuation could be interpreted as a bias towards low potential in the results when data are missing. However, it is important to understand that the method yields two outcomes: (1) the main outcome that provides an easy reading of the wild food strengths regarding its potential and its feasibility to be included in food policy planning; and (2) the complementary outcome that identifies possible challenges that limit this inclusion. The assessment of wild food as non-compliant in a Table 4 continued particular criteria informs decision-makers about the unfeasibility of the wild food for food security planning, either because of its negative results with the existing data or due to the lack of data. In this way, the method highlights both, the negative results and the importance of this lack of information, something that the present research seeks to emphasize to encourage the progress needed in STI. In any case it is not final assessment about wild food potential.

However, when considering the scale of the secondary information source for the evaluation of the criteria, it is important to specify that in this study the territorial reference is based on an ecosystem classification and not on a political/administrative one. In this sense, an ecosystem is understood as a biological system constituted by a community of living organisms (biocenosis) and the physical environment where they are related (biotope) or as a unit composed of interdependent organisms that includes man and share the same habitat (Tansley 1935; Molles 1999; Smith and Smith 2012) . From this perspective and considering the approach of Armenteras et al. (2016) , ecosystems become important in regional decisions and management as long as they are identified and delimited in the territory and integrated with the other social, cultural and economic elements (Crespin and Simonetti, 2019) . Data from secondary information obtained from other territories can always contribute to the discussion of the results, but it is preferable that the assessment of the criteria be based on locally obtained data.",

If a wild food does not meet any of these four criteria it may not be relevant for the community (criterion 1.1) or its consumption may have negative effects on the conservation of biodiversity (criterion 2.2) or human health (criteria 3.1 and 3.3). In this case, a Low Potential is assigned indicating that it is not feasible to suggest it as an alternative in the food and nutrition security planning for the territory ( Table 2 ). The foods that through processes of science, technology and innovation demonstrate to comply with the four criteria mentioned above, if they still do not comply with all ten criteria, cannot be suggested as an alternative, but they will have more possibilities of achieving it and therefore could obtain a Moderate or High Potential (Table 2) .",

The results obtained from the application of the method proposed have the potential to generate alerts that discourage the use or frequency of use of any food whose consumption may generate problems for human health or the conservation of biodiversity. This aspect could have a high impact on the recognition of possible traditional and cultural practices with a high risk of transmission of pathogens due to the inappropriate handling and/ or consumption of wild foods.

In this line, the inclusion of wild foods in the planning of the nutrition and food security of territories associated with tropical forests has been limited by various challenges that are related to their sustainable consumption. In this regard, future perspectives of this research should address a monitoring process of the interventions in favour of nutrition and food security that include wild foods with Very High Potential in their planning. The objective would be to confirm or discard the contributions of these interventions to nutrition and food security, human health and the conservation of the environment; as well as their relevance and sustainability, and their effects on the food sovereignty of the territory.",
