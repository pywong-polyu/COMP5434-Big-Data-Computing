The Republic of San Marino is still one of the countries with one of the highest rates of confirmed deaths relative to its population. 2, 3 In this problematic scenario, the Republic of San Marino has invested all available resources to promptly contain the public health damage caused by the pandemic. Therefore, in addition to the efforts to diagnose and treat the infection, this country conducted a vaccination campaign to quickly reach the goal of herd immunity. Considering the difficulties in the general supply of vaccines throughout Europe and beyond, the Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine was included in the vaccination campaign of the Republic of San Marino. 4 Gam-COVID-Vac was developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia and released on 11 August 2020 by the Russian Ministry of Health as Gam-COVID-Vac. 5",

In addition, no unusual side effects were noted: the most common adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) reported in the aforementioned study were flulike symptoms, injection site reactions, headache, and asthenia; most of these (94%) were grade 1, 5\u00a27% grade 2, and 0\u00a24% grade 3. None of the severe AEFIs were associated with vaccination. 9 Evidence from clinical trials before vaccine approval is essential but not sufficient; in fact, there is still limited information in the scientific literature on the safety of Gam-COVID-Vac in real world context and no data on long-term AEFIs.",

In the planning process of a national vaccination campaign, the acquisition of solid evidence on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine is a priority. Vaccinevigilance (i.e. the surveillance of the post-marketing safety of vaccines) consists of the activities of detection, evaluation and communication of AEFIs, in order to reduce the potential negative impact on the immunisation of the population. 10 Active surveillance (i.e. solicited reporting along the campaign) is pivotal and offers advantages as compared to passive reporting, by carefully and timely assessing the prevalence and characteristics of AEFIs to Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine among the population of the Republic of San Marino. Preliminary results on the population \u2265 aged 60 years have been published and showed a high tolerability profile in terms of short-term AEFIs. 11 The aim of ROCCA final analysis is to assess potential short-and long-term AEFIs to Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine through a 3-month follow-up of the whole population included in the study.",

Due to the presence of 1639 (26\u00a25%) participants lost to follow-up who did not provide information on adverse reactions after the second dose of the vaccine, monotone multiple imputation was used to replace missing values with multiple sets of simulated values to complete the data (m = 30). Regression estimates from the multiply imputed sets were then combined into one overall estimate with an associated variance that incorporated the within-and between-imputation variability. 16 A sensitivity analysis using weighted regression estimates to test for local departures from the missing-at-random assumption gave results that closely agreed with those obtained under missing-at-random multiple imputation (data not shown). 17 The resulting rates of adverse reactions were stratified by age, sex, dose and severity, and were then depicted using bar charts with super-imposed 95% CIs obtained with the delta method. Lastly, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the baseline risk factors associated with increased risk of adverse reactions classified as grade 3 or grade 4 after the two doses of the vaccine. To avoid model overfitting and mis-classification, only significant risk factors were included as covariates in regression analyses. With this aim, we adopted a bootstrap backward procedure in which 1000 replicated bootstrap samples were selected from the original data. In each replicated sample, a backward elimination of covariates was applied with a significance level of removal equal to 0\u00a205, and the risk factors selected in at least 500 (50%) of the replicates were included as covariates in the final multivariable model. 18 Other automated selection methods, including classical stepwise regression and lasso, led to the same subset of covariates to retain in the final model (data not shown).",

Of all characteristics collected at baseline, only young age, food allergies and female sex were found to be significant risk factors for having grade three or four systemic and local events after two vaccinations. This data is coherent with what has been reported for other vaccines, especially for young age.
