Despite the unwavering international interest on this public health crisis, information on biology and transmission of this virus are limited and final mortality rates are subject to only rough estimation. 1e3 Interestingly, there are varying approaches in different countries on how to best avoid further COVID-19 exposure from outside. While new data is acquired amid these discussions, some countries have restricted travel to regions with high amounts of COVID-19 cases. So far, a wide range of distinct operational procedures and measures have been implemented with respect to air traffic. While some countries have completely shut down border crossings and restricted flights in affected areas, 4 others have implemented fever measurements and 2week long self-quarantine for travelers to contain further spread of COVID-19 cases. Since the extent of COVID-19 cases vary enormously between different countries, ranging from very high numbers to none or only a few cases, making decisions on if and how to restrict air traffic from heavily affected countries remains challenging. The united effort of all countries to decrease the speed of COVID-19 spread and reduce undetected cases from traveling into their respective countries 5 further adds to this challenge.",

The direct comparison of international passengers and COVID-19 cases shows a significant correlation with a clear trend on Asian countries which have the most flight routes with China (Fig. 4) . Accordingly, Europe, North America and the Southwest Pacific have lower numbers, while in Africa and South America, with a negligible percentage of flight routes, there are no initial cases. A statistical analysis of international cases shows a statistically significant pattern between the high-volume air traffic region Asia and the low-traffic region Europe (Fig. 4) .

In addition, compared to the Ebola virus, which mainly occurred in rural and sparsely populated areas, COVID-19 has developed in the country with the highest global population density. Thus, air traffic has been a main vector for the global spread of COVID-19. While our data is incomplete due to only limited availability of information, our findings suggest a direct correlation between passenger numbers between mainland China and international destinations and diagnosed COVID-19 cases outside of China. The big differences in COVID-19 cases numbers per passenger in China vs. internationally are most likely related to extensive domestic transportation by train and car whereas international COVID-19 spread is practically solely attributable to air traffic and passenger numbers. International traffic with China mainly depends on the air traffic network, since mainland China is geographically relatively isolated from other world centers, even within Asia. Our analyzed data further indicate that international cases cannot be viewed as individual events. The number of international cases is directly correlated to the number of air traffic routes and passenger volume, which is a troublesome finding.",

Population size, custom controls as well as the increasingly implemented control measures may affect the scale and behavior of further virus spread. Additionally, it is quite likely that domestic flight routes in China have also been frequented by international travelers who may have also combined domestic air-travel with other transportation modalities e.g. cruises, trains and others. These aspects may have also impacted the data. Between January 27th and 30th, we observe major international flight restrictions to China. At the same time, an explosion of case numbers within new epicenters is detected which has given further rise to international virus spread, affecting Italy and Iran in particular. Newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases with potential travel history to China have most likely become negligible e yet incalculable e because of persisting travel restrictions to China and the development of new epicenters with continuous international flight routes. Therefore, continuous flight services from these secondary epicenters have presumably played a major role in COVID-19 spread.",

International air traffic is breaking down with increasing COVID-19 cases in many countries. While our data supports this development, we must critically reevaluate air traffic restrictions and whether their continuous use is effective with respect to increasing global COVID-19 cases.",
