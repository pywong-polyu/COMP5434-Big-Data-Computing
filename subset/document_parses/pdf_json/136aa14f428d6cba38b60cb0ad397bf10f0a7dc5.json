The clinical disease, later called COVID-19, resulted from the virus spreading globally during the first few months of 2020 to be declared a global pandemic on the 11th March 2020 [3] . The clinical course has a predominant respiratory presentation leading to acute respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support and intensive care supportive treatment [4] [5] [6] [7] . Early seemed a temporal association between the requirement for mechanical ventilation and AKI, as half of those requiring mechanical ventilation developed AKI within 24 hours. At the time of reporting, 35% of the patients with AKI had died. Wilbers and Koning described a 60% incidence and 41% mortality of AKI among a cohort of 76 Critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the Netherlands, rather similar to the findings of Fominskiy et al. in Milan, Italy [17, 18] .",

Although an electronic AKI detection and alerting system has already been in place within the trust since March 2016 (Think Kidneys/NPSA Safety Alert NHS/PSA/RE/2016/007) manual confirmation of each AKI case was still carried out, to ensure a valid baseline creatinine result was utilised.

Any in-patients who had developed AKI and recovered prior to seven days before the COVID positive date were excluded.

Of the 1032 patients, 31.6% died following the diagnosis of COVID-19, compared to 14% deaths in all sectors across the UK as of 31st May 2020. What is apparent from our study is the dramatic effect having an acute kidney injury has on the patients' disease progression. In almost every metric studied, AKI results in significantly worse outcomes. Patients with AKI in association with COVID-19 are more likely to die (52.4% vs 26.3%) and more likely to be admitted to ICU (34.8% vs 11.2%). Once in ICU they were more likely to die in ICU (52.1% vs 22.8%), to die at any point following admission (54.8% vs 25.0%) and to require mechanical ventilation (86.3% vs 66.3%). Even adjusting for all other parameters, AKI remains a significant factor of overall mortality (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.32, p-value <0.001) and following admission to ICU (HR 2.89, 95% CI 1.53-5.47, pvalue 0.001). The mortality rates of ICU patients with AKI and COVID 19 are similar to those found in other European centres [18, 35] .",

Whilst a retrospective study provides limitations in fully explaining such a difference, it should be noted that a significant number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Manchester area were not admitted to the hospital, with the use of virtual wards to provide support for those with a milder disease course [22] (S1 File). The hospital is a tertiary hospital with a renal department, and so some patients were specifically transferred in from elsewhere for renal support. As such, the likely higher acuity of admitted patients could partly account for the higher mortality rate, as only those with a more severe phenotype were hospitalised. Certainly, there were more patients in our cohort who required escalation to critical care (16.0%) compared to both the Wuhan and NY study (10.4% and 9.7% respectively) [10, 16] . There has been much discussion about ethnicity as a risk factor, but this appears not to be the sole driver, as there were more White patients in the AKI group, compared to the non-AKI group in the NY cohort, along with a similar proportion of Black patients in both groups, which is the opposite to what we found in our study [16] . The differences are also not explained fully by diabetes, which was seen in only 14.3% of patients in the Wuhan cohort, but 33% in the NY population and both having similar mortality rates [10, 16] .",

(63.7% male and 20.8% black) but they did not find these drugs were related to greater AKI risk. Patients also had a higher serum sodium and haemoglobin, higher urea and creatinine, and a higher CRP, along with lower blood oxygen saturations and temperature. Once adjusted for all parameters, being male, having a higher baseline serum sodium and CRP as well as a previous diagnosis of Renal disease were all still significantly associated with AKI but RAAS inhibition was not. Despite the poorer outlook for patients with AKI in the context of COVID-19 in regards to mortality, it seems if a patient survives they do appear to have a much higher chance of recovering their renal function (82%) compared to the 57% recovery in a study by Chan et al. [36] . This may be in part due to the unique nature of COVID-19 but also likely to be related to prior established robust early AKI interventions previously described within our hospitals [37] . Survival during and following ICU admission gives further insight into the apparent differences in COVID-19 compared to other severe respiratory conditions. In the AKI population, 38 patients died during their ICU stay with only two of the patients dying following discharge from critical care. This was similar in the non-AKI group where 21 patients died during their ICU stay, with only a further two dying on discharge. This would suggest that if a patient with COVID-19 survives their admission to ICU, they have a good chance of survival overall.",

This is along with emerging data for more direct renal damage from endothelial injury, thrombotic events and glomerulopathy [11] [12] [13] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Certainly, in our cohort, patients in the AKI group had a higher peak serum sodium at diagnosis, which may indicate a degree of hypovolaemia.

It has not been possible to determine the cause of death for patients aside from that patients died whilst being treated for COVID-19. It has also not been possible to say that AKI in of itself was a direct cause of mortality. It may be that the existence of AKI in a patient with COVID-19 is a surrogate marker for the severity of disease, as is already accepted in other diseases such as sepsis. The fact that baseline biochemistry such as CRP, and vital signs such as temperature, respiration rate and oxygen saturations were worse in patients with AKI does add some credence to this. Renal recovery was assessed based on serum creatinine. In the cohort of patients showing serological renal recovery there may be a subset who have still taken a significant \"renal hit\" as lower creatinine levels occur in patients recovering from an acute and/or prolonged illness. This is in part due to a loss of muscle bulk and poor dietary intake. We could not assess this which may then overestimate the true renal function. Given this was a retrospective study, there were also multiple parameters that were unable to be studied due to the amount of missing data, including weight and body mass index, along with biochemistry such as Ferritin, Troponin T, Lactate Dehydrogenase, D-Dimer, Procalcitonin, Creatinine Kinase, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and urinalysis.",

The median time to the initial AKI from the date of COVID-19 positivity was -1.00 days (IQR -1.00-2.00). 52% (n = 110) of patients were in AKI during the 72 hours of COVID-19 positive date (i.e. 24hrs before, 24 hours of positive date and 24hrs post COVID-19) and 24% (n = 50) of patients developed AKI post 24hrs of COVID-19 positive date.The total number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) was 32 (15.2%), and this was provided for 24 patients by continuous RRT alone, seven patients receiving both continuous RRT and haemodialysis and one patient needing haemodialysis only.Table 1.
