            "text": "Despite increasing global recognition of the ways in which the health of marine environments 'impacts the health of billions of people', the relationship between marine ecosystems and human health and wellbeing is still relatively understudied [1] . In recognition of this, the United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the 'Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development' [2] . An explicit focus is on achieving the interlinked Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of ocean conservation and sustainability (SDG14) and human health and wellbeing (SDG3) [3, 4] . International research consortiums responding to these interlinked goals have identified a number of key priorities and research gaps [1, [5] [6] [7] . First, there is a need for more multi-, inter-and trans-disciplinary engagement to better understand human-ocean relationships, particularly how the health of marine environments and people are interlinked [1, [6] [7] [8] . Second, this research to date has been dominated by Global-North based research consortiums with a 'strong European bias in the empirical literature' [9] (p. 5). This dominance needs expanding to different national contexts including those in the Southern Hemisphere. Third, expansive ecosystems research, and particularly on 'blue economies', has highlighted the economic benefits of coastal ecosystems goods and services that provide livelihoods, trade, and food [10, 11] . However, this research has not adequately engaged with the different cultural benefits, and 'dis-benefits' [12] (p. 487), of these socio-ecological relationships [12, 13] . There is an urgent need to focus on how these 'cultural benefits' [14] [15] [16] [17] emerge and impact human physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing, and the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems. Fourth, as philosopher Bradiotti reminds us, while a 'binary distinction' between humans and non-human (and nature/culture) has been 'foundational for European thought since the Enlightenment', many cultures, including postcolonial and Indigenous epistemologies and cosmologies do not adopt this distinction [18] (p. 2). Indigenous, First Nations, and Global South scholars have long been advocating for Western science to pay better attention to their knowledge systems; that 'when it comes to human/non-human relations, it is time to start learning from the [Global] South' [18] (p. 3). While there is widespread recognition that Indigenous knowledge [IK] systems often centralise long-term sustainable use of resources [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , IK is marginalised in international research about socio-ecological systems, except for research on/by/for Indigenous communities [20] [21] [22] , and often reinforcing their wider societal marginalisation [22] . The 'ongoing privileging of one knowledge system' ('Western Science') and suppression of others including Indigenous epistemologies has 'left Western epistemology so dominant that it can now seem like the only possible framework' [23] .",

Second, research has shown that surfing can create strong bonds between people and places, shaping participants' sense of physical, emotional, spiritual, community, social, and cultural wellbeing, impacting people, communities, 'more-than-humans' [32] and oceans [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Third, Aotearoa New Zealand's bi-cultural [23] context, i.e. Indigenous M\u0101ori and European settlers (termed P\u0101keh\u0101), provides a revealing cultural context for reassessing the ways in which 'Western Science' conceptualises socio-ecological relationships and coastal 'blue spaces' as sites of wellbeing [31] , that often drive understandings of sustainability, wellbeing, and ocean health. More widely, the paper demonstrates the value of trans-and inter-disciplinary place-based approaches that integrates research across the humanities and social sciences-including cultural and health geography, sociologies of leisure and sport, and feminist cultural studies-and also engages with Indigenous knowledge [IK], specifically M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori.",

            "text": "Before discussing our materials and methods it is important to explain what M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori is, and how this differs from what we will term 'Western Science'. Western Science is the dominant, and often unquestioned knowledge system in ecosystems (as in most 'science' research) underpinned by a 'Western epistemology' [23] (p. 83). M\u0101tauranga is a M\u0101ori worldview that includes 'knowledge, wisdom' and 'ways of knowing' [39] (p. 152), a cultural system of knowledge about everything that is important in the lives of the people [23] . Thus, while often treated as 'merely information', M\u0101tauranga needs to be understood as a whole knowledge system, epistemology and ontology [23] (p. 83); which 'includes science' but also recognises the importance of 'experiential systems', em-phasising 'relationship-based learning' and 'exploring, theorising and understanding' at the local level [23] (p. 83) . M\u0101tauranga is passed between generations and developed through multiple practices, including arts and technologies [23] . Therefore, as outlined in this paper, M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori has a fundamentally different way of regarding ecosystems to European-based knowledge, implicating how they are lived with and managed [40] [41] [42] [43] . There is no dichotomy between humans and the natural world; rather relationships with the environment include the spiritual, genealogical, affective, cognitive and behavioural ties to a physical location as a result of the meanings and histories within it [40] .",

In other words, the 'structures of Western science, such as the specific compartmentalisation into disciplines, the hierarchies organising knowledge within those disciplines, and the types of knowledge that are excluded or included', continue to 'reflect Western philosophical traditions' [23] (p. 83). For example, after editing a journal special issue comparing research insights from M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori and Western science, the editor reflected on why there are 'few explicit references to the Western scientific method as a formalised, culturally specific method of learning' [45] (p. 164). He observes, 'the statement that the process of science is \"not negotiable\" is both misinformed and tending toward bigotry. In fact, Western science has a long history of cultural adaptation and development, and remains open for negotiation of new ways of thinking and learning'. He concludes that, 'Western culture holds no monopoly on logic-based knowledge or the acquisition of reliable knowledge' [45] (p. 164).",

            "text": "This paper builds on these insights which, as we show, are central to our transdisciplinary engagement. Furthermore, we recognise that knowledge production is essentially political and historical. Therefore any engagement with M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori perspectives must always recognise past and existing frameworks of power [46] . M\u0101tauranga has been treated as 'knowledge to be exploited, but not supported' [23] (p. 84), and M\u0101ori have written extensively about the ongoing impact of colonisation on M\u0101tauranga [46] , including the ways Aotearoa New Zealand Government 'policies and systems have marginalised M\u0101tauranga and prioritised Western science' [23] . While most universities and external research funding agencies now require investigators to show some measure of M\u0101ori perspective or commitment to M\u0101ori communities in their research, many commentators argue this is a 'box-ticking exercise', offering only lip-service to Aotearoa New Zealand being a bi-cultural nation [23, 39] . However, initiatives in environmental science are increasingly operating within the Treaty of Waitangi [47] principles, in so doing recognising M\u0101ori sovereignty and decision-making power over all things M\u0101ori (i.e., environmental resources), and viewing M\u0101ori as 'scientists, experts, collaborators and colleagues', not simply informants or subjects. For example, M\u0101ori researchers in the 'Our land and water' National Science Challenge research programme are, 'combining M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori and Western science' in ways they suggest 'will result in a new wave of applied, integrated science that is distinctly designed for Aotearoa' [48] . We concur that there is not one way of knowing that should shape responses to different local, national and international environmental issues. Our aim in this paper is to show, through engaging in this national context of Aotearoa, that drawing on Indigenous knowledges is ethical and necessary in how we understand, care for, and develop relationships with blue spaces and marine ecosystems.",

            "text": "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: first we outline our transdisciplinary approach to understanding ocean-human health and wellbeing by discussing the different bodies of literature from which this is drawn. Although beyond the scope of this paper, we recognise that transdisciplinary is a term that is used differently across disciplines and subject areas. Here, transdisciplinary refers to knowledge production that is both inter-disciplinary, and also attempts to reflect on and challenge dominant ways of knowing. Engaging in transdisciplinary research creates many challenges, not least the ways in which the 'knowledge structures, data or mind sets, theories, models, paradigms, norms, values, interests, linguistic forms, and the roles of actors and institutions' are understood in our different disciplinary approaches [49] . This difficulty of 'integration' as Klein [49] outlines, is rooted in long-standing debates in Western philosophy about the assumptions and limitations of 'different disciplinary' constructions of the world. However, if transdisciplinary research is to address a societal problem, such as ocean-human health, the emphasis and approach needs to shift away from 'traditional epistemology' focused on universality to conflicts of knowledge, hybridity and contextuality' [49] (p. 11). These important debates are at the heart of the transdisciplinary project. Second, we explain the bicultural context of Aotearoa New Zealand, briefly explaining how M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori influences understandings of coastal environments and the interconnected relationship with human, and 'more-than-human', wellbeing [50] . Importantly, we show that this worldview impacts not just those who identify as M\u0101ori, but is embedded in a range of informal and formal practices and policies [51, 52] . We then discuss existing empirical research on surfing, to show the different, but interconnected, cultural and wellbeing benefits and socio-ecological relationships. This discussion draws on a number of projects the authors have conducted, past and in-process, all of which involve qualitative fieldwork, and in-depth interviews (outlined in Section 2.3). This discussion is supplemented by a new case study of coastal recreation during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Aotearoa conducted April-July 2020, drawing on 'mainstream' media, social media, and personal observations (discussed in Section 3). The lockdown responses amongst surfers impacted coastal communities across Aotearoa New Zealand revealed the significance and meanings of coastal recreation generally, and surfing specifically, for the population at large. Finally, we offer some conclusions and recommendations for future work.",

[16] introduced the term 'cultural ecosystem services' (CES) to conceptualise the non-material cultural benefits that occur in the interactions between environmental spaces (i.e., physical settings such as rivers, lakes, coasts) and the cultural practices that take place within them. Yet as Bryce et al. [55] outline, there is a dearth of research that explores CES and systematically integrates them into more established ecosystem service assessments. They [55] introduced a typology of relevant cultural practices that includes; playing and exercising; creative and expressing activities; gathering and consuming; and producing and caring. Their research suggests that, through these activities, the multiple cultural wellbeing benefits that develop include place-based identity (e.g., sense of belonging), experiences (e.g., connection to nature), and capabilities (e.g., physical and mental health, skills, and knowledge). Furthermore, through this connection to nature, a sense of belonging and an ethic of care and responsibility can develop which, they suggest, can lead to people supporting the ongoing management and restoration of these ecosystems [55] . This conceptualisation positions CES in a place-based context, recognizing the mutually reinforcing relationships between environmental spaces and cultural practices.",

In contrast to the dominant pathogenic focus on health risks and problems, this research has explored the factors that support health and wellbeing, particularly the qualities of water which are \"affective, life-enhancing, and health-enabling\" [56] (p. 2). The authors' focus on water as healing has a long history across many cultures, with seaside destinations seen as therapeutic sites for leisure and health (e.g., thalassotherapy) [57] . Coastal 'blue spaces' have been interpreted as \"therapeutic landscapes,\" providing physical, psychological, social, and spiritual benefits. These benefits develop from both individual and community experiences and relationships [58] and may arise from immersion or simply visual embrace of the sea [37, 58] . This growing body of work has illustrated the different ways in which coastal spaces can foster physical and emotional health and wellbeing across diverse groups, from those who watch, listen, and smell from the shore, to full-immersion activities such as surfing and swimming [56, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] .",

As research across diverse national contexts including England, Ireland, South Africa, USA, and Australia illustrates, coastal spaces can operate as places of white retreat and safety, e.g., [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . At a more local scale, beaches can be 'colonised' by activity groups such as surfers, fishers or users of off-road vehicles [71] . Therefore, research needs to also consider the different cultural, economic, socio-demographic, and political factors that contribute to a disconnect with particular coastal bluespaces, as well as those that foster connectedness [35, 62] . In contemporary Aotearoa New Zealand, as we show below, it is a contested [71, 72] and liminal space where cultural and spiritual significance has been increasingly in friction with the 'capture' exerted by real estate and aspirations associated with the capitalist gaze [29] .",

            "text": "These inequalities and dissonances also relate to how we are able to experience and develop health and wellbeing. Wellbeing is a concept that has been diversely defined across disciplines from neuroscience to social science, therefore recognising these different conceptions of wellbeing is vital [73] . At its heart, wellbeing is about being well, and being implies the 'whereness' of living [74] . In contrast to health, which despite recognition of its multidimensional aspects is often more focused on the absence of disease, wellbeing comprises more multidimensional, subjective, and holistic dimensions of a life [74] [75] [76] . Wellbeing's complexity lies in the way it connects to a spectrum of social, cultural, economic, spiritual, cognitive, emotional, physiological, and symbolic processes. A useful connection to coastal places can be built around Gesler's notion of therapeutic landscapes [77] , which refers to sites where physical and built environments along with memory and reputation combine to produce an atmosphere conducive to healing. Wellbeing therefore recognises the value of centralising people's emotions, affects, and experiences [75] , as well as the diverse contexts and culturally dependent ways of conceptualizing wellbeing [62] . Within blue space research, 'place-based' understandings and promotion of health and wellbeing are increasingly advocated [56] , an approach that emphasises the cultural and environmental specificity of wellbeing for specific populations, a perspective that underpins our case study. These concerns are also reflected in M\u0101ori models of health and health promotion [78] [79] [80] . Yet, in settler societies like Aotearoa, the politics of colonisation continue to impact understandings of connections between health, wellbeing and place [71] [72] [73] . Different contexts affect Indigenous M\u0101ori health, and relationships to place amongst Indigenous M\u0101ori run deeper and longer than settler-colonizers [81, 82] . As Durie [78] (p. 70) suggests, the natural environment is so fundamental to a sense of wellbeing for M\u0101ori that tribal elders regard 'lack of access to tribal lands or territories' as an important indicator of poor health. Therefore, as Panelli and Tipa [80, 83] suggest, a \"place-based\" approach to wellbeing enables the linking of culture, current and ancestral relationships, and environments into understandings of the interconnections between the health of ecosystems and humans. As we argue in this paper, recognising conceptions of wellbeing, and of place beyond dominant Western, European ideological traditions that have separated humans from 'nature', helps to recognise tensions inherent in settler-colonial populations including around blue spaces. Importantly, and while not our focus here, this approach also promotes health leadership by Indigenous peoples whose relationships to colonized places run deeper and longer than settler-colonizers.",

A M\u0101ori worldview begins with the Creation narrative and Te Kore (the void), an aeon of vast emptiness [91] . Out of Te Kore came Te P\u014d (a period of darkness), during which the primordial parents Papat\u016b\u0101nuku (Earth Mother) and Ranginui (Sky Father) came into being. Papat\u016b\u0101nuku and Ranginui were locked in a matrimonial embrace, and during this time a number of their progeny grew tired of being confined to the small and dark space [91] . T\u0101ne-Mahuta (god of the forest) was successful in separating the parents and brought light into the world-Te Ao Marama (the world of light) [91] . From there, the various M\u0101ori deities took their respective places within Te Ao Kikokiko and Te Ao Wairua. Whilst slightly different versions exist between some iwi (tribe/s), the creation narrative exemplifies the importance of the environment and the intimate link between humans and natural world.",

The demise of these traditional narratives and customs occurred as a result of British colonisation (e.g., the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907) [95] . The colonisation of M\u0101ori and Aotearoa NZ involved the actions of missionaries (to pacify M\u0101ori), the military (to keep M\u0101ori pacified), and mass immigration (to overpopulate and assimilate M\u0101ori). Mass land confiscations uprooted whole communities, sub-tribes, and tribes and decimated M\u0101ori trade and economy. Use of te reo M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori language) was discouraged to the point that it nearly became extinct, much like the M\u0101ori population. Despite this, the past 40-50 years has seen a resurgence in M\u0101ori identity and self-determination [92] . Part of this resurgence has involved the rise in M\u0101ori who are seeking to re-claim this knowledge system to help improve M\u0101ori wellbeing and the tai\u0101o (environment). Furthermore, within the sphere of coastal leisure, amongst activities that have seen a resurgence in popularity, are waka ama and waka hourua (voyaging canoes) [96, 97] . Alongside an increase in participation numbers within these activities, numerous Indigenous researchers are reclaiming these knowledge systems [98, 99] .",

Immigration and urbanisation have led to increasing hybridity, as well as many more M\u0101ori in urban contexts, often becoming disconnected with their M\u0101tauranga. While research suggesting M\u0101ori are more likely to report involvement in pro-environment behaviour than P\u0101keh\u0101 or those of other ethnicities [85, 87] , it is also the case that New Zealanders of all ethnicities identify themselves as outdoor people, who have pride in the belief that they live in a 'cleaner and greener environment than is found in many other developed countries' [85] (p. 40). Indeed, adopting positive attitudes to the natural environment has been shown to be central to settlement experiences for new migrants for developing a sense of belonging [86] . As Wheaton et al. [31] illustrate, M\u0101ori knowledge connected to 'wellbeing, leisure, and the outdoor world' continue to have particular significance for M\u0101ori but also impact across communities, and to some extent dominant national 'discourses, policies, and practices' around coastal leisure activities and outdoor education (pp. 92-93).",

            "text": "In the final section of the paper we explore public responses to the loss of mobility and freedom experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown in Aotearoa with respect to access to beaches and participation in surfing. The initial COVID-19 full-lockdown in Aotearoa New Zealand began 25 March 2020, and continued until 27 April 2020, and was imposed with speed and severity. The first case of the virus was reported on 28 February 2020. At this time public health experts urged the government to act with great urgency, convinced that Aotearoa New Zealand could stop the virus from spreading, and even wipe it out entirely, if a lockdown was implemented strictly and swiftly. The nation returned to Level 1 on midnight 8 June 2020 [105] . These events brought the significance and meanings of coastal recreation generally, and surfing specifically, into sharp relief for Aotearoa New Zealanders. The research team were already engaged with a number of research projects exploring aspects of wellbeing and ocean-based leisure including surfing [30, 33, 35, 89, 106, 107] , which provided some background context. These qualitative research projects involving participant observation (three of the authors are regular surfers) and in-depth interviews with surfers in Aotearoa, including men and women across a range of ages, and self-identified as M\u0101ori, P\u0101keh\u0101, and migrants who now call Aotearoa home. Within these projects, all subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and as approved by the University of Waikato Human Research Ethics Committee HREC (health) 2018#76 and 2019#06. For this new case study of the COVID-19 lockdown period, (March-July 2020), data was collected via fieldwork (participant observation) and media analysis. All of the research team were living in, or have close connections to, coastal communities during lockdown. Researchers complied field notes of their experiences and daily interactions, including 'exercise' walking on the beach, and interactions on social media (i.e., Facebook, Instagram), including sites frequented by surfers locally and around New Zealand. Second, we collated national newspaper articles (between March-July 2020) that discussed beaches, water-sports or surfing. We also included conversations from publicly available social media groups about surfing and water sports (e.g., Surfing New Zealand, Surf Life Saving New Zealand). All social media posts used in the discussion are from public (but unnamed) sources, or permission has been granted. However, for ethical reasons these are all anonymised, and all place names removed. The data-written notes, social media posts, newspaper articles-were analysed thematically [108] , and in conversation with theoretical ideas in the literature on coastal immersion in surfing and swimming.",

Therefore, we briefly highlight the methodological and epistemological assumptions that underpin this research, recognising that for those readers in the 'natural' sciences who adopt-at least tacitly-a positivist epistemology, these will not be familiar. Our place-based case-study is rooted in a constructionist interpretivist epistemology, or theory of knowledge. Social-constructionism emphasises that our knowledge and understandings of the world evolve through our active and creative interaction with our environments, other people and other entities. In this paradigm 'nature' is not perceived as separate from human culture [108] . Social constructionism also understands the central role of language and communication, which actively constitute or creates these realities which can be multiple and that compete for truth and legitimacy [108] . Such epistemologies often align with inductive methodologies. For example, recognising the contextual ways in which reality is constructed, the research objective necessarily shifts from hypothesis and broad generalisations across society, to reveal the complex and often conflicting ways in which the analysis of peoples' stories provide insights into understanding experiences [109, 110] . These methodologies therefore involve different processes and criteria to natural sciences (informed by a positivist epistemology) impacting all aspects of methodology (i.e., from framing research questions, theory development, through to analysis and the criteria used to present and validate data [110] . This methodology is also complementary with M\u0101tauranga Maori, which, as discussed (in the introduction) also rejects the structures, hierarchies, and types of knowledge embodied in Western philosophical traditions of science.",

            "text": "The unusual circumstances of the lockdown showed how surfers had previously taken-for-granted their mobility and access to the coast. Multiple comments revealed the everyday importance of coastal recreation for people's sense of wellbeing. This was a typical comment: 'this is a surreal situation that none of us have ever experienced before. Those of us who live on the coast have never been told we cannot go in the ocean and would never imagine that day would come'. [111] During this time of lockdown, debates about the importance of coastal leisure for health and wellbeing, including physical (i.e., exercise), mental, spiritual and economic elements (such as fishing and shellfish gathering) quickly became prominent in national media [112] . Early advice (25 March) from Police Commissioner Mike Bush made it clear that while outdoor exercise was encouraged 'you are not allowed to drive to the beach or to a park or to anywhere non-essential' [111] . Surfers interpreted these messages in different ways, with many (along with other ocean-user communities including swimmers, kite-surfers, kayakers, paddlers, stand-up paddle boarders) arguing that they considered surfing as 'essential' or as 'daily exercise'. For example, a man who had been surfing for 50 years, who was interviewed in the national press after receiving a police warning for surfing at his 'local' beach [113] , regarded being able to go out for a paddle as essential for his (and his wife's) wellbeing. Unconcerned about the possibility of being arrested, he argued, \"[Surfing] is good for our mental sanity\" [113] . This sentiment was echoed across the subsequent posts that flooded social media: '[surfing] Is essential for mental health purposes' (surfer, female).",

[114] The experience of being denied access to the ocean spaces they are usually able to surf unimpeded, offered insight into the degree to which surfers rely on oceans and beaches for their health and wellbeing. The perspectives expressed above offer a \"salutogenic\" way of thinking about human health and the ocean, in that they are focused on the ocean as healthgiving and health-enabling [115] . Adapting Gesler's [77] idea introduced earlier, these surfers experience oceans and beaches as a \"therapeutic seascape\" seen as essential to their health and wellbeing. Yet, like the surfer who risked arrest due to the importance of the beach he feels to his mental health [113] , social media posts suggest surfers had never thought of this experience as anything less than an entitlement which caused further tensions.",

[120] Despite government rhetoric of 'our team of 5 million' being in this together and 'being kind' to each other [105] , on-line 'vigilantism' particularly through community-based social media, was prevalent as some surfers continued to ignore the rules, while also speaking out against the public and police who took them to task [111, 115, 119, 120] . Coastal communities and surfers particularly were under surveillance, from the police, and from each other. The following online 'conversation' was typical on community social media: Lockdown exposed and amplified some of the underlying tensions in these communities, such as between surfers and non-surfers, 'locals' [68] , and non-locals (variously defined), and those who are permanent house dwellers and so-called 'freedom campers.' [51] The latter group, characterised on social media as 'foreigners living in vans,' were often accused of leaving their rubbish, and 'unlike kiwi surfers' had 'no respect for the coastline' (social media posts). The sense of 'them and us' between the coastal community and city dwellers, was highlighted in multiple posts, such as a lockdown ditty critiquing people coming to their holiday homes (attributed to Abby Lawrence), which was re-posted by a surfer on a community social media page and received over 100 'likes'. In some cases, these claims to being local' and disputes about going surfing were also tied to whakapapa (genealogy), such as 'If your bloodline ties to [place] you're an original local. By all means come and stop me' (social media post).",

M\u0101ori recalled their experiences from the 1919 Spanish influenza epidemic that greatly affected those communities [123] and were therefore concerned that people would come from the cities (i.e., COVID hotspots) back to their 'baches' (Note: this is a term for holiday or beach houses) and bring the virus into these small rural communities. Indeed, the road closures were a pro-active public health response that promoted tribal mana whakahaere (autonomy). Social media posts from the general public including some M\u0101ori showed a general lack of disregard and disrespect towards this public health measure. These posts often cited personal grievances against one of the tribal leaders, or commonly referred to the narrative of M\u0101ori blocking access to the beaches, a widespread, yet incorrect, narrative perpetuated by those who think M\u0101ori have and continue to deny access to beaches [124, 125] .",

In this case, however, locals (both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori) seemed supportive of this measure, with the only backlash appearing to come from international tourists [122] . Moreover, a similar roadblock had occurred at this same place in mid-2019 at this same place in response to the vandalism of culturally established pou (carved wooden post) which demarcated a shellfish collecting exclusion zone. This customary r\u0101hui (ban) has been established to ensure that the local shellfish populations are protected and are able to rejuvenate [124] . During the lockdown, a similar r\u0101hui was established on the Waipa and Waikato rivers (by the M\u0101ori king, Kiingi Tuheitia) [126] . This ban prohibited food gathering and all recreational activities on the waterways. This ban was established to ensure the mauri (life-force) of these waterways were able to recover and to contain the spread of COVID. This was explained as being \"about informing the people and letting everyone know that, actually, because the waterways are a source of spiritual inspiration for our people, they need time to recover too\".

Rather, around the country surf breaks had much higher than usual numbers of people, including those who had not been in the water for many years, as well as first-time surfers. A Wellington surfer of 28 years reported [130] 'he had never seen so many surfers there at once' and that 'It was like a seal colony of 150 plus surfers stretching across the whole bay' in contrast to up to 40 people on a regular weekend. News reports confirmed that Kiwis took to the beach in their masses, 'in the water, walking their dogs, watching the sunrise and all sorts' [128] . This beach-going and surfing trend was still apparent several months later, and through winter.

As research on 'surf therapy' wellbeing initiatives that have been proliferating around the world [30, 130, 131] has also shown, these wellbeing benefits of ocean immersion are multi-sensory. lisahunter and Stoodley [34] explored surfers' relationships with salt-water, using various technologies to capture their multi-sensory experiences, feelings and 'entanglements with water' (p. 4). Their work focused less on what participants thought about surfing, but rather on their experiences of 'seeing, hearing, and feeling it', such as 'the smells and sounds of the coast, the temperature and movement of the water, and the taste of salt in the air' (p. 8). Their research [34] helps explain how the saltwater ecosystems in which surfers are immersed are central to the health-enabling aspects of surfing as an ocean practice. They also show how the benefits of surfing are not only in the water itself, but also the connection with human and non-human others in the water [34] . For example, participants explained the pleasures of 'waiting for a wave, the splashing of the water, and sociality with others, both friends or casual acquaintances' (p. 19) . They also referred to 'how the absence of surfing made them feel frustrated or unhappy' [34] (p. 12). Nonetheless, the 'buzz' of surfing can endure beyond the surf session. For many, the opportunity to go surfing is infrequent, yet simply recalling the memory of the experience, for some sustained wellbeing benefits [129] :",

This healing of te tai\u0101o (the environment) was exemplified when a school of kanae (mullet-a type of fish) was seen along the unusually clear shorelines of Okahu Bay in central Auckland. Some of the local kaum\u0101tua of Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua (one of the tribes located in central Auckland) recalled that they hadn't seen kanae there since before they were 'booted up the hill' following the land confiscations in 1951 (social media post). Often M\u0101ori (surfers and non-surfers) also pointed out that the ocean was not solely for surfing; that the beach was 'like a p\u0101taka kai (pantry) where people actually go gathering for food around the shoreline', or a place to engage with the M\u0101ori deities (social media post). As food gathering was prohibited in lockdown, many iwi (tribes) sent care packages to tribal members, no matter where in the country they were. Some of the more remote iwi also incorporated local delicacies (i.e., seafood and other wild foods) in the packages. However, broader discussion about whether and how sea/landscapes were impacted by the absence of humans, who are usually a part of these ecosystems, was not prevalent amongst surfers. For example, was there perhaps more plastic left uncollected after being washed up on beaches, or animals who missed their regular human companions? To be clear, we are not advocating for a version of environmental sustainability that excludes humans, yet despite surfer's common assertions of themselves as environmental stewards [33, 132] and of the role ocean places play in their health, there was less reflection amongst surfers on such possibilities. Furthermore, many surfers were only able to see what they were being denied, rather than seeking out alternative nature space environments such as the forests or hills, which as research has shown also have therapeutic benefits [61] . The lack of water access caused a level of anxiety amongst surfers that did not translate to. In this sense, surfers' relationships are, perhaps, place-myopic rather than 'place-responsive' [133] .",

However, as previous research has shown, blue spaces can also be sites of exclusion [33, 56] . In this case study, the surfer's language and attitudes were highly localised and exclusive; many did not believe that beach access should be extended to all individuals. Indeed, reflecting previous research, some surfers saw themselves as having deeper oceanic relationships than other citizens [132] , and therefore, they claimed greater 'rights'-even 'needs'-to access their 'local' beaches than more casual water users. The impact of these beliefs was the exclusion of some individuals and groups, and therefore that these wellbeing benefits are not available and extended to all.",

Therefore, as Fish et. al. [16] and other in CES research have argued, research needs to reveal these important 'non-material cultural benefits that occur in the interactions between environmental spaces (i.e., coasts) and the cultural practices (i.e., surfing) that take place within them.",

In particular, our concern has been for how the health of marine environments and people are interlinked, and how Indigenous perspectives can deepen appreciation, as well as equity considerations, of understandings of place and the performance of wellbeing. We have acknowledged the ways that Indigenous knowledge systems centrally locate the ontological significance and long-term sustainable use of marine resources. The contradiction, however, is that despite aspirations for sustainable seas and coastlines, such knowledge is persistently marginalised in international research concerning these socio-ecological systems. The exception is research on, by, and for Indigenous communities which, in remaining an important yet niche endeavour, continues to reinforce a position of Indigenous marginalisation in society and the academy and policy sphere. As researchers, not only do we need to explore the knowledges relevant to the places, spaces and communities we research, but also recognise that Indigenous peoples can offer place-specific leadership that cares for place while also challenging oppressive histories.",

Our research demonstrated that the activity is more than a recreational pursuit on and in the ocean's surface layer. Rather, it is a metaphorical as well as literal (and near-littoral) immersive practice creating strong bonds between surfers and coastal places. While M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 surfers to some extent continue to embody different knowledges and meanings, these bonds were experienced across these surfing communities.",

            "text": "We have demonstrated the value of a transdisciplinary, place-based approach that integrates inter-disciplinary research across the humanities and social sciences, including cultural and health geography, sociologies of leisure and sport, and Indigenous knowledge, in this case, M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori. Despite its pervasiveness in the everyday experience in Aotearoa New Zealand, the relationships between marine ecosystems, M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori and human health and wellbeing are still relatively under-studied. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the processes used in M\u0101ori 'science' have an important role in removing the boundaries between disciplines and helping teams of scientists with different areas of expertise to integrate their knowledge [22, 41, 42, 47] . These processes are not only inspiring 'new conceptions of knowledge and approaches to creating knowledge', but are also helping to develop the 'skills that promote conversation and learning from different knowledge systems' [41] (p. 86). In other words, they enable an ecological way of thinking about wellbeing such that, in Aotearoa, a partnering between Western and M\u0101ori science is allowing an incorporation of M\u0101ori wellbeing ontologies. As researchers develop more integrated and transdisciplinary work on human and ocean health and wellbeing, we encourage researchers to engage with the Indigenous knowledge systems that reflect the values of the places they are working with and from. In so doing, transdisciplinary research teams can develop more integrated methods to identify practical, ethical, and sustainable solutions.
