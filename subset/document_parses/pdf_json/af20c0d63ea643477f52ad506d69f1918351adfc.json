Thus, reaching herd immunity not only depends on the efficacy of the vaccine itself, but also on overcoming this hesitancy of uptake in the population. In this study, we revealed the determinants regarding vaccination directly from people's opinions on Twitter, based on the framework of the 6As taxonomy. Covid-19 vaccine acceptance depends mostly on the characteristics of new vaccines (i.e. their safety, side effects, effectiveness, etc.), and the national vaccination strategy (i.e. immunization schedules, quantities of vaccination points and their localization, etc.), which should focus on increasing citizens' awareness, among various other factors. The results of this study point to areas for potentially improving mass campaigns of Covid-19 immunization to increase vaccine uptake and its coverage and also provide insight into possible directions of future research.",

To bring this pandemic to an end, a large proportion of the world needs to be immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Herd immunity is a key concept for pandemic control and its extinction [9] . However, to achieve herd immunity and cut the transmission chain, using a vaccine with a claimed 95% efficacy, we need to vaccinate at least 63% to 76% of the population [7] . This required vaccine coverage is certainly very high, and may not be easily attained for many reasons. This is a huge challenge not only for pharmaceutical companies and finite healthcare resources, but also for government agencies and regulatory authorities [8] , [9] , [31] .",

In the face of the current Covid-19 pandemic, a pragmatic methodology (beyond questionnaire experiments) is needed to reach the main determinants of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance, which is lacking in the literature. For that reason, this study aims to fill this gap. The study is based on text data obtained from Twitter regarding vaccines in Poland.

The proposed approach (i) examines the main determinants of vaccine uptake, (ii) identifies possible root causes of nonvaccination, (iii) outlines the relevance of the determinants for citizens' perceptions, and (iv) can support the subsequent design of robust and evidence-based interventions by governments.

The reasons behind decisions to refuse or delay vaccination are varied and context-specific, thus there is no single form that vaccine hesitancy takes [11] . According to [2] , the acceptance and adherence to public health recommendations by the population depend largely on the way people perceive a threat. The study of [12] revealed a comprehensive list of concerns related to the Covid-19 immunization of people who do not wish to be vaccinated. Respondents most frequently reported: lack of proper testing of vaccines (74.1%), vaccine adverse effects (65.1%), lack of vaccine effectiveness (44.9%) and improper transport/storage of vaccines (14%). However, the results of campaigns to encourage vaccination are not only dependent on vaccine efficacy and safety. Effective communication campaigns are needed, based on transparency and focusing on restoring trust in authorities, the government and medical professionals [14] . According to [13] , vaccine acceptance among the general public and healthcare workers plays a crucial role in the successful control of the pandemic. We can consider immunization programs to be effective when there are high rates of coverage and acceptance in the population [15] . To achieve this, detecting the determinants of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance is crucial.",

The assumption of focusing only on Polish tweets was aimed at: (i) selecting only one country for evaluation as a case study; (ii) providing access to discussions regarding homogeneous government regulations on vaccination; and (iii) guaranteeing the relative universality of the results for other European Union countries, given that Poland is also a member. After collecting the data, we performed the pre-processing steps. Tweets in a language other than Polish were deleted, duplicate or empty tweets were removed, and finally, we obtained a set of 105 849 tweets ready for further data analysis.",

The following information for each tweet was downloaded: (i) tweet full text, (ii) the numbers of favorites and retweets, (iii) user geolocation; (iv) user description/selfcreated profile, (v) tweet date and hour. In order to check whether the data are balanced, we divided all tweets into subsets (covering a period of 7 days) to identify tweets in the material in terms of a place and date of publication. The content in each subset was then compared to see if the data were evenly distributed. This experiment proved that the data was well balanced.

Unsupervised learning was chosen because it is commonly used and allows us to conduct exploratory analyses of large text data in social science research [47] . As a result of topic modeling with the usage of the WordStat software, 33 topics, described by top-weighted keywords, were obtained. Next, an iterative process of topic labeling was performed: (i) topics were labeled to create the first version of labels based on the keywords with the greatest weight, (ii) names of labels were polished through in-depth reading of the most representative topic tweets, and (iii) the final set of topic labels was created. Similar to [47] , [49] and [52] , our thematic approach relied on human interpretation. Thus, this approach could be significantly influenced by personal understanding of the topics and a variety of biases. The results of this stage are part of the supplementary material: Table B .

This is especially true for elderly or disabled people who need the support of third parties to undergo the vaccination procedure. Not everyone can count on free support from their family members. This follows indirectly from the study [40] , which found that seniors who lived alone had a lower likelihood of having received the vaccine than those who lived with others. Some have to pay for the help of an assistant in this process.",

Three types of incentive techniques have been identified to stimulate activation: (i) prompts and reminders, (ii) workplace policies, (iii) incentives. The first group included two topics with negative sentiment. The need for direct (or telephone) contact especially with seniors regarding vaccination was pointed out, as this group is constantly overlooked in government programs due to digital exclusion [34] , [44] . This result is also consistent with [40] , who revealed that receiving a reminder from a doctor (67.7%) was an important influence on accepting a vaccination. According to [22] , providing reminders to staff in aged care facilities significantly increased influenza vaccine uptake. Thus, sending reminders about vaccination terms to people is a good idea, and according to [33] , for the elderly generation, also in the form of a personal letter. In addition, another theme of negative sentiment was the lack of contextualization advertising, best represented by the tweet: ''The vaccine isn't yogurt, but that's a bit how it's advertised??''. 5 In this area, an important element for improvement is the creation of thoughtful advertising. To support an effective launch of new Covid-19 vaccines, a government needs to understand the community's concerns, and design such advertising strategies that will neutralize them, and eventually encourage vaccine uptake. Since ''one size does not fit all'', the work of [41] recommended avoiding generic messages and instead, considering the different emotional states of the community in tailored vaccine communication efforts.",

The tone of the tweets reflected the split of opinions on mandatory vaccination from acceptance to outright rejection of such a proposal. Examples were shared of forced vaccination by some employers, and the legal implications of this approach were discussed. The study of [38] suggests that obligatory mandates of the Covid-19 vaccination may be ineffective or, worse still, induce a backlash. In turn, the research of [42] reported that 48.1% of respondents would accept their employer's recommendation to vaccinate. They also claimed an attentive balance is required between educating the public about the necessity for universal vaccine coverage and avoiding any suggestion of coercion.",

Moreover, [36] claimed that payment for vaccination is morally suspect, likely unnecessary, and may be counterproductive. Similarly, [39] argued that financial incentives are likely to discourage vaccination (particularly among those most concerned about adverse effects), and instead, contingent nonfinancial incentives are the desired approach.",

The first of these created the Protection determinant, which includes comments presenting a wide range of discrimination against unvaccinated people (e.g. a curfew and travel ban for the unvaccinated, etc.). According to the public health principle of least harm to achieve a public health goal, policymakers should implement the option that least impairs individual liberties [43] . The next two topics were labeled Insurance. In this group of tweets, there were threads related to the lack of compensation in the case of death related to the Covid-19 vaccination, and insurance in the event of vaccine complications. The necessity of testing people before the vaccination itself was also indicated to diagnose possible contraindications and eliminate post-vaccination complications.",

Policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove vaccination obstacles, false rumors, and misconceptions regarding the Covid-19 vaccines. Thus, the knowledge of determinants influencing Covid-19 vaccine acceptance can help to create communication strategies that are much needed to strengthen trust in government and health authorities. The study recognized that those interested in vaccination pay the greatest attention to the determinants in the area of Awareness and Acceptance. For this reason, the promotion of broad and detailed information regarding the vaccines and their side effects, safety and efficacy becomes a key direction in favor of Covid-19 vaccine uptake.",
