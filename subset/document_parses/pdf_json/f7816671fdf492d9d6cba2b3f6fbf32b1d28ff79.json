Age discrimination in hiring also increases during recessions (Dahl & Knepper, 2020) , contributing to the longer unemployment durations for older workers.

(2014) found that workers approaching retirement during a recession are disproportionately likely to suffer long-lasting negative consequences, including years of reduced replacement earnings, loss of health-care coverage, lower utilization of health care, and reduced longevity. The number of households \"at risk\" for being unable to maintain their preretirement standard of living in retirement also increased during the Great Recession (Munnell & Rutledge, 2013) . This decrease in retirement security was driven both by increases in early retirement (Rutledge & Coe, 2012) , which spreads retirement savings and Social Security over a longer time frame, and reductions in retirement assets (e.g., decreases in 401k plans).",

The economic shock of COVID-19 hit employed individuals of ages 65+ years and women more harshly, but while a smaller economic shock hit younger workers and men, there were more of them that were impacted due to higher existing employment rates, hence the higher percentage point decreases. Figure 2 and Table 1 present labor force participation rates. There were no significant decreases in the participation rates in previous recessions for any group, but there has been a clear decrease since 2019 for all age groups. Like with the employment rate, those ages 65+ years experienced the largest percent decrease (5.57%). Unfortunately, the data do not allow us to track retirement; however, Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber's (2020) analysis of the Nielsen Homescan panel data suggests that retirement increased significantly. Before COVID-19, 52.7% of those not working or looking for work stated that they were retired, and this increased to 59.5% in early April 2020. Table 1 present the official (U-3) unemployment rates. The increase in the unemployment rate in April 2020 was dramatic and rapid, with unemployment rates increasing by a staggering 13.81 percentage points for women ages 65+ years, compared to the average rates in 2019, resulting in an unemployment rate of 16.85%. For men ages 65+ years this was an 11.36 percentage point increase, resulting in an unemployment rate of 14.26%. Unemployment rates also increased significantly, but by much less, for the younger age groups: 9.70 percentage point increase for ages 25-44 years versus 9.76 for ages 55-64 years. These were massive percent changes in unemployment rates, between 282% and 454%. Workers ages 65+ years and women faced both higher percentage point and percent increases in unemployment rates.",

In Figure 3 , the increase in the unemployment rate in the early onset of COVID-19 was two to three times larger than that from the peak of the Great Recession of 2007-2009. We also see that the COVID-19 recession impacted workers ages 65+ years more than younger workers, while this was the opposite in previous recessions. Figure 4 presents the broader U-6 measure of unemployment rates by age group and sex, and Table 1 summarizes the percentage point and percent decreases in the U-6 rate. The gap between the U-6 and U-3 rates was the largest for workers ages 65+ years, especially for women, meaning that they were more likely to be marginally attached to the labor force or underemployed (these groups are counted in the U-6 rate). Using the U-6 rate shows an even higher unemployment rate in April 2020, of between 20.24 and 29.18%. The percentage point increase in the U-6 rate was again the largest for ages 65+ years, especially for women, but the difference in the percentage point increase by age group and sex was less pronounced using the U-6 rate. Results using our further broadened \"U-6+\" rate are similar (Table 1) .",

We find that older workers, especially women, were more impacted by COVID-19 and this recession than by previous recessions, where older workers were generally less affected. The fact that older workers were hit harder this time is likely driven by the higher mortality rates for older people. For those that got COVID-19, mortality rates were 8.6% for those in their 70s, 4% for those in their 60s, 1.25% for those in their 50s, and 0.3% for those in their 40s (Begley, 2020) .

First, working longer is less safe. This is especially the case for many bridge jobs that older workers take to delay retirement. Examples of common bridge jobs include managerial positions, transportation drivers, sales, and construction roles for men, and managerial, administrative/clerical, sales, and personal service roles for women (Cahill et al., 2011; Neumark et al., 2019) . However, bridge jobs appear to often have higher rates of face-to-face contact and are less likely to allow for remote work, especially for women (Montenovo et al., 2020) . Early evidence suggests that retirement increased significantly in the first month of the pandemic (Coibion et al., 2020) , suggesting that older workers are retiring early instead of taking the risk.",

The Social Security Trust Funds were already in a difficult position before COVID-19 as they were forecasted to be exhausted by 2035 (Brandus, 2020) . The federal government may need to enact reforms to improve the solvency of the system earlier than anticipated. These reforms could include cutting benefits, such as by further increasing the full benefits retirement age beyond 67 years. However, this would further decrease retirement security. A better option may be to increase revenue for the system by increasing Social Security taxes, borrowing more money, or cutting expenditures elsewhere in the federal budget to maintain or increase Social Security benefits.",
