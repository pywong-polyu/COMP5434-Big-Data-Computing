Through parent peaks, fragment peaks, fragmentation characteristics, and comparative analysis with the literature and reference standards, a total of 77 components from the methanol extracts including 18 coumarins, 24 flavonoids, seven organic acids, three limonoids, and 25 other compounds were detected and identified. Among them, 15 components have not been reported previously in the CSF. Notably, the stachydrine peak initially showed a higher content in the total ion current chromatogram. Overall, CSF produced in the Zhejiang province contained a richer variety of chemical compositions. These observations provided a theoretical basis for the further quality assessment and application of CSF.",

With a high separation efficiency, a fast scanning speed, a high throughput, a high resolution, and high sensitivity, Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS) technology combines the separation capabilities of chromatography and the qualitative functions of mass spectrometry are widely used in the component analysis of complex systems of traditional Chinese medicine. 2, 12, 13 It is especially suitable for the qualitative identification of complex natural plant systems and the discovery of new compounds lacking reference substances. 14 At present, research on CSF mainly concentrated on its pharmacological activity, 6, 7 and the components mostly focused on were essential oil, 6, 7 and coumarins 15, 16 such as 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, scopoletin, and bergapten, as well as flavonoids such as hesperidin, 17 however, few research systematically reported on the chemical components of CSF. In addition, CSF has a wide range of production areas, and different growth environment and geographical locations may result in intermingled quality and differences in compositions. For a better comprehensive comparison, an analysis of the compositions from different origins was provided as a reference for evaluating the quality of CSF.",

The TIC of extract samples and mixed reference standards is shown in Figure 1 . According to the peak time, standards, and relevant literature, 77 compounds were separated and identified within 40 min, and are shown in detail in Table 1 , including 18 coumarins, 24 flavonoids, seven organic acids, three limonoids, and 26 other compounds. Among them, 15 components were detected in the CSF for the first time: five flavonoids including eriocitrin, eriodictyol, astragalin, isotrifoliin, and glabrone; two coumarins including isopimpinellin and isofraxidin; one organic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid; and seven other compounds including oleamide, erucamide, stachydrine, coniferin, o-veratraldehyde, 6-hydroxyindole, and linderalactone.

In the positive mode, these kinds of compounds may Furanocoumarins can be divided into linear furanocoumarin and angular furanocoumarin. 21 Due to the construction features of furanocoumarins, it is easy for them to continuously lose CO (28 Da) and CO 2 (44 Da) groups, so the fragment ions of these kinds of compounds in the second MS were characterized by m/z 203 and m/z 158. 22 23 Furthermore, compound 51 exhibited a molecular ion at m/ z 217.0495 [M + H] + in the positive mode. The second order spectrum shows fragment ions at m/z 202.0261 and m/z 173.0598, which correspond to the loss of CH 3 and CO of the parent ion, respectively. Therefore, compound 51 was identified as bergapten 15 (the fragmentation pattern is shown in Figure 3f ).

Under the same collision energy, flavonoid glycosides easily lose their linked sugar molecules, afterward the RDA reaction occurs as well. 22, 26 Glycoside is composed of aglycone and sugar. Analogously, diosmin is composed of diosmetin, a rhamnose, and a glucose. S9 S10 S11 S12 S13 S14 S15 179.0341, 177.0545, 153.0181, 147 .0440, and 137.0599 were formed for the both compounds.

On the whole, the coumarins extracted from different origins of CSF were abundant. According to this study and combined with relevant literature, 15 the coumarins are the main chemical components of CSF, thus the coumarins were well preserved by means of using the extraction method in this work. The chemical component differences among CSF from different origins are shown in Table 2 . As for the flavonoids, other CSFs were more abundant than that of CSF-Guang. In addition, eriocitrin, eriodictyol, and glabrone were only detected in the Guangxi province, while none of the other origins were detected, which needs a further verification. Among them, eriocitrin and eriodictyol are common in citrus, while they have not been reported previously in the CSF. Overall, CSF produced in the Zhejiang province contained a richer variety of chemical components. More noticeably, according to previous studies, the research on the compositions of CSF mostly focused on its coumarins, whereas few reported on the polymethoxyflavonoids. 15 In this work, a total of seven polymethoxyflavonoids have been found, including nobliletin, tangeretin, 5-demethylnobiletin, etc., which have shown different pharmacological activities such as antitumor, antibacterial, antineuritis, antioxidant, cardiovascular protection, and antihyperlipidemic effects. 2, 10, 12, 22, 32 ",

In summary, this research provided an efficient and rapid method for qualitative analysis and quality control of chemical components in CSF. an online degasser, a quaternary pump, and a column temperature compartment, and it was combined with a Q Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) by means of an electrospray ionization interface. 4.3. Preparation of Samples and Standards. 4.3.1. Preparation of Samples. Approximately 0.5 g of 15 batches of CSF were, respectively, weighed, which were passed through the 40-mesh screen, added to 25 mL of methanol, and subjected to ultrasonic extraction (320 W, 40 kHz) for 30 min. Different batches of the CSF filtrate were, respectively, concentrated to 1 mL using a rotary evaporator and then transferred to an automatic injection bottle after passing through a 0.22 \u03bcm PTFE membrane for UPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS analysis. High-resolution MS source parameters include a 3.5 kV spray voltage, a 320\u00b0C capillary temperature, a 30 unit sheath gas, a 10 unit auxiliary gas, a 300\u00b0C auxiliary gas heater temperature, and a 5 unit sweep gas, and were used in positive ion mode.
