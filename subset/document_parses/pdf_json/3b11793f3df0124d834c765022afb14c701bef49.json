Outstanding questions regarding how significant the influence of the moon, clouds, and artificial lighting remain. To be able to make statements about these effects, measurements over a long period of time are necessary. Fraunhofer IOSB performs such measurements in the 380-780 nm photopic visual and 800-1700 nm shortwave infrared spectral range. As the latter is only marginally affected by artificial lighting, a comparison of the two bands deepens insight into the influence of artificial lighting. First analyses show that the moon is, as expected, the dominant light source in the night sky, especially during a full moon. Illuminance values up to 200 mlx and irradiance values up to 600 \u00b5W/m 2 were measured in the visible and infrared respectively. The influence of clouds is more complicated. The measured intensities depend, among other things, on cloud cover and cloud altitude. When the night sky is overcast, the measured intensities can drop as low as 0.5 mlx and 0.5 \u00b5W/m 2 , respectively. These small values were measured during rainfall. The influence of artificial illumination is difficult to estimate, as intensities in the shortwave infrared decrease with increasing cloud cover, but increase in the visual.",

A century ago, observatories were located near cities, but today they are found far away on remote mountains. The illumination of the growing cities has made it impossible to make astronomical observations there. Astronomers have been carrying out measurements for many years in order to find out how bright the night sky is 1-3 .",

An automated system simultaneously records illuminance in VIS, irradiance in SWIR, and cloud cover and environmental data each night from dawn to dusk. Breaks in the measurements occurred between mid-May and end of July, as the astronomical twilight lasted the entire night, and between the end of October 2019 until August 2020 due to technical problems and the SARS CoV 2 pandemic. Preliminary analysis of the data with respect to the influence of moonlight, clouds, and rain on night illumination will be presented in this paper.",

Figure 1 shows the large variability of night illumination as a function of the lunar altitude, measured with an illuminance (VIS) and an irradiance meter (SWIR). Details can be found in the \"Methods\" section. Figure 1a shows the measurements in the VIS when the moon was below the horizon. The scatter of the measured values here is never greater than about a factor of 13, regardless of the altitude of the moon under the horizon. Most of the measured illuminance values are in the range between about 0.3 mlx and 4 mlx. Thus, much of the scatter in Fig. 1b can be attributed to the changing lunar phase, which is not shown here. The remaining factor of 13 could be due to variable illumination of clouds by artificial lighting. Also, the variable irradiation by nightglow 22 as well as stars and planets will contribute as well.",

Above this, up to an altitude of about 11,000 m increasingly larger values are measured, but the smallest measured values remain almost on a plateau at about 1.5 mlx. The assumption for this behavior is that from a cloud altitude of about 500 m, more and more artificial lighting is reflected into the measuring range. The irradiation reaches its maximum at a cloud altitude of about 1000 m and then remains almost constant as the cloud altitude increases further. The reason for the lower illuminance values of less than 1.5 mlx for the data points at cloud altitudes of about 1000 m, 2200 m, and 7300 m is not known now. The data are from different measurement nights in April and May 2019 and October 2020. An assumption is that the glass dome protecting the detector was fogged with dew. The high values of relative humidity of 90% and more, which the weather station measured www.nature.com/scientificreports/ at the same time, agree with this. Another possibility is that wrong altitude values have been calculated by the Nubiscope at these times. But at the moment there is no concrete reason for this assumption. Graph b of Fig. 4 shows the measurements in the SWIR. With increasing altitude of the lowest clouds, there are also larger irradiance values. However, there are very low intensities at any altitude. There is no plateau as seen in the VIS. This would fit to the already expressed assumption that clouds can strongly shield the radiation of the nightglow. Also, it appears that artificial lighting does not have a large effect on the measurements in the SWIR.",

Many variables, some of them unknown in their magnitude, influence the night illumination. While the illumination by the moon, the stars and planets as well as the nightglow can be calculated or estimated, this is no longer possible for the contribution from artificial lighting. In addition, there is the influence of the earth's atmosphere in which the incident radiation is scattered and absorbed. Also, clouds can reduce as well as increase the night illumination 31, 32 . Apart from artificial lighting, the moon is the brightest light source in the VIS with illuminance values up to almost 200 mlx during full moon phase. If the moon is below the horizon, minimum values of just 0.5 mlx were measured. In the SWIR, the measured irradiance values range from about 0.5 to 600 \u00b5W/m 2 . Our measurements also show that the influence of moon light is much greater in the VIS than in the SWIR. This is also shown by spectra recorded by Vatsia 29 in the spectral range from 0.45 to 1.95 \u00b5m in clear nights at different lunar phases. The measured radiances between no moon and full moon differ in VIS by a factor of about 100. In the SWIR, on the other hand, the measured values differ by only about a factor of 2.",

In the SWIR, the irradiance does not fall below about 20 \u00b5W/m 2 . With increasing cloud cover in the VIS, a slight increase of the measured values can be observed, while the values in the SWIR decrease. Only at a cloud cover of more than 90%, the measured values decrease significantly, down to about 0.5 mlx in the VIS and to about 0.5 \u00b5W/m 2 in the SWIR. The illuminance values are approximately in agreement with the values found by Jechow et al. 31 during measurements in a rural area in Germany; over two nights only, one clear (1.10 mlx) and one overcast (0.68 mlx). Other measurements by the same author 33 , taken in Latvia, show values of only 0.22 mlx in overcast conditions, which is much less than our measurements. One reason for this could be the lower influence of artificial lighting on the measurements. However, the measurements by Jechow et al. 31 and those described in other publications can only be compared to a very limited extent with the measurements presented here, as measurement area, encountered weather conditions, and measurement equipment are different. Often a Sky Quality Meter or a DSLR camera is used. In contrast to the hemispherical coverage of the devices used in our measurements, the SQM is mostly used in the version with a lens (SQM-L). Then, according to the manufacturer, it has a field-of-view of only 20\u00b0 (FWHM), without lens 84\u00b0, and no cosine correction 34 . In addition, it has a different spectral response than the human eye adapted illuminance meter used here. During the measurements, the SQM was generally aligned to the zenith 32, 35, 36 . Also, the measurement quantities of the instruments (SQM: mag/arcsec 2 , illuminance meter: lux) cannot be easily converted for comparison in a common set of units, thus complicating the problem. In order to be able to compare measurement results from the SQM and the illuminance meter, joint measurements with both types of instruments are planned for the future. A DSLR camera with fisheye can do both-luminance and illuminance (scalar and horizontal) measurements simultaneously and the green channel is at least close to the photopic band (closer than the SQM band). However, this method is not yet used for long term studies.",

These factors exclude each other to some extent: no artificial lighting typically means remote areas that can be difficult to reach and have poor security. Additionally, financial limitations had to be considered and our search was limited to areas in Germany or central Europe. Various sites were assessed 44, 45 and none was ideal from an artificial stray light point of view. The final compromise was a proving ground near Storkow, Brandenburg, Germany (52\u00b011\u2032 N, 13\u00b056\u2032 E, altitude 49 m). The small town is about 8 km away. Although located about 50 km southeast of Berlin, this area is in one of the darkest German regions. The light pollution map 46, 47 gives the following values for the zenith sky brightness: Proving ground: 21.6 mag/arcsec 2 (0.247 mcd/m 2 ), Storkow: 21.02 mag/arcsec 2 (0.422 mcd/m 2 ), and Berlin (Brandenburger Tor): 18.10 mag/arcsec 2 (6.2 mcd/m 2 ). These good conditions are confirmed by test measurements conducted there 45 . Figure 6 shows sky images from the test measurements with different cloud coverage. Stray light, especially at the horizon, is apparent. The effect of the stray light cannot be removed from the measured data and must be considered when analysing the data.",
