However, L. japonicae flos is often confused or adulterated with Lonicerae flos (L. flos, Lonicera macrantha (D.Don) Spreng., Shanyinhua in Chinese). The anti-SARS-CoV2 activity and related differentiation method of L. japonicae flos and L. flos have not been documented. In this study, we established a chemical pattern recognition model for quality analysis of L. japonicae flos and L. flos based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and anti-SARS-CoV2 activity. Firstly, chemical data of 59 batches of L. japonicae flos and L. flos were obtained by UHPLC, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis was applied to extract the components that lead to classification. Next, anti-SARS-CoV2 activity was measured and bioactive components were acquired by spectrum-effect relationship analysis. Finally, characteristic components were explored by overlapping feature extracted components and bioactive components. Accordingly, eleven characteristic components were successfully selected, identified, quantified and could be recommended as quality control marker. In addition, chemical pattern recognition model based on these eleven components was established to effectively discriminate L. japonicae flos and L. flos. In sum, the demonstrated strategy",

As of November 5, 2021, there are more than 248 million confirmed cases and 5.02 million related deaths caused by COVID-19 (WHO, 2021) . Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties (Zhao et al., 2021) . Since the COVID-19 pandemic, China's treatment protocol using integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine played significant efficacies in alleviating symptoms and suppressing the rapid spread of COVID-19 in China (Ni et al., 2020) . Lonicerae japonicae flos (L. japonicae flos, Lonicera japonica Thunb.), a well-known heat-clearing and detoxifying botanical drug, is one of the most commonly prescribed botanical drugs in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 according to an extensive analysis of the frequency of traditional Chinese medicine used in China (Luo et al., 2020) . Clinical trials have confirmed that L. japonicae flos decoction efficiently inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) replication and accelerated the negative conversion of infected patients . Investigations have revealed that many Chinese medicinal prescriptions containing L. japonicae flos successfully relieved COVID-19 symptoms, improve the recovery of thoracic radiological abnormalities, and prevent fatal deterioration of the disease (Xiao et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021) .",

However, L. japonicae flos is often confused or adulterated with Lonicerae flos (L. flos, Lonicera macrantha (D.Don) Spreng., Shanyinhua in Chinese) for they are two closely related botanical species with similar morphological characteristics and had been officially listed as a single item in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Zhang et al., 2015) . Both of L. japonicae flos and L. flos possess heat-clearing and detoxifying efficacy , while pharmacological investigation has revealed that the antibacterial intensity of L. japonicae flos was obviously different from L. flos (Shi et al., 2016) . In addition, L. flos may have greater antioxidant activity than that of L. japonicae flos according to higher phenolic acids content in L. flos (Kong et al., 2017; Zuowei et al., 2019) . Phytochemistry studies indicated that phenolic acids, flavonoids, iridoids, and saponins are the predominant composition of L. japonicae flos and L. flos, but saponins contentes in L. japonicae flos are fewer than those in L. flos . On this account, L. flos is not allowed to prepare injections. Until now, there has been little work that completely investigated the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity and related chemical properties of L. japonicae flos and L. flos. Thus, for the sake of precise quality evaluation, the establishment of characterization methods for L. japonicae flos and L. flos according to their effectiveness is essential.",

Peaks 23, 7, and 24 all showed same [M\u2212H] \u2212 ions at m/z 353.0854 (C 16 H 18 O 9 ), and obvious fragment ions of quinic acids moiety and caffeic acid moiety at m/z 191.0551 and 179.0348, respectively. In addition, a dehydrated quinic acid moiety at m/z 173.0348, a dehydrated caffeic acid moiety at m/z 161.0246 and a decarboxylated caffeic acid moiety at m/z 135.0448 were also detected. Accordingly to the reported polarity, retention behavior of the isomers and further validated by reference standards, peaks 23, 7, and 24 were unambitiously identified as 3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid (chlorogenic acid), 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid (neochlorogenic acid) and 4-O-caffeoyl quinic acid (cryptochlorogenic acid) (Qi et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . Peaks 62, 58, and 60 yielded an identical [M\u2212H] \u2212 ion at m/z 515.1193 (C 25 H 24 O 12 ). As compared to peaks 23, 7, and 24, peaks 62, 58 and 60 had one more caffeoyl units. They are a group of dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers, shared similar fragments ions as peaks 62, 58, and 60, such as m/z 353. 0924, 191.0556, 179.0340 and 173.0464 . Moreover, by comparison of retention times, mass spectra with reference substances, peaks 62, 58, and 60 could be unambitiously assigned as 4,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid, 3,4-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid and 3,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid (Qi et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . Then peak four was tentatively characterized as secologaniside isomer (Qi et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . Peak 20 yielded [M\u2212H] \u2212 ion at m/z 373.1143 (C 16 H 22 O 10 ), and a series of product ions at m/z 167.0720 by successive losses of glucose and CO 2 , at m/z 149.0612 by subsequently dehydration from 167.0720, and at m/z 123.0451 by loss of CO from 149.0612. Then, it was characterized as swertiamarin accordingly to reference substance data (Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . Although, peak 28 and 32 both displayed parent ion at m/z 403.1232, their secondary fragment ions were totally different. The [M + HCOOH\u2212H] \u2212 ion at m/z 403.1232 and [M\u2212H] \u2212 ion at m/z 357.1199 was peak 28. Its' fragment ions at m/z 195.0591 and 125.0265 were produced by losses of glucose and RDA cleavages. As for peak 32, 403.1227 was the deprotonated ion, and fragment ions at m/z 223.0633, 165.0580 and 121.0318 were generated by successively losses of C 6 H 10 O 5 , COOCH 3 and CO 2 . And fragment ion at m/z 179.0601 was produced by loss of CO 2 from ion at m/z 223.0633. Further, combined with the data from reference substances, peak 28 and 32 were identified as sweroside and secoxyloganin, respectively (Qi et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . Peak 27 presented [M + HCOOH\u2212H] \u2212 ion at m/z 433.1353. Neutral loss of a glucose moiety produced the ion at m/z 225.0793. Ion at m/z 101.0265 was produced by RDA cleavages, accordingly, peak 27 was tentatively characterized as secologanin . ",

Combined with the rule that analytical standard is commercially available, 11 bioactive components (peak 23, 7, 24, 62, 60, 18, 58, 20, 28, 61, 32) were chosen to establish a quality evaluation model for Lonicera samples using PLS-DA. Training set samples from cultivated L. japonicae flos, wild L. japonicae flos and L. flos were successfully segregated ( Figure 5A ). Two principal components are obtained by fitting with contributions of 57.2 and 24.9%, respectively ( Figure 5A ). The established model had excellent goodness of fit (R 2 X 0.821, R 2 Y 0.770) and predictive ability (Q 2 0.736). Permutation tests results confirmed that the established model avoided an over-fitting problem for the values of substrate Q 2 intercept from R 2 intercept were lower than 0.3 ( Figures 5B-D) . Next, testing set samples were applied to validate the model. Validation results indicated 27 samples were correctly divided into their own categories with 100% accuracy, which proved the great performance of established model ( Figure 5E ; Table 2 ). In order to verify the predictive ability of PLS-DA model, prediction set samples were selected as investigation. As shown in Figure 5F ; Table 2 , three batches of samples were identified as cultivated cultivated L. japonicae flos and 1 batch of sample was classified as L. flos at the accuracy of 100%. With regards to model performance, the equal to 1.00 value of precision, sensitivity and specificity demonstrated the good capacity of the model to discriminate samples ( Table 2 ). In sum, these results showed that bioactive components based discriminatory strategy was reliable which could be used for quality evaluation as well as quality prediction of cultivated L. japonicae flos, wild L. japonicae flos and L. flos samples.

Considering that eleven characteristic components belong to caffeoylquinic acids (Peak 23, 7, 24, 62, 60, and 58) and iridoid glycosides (Peak 18, 22, 28, 61, and 32) , the detection wavelength was set at 327 and 240 nm, respectively ( Figure 6 ). The contents of eleven characteristic components in 59 batches of L. japonicae flos and L. flos samples were summarized in Table 3 . Chlorogenic acid was the predominant component in cultivated L. japonicae flos and L. flos samples with the content of 1.21% \u00b1 0.03 and 2.62% \u00b1 0.18, respectively ( Table 3 ). In wild L. japonicae flos samples, secoxyloganin had the highest rate of 2.45% \u00b1 0.43 ( Table 3 ). The contents of caffeoylquinic acids, including chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, 4,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid, 3,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid and 3,4-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid, in L. flos samples is about twice of which in L. japonicae flos samples (Table 3 ; Figures  7A-E,G) . While the contents of morroniside and sweroside in cultivated L. japonicae flos was significantly higher than that in wild L. japonicae flos and L. flos samples (Table 3 ; Figures 7F,I) . It is worth mentioning that the contents of morroniside and sweroside in the majority of L. flos samples are close to zero, and they can be recognized as quality marker for L. japonicae flos to distinguish cultivated L. japonicae flos from L. flos and wild L. japonicae flos samples. The content of swertiamarin in wild L. japonicae flos was slightly higher than the other two, but the content of secoxyloganin was significantly higher than cultivated L. japonicae flos and L. flos (Table 3; Figure 7K ). As for centauroside, although the average content in wild L. japonicae flos is the highest, it has not been detected in the majority of wild L. japonicae flos and L. flos samples ( Table 3 ; Figure 7J ).",

In the present study, the detoxifying efficacy of L. japonicae flos was demonstrated by anti-SARS-CoV2 M pro activity. SARS-CoV2 is the etiological agent responsible for the global COVID-19 outbreak (Zhu et al., 2020) . After SARS-CoV2 invades the cell, it will immediately utilize the substance in the cell to synthesize two polyproteins, and encode M pro . The M pro plays a pivotal role in the proteolytic process that releases the functional polypeptides of Spike, Membrane, Envelop, Nucleoprotein, replicase and polymerase from polyproteins (Boopathi et al., 2021; Mittal et al., 2021) . Accordingly, 2019-nCoV M pro is the critical protease for SARS-CoV2 replication. The anti-SARS-CoV2 activity could be revealed by inhibitory effect on M pro . The safety and efficacy of botanical drug are key components of their quality. Accordingly, the contents of components closely related to the safety and efficacy of medicines become the important basis for quality evaluation (Wu et al., 2018) . However, the relationship between efficacy and specific components in medicines remain to be systematically illustrated. In this study, we focused on the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of L. japonicae flos to explore its characteristic components which related to detoxifying efficacy and reflected the chemical basis of L. japonicae flos in whole. Eleven characteristic components were screened, including six caffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 4,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid, 3,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid and 3,4-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid) and five iridoid glycosides (morroniside, swertiamarin, sweroside, centauroside, secoxyloganin). From the perspective of correlation degree with efficacy, six caffeoylquinic acids may have more significant effect on inhibiting M pro activity compared to five iridoid glycosides. Interestingly, caffeoylquinic acid isomers could have better anti-SARS-CoV2 M pro activity than dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers for their higher correlation degree. These results are consistent with the in silico studies that chlorogenic acid showed the excellence scores and interactions inside the binding site of SARS-CoV2 M pro (El Gizawy et al., 2021) . 3,5-O-dicaffeoyl quinic acid was making superior affinity towards M pro as well, which is better than standard drug Remdesivir (Shah et al., 2021) . As for discrimination between L. japonicae flos and L. flos, the VIP values of five iridoid glycosides are relatively higher. Compared to L. flos, the contents of five iridoid glycosides are relatively higher in L. japonicae flos samples, which are in accordance with the published results (Chen et al., 2007) . Furthermore, it is reported that iridoid glycoside component could be used as a marker to distinguish L. japonicae flos and L. flos for the amount difference . However, more pharmacological data about iridoid glycosides are also needed for completely quality evaluation of L. japonicae flos.",

But little attention has been paid to the comparison of quality difference between wild and cultivated L. japonicae flos. Our results indicated that the contents of six caffeoylquinic acids in cultivated and wild L. japonicae flos are almost the same. While the contents of five iridoid glycosides various, which may account for that cultivated and wild L. japonicae flos clustered in two regions in chemical pattern recognition model (Figure 4) . However, there was no significant difference between their anti-SARS-CoV2 M pro activities. Therefore, growth mode had little effect on the quality of L. japonicae flos.",

We further screened eleven characteristic components which are closely related to anti-SARS-CoV2 activity and display critical role in classifying L. japonicae flos and L. flos. Based on the characteristic components, chemical pattern recognition model of classifying L. japonicae flos and L. flos was successfully established. The proposed strategy provided an efficient tool for quality analysis of traditional Chinese medicine.",
