It has revolutionized the rate at which information is shared and enhanced its reach. However, another side of the coin dictates an alarming story. These platforms have led to an increase in the creation and spread of fake news. The fake news has not only influenced people in the wrong direction but also claimed human lives. During these critical times of the Covid19 pandemic, it is easy to mislead people and make them believe in fatal information. Therefore it is important to curb fake news at source and prevent it from spreading to a larger audience. We look at automated techniques for fake news detection from a data mining perspective. We evaluate different supervised text classification algorithms on Contraint@AAAI 2021 Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset. The classification algorithms are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also evaluate the importance of unsupervised learning in the form of language model pre-training and distributed word representations using unlabelled covid tweets corpus. We report the best accuracy of 98.41% on the Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset.",

While manual detection [8, 1, 7] is the most reliable method it has limitations in terms of speed. It is difficult to manually verify the large volumes of content generated on the internet. Therefore automatic detection of fake news has gained importance. Machine learning algorithms have been employed to analyze the content on social media for its authenticity [27] . These algorithms mostly rely on the content of the news. The user characteristics, the social network of the user, and the polarity of their content are another set of important signals [31] . It is also common to analyze user behavior on social platforms and assign them a reliability score. The fake news peddlers might not exhibit normal sharing behavior and will also tend to share more extreme content. All these features taken together provide a more reliable estimate of authenticity.",

The dataset shared is created by collecting data from various social media sources such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. The fake news detection task is formulated as a text classification problem. We solely rely on the content of the news and ignore other important features like user characteristics, social circle, etc which might not always be available. We evaluate the recent advancements in deep learning based text classification algorithms for the task of fake news detection. The techniques include pre-trained models based on BERT and raw models based on CNN and LSTM. We also evaluate the effect of using monolingual corpus related to covid for language model pretraining and training word embeddings.

In addition to these details [9] have used other factors such as attached URLs, social media post propagation features, and content-based hybrid model for classifying news as fake or genuine. Another research [15] based on structural properties of the social network is used for defining a \"diffusion network\" which is the spread of a particular topic.

Each data sample is divided into a maximum of 40 sentences and each sentence consists of a maximum of 50 words. The word encoder is a bidirectional LSTM that works on word embeddings of individual sentences to produce hidden representation for each word. The word-level attention helps us to extract important words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence. These informative words which conceive the complete meaning of the sentence are aggregated to form sentence vectors. The sentence vectors are processed by another bidirectional LSTM referred to as sentence encoder. The sentence-level attention layer measures the importance of each sentence and sentences which provide the most significant information for classification are summarized to get a document vector that contains the gist of the entire data sample.",

The word embeddings generated from the first block are passed to the next block as input. The final encoder generates an embedding for each word in the text.

For example, \"don't means \"do not\" and \"it's\" stands for \"it is\". These shortened forms are expanded in this step. -Removal of Special Characters: Special characters are not readable because they are neither alphabets nor numbers. They include characters like \"*\", \"&\", \"$\", etc. -Noise Removal: Noisy text includes unnecessary new lines, white spaces, etc. Filtering of such text is done in this process. -Normalization: The entire text is converted into lowercase characters due to the case sensitive nature of NLP libraries. -Removal of stop-words: English language stop words include words like 'a', 'an', 'the', 'of', 'is', etc which commonly occur in sentences and usually add less value to the overall meaning of the sentence. To ensure less processing time it is better to remove these stop words and let the model focus on the words that convey the main focus of the sentence. -Stemming: This step reduces the word to its root word after removing the suffixes.
