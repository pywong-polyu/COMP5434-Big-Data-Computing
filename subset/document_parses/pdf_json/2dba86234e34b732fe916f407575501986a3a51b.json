TFBs constitute a core element of the cultural identity of a country, although some of them are losing their appeal. In this study, the authors explored the TFBs perceptions of inhabitants in nine countries to determine if their food identity is changing by analysing the TFBs most frequently mentioned by different age cohorts within a country. Six countries were found to have a distinctive core of TFBs shared across age cohorts (homogenous), whereas the remaining showed a heterogeneous pattern. Correspondence and cluster analyses usually grouped younger generations together implying higher similarities among these cohorts. Furthermore, the binary logistic regression analyses performed identified significant differences in the probability of mentioning a specific TFBs across age cohorts per country. Data collected show younger cohorts focusing on TFBs categorised as snacks and foods on-the-go, whereas older cohorts more often refer to time-consuming savoury preparations. The results suggest that lifestyles and current societal trends in food consumption, for example, convenience and healthiness, are impacting the food culture and identity of countries, and therefore play an important role in the variation of TFBs perception and consumption between age cohorts within countries. The results obtained in this study could not only be used by food policymakers and nutritionists to distinguish the current trends that are reshaping the food identity and eating behaviours of the population but also to improve or develop new dietary strategies by age cohorts in the countries studied.",

Two dimensions have been described to represent this relationship, namely from biological to cultural (nutrition to symbolic functions) and from individual to collective (phycological to collective functions) (1) . In this context, some foods may also provide symbolic functions in a culture, as is the case of traditional foods and beverages (TFBs). Thus, the spectrum of TFBs perceived as such and consumed by inhabitants define the food culture of a specific country. TFBs have been inherited through generations, making them the representative of the cuisine of the country, and therefore a faithful estimation of the eating habits followed by its inhabitants (2) . However, countries and their cuisines have changed over time influenced by several historical phenomena, as described below.",

Previous studies related to traditional foods developed a definition of traditional food products from the perspective of a consumer (11) , determined the motives for choosing and consuming TFBs in Europe (12) , unravelled the perceptions and preferences of consumers for specific TFBs (13) and studied the impact of innovations in TFBs (14, 15) . However, which food products are perceived as traditional by inhabitants of different countries and to what extent the age of a consumer exerts an effect on this perception was not investigated. Hence, here we aimed to determine if the food identity differs among age cohorts in different countries by studying the similarities and differences in the foods and beverages perceived as traditional between generations in nine countries (The Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, China, and Japan). In addition, we investigated the types of foods (dish, snack, or beverages) and the consumption moment (regular basis, special occasions/celebrations, and/or seasonally) to compare several aspects that may be influencing the perceptions of consumers from different cultural backgrounds and dietary habits.",

The countries were chosen based on two aspects, which are (i) their geographical distribution within a continent, to cover different countries within a region/continent; and (ii) the background of their food culture. The TFBs in a country have been influenced by several forces, e.g., colonisation, trade, and the rearrangements of nations being some of them (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Thereby, countries that were connected through colonisation were also selected. For instance, Brazil was included since it has a different background than the other countries of that region due to the African and Japanese immigrants (16, 17) . Indonesia was colonised by The Netherlands; therefore, some level of overlap in the foods and beverages mentioned was expected (18) . Adult inhabitants (\u226518 years of age) who were born and raised in each country were part of this research to ensure they were highly familiar with their traditional cuisine.",

Therefore, staff members, PhD candidates, MSc, and BSc students were kindly asked to take a pilot survey as if they were in their country of origin to test the survey and if the constructs were well formulated. At the end of the survey, a special box was left open for them to provide comments and suggestions, and also barriers that they may have encountered. After the first pilot, the questions were adjusted, when necessary, and another pilot was carried out to crosscheck the constructs and final details, such as ease of answering the survey when using different devices (laptop or mobile) and length of the survey. Regarding the languages, the questionnaire was developed in English and translated into the mother tongues by two natives. If differences were found, which rarely happened, a third person was asked to back-translate the sentences that were different in order to keep the one that was in line with the English version.",

Afterwards, the foods and beverages were classified into categories when respondents mentioned varieties of a product. The TFBs mentioned by at least 13-20% of respondents in each country, from the largest cities and other cities, were further analysed. To determine the threshold, we focused on the representativity of the diversity of TFBs at a national level by considering the answers given by respondents from the largest cities and other cities of each country. Two to three natives from each country were asked to act as experts with the aim of crosschecking whether the TFBs selected at different proportions (50-20%) were representative of the cuisine of the country, that is, that they could be classified as TFBs based on the definition used in this study and if they were available nationwide. In most of the countries, a threshold of 20% captured what the study aimed for. However, in China and Indonesia, this threshold was capturing fewer TFBs (five approximately). Since these countries are either large or spread into several islands, which implies a larger variation, we decided to extend the list of TFBs to a minimum of 10 to be able to look for similarities and differences in the perceptions of the four age cohorts. Hence, in China and Indonesia, a threshold of 13% was used to select the TFBs to be further analysed.",

However large countries with strong regional cuisines-such as Mexico and China-were classified as having a heterogeneous food identity. Hereof, throughout the years, countries have been impacted by different phenomena that have altered their food habits (26) . This alteration varies depending on their exposure to other cultures and their diets (27, 28) , but also based on its size, administrative divisions, and interconnectivity, which could explain the heterogeneity obtained in these two countries. Interestingly, The Netherlands also followed a similar pattern, which could be related to its high globalisation and immigration levels (29, 30) . ",

            "text": "During lifespan, we are exposed to several TFBs, which set the learned preferences of the consumers in terms of ingredients, textures, flavour profiles, cooking skills, among others (31) . Nonetheless, these preferences are believed to change in function of age of the consumer, his/her lifestyles, country, and current societal trends, which may explain why our results showed differences in the perceptions of TFBs between generations. Overall, youngest age cohorts (C1-C2) shared similar perceptions regarding the foods and beverages considered as traditional whereas older age cohorts (C3-C4) were usually dissimilar. Differences were also spotted between the types of TFBs since convenience foods that are usually consumed as snacks on-the-go were most probably mentioned by the youngest age cohorts. On the contrary, older age cohorts were more inclined towards time-consuming preparations or specific TFBs. In this respect, previous studies have obtained similar results when attempting to unravel the key predictors driving convenience in food consumption (32) and the consumer segments that are more inclined towards convenience food products (33) . The former identified age (young participants), naturalness, and nutrition knowledge as the main drivers among different types of processed foods, and low cooking skills were linked to the consumption of moderately to highly processed foods. The latter research reported that consumers seeking convenience and those with fewer cooking skills were prone to purchase convenience foods. Our results suggest that the convenience trend is also impacting the habits of young generations when consuming TFBs.",

Another interesting case is \"a\u00e7a\u00ed\" in Brazil, which nowadays is highly consumed as \"a\u00e7a\u00ed na tigela\" (bowl with a\u00e7a\u00ed paste topped with fruit slices), which was spread in the market, both nationally and internationally, in recent years following the healthy trend because of its high antioxidant capacity and anthocyanin content (35, 36) . Similarly, \"bitterballen\" a crunchy deep-fried ball filled with meat ragout was most frequently mentioned by younger age cohorts, while \"kroket\"-a roll with the same ingredients and taste as \"bitterballen, \" but with a different consumption moment-was mostly mentioned by C3. These results suggest that new societal trends may have an impact on the food identity of countries lead by younger generations.",

Regarding the type of TFBs and its consumption moment, our results showed that overall the TFBs most frequently mentioned were savoury dishes consumed on a regular basis during breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. These outcomes reflect the importance of consuming TFBs in the main meals throughout the day in most countries. However, a different pattern was identified in Brazil, The Netherlands, and Indonesia, where snacks lead the list. This finding might suggest that snack-eating habits are rooted in the traditional cuisine in a country-dependent manner. Interestingly, Chilean respondents stated a large seasonal consumption (35%) of TFBs, which may be linked to the seasonal produce and low off-season imports of fresh commodities (40) .",

The knowledge gathered in this study identified some common patterns occurring in different countries worldwide.

This variation is less in countries with a homogeneous food identity. Current societal trends in food consumption, for example, convenience and healthiness, are impacting the food culture and identity of countries, and societal trends are expected to play an important role in the further diversification of the TFBs perceived and consumed.",

In addition, the convenience sampling method using social media led to an underrepresentation of the older age cohorts in many countries, which eliminates the possibility to meaningfully weigh data to adjust for the disproportional representation of the number of people within each age cohort. In sum, our exploratory analyses discovered differences between the younger and older age cohorts at a qualitative level, but we have insufficient means to determine the prevalence of food perceptions of the consumer.
