            "text": "Mosquito surveillance is a crucial process for understanding the population dynamics of mosquitoes, as well as implementing interventional programs for controlling and preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Environmental surveillance agents who performing routine entomological surveys at properties in areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic play a critical role in vector surveillance by searching and destroying mosquito hotspots as well as collate information on locations with increased infestation. Currently, the process of recording information on paper-based forms is time-consuming and painstaking due to manual effort. The introduction of mobile surveillance applications will therefore improve the process of data collection, timely reporting, and field worker performance. Digital-based surveillance is critical in reporting real-time data; indeed, the real-time capture of data with phones could be used for predictive analytical models to predict mosquito population dynamics, enabling early warning detection of hotspots and thus alerting fieldworker agents into immediate action. This paper describes the development of a cross-platform digital system for improving mosquito surveillance in Brazil. It comprises of two components: a dashboard for managers and a mobile application for health agents. The former enables managers to assign properties to health workers who then survey them for mosquitoes and to monitor the progress of inspection visits in real-time. The latter, which is primarily designed as a data collection tool, enables the environmental surveillance agents to act on their assigned tasks of recording the details of the properties at inspections by filling out digital forms built into the mobile application, as well as details relating to mosquito infestation. The system presented in this paper was co-developed with significant input with environmental agents in two Brazilian cities where it is currently being piloted.",

            "text": "Mosquito-borne diseases place a huge public health burden on the inhabitants of tropical regions. In Brazil, diseases such as zika, dengue, and chikungunya are arboviruses transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquito which are endemic in Latin America. Other vectors like the Culex transmit diseases such as West Nile fever and Japanese encephalitis (1, 2) . Mosquito-control surveillance is an essential component of the health interventions initiated by the public health authority to control and prevent the spread of diseases. Environmental surveillance agents play an indispensable role in controlling mosquitoes by identifying and treating infected dwellings. They do this by scheduling routine household visits to make sure homes and backyards have no mosquito hotspots. During the visits, the workers record the data on paper forms designed by the local community (3) . Despite the success of the agents in mosquito-control surveillance, the traditional paper-based system and the process of transcribing the data onto a computer system is a time-consuming and errorprone undertaking, which potentially yields low-quality data and causes delays in the analysis. Using mobile technology is therefore considered an effective way to support health agents in collecting and reporting data in real time (4) .",

            "text": "There is increasing interest in the use of mobile applications for capturing and transferring data in the field of public health research, including research into mosquito-borne diseases, where mobile applications have been adopted for disease surveillance or vector surveillance (5) . The applications vary with respect to their primary functionality and features, and include text-messaging outbreak alert apps (6) , data collection apps (7, 8) , and vector surveillance apps (5) . Most of the data collection applications were developed for public use for the recording of symptoms (4) . A small number have been developed for vector surveillance. For example, VectorPoint (9) is a mobile surveillance application for the vector that causes Chagas disease in Arequipa, Per\u00fa. The application provides a risk map based on data collected during fieldwork. To the best of our knowledge, there are two existing vector surveillance mobile applications dedicated to mosquito surveillance: Chaak (10) captures data related to the immature stages of dengue virus mosquito vectors in M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9xico; VazaDengue (11) integrates social media with citizen science to guide surveillance agents in controlling mosquitoes. Chaak, a cellphone-based system, is comparable to the system we propose here. Chaak provides two main components: a platform that enables managers to coordinate and manage health workers, and a mobile application to enable health workers to collect field data on the presence or absence of mosquitoes (10) . One limitation of the Chaak system is that new property addresses can only be recorded by managers; health agents are unable to change property details or add extra information. The system also suffers from incompatibility with various mobile operating systems and is unsuitable for large-scale implementation.",

The current process at these institutions involves managers assigning surveillance visit tasks for specific geo-entities (areas and neighborhoods) to the agents, who visit the premises and record data regarding mosquitoes on paperbased forms. The agents go from house to house checking for mosquito breeding habitats in containers holding stagnant water, inside, and around residential premises. Such sites are environmental risk factors for indoor and outdoor mosquito infestation. The agents count the containers holding immature insects and collect information regarding larvae and pupae. This data is then copied onto a computer-based system. The process of transcribing the data is time consuming and prone to errors, resulting in a reduction in accuracy and an increase in vector control response time, and only enabling such information to be analyzed at coarser ecological units as demonstrated in previous research that have used such data (12, 13) .",

They therefore represent a promising tool in the fight against mosquito-borne diseases. To assist in this fight, and based on guidelines provided by the local communities in Recife and Campina Grande, we developed a cloud-based system (the MEWAR IT system) which improves the surveillance of the mosquito by providing timely and geolocated reports regarding the presence and absence of mosquito (eggs or larva) in properties without colleting any climate data or epidemiological data (individual health information). The name of the research project is called \"Mosquito Population Modelling for Early Warning & Public Health Response, \" which is abbreviated as MEWAR.

MEWAR system is considered unique compared to other existing mosquito surveillance systems. It does not depend on social science (citizen science) or social network (i.e., social media such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.) to collect vector-related data (11) . It also provides agents with more flexibility in terms of decisionmaking on the ground, which is crucial for keeping agents engaged with the app. For example, it is not specifying properties to be inspected (10) . Rather, it specifies a neighborhood and number of properties for each inspection task; it is not dedicating a path to follow while inspecting properties, which usually other vector surveillance systems do by generating specific routes based on infestation risk or modeling (9) . The system also gives control to the agents to add new addresses if not exist rather than limiting this to managers only (10) . At the same time, it does not restrict the format of the addresses. Finally, the technical infrastructure and the support of multiple platforms allow large-scale implementation of the MEWAR, as well as make the system adaptable to other different scenarios and settings. This paper presents the process of designing, building, and developing the MEWAR system and the architecture of the proposed mosquito surveillance system that supports environmental surveillance agents in their routine inspection visits in the two Brazilian cities of Recife and Campina Grande.",

Most importantly, the development has involved a close collaboration and the co-authoring with Brazilian health agents from the environmental surveillance agencies in Recife (ASACEs) and Campina Grande (ASAs). Academics from UFPE and UFCG served as a bridge between the development team in UCL and the environmental surveillance agencies in the two cities. The health agents provided the development team with invaluable information and shared insights into the processes involved in their data collection and fieldwork. Figures 1, 2 show the location of Recife (State of Pernambuco), and Campina Grande (State of Para\u00edba), the two cities in which this study is conducted. The two cities are representative of the mosquito surveillance methods used across all Brazilian cities as defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Recife city is located along the coasts (8 \u2022 03 \u2032 S34 \u2022 52 \u2032 W), with 1,661,017 inhabitants and 218 km 2 area, making it one of Brazil's highest population density cities (14) . The second site study is Campina Grande (7 \u2022 13 \u2032 14.92 \u2032\u2032 S, 35 \u2022 55 \u2032 1.32 \u2032\u2032 W) which is also located in Northeast Brazil. It is considered the industrial center of Northeast Brazil and the main technology center in South America. The estimated population in 2021 is 413,830, making it the second-most populous city of Para\u00edba (15) . Since 1995, the state of Pernambuco has been endemic for mosquito-borne disease (dengue virus). In 2015, other mosquito-borne diseases (Zika and Chikungunya viruses) were introduced as well in Pernambuco, which in turn yields, circulate these mosquito-borne diseases within a geographic region (i.e., Northeast Brazil). The co-circulating of these viruses poses a significant challenge to health authorities (16) . Climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall level, etc.,) in Northeast Brazil, including, Recife and Campina Grande, are ideal for mosquito living, making them suitable for mosquitoes abundance, thus, optimal sites for our study objective [i.e., mosquito surveillance; (14, 15, 17) ].",

One suggestion for the mobile app was to have a separate page to view the submitted visits forms (i.e., historical records) by filtering search data according to the name of the area visited, the name of the block, and the date. Other popular suggestions were to add extra fields to some of the pages on the form and to make some fields optional, both of which would provide more flexibility. The design of the mobile application home page was also discussed, and it was agreed that essential components would include a user bio-card and a list of assigned tasks provided by the manager.

            "text": "The manager dashboard allows environmental managers to coordinate the routine surveillance visits performed by health agents and to monitor their progress in real time. The dashboard is adaptable to different locations (states, cities) and languages (English, Portuguese). The manager dashboard assigns unique configurations based on their user profile-the user's registered city-in order to adjust and customize the list of areas, neighborhoods, and health agents. Each manager only has access to information relevant to their city and to local agents. Agents are registered to a specific manager and designated to a specific area. Managers create their team by adding agents who work under their supervision. This minimizes the list of agents and accelerates the process of managing and monitoring each agent. Figure 5 shows the manager dashboard home page where the key functionalities (delete, edit, set to complete) and information (list of agents and assigned tasks) are displayed. The domainspecific functionalities that managers have access to are: (1) adding agents to their team; (2) allocating agents to a specific geographical area; (3) creating visit tasks for a specific number of properties in a neighborhood for each agent to be completed within specific time (which precise properties are visited is not dictated by the manager); (4) editing or removing existing tasks (if a task is removed, any form that has been submitted as part of this task will not be deleted); (5) monitoring the progress of the work using the progress bar (which shows the number of forms submitted relative to the total assigned); (6) approving the completion of the assigned tasks; (7) defining new geographical areas and associated neighborhoods. The manager dashboard contains all the information required to assign an inspection visit task, such as geographical data (areas name, neighborhood ID) and a list of all registered agents. Moreover, the dashboard provides real-time progress reports by showing the number of completed visit forms for each assigned task. Hence, it assists the managers in monitoring the progress and assessing the situation on the field in real-time and rapidly making any required decisions (i.e., allocating or reallocating agents for blocks with slower progress and so on). The overarching goal of manager dashboard is to integrate both mosquito surveillance and risk modeling data to understand and predict the areas at high risk of mosquito infestation. Thus, the collected data (through the app) and predictive models will in the long run be able to inform policymakers how to improve surveillance and operations in the field, have evidence for staffing the environmental agencies with agents, and also evidence for investing in better water sanitation in areas where mosquito infestations seem to be a major issue.",

The tasks are defined by area name, neighborhood, the number of properties that need to be inspected, and the cycle, which represents the months of the year during which the task is to be carried out (for example, January and February are Cycle 1) (Figure 6) . The agent then selects a specific task and starts filling out the surveillance forms.

Pre-defined dropdown menus and radio buttons are integrated wherever possible instead of free text. All fields have a validator to help and guide the user if they make an error (such as inputting text when the expected value is a number). All mandatory fields are marked.

The server responds to Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) requests and processes the received data and user authentications. The Node.js with an ExpressJS framework has been used as a server for our system to define the Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints for communication with the database. The advantage of Node.js over other options is the support of asynchronous call-backs, which in turn enhance the response times and smooth the user experience (21) . The server is hosted on Heroku with a cloud-based NoSQL unstructured database for data storage. The selection of a database system is crucial to any data-driven software solution. Because the surveillance system and paper forms used in Brazil can differ slightly from city to city and across time, it was reasonable to choose the NoSQL unstructured database (e.g., MongoDB) to avoid restrictions on any future changes to the database models (22). In other words, a structured database would not in practice provide greater flexibility and would enforce the data type in the models (23) . It should be noted that the current MEWAR surveillance system service is dedicated only to Recife and Campina Grande surveillance agencies, and data is collected for research purposes only. However, the system is envisioned to support the system's adoption by the two cities for their daily surveillance, scale up to other cities and states, and make it interoperable with state environmental agencies' servers, which require manual report data entries (24) .",

The proliferation of mobile devices makes their use as surveillance tool much easier, however, the network and internet access remain an obstacle indeed, especially in low-income countries (developing countries). Therefore, one way to mitigate this issue is the integration of some caching functionality into the mobile application, which will enable it to operate in areas where there is no internet connection. The caching functionality will allow the mobile application to work in offline mode or when the connection is lost during the process of filling out the forms. Finally, the overarching objective of developing this system is to combine the dataset collected by the mobile application with climate data and larval index data to develop predictive models which can be calibrated to predict the areas most vulnerable to mosquito infestation. The results could be integrated into the manager dashboard as risk map for policymaking, which will result in better decision making regarding the priority of in-field surveillance.",

            "text": "Mobile technology has enabled the development of significant intervention tools that can enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control campaigns performed by environmental surveillance agencies by switching from the traditional paper-based system to digital forms. Here, we have described the process of designing, developing, and implementing a mosquito surveillance system (MEWAR). The proposed system has the potential to strengthen the entomological surveillance of the mosquito, which is responsible for transmitting several deadly arboviruses in Brazil. The system provides several critical functions that allow workflows to be tracked through a manager platform and provide real-time geolocated reports using a mobile application. Moreover, such a system can be a useful tool for integrating and calibrating models into mosquito surveillance at a fine scale. The proposed system has been developed by following appropriate software design and development practices to improve the quality of the system and reduce maintenance issues. Although the system was designed for environmental surveillance agents in Brazil and is based on that local setting, it could be scaled up to any country, and the knowledge acquired from the developmental process could be transferable to other intervention tools. The system could also be integrated into existing government public health programs that use digital interventions.",
