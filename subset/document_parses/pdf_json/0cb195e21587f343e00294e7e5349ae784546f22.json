Data informing whether immune-mediated medications lead to more severe infection are sparse. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether outpatient immunosuppressive therapies that treat autoimmune inflammatory disease or prevent solid organ transplant rejection are associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a positive PCR nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 from February 25 to September 9, 2020, cared for within a large integrated health care organization MAIN MEASURES: Exposure was defined as an outpatient fill of prednisone, immunomodulator, small-molecule, or biologic therapy in the 105 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The main outcome was either hospitalization, ICU admission, or death within 45 days after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, and autoimmune disease. KEY RESULTS: A total of 39,686 adults had a positive PCR test. In the primary analysis, prior prednisone use was associated with severe illness after diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.60); however, immunomodulator (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.57-1.34) and biologic/small-molecule therapy (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.79-2.00) were not. Secondary analyses showed variable risk among therapies: Janus-kinase inhibitors had an increased odds of severe illness (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.16-9.67), thiopurines/conventionaldisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs had a reduced odds (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.88), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were not associated (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.18-1.08). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Outpatient use of prednisone is associated with severe illness after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Immunomodulator and biologic/ small-molecule therapy were not associated, but different risk subgroups were identified. Our findings can inform risk-benefit discussions in the clinic and risk-based recommendations for patients on these therapies.",

            "text": "An estimated 10 million people in the USA have an altered immune system, a potential risk factor for severe and fatal infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 Patients on immune-modifying therapies such as prednisone, immunomodulators, biologics, and targeted small-molecule therapy are concerned that these medications may unacceptably impair the immune system and allow SARS-CoV-2 to spread unchecked in the body. [2] [3] [4] Despite these concerns, it is unclear whether these immunemodifying therapies, used to treat conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus as well as prevent rejection from solid organ transplantation, in fact worsen the severity of SARS-CoV-2 if infection occurs. 5 Prior studies have studied highly selected populations from single-specialty international registries or from referral centers, raising questions of generalizability as well as complete capture of key medication exposure, confounders, and outcomes. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] To address this gap, we assessed the relationship between use of prednisone, immunomodulators, biologics, and targeted smallmolecule therapy prior to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, all within a single integrated regional health care system in Northern California. We also explored the association between COVID-19 outcomes and acute (< 7 days) vs chronic prednisone use, monotherapy vs combination therapy, specific medication subgroups (anti-TNF, thiopurine/DMARDS, JAK inhibitors), as well as underlying immune-mediated disease.",

For age, we selected the group aged 30-49 years as the reference group because it had the largest number of patients. BMI was categorized as underweight (< 18.5 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ), and obese (\u2265 30.0 kg/m 2 ). 29 Specific comorbidities (cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension), as well as the Charlson comorbidity index, were assessed using a 1-year lookback period from date of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

The present study builds on the emerging but limited data on this topic derived primarily from international registries, referral center studies, and administrative claims data. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] We found outpatient use of prednisone was associated individually and in aggregate with hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, indicating a strong effect across the spectrum of severity. In contrast, immunomodulator and biologic/small-molecule therapy were not associated. The association between steroid use prior to the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization, ICU admission, and death observed in our study is similar to what has been observed in single-specialty rheumatology, IBD, and psoriasis studies. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 12, 15 This finding is also consistent with the known effects of steroids, which worsen viremia, prolong the viral shedding time, and increase the severity of infection by diminishing the immune system's antiviral defenses. 30 While we were unable to provide a more granular dosedependent exposure with outcomes, the consistency in results for prednisone (except for death), when use was assessed as \u2265 7 days and outcomes were restricted to 21 days, supports a biologic association between chronic outpatient prednisone and worse outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, although residual confounding cannot be completely excluded. In contrast, immunomodulators and biologic/smallmolecule therapies prior to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were not associated with severe illness in the primary analysis, consistent with results from other retrospective studies. [6] [7] [8] 10, 16, 18 These therapies can also affect the immune system, and thus, the contrast with prednisone is notable. The difference in point estimates for these therapies when used as monotherapy compared to combination therapy supports current recommendations that chronic use of immunomodulator, biologic, and small-molecule therapy does not appear to meaningfully increase the risk of severe outcomes after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Our results are consistent with recommendations that patients should not change or discontinue therapy for fear of worse outcomes. [31] [32] [33] Of course, appropriate measures should be taken to avoid infection and mitigate severe infection.",

A registry study reported similar findings for mycophenolate mofetil (OR 7.67; 95% CI 1.73-28.04) as well as B cell-depleting rituximab (OR 4.34; 95% CI 1.77-10.63), 9 which are used in autoimmune disease but also transplant and cancer, respectively. Data for other therapies were not reported. 9 The reasons for this observation may be several, including more profound immunosuppression compared to other therapies, indication bias, or unmeasured confounders, such as frailty in patients on these therapies. 34 It is notable our retrospective study showed outpatient exposure to prednisone and JAK inhibitors prior to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis had an increased odds of severe SARS-COV-2 outcomes whereas randomized trials of intravenous corticosteroids or tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor) used in hospitalized patients already infected with SARS-CoV-2 and requiring respiratory support reduced mortality 35, 36 (presumably from mitigating the cytokine storm). 37 A trend toward increased risk of severe COVID-19 with JAK-inhibitor therapy prior to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis has been observed in a retrospective French registry and a New York referral center study, but not on univariate analysis in an IBD registry study. 9, 10, 14 All three studies reported low patient numbers and concerns for confounding. Thus, while it may be that the aggravating, beneficial, or neutral effect of outpatient immunosuppressive therapy on COVID-19 outcomes may depend on timing and the balance of antiviral containment and anti-inflammatory response, 9, 30 this hypothesis should be considered speculative in the absence of more definitive data.",

[24] [25] [26] [27] 38 It also provided novel data in that most immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in our study did not increase the odds for ICU admission or mortality, after adjusting for immunosuppressive medication type, specific comorbidities, and demographic risk factors. We found organ transplantation increased the odds of hospitalization and asthma had a borderline association, whereas psoriasis increased the odds of ICU admission, the latter perhaps due to its strong association with significant comorbid conditions. 39 There are several study limitations. We grouped therapies into clinically meaningfully and commonly used categories, but acknowledge that these treatments have different mechanisms of action, different effects on the immune system, and potentially different effects on outcomes depending on when used in the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 40 Ongoing studies are necessary to accrue sufficient data to provide risk estimates for individual therapies. It is also possible that outcomes occurring outside of the health setting and not captured in membership files may have been missed, although this is uncommon. Finally, disease severity is not well captured in administrative data. While prednisone could be a marker of more severe immune-mediated disease or other condition requiring hospitalization within 45 days, we feel it should not be associated with short-term ICU admission and death if a confounder, particularly after adjustment for age, disease, and comorbidity. Thus, while we propose a true biologic association between prednisone and SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to the observed outcomes, residual confounding cannot be excluded completely.",

This increased the generalizability of the findings as well as permitted overcoming potential issues with prior studies, including small sample size, limited inclusion of key variables for multivariable analysis, convenience sampling of physician-reported cases, and finally pooling of data from many different countries, each with their own health system, practices, and resources.",

[2] [3] [4] [31] [32] [33] For those therapies where we showed an increased odds, providers can discuss with patients the limitations of the current data and review evolving medical society recommendations regarding medication management, [31] [32] [33] as well as reinforce strategies to mitigate risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which currently involves vaccination, particularly in vulnerable groups.
