However, little is known around the most relevant factors to symptom change; whether certain emotion regulation and coping strategies are linked to better outcomes; and how people with EDs are adjusting to psychological interventions moving online. Method: In a mixed-method design, we collected qualitative and quantitative data from 207 (76 males) selfselected UK residents with self-reported ED, who described and ranked impacts of the pandemic on their symptoms. Regression analysis examined whether emotion regulation strategies were associated with self-reported symptom change, ED symptomatology, and negative emotional states. Thematic analysis explored participants' experiences of the pandemic, particularly factors affecting their ED, coping strategies used, and experiences of psychological intervention.",

Emotion regulation, such as having fewer strategies, poorer emotional clarity, and non-acceptance of emotions, explained nearly half of the variance in emotional distress during the pandemic. Qualitative findings indicated that difficult emotions (such as fear and uncertainty), changes to routine, and unhelpful social messages were triggering for participants during the pandemic. While some participants described employing positive coping strategies (such as limiting social media exposure), many reported using ED behaviours (among other maladaptive strategies, like alcohol use) to cope with the pandemic. Finally, loss of treatment support, feeling underserving of support and experiencing a 'detached connection' online were further exacerbating factors for these participants.",

Aiming to inform future treatment and support, the present study examined which aspects of the pandemic have been especially difficult for people with EDs, and whether certain coping strategies and ways of dealing with emotions have been associated with better wellbeing. We also explored experiences of the move to online psychological treatment. Of 207 participants surveyed online, 83.1% reported that their ED symptoms had worsened, most notably due to difficulties managing emotions like anxiety around the unknown situation, changes in routine and in physical activity. Poorer mental health was associated with having fewer emotion regulation strategies, poorer emotional clarity, and nonacceptance of emotions. Participants outlined some helpful coping strategies during this time (such as limiting social media use) as well as some more detrimental strategies (such as increased ED behaviours and alcohol use). Finally, while some aspects were found to be beneficial, our participants reported a loss of support, feeling underserving of help, and a detached connection with their therapist as barriers to a successful online treatment. Our paper discusses the clinical implications of these findings.",

Many governments imposed lock-down and social distancing measures, such as those that started on 23rd March 2020 in the UK. While pandemics and periods of mass quarantine are historically linked with psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity [1] [2] [3] , their impact is disproportionately felt by people living with pre-existent mental illnesses [4, 5] . Psychological services have valiantly rallied to mobilise online delivery of services [6] , but the efficacy of such services and their reception with patients is thus far unknown.",

            "text": "One group of individuals of particular concern are those with eating disorders (EDs), long recognised as among the deadliest psychiatric illnesses [7, 8] . Recent efforts to examine the effects of the pandemic on people with eating disorders suggest a marked worsening in symptoms, most notably in restricting, binge eating, purging and pathological exercising [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Qualitative exploration of these experiences revealed that individuals with eating disorders attribute the exacerbation of their symptoms to disruption across many spheres of their lives, alongside reduced access to healthcare services [11, 14] . Changes in living situations, for instance, have meant that some people have had to move back in with their parents, which for some may mean more support towards their eating disorder, but for others more anxieties around feeling trapped, watched, or over having less influence over meal choices [11, 14] . Relatedly, being housebound during lockdown has affected access to social support networks, with individuals unable to see friends for support, and incurred changes to exercise routines, with some individuals distressed by the loss of access to gyms and others feeling compelled to exercise more due to the constant availability of online exercise classes and social pressures around it [11, 14] . Participants in these studies also highlighted social pressure in the form of triggering messages on social media, having increased their media consumption. Indeed, people during the lockdown have spent more time engaging with media online and on television [15] , and others have raised concerns that greater exposure to home cooking or exercise classes may have negatively impacted individuals with EDs [16] . Finally, the lockdown has resulted in changes in food buying and eating behaviours, with participants reporting food stockpiling and resultant binge eating episodes; justifying food restriction with the reality of food insecurity [17] ; or being unable to access 'safe' foods. These studies [11, 14] validated many of the concerns raised by clinical researchers [18] , who also note the likelihood that the increased anxiety of this period may move individuals from a prodromal to full disease state.",

            "text": "The fact that this is occurring during a time of indefinite disruption to services is deeply worrying. These illnesses frequently run a protracted course [19, 20] , with some evidence that this chronicity is underpinned by progressive neurobiological changes which incur treatmentresistance and impede full recovery [21] . It is paramount that changes in symptomatology are mapped and understood in order to inform emerging online paradigms and support individuals in their recovery efforts. In light of this, a valuable area of focus may be emotion regulation and coping strategies. Emotions are known to play a role in the pathology of EDs [22] [23] [24] , and in this context, it is highly relevant that the pandemic has fuelled additional feelings of depression, anxiety, uncertainty and psychological distress [5, 25] . For example, many people have lost jobs or are facing unemployment, thus raising fears around an uncertain future; others may be experiencing the heightened stress and guilt associated with balancing work and childcare. Many are highly anxious about their physical health and that of their loved ones. One study conducted early in the pandemic (April-May) with a large population of people with EDs found that over 60% of participants were experiencing comorbid generalised anxiety disorder, with participants reporting substantial increase in anxiety, attributed specifically to Covid-19, since the end of 2019 [11] . Other studies reported heightened feelings of sadness, anhedonia, apathy and worthlessness [12, 13] . Identifying and regulating emotions is a known difficulty for people with EDs [23, 26] , which means they may be especially poorly equipped to cope with these added difficulties. Indeed, within the same samples, substance abuse, selfinjury and suicidal feelings were reported by some participants [11] [12] [13] . Some theorists suggest that eating disordered behaviours arise due to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies [23, 26] , and the pandemic both increases the likelihood that these maladaptive regulation strategies will be deployed whilst simultaneously barring access to strategies which might have previously helped [18] . As such, the question arises as to which emotion regulation strategies have been used during the pandemic and whether some are associated with less exacerbation of ED behaviours. While studies have suggested that reappraisal and acceptance may be useful strategies during the pandemic [25, 27] , as of yet no research has explored the relationships between emotion regulation strategies and psychological wellbeing in people living with an ED during the pandemic. It may however be the case that these emotion regulation strategies explain some of the variance in the impact of the pandemic on individuals with an ED [9, 10, 14] , in which case identifying the coping strategies used by people with EDs during the pandemic and which are linked with better outcomes could help develop better treatment plans.",

Disruption to services, routines and accountability have jeopardised recovery efforts for many people with EDs [11, 14] , and even impacted the ability of individuals with past eating disorders to remain in remission [11] . In the UK, evidence-based psychological therapies, such as eating disorder focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-ED), are typically offered to adults with eating disorders [28] . The impact of the pandemic on treatment has varied across localities; treatment in some ED services may have been paused or reduced if there was a requirement to redeploy staff into essential areas of the NHS, whereas other services have been able to continue offering treatment by branching into telehealth, for instance video-conferencing. This kind of remote psychological treatment was already effectively employed in areas where geographical distance can make it difficult for individuals to access face-to-face healthcare [29] , but does require additional considerations, such as access to adequate internet connectivity, a quiet, confidential space, and in the case of eating disorders, navigating how to conduct in-session weighing [30, 31] .",

A very preliminary qualitative analysis of a small group of patients with anorexia nervosa and their families [10] suggested that while some benefited from continued support in this alternative format, others were unable to tolerate seeing themselves on screens. Other concerns expressed by patients and families about online treatment included the lack of non-verbal communication; that previous homework challenges, such as eating out, would become impossible; and that virtual connection placed responsibility on patients to manage their own weigh-ins, an accountability which would be difficult for people at early stages of recovery and which might constitute an extra burden on carers. While research on the COVID-19 pandemic has flourished and there is preliminary evidence of deterioration in people with EDs [9, 10, 14] , further indepth empirical scrutiny is imperative for best supporting these individuals through the present time. The high mortality rates of EDs [7, 8] , the development of treatmentresistance over time and the neurobiological changes which maintain chronicity [19] [20] [21] all underscore this crucial need for clinical and research attention to people with EDs. Accordingly, the current study had three aims. To inform clinical focus during this period, we firstly aimed to build a more comprehensive account, enabled by a mixedmethods design, of which factors were important during the pandemic as well as how these factors affected participants' experiences. As such, we built on previous research by ranking these factors in importance and exploring at a deeper, qualitative level their impacts on participants. With a more extensive and sex-balanced sample than in previous studies, we also aimed to delineate factors that might be impacted by individual differences, such as diagnosis. Second, we aimed to understand whether some emotion regulation strategies were linked to symptom changes and wellbeing outcomes for individuals affected by an ED. We also aimed to further explore this aspect with qualitative reports of the coping strategies people with an ED have used during the pandemic. Third and finally, given that previous studies offered only very sparse consideration of treatment experiences during the pandemic, we qualitatively explored participants' experiences with online treatment, hoping to inform and optimise future treatment delivery for this vulnerable population.",

This motivated our decision to adopt a mixed-methods approach so as to complement quantitative data around the impact of the pandemic with insights around how it affected participants in the greater context of their lives. The impact of the pandemic on mental health and eating symptomatology was quantified with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale [33] , the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire [34] and a single numerical item in the qualitative survey. Emotion regulation strategies, as predictors of these impacts, were operationalised with the short form version of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale [35] . Richer details around the impact of the pandemic on ED symptoms, coping strategies and (if relevant) experiences of online treatment, were accrued with a short qualitative survey. The survey took approximately 45 min to complete, including additional questionnaires not reported here, and participants were rewarded with money (Prolific) or a chance to be entered in a prize draw for Amazon vouchers (social media).

Much has been written around the association between social media use, thin idealisation, disordered eating and eating disorders [38] [39] [40] . Thin idealisation online has manifested at the present time in messages around avoiding quarantine weight gain, messages which have been suggested to be dangerous to people with EDs [18, 41] . The impact of such pernicious messages was reflected in our qualitative data, which likewise found that triggering messages led to increased pressure to eat healthily, to exercise, and to lose weight, which exacerbated ED behaviours. In accordance with the quantitative data, participants who described being triggered by social media were generally those with AN, some of whom were triggered even by ostensibly positive messages. Notably, some participants mentioned a pressure towards self-improvement and productive use of lockdown. Concerns have been raised about people with pathological perfectionism in the context of the vanishing divide between work and home, the tendency for stressful situations to increase the drive to achieve mastery, and the difficulty of these individuals to adjust self-standards despite exceptional circumstances [42] . These concerns have also been raised in the context of EDs [18] , where additional risks around \"self-improvement\" messages lie in the social reinforcement of thin idealisation, diet and exercise. In so far as participants with AN and with OSFED appeared more affected by triggering social media, it is interesting that some studies suggest perfectionism is associated less with bingeing than with other types of eating pathology, such as restriction and purging [43] [44] [45] . In accordance with its status as a lesser known, stigmatised and misunderstood eating disorder [46] [47] [48] , the particular social media usage of individuals with BED is unknown; the different impact of social media exposure on people with BED in the present study is, as such, an intriguing avenue for future research.",

As pertains to this first predictor, lack of emotional clarity is characteristic of alexithymia, a personality trait characterised by an inability to identify and describe emotions. Alexithymia occurs at higher rates both in people with an ED [26] and populations more vulnerable to EDs, such as autistic people [51, 52] , such that some query whether it might mediate this increased vulnerability [53] . Clarity and awareness of emotions are thought to occur early in the process of emotion regulation, such that the ability to identify feelings helps determine which strategy to use to regulate unpleasant emotions [54, 55] . Interestingly, lack of access to emotion regulation strategies was also a strong predictor of distress during the pandemic. It is possible that these two are linked, and that helping patients identify their feelings with more clarity could help them match specific negative emotions to one in an arsenal of adaptive strategies. Worryingly, maladaptive and avoidant strategies, such as ED behaviours, alcohol use, self-medicating and self-harm were common responses to difficult emotions in the pandemic, as in previous reports [11] . Unfortunately, these kind of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies are activated easily and automatically, while adaptive strategies require conscious activation [56] .",

Only two studies have examined the coping activities engaged in by people with EDs at this time: consistent with the importance of setting new structures and enjoyable activities highlighted by our participants, these previous studies found that among the most helpful activities for people with AN and BN were establishing routines, day planning and scheduling pleasant activities [12, 13] , in addition to time with family, yoga and gentle exercise.",

While clarification of emotional experience may be a crucial first step, this might be followed by attempts to increase accessibility of existing adaptive regulation strategies and develop new ones, including emotion acceptance, in response to distress. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) for BED and BN was developed in response to patients who do not always benefit from Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)-focused treatments [62] , but this and other third-wave interventions such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), compassion-focused therapy (CFT) and mindfulness have wider potential in the treatment of people with EDs [63] . Their relevance in this context comes from the fact that in contrast to pure CBT which attempts to prevent strong negative emotions being activated, third wave interventions are response-focused [64] : centred around accepting, managing and finding adaptive ways to moderate the experience of strong emotions when they arise. The existing evidence suggests that CBT may be more effective than third wave therapies [63] [64] [65] , but these analyses all focus on a time prior to Covid-19. Whether third wave, response-focus therapies might be useful at a time when people have limited control over the antecedents of negative emotion is an intriguing query for future researchers. Adaptions to treatment paradigms in the current climate must, however, be made with caution and based on further experimental scrutiny.",

            "text": "The third strand of our analysis focused on exploring the responses of those within our UK-based sample who had been offered remote psychological interventions. Very little is presently known around the efficacy of online treatment during the present crisis, but some preliminary concerns raised by individuals and their families [10] were ratified in our analysis. Where participants in the previous study suggested that therapeutic contact online would certainly \"lack something\" [10] , our participants also reported a feeling of \"detachment\"; a diminishment of the expected and desired connection with the clinician, partly due to practical difficulties, such as internet connectivity and participants being unable to find a safe and private place within their homes. Interestingly however, our participants with pre-existent therapeutic relationships seemed partly protected from this issue, and reported some benefits from maintained therapeutic contact. Likewise, the previous study [10] raised concerns around the loss of structure, the loss of more active therapeutic activities, such as homework, and the loss of accountability, for instance related to weigh-insconcerns aligned with the comments of our participants. This allowed some of our participants to engage unchecked in ED behaviours (\"I have no one around to keep an eye on me\"), consistent with the ambivalence that people with EDs often feel around treatment and recovery [66, 67] . It is important to recognise that these data, and that of the previous study [10] , are time-sensitive. At the point of our data collection in June-July 2020, NHS services had recently undergone mass reorganisation and deployment of staff. Though the NHS remains in a state of flux and differences are still present across localities, the importance of \"business as usual\" and clear, practical guidance around how to establish the same level of excellence have since been disseminated [18, 30, 31, 68, 69] . For example, with reference to issues around engagement, motivation and openness, clinicians have been recommended to thoroughly and openly explore the patient's previous experiences of and attitudes towards remote treatment; to discuss and plan the practical implementation of the therapy and develop contingency plans for issues such as connection problems; to use the full power of audiovisual technology to create openness and connection; and to, as much as possible, involve the patient as an active collaborator in therapy [18, 30, 31] .",

It is however important to note that for some, using video may be upsetting, so a recent paper recommended starting with audio if the patient has concerns about seeing their own image, and/or asking them to not look at parts of their own image they find distressing, although the therapist and patient should ideally work together to accept switching to video [31] . Another important aspect concerned the convenience of online treatment which reduced lengthy travel timescurrently considered as a barrier to successful treatment [71, 72] . The positive appraisals around convenience and ease of access, found in our participants and in those of the previous study [10] were actually identified as advantages of telehealth interventions prior to Covid-19 [29, 73, 74] and suggest a future for online treatment beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Internalised stigma may also contribute to these feelings [76] . However, it is possible that this is, in addition, an unintended consequence of governmental measures and communications aimed at reducing transmission and preserving medical resources to cope with Covid-19. Worrying evidence is emerging that despite increased reports of domestic violence, self-injury and suicidality, fewer individuals than would be typically expected are seeking formal help from health professionals [77] . Concerns that mental ill-health might be perceived as less important than physical health [78] seemed to be borne out in our participants. To some extent, solutions may be found in the possibility of selfreferrals as an option, and in increasing awareness of the availability of online support groups, as access to these groups was identified as helpful by some participants. Research exploring the impact and perception of public health announcements may, however, be vital in ensuring that those who need to do seek help.",

First, the time sensitivity of the study necessitated speedy and convenient recruitment of participants through social media and Prolific. While this allowed us to collect a larger and more sex-balanced sample than previous research on COVID-19 and EDs [9, 14] , we relied on selfreported diagnoses. Although the EDEQ confirmed that average eating psychopathology was in the clinical range, it would have been beneficial to confirm diagnoses, which may have been especially important in our attempts to contrast different ED diagnoses. Moreover, our sample was self-selected and over 18, meaning that it is possible that it was biased towards people who may have more severe eating disorders, or who had not been able to use treatment to make change. Our sample indeed had a longer than average duration of illness in comparison to recent estimates for untreated eating disorders [79] . Therefore, it is possible that this study's sample may not be a fully generalisable representation of the entire eating disorder population, including of the younger population.",

Particular efforts had been made to recruit this often forgotten population, and were partially achieved in that we recruited 76 men with EDs. However as the distribution of men and women differed across specific ED diagnoses and the male sample was still comparatively underpowered, we were forced to abandon our hope to compare male and female participants with each specific type of ED pathology. Consequently, it is possible that differences between ED diagnoses, for instance in the greater importance of social media triggers for participants with AN and OSFED than for participants with BED, might be a factor of the different representation of women and men within these groups. Here, again, the paucity of data on ED in males creates the danger that in the present time, too, men with EDs may be less understood.",
