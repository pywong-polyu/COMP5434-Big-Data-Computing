Different vaccines can be dosed, each providing different immunization times and immunization levels. Differences due to individuals' ages are accounted for through the introduction of either a continuous age structure or a discrete set of age classes. Extensions to gender differences or to distinguish fragile individuals can also be considered. Within this setting, vaccination strategies can be simulated, tested and compared, as is explicitly described through numerical integrations.",

Movements in space can be comprised with a procedure similar to that used in Section 4 to introduce a continuous age structure, possibly introducing a further distinction among individuals having different destinations, see [10, 12] for further details. A different approach to diffusion in space is treated, for instance, in [29] . The setting therein is based on stochastic ordinary differential equations, eventually leading to partial differential equations of second order in the space derivative [29, Formula (13) ].

However, this condition is clearly not sufficient: one should also require that D(t * , T ) in (2.14) does not exceed the number of living individuals at time t * . The integrations in Figure 2 .6 confirm that stabilizing at R o (t) = 1 does not stop the spreading of the disease, as also shown in Table 2 .2. When R o (t) = 1, a sort of \"dynamic equilibrium\" is onset, so that, for large t, the maps t \u2192 I(t) and t \u2192 R(t, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 are approximately constant, while t \u2192 S(t) and t \u2192 V (t, \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 have oscillations that approximately balance each other, so that their sum keep diminishing at a rate approximately \u00b5 I(t * ), see Figure 2 .7. Somewhat surprisingly, two situations arise where a higher vaccination speed allows for a faster reduction of the infected and infectious population, so that -on the time interval considered -the resulting number of casualties is lower than that obtained after a higher but slower vaccination campaign, see the bold data in Table 2. 2. More precisely, a higher vaccination speed allows for a faster reduction of the I population and to quickly dose all the S individuals or lower R o below the desired threshold, see Figure 2 .8. On the other hand, the lower value of R o (t) obtained with the slower campaign ensures that in subsequent times this strategy results in being more effective in lowering casualties. ",

The present framework clearly allows also to leave an amount of non vaccinated individuals, as in \u00a7 2.1. It is evident that Class 1 First is likely to be the least effective strategy, as it actually results from number of casualties in class 2 even higher that that resulting from strategy Class 1 First. Moreover, in both Class 1 First and Class 2 First strategies, the rise of rather persisting epidemic waves is evident. In particular, in the latter case the final increase in the number of infected of both classes induces to expect a worsening of the situation in the long run. Among the strategies considered, the one resulting most effective in containing casualties is the Feedback one. However, it is not easy to anticipate that, mainly due to the particular initial data chosen, it is only slightly better than the Half-Half one. Indeed, a feedback strategy is generally prone to provide better results than an open loop one.",

Indeed, compare the qualitative behavior of the maps t \u2192 I a (t) in the reference case (Figure 4.1) , in the successful cases Feedback or Half-Half to those corresponding to the strategies Class 1 First or Class 2 First (Figure 4 .3). The epidemic waves in the latter case appear to be quite persistent, while they fade out sooner in the former 2 cases. Indeed, the lack of any vaccination results in a high mortality that hinder the repeated formation of waves. On the opposite, an efficient vaccination campaign quickly flattens the S a curve near to 0. A weak vaccination campaign still reduces the number of casualties but may be not sufficiently strong to eradicate the disease, which thus keeps propagating in waves.",
