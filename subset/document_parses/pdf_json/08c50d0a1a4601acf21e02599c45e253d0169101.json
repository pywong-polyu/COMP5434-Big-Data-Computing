Despite the occurrence of a relapse, all but four patients received a second dose of vaccine, of the same type as the first, except for one young patient (patient 1) who was vaccinated with the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine three months after an initial Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine injection (the AZ vaccine was no longer authorized for people under the age of 55 years in France at the time of his second injection). One of the four patients who received only one dose had a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at the time at which he should have received the second injection (patient 8). Seven relapses were noted after the second injection of vaccine. These relapses occurred a mean of 12 days (range: 1 to 25 days) after vaccination. Finally, two patients had relapses two and seven days after their third injection of Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine, despite having experienced no relapse after their second injection six months previously. Two patients (patients 7 and 23) experienced a relapse after each of their two injections of vaccine. INS relapse was confirmed by biological evidence of a nephrotic syndrome in 14 patients, and was strongly suspected due to a significant increase in proteinuria relative to the last assessment, but without a decrease in albumin level to below 30 g/l in nine patients. Two young adults (patients 23 and 24) did not undergo albumin determinations, but their proteinuria increased from 0.09 to 10.3 g/g and 4.9 g/g. Proteinuria in the entire cohort ranged from 1.4 to 10.3 g/g (mean: 5.6 g/g). Two patients had severe nephrotic syndrome with albumin levels below 15 g/l.Four patients (patients 3, 6, 8, 17) had no nephrotic range proteinuria at the time of relapse but the significant increase of proteinuria level led the clinicians to consider this increased as the first manifestation of post vaccination relapse requiring specific therapy that was started within days. Five patients experienced acute at the time of post-vaccine relapse: three had AKI KDIGO stage 1 (patients 11, 14 and 25), one had AKI KDIGO stage 2 (patient 13) and one had AKI KDIGO stage 3 (patient 2), but none of these patients underwent either renal biopsy or renal replacement therapy at this time. Venous thrombosis occurred in two patients (patients 1 and 2) at the time of relapse. Treatment and outcome All but one of the patients received steroids as a first-line treatment for INS relapse. Nine of the 11 patients without specific treatment at the time of post-vaccine relapse received steroids alone for treatment of the relapse, whereas the other two received steroids together with a calcineurin inhibitor (patient 8) or rituximab (patient 6). Steroid dose was increased for the patients on steroid treatment alone at the time of relapse, and all but one of these five patients received an additional immunosuppressive drug: MMF for patient 2, CNI for patients 3 and 4, and rituximab for patient 7. For the four patients on MMF only, steroids were added to the treatment regimen at the time of relapse. One patient on rituximab was treated with steroids, one patient on CNI and low-dose steroids was treated by increasing steroid dose and two patients on rituximab and steroids were switched onto obinutuzumab for patient 5 and MMF for patient 22 along together with a higher dose of steroids. The last patient (patient 13) was treated with oral cyclophosphamide alone. Of note, among 18 patients with available data, assessment of humoral immune response to SARS-Cov-2 found that 11 patients exhibited a positive antibody level titer (greater than 7.1 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml) within the two months after the first vaccine administration. During follow-up, 21 of the 25 patients achieved complete remission, within one month in 17 of cases. One patient (patient 14) was in partial remission at last follow-up and one patient had no remission (patient 13). This particular patient displayed INS due to FSGS and had been in remission on rituximab for seven months. His relapse started 20 days after the second dose of vaccine and was treated with this treatment remained unsuccessful at last follow-up. The two patients (patients 22 and 25) who relapsed after their third dose had just started steroid therapy at the time of writing. DISCUSSION Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were developed in less than a year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic threat. The three main vaccines used in Europe are based on either new mRNA technology [24] for the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) and the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273), or an adenovirus vector for the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine (AZD1222). These vaccines have formed the backbone of a massive vaccination campaign worldwide, heralding a new era of preventive medicine. Nevertheless, a number of concerns have been raised about the potential toxicity and reactivity of these vaccines, and pharmacovigilance reports for these new vaccines have been monitored particularly closely, due to their novel mode of action. By August 18, 2021, 1.8 billion people had been completely vaccinated against COVID-19 and only 295 cases of glomerulonephritis (new-onset or relapsing), including 46 cases of MCD, had been reported to VigiBase [25]. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are designed to activate immune responses by inducing the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, but they could also potentially trigger autoimmune conditions in predisposed individuals. In agreement with this hypothesis, Caza et al reported a series of 29",

            "text": "We report here the first series of 25 INS relapses occurring within one month of anti-COVID-19 vaccine injection. We also excluded six other known cases from this series because the biological data were insufficient to confirm INS relapse. The 20 French patients were referred from different regions of France after several calls for cases sent to all French nephrologists by the French Society of Nephrology Dialysis and Transplantation and the French rare disease center for INS management. This study was retrospective and suffers from the limitations inherent to this type of approach, and missing cases are, of course, likely. Unfortunately, in the context of the massive worldwide vaccination campaign against COVID-19, it is difficult to determine accurately the incidence of relapse after vaccination, because vaccination status is not sufficiently well recorded for all ISN patients. Nevertheless, at one center participating in our study (Necker Hospital Adult Nephrology Department), 106 adult patients were contacted individually to record vaccination status and the occurrence of relapse: 80 of these patients had had at least one injection, and two (2.5%) had experienced a relapse (one after the first dose and the other after the third dose).We cannot rule out the possibility that the INS relapses observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reflect a fortuitous association rather than a related disorder, but the pathophysiological processes potentially involved merit consideration. It has been suggested that INS is the clinical manifestation of a primary disorder of T-lymphocyte function leading to cytokine release, resulting in alterations to the glomerular filtration barrier[1]. The signature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination seems to involve several crucial effectors of adaptive immunity (CD4 + /CD8 + T lymphocytes, natural killer T cells, memory B lymphocytes and T follicular cells)[24]. Sahin et al. showed that, following stimulation, the supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated participants contained proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12p70, which could potentially be involved in INS pathogenesis[2,27].

            "text": ", the close temporal relationship (17.5 days after a first injection, 12 days after a second injection and 4.5 days after a third injection) between vaccination against COVID-19 and INS relapse suggests a possible pathophysiological link between these two conditions, although it is not yet possible to draw definitive conclusions.The main objective of our study was the identification of risk factors or patient profiles at particular risk of INS relapse following vaccination against COVID-19. Our study suggests that INS may relapse in patients with childhood-or adult-onset disease, but that relapses occur preferentially in patients with \"difficult to treat\" INS, as 84% of cases were already on treatment with immunosuppressive agents to control underlying glomerular disease. Ten of our patients had suffered a relapse in the preceding 12 months, suggesting that their ISN remained particularly active before vaccination. Nevertheless, 11 patients were on no specific treatment and the occurrence of a relapse more than 20 years after the previous episode in two patients highlights the potential role of vaccination as a trigger for INS relapse. In our series, 80% of the patients had received the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine, but INS relapse has beendescribed with most of the vaccines used in Europe and North America. Adding our 25 patients to the other seven published cases of post-vaccination relapse and new-onset nephrotic syndrome linked to MCD [7-20, 25], the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine had been administered in 30 cases (68%), the Moderna vaccine in five cases (11%), the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine in seven cases (16%), the Janssen vaccine in one case (2%), and information type of vaccine was unavailable in one case. These figures may simply reflect the availability of each of the vaccines. For example, in France, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine accounts for almost 80% of anti-COVID-19 vaccine injections. However, one pharmacovigilance report reported an OR of 2.13 for MCD development after vaccination with the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine relative to other vaccines [25]. Clinical and biological presentation was not unusual for this condition. In 4 patients without nephrotic range proteinuria at the time of post vaccination relapse, after careful evaluation of their medical records spontaneous remission of nephrotic syndrome was not suspected. Acute kidney injury occurred in five patients (three with AKI KDIGO 1) but resolved rapidly with treatment in all but one patient who did not achieve remission, and two patients had uncomplicated thrombophlebitis. As expected, the post-vaccination relapses of all patients were treated with steroids, the cornerstone of INS treatment. Based on specific previous renal disease history, treatment with additional immunosuppressive agents was initiated in nine cases. Excluding the two patients who presented a relapse after the third injection and who had only just started treatment, 21 of 23 patients achieved rapid remission on treatment and an additional patient achieved partial remission. These observations are consistent with the various case reports published to date (Table 3) and suggest that INS relapse following COVID-19 vaccination is highly sensitive to steroid therapy. Because renal biopsy was not systematically performed at the time of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination relapse, alternate glomerular pathologies cannot be definitively ruled out. Nevertheless, biopsy-proven INS at the time of the first episode, previous history of \"difficult to treat\" form of INS (frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome) and successful use of steroid to control post vaccination relapse highly suggest that the patients presented in this study displayed a relapse of their primary glomerular disease rather than occurrence of another glomerular disease. despite the relapse after the first administration of vaccine in 18 patients, the patients' clinicians were not reluctant to perform a second injection in 14 cases (with a vaccine from the same manufacturer in 13 cases). In 12 of these 14 patients, no flare-up was observed after the second dose. The other two patients had a minor relapse that resolved rapidly when steroid dose was increased slightly. Only three of the seven published cases received a second dose, and none presented proteinuria requiring a change of treatment. These findings should encourage physicians to persuade their patients to complete the anti-COVID",
