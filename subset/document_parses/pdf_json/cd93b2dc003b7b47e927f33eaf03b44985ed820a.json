Viruses that are contained in the droplets can infect other people through the respiratory tract if they do not maintain a safe distance, or if they enter their body indirectly [4, 5] . One of the indirect routes is through contaminated surfaces. Recent studies have shown that human coronaviruses can persist on various surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days [6] . The existence of coronaviruses in water, sewage, and wastewater in a few days' time frame is also possible and discussed in detail in the review [7] . Thus, the disinfection of repeatedly touched surfaces and decontamination of water/wastewater is essential to interrupt the possible transmission routes of these pathogens.",

However, a limited number of experimental studies used PSs to inactivate coronaviruses. The photodynamic disinfection of blood plasma from SARS-CoV in the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system was successful with a standard dose of methylene blue (0.085 mg per 250 mL of plasma) and visible light doses (30-120 J/cm 2 ); the SARS-CoV titers were reduced by about three orders of magnitude, compared to the level of the other two tested viruses (arbovirus Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever and paramyxovirus Nipah) [10] . In suspensions with virus titers 3.0-4.0 lgTCID50, SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated using 1.0-10.0 \u00b5g/mL methylene blue, or 0.5-5.0 \u00b5g/mL Radachlorin, and 662 nm irradiation (16 and 40 J/cm 2 ) by a semiconductor laser [11] . However, both PSs, methylene blue and Radachlorin, are able to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 at a very low micromolar range even without irradiation [11, 12] that makes it difficult to assess the true photodynamic effect.",

In this study, we used an octacationic derivative, octakis(cholinyl)zinc phthalocyanine (Zn-PcChol 8+ ), and LED with the emission maximum at 692 nm to inactivate infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 tested in Vero E6 cell cultures. Due to the presence of eight positively charged peripheral substituents in the phthalocyanine molecule, electrostatic interactions should play an essential role in determining the properties of this PS; electrostatic repulsion results in a monomeric state of Zn-PcChol 8+ in aqueous solutions, and electrostatic attraction-in its binding to the negatively charged bacterial cells [16] . In order to reveal the possible binding sites of the PS on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed the electrostatic potential fields of the S-protein of this coronavirus and Zn-PcChol 8+ molecule and studied interactions of these molecules by Brownian dynamics (BD). For virus titration, stocks of treated or non-treated viruses were serially diluted 10-fold starting from 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22126 . Confluent monolayers of Vero cells, grown in 96-well plates, were washed with PBS and infected with respective dilutions of each virus. After 40 min of incubation at 37 \u2022 C, the supernatant was removed, and 200 \u00b5L of virus growth medium was added per well. Plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C under 5% CO 2 for 7 days. All virus titrations were performed in triplicate. Virus-induced cytopathic effect was detected, and virus titers were determined as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL, according to Reed and Muench [21] . The photos were obtained using the EVOS XL Core Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), phase contrast mode 4/10, magnification \u00d720.",

The molecular structure of Zn-PcChol 8+ is shown in Figure 1 . For virus titration, stocks of treated or non-treated viruses were serially diluted 10fold starting from 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22126 . Confluent monolayers of Vero cells, grown in 96-well plates, were washed with PBS and infected with respective dilutions of each virus. After 40 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the supernatant was removed, and 200 \u03bcL of virus growth medium was added per well. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 7 days. All virus titrations were performed in triplicate. Virus-induced cytopathic effect was detected, and virus titers were determined as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL, according to Reed and Muench [21] . The photos were obtained using the EVOS XL Core Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), phase contrast mode 4/10, magnification \u00d720.",

The most abundant M-proteins and E-proteins are transmembrane proteins with short (19 and 16 amino acid residues, respectively) N-terminal ectodomains; in contrast, each ectodomain of the trimeric S-protein contains 1213 amino acid residues out of a total of 1273 [32] .

            "text": "It has long been postulated that antiviral PSs must bind to the viral lipid envelope (in the case of enveloped viruses), or the protein coat, or the genome [30] . In coronaviruses, the envelope contains a lipid bilayer with at least three embedded viral proteins: the membrane protein (M-protein) and the envelope protein (E-protein) are involved in virus assembly, while the spike protein (S-protein) mediates virus entry into the host cells [31] . The most abundant M-proteins and E-proteins are transmembrane proteins with short (19 and 16 amino acid residues, respectively) N-terminal ectodomains; in contrast, each ectodomain of the trimeric S-protein contains 1213 amino acid residues out of a total of 1273 [32] . Unsaturated fatty acids of viral lipids are susceptible to singlet oxygen generated by the membrane-binding PSs, such as the lipophilic thiazolidine derivative [33] . However, intercalating of Zn-PcChol 8+ in the viral lipid bilayer that originates from the host cell membranes seems unlikely since the octacationic Zn-PcChol 8+ molecules showed no affinity to the POPC model bilayer in our recent simulation experiments [26] . Moreover, Zn-PcChol 8+ molecules almost never appeared at distances less than 3.5 nm from the POPC bilayer center.",

To answer the question, we first calculated the electrostatic potential field of the S-protein and Zn-PcChol 8+ according to Poisson-Boltzmann formalism. Figure 4 displays the surface distribution of electrostatic potential and equipotential electrostatic surfaces of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (a) and (b), and Zn-PcChol 8+ (c) at ionic strength 100 mM. It is easy to see that while the Zn-PcChol 8+ molecule is mostly positively charged, the S-protein stalk shows three large areas of negative electrostatic potential, with the largest negatively charged area located at the conjunction of the stalk and the head of the spike protein. The head itself is mostly positive, though several patches of negative potential are present. From panel (b), one can also see that the distribution of electrostatic potential is not strictly symmetric.",

In fact, as we have found, positively charged Zn-PcChol 8+ molecules concentrate near negatively charged amino acid residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains (Figures 4 and 5) . It is well established that, in comparison with SARS-CoV, the surface of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein exhibits a more positive electrostatic potential [34] . However, while its S-protein head carries a positive electrostatic potential, the stalk, according to the previous data [34] and our simulations (Figure 4) , is negatively charged and provides the appropriate surface encounter to the Zn-PcChol 8+ molecules. Our BD simulations have demonstrated that the most stable binding occurs at the junction of the stalk with the head of the spike protein at a distance of about 10 nm from the intramembrane domain. Zn-PcChol 8+ is the Type II PS, with a high quantum yield of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) production (0.65) [22] . In the aqueous medium, the lifetime of 1 O 2 is about 4 \u00b5s but is shortened in a biological environment. In cells, the lifetime of 1 O 2 is in the range of 10-320 ns, and its diffusion distance is 10-55 nm [35] . According to the authors [36] , 1 O 2 has an even more limited lifetime and diffusion distance, 40 ns and 20 nm, respectively. Thus, for effective oxidative damage, the PS should be located at a distance of no more than the diffusion radius of 1 O 2 from the sensitive biological structures. In terms of antimicrobial photodynamic treatment, this means that the adhesion of the PS to the external structures of the targeted pathogen should be sufficient to allow its destruction [37] . Our BD simulations show ( Figure 5 ) that Zn-PcChol 8+ binds to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at a Viruses 2021, 13, 643 9 of 11 distance of no more than 10 nm from the viral membrane. Surface proteins and the lipid bilayer are both sensitive to oxidative damage. In fact, we have shown that Zn-PcChol 8+ causes photodynamic inactivation of avian influenza A viruses of the H5N1 [15] and H5N8 [20] subtypes. Three different types of H5N8 damage were observed after treatment with 4 \u00b5M of Zn-PcChol 8+ and 12 J/cm 2 of white light [20] , namely, \"bald\" virions with removed surface glycoproteins and membranes retaining structural integrity, virions with damaged membranes, and totally destroyed virions, all forms being non-infectious.",

Our experimental data confirm the lack of Zn-PcChol 8+ antiviral activity in the absence of irradiation. Indeed, Zn-PcChol 8+ itself did not affect SARS-CoV-2 titer and only under irradiation caused the loss of infectivity, that is, virus photodynamic inactivation (Table 1 ). This distinguishes Zn-PcChol 8+ from methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine dye, whose antiviral activity is observed even without photoactivation.

In this study, the octacationic phthalocyanine Zn(II) derivative (Zn-PcChol 8+ ), in a minimal concentration of 1 \u00b5M under 692 nm LED light irradiation at a dose of only 3.75 J/cm 2 , completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with the titer 5.00 lgTCID50/mL in the medium rich in inorganic salts and proteins, similar in composition to saliva droplets. The high sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to Zn-PcChol 8+ -induced photodynamic inactivation makes this PS promising for disinfection purposes to combat the spread of COVID-19.",
