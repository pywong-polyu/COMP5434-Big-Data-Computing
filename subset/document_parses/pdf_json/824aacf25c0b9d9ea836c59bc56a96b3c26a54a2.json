WSP-H torch was used to deposit two complete thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with multilayered top-coat. NiCrAlY was used as bond-coat and deposited on nickelbased superalloy substrates. Top-coat consisted of up to three sublayers: (i) yttria-stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2 -8 wt.%Y 2 O 3 -YSZ) deposited from solution, (ii) gadolinium zirconate (Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 -GZO) deposited from suspension, and (iii) optional yttrium aluminum garnet (Y 3 Al 5 O 12 -YAG) overlayer deposited from suspension. Each of the sublayers was intended to provide different functionalities, namely improved fracture toughness, low thermal conductivity, and high erosion resistance, respectively. High-temperature performance and thermal shock resistance of the deposited coatings were tested by thermal cycling fatigue ''TCF'' test (maximum temperature 1100\u00b0C, 1 h dwell per cycle) and ''laser-rig'' test (maximum temperature * 1530\u00b0C, 5 min dwell per cycle) exposing samples to isothermal and gradient thermal conditions, respectively. In both tests, coatings endured around 800 test cycles which shows great potential for further development of these layers and their application in demanding thermal conditions. Analysis of the samples after the test showed microstructural changes and identified reason of ultimate coating failure.",

Thermally sprayed TBCs usually consist of MCrAlY-based bond-coat (M being Ni, Co, or both) and YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) top-coat and have been successfully used for many years ( Ref 2) . However, in order to further increase thermal efficiency of gas turbines, it is desirable to increase their working temperature, but to meet this goal, new coatings alternative to conventional TBCs have to be sought (Ref 3). Possible innovations may include change of coating chemistry, tailoring coating microstructure, or preparation of multiphase materials (Ref [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Also on the side of the coating equipment, innovations are desirable in order to decrease process cost, coat larger components, or deposit thicker layers more efficiently ( Ref 10) . It is important to note that there are different types and sizes of gas turbines Production Notes: Credit Line: This article is an invited paper selected from abstracts submitted for the 2020 International Thermal Spray Conference, ITSC2020, that was to be held from June 10-12, 2020, in Vienna, Austria.

Due to the high plasma enthalpy, considerable feed rates (more than 100 mL of liquid per minute) may be processed with high deposition efficiency (DE). For example, at * 100 mL/min feed rates, DE of around 55-60% is commonly achieved by WSP-H torch for YSZ spraying from suspension or solution and around 75% for spraying of YAG from suspension ( Ref 12, 13) . TBCs with both NiCrAlY bond-coat and single-layer YSZ or GZO top-coats were already successfully deposited from powder, suspension, and solution and benchmarked by thermal cycling fatigue (TCF) test repeatedly exposing coatings to 1100\u00b0C for 1 h. Please note that this test is in the literature also denoted as furnace cycle test (acronym FCT) and due to its relatively low cost, simplicity, and high throughput is often used for initial screening of thermal fatigue resistance of newly developed TBCs. All coatings showed in this test behavior fully comparable to TBCs deposited by conventional technologies ( Ref 15, 16) .",

Coating with additional thin YAG layer was also deposited and tested with motivation to potentially provide improved protection against high-temperature erosion and CMAS attack (Ref 20) . Target bond-coat and top-coat thicknesses were * 150 to 200 lm and * 200 to 250 lm, respectively. Conventional TBCs with such thicknesses were already tested in the used TCF furnace and laser-rig, so that neither method demanded tuning of the testing procedure and relevant results were available for comparison. Also, such thicknesses are representative of many industrially used TBCs including those deposited by EB-PVD technology for which suspension/solution plasma spraying may be a potential substitute. Ratio of the thicknesses of individual top-coat sublayers was selected as approx. 1:6:1 for YSZ, GZO and YAG sublayers, respectively.",

Edges of the Hastelloy-X coupons used for TCF test were effectively rounded during grit-blasting process. Choice of different substrate materials was given by the previous optimization of testing procedure for both tests and existing result databases; however, both Hastelloy-X and Ren\u00e9 N515 are Ni-based superalloys used in high-temperature applications. Substrates were grit-blasted, cleaned in ultrasonic bath in acetone and mounted to revolving air-cooled carousel and preheated by plasma torch. ''Trilayer'' and ''Quadlayer'' coatings consisting of 3 or 4 sublayers, respectively, were deposited using the following feedstocks: Injection pressures of liquid feedstocks were optimized by SprayCam (Control Vision, Inc. USA) camera, and sample temperature was monitored during deposition by thermocouple (attached to the substrate) and IR camera (monitoring frontal surface). Deposition of individual sublayers consisted of several deposition cycles (each consisting of 3 up and down torch strokes) interrupted by cooling periods to prevent overheating of the samples. Further details on deposition procedure are provided in Ref 12, 13, 15 . Spraying parameters are surveyed in Table 1 .",

The rig was set to create a circular laser spot size of about 25 mm (1'') in diameter, in order to fit the dimensions of the substrate. A compressed air jet cooled the backside of the substrate in order to generate the thermal gradient along the TBC/substrate profile. The rig was closed-loop computercontrolled. Frontal side of the samples with the coating was repeatedly illuminated for 5 min by the laser at a constant power, which was interrupted by 2-min periods of laser shutdown. Temperature of the coating surface was evaluated by calibrated pyrometer (one color 7.9 lm wavelength pyrometer with a spot size of * 7 mm at the center of the TBC top-coat). The emissivity values for the GZO and YAG top coats were measured experimentally within a range of 500 to 550\u00b0C (using the laser-rig pyrometer) and found to be 0.92 and 0.98, respectively. The substrate temperature was evaluated at the sample center by thermocouple (Omega, KMQIN-032U-12, Nicrosil/Nisil) inserted into the hole drilled in the middle of the substrate thickness. During the whole test, back side of the samples was intensively cooled (non-stop) by compressed air at a constant flow. For this reason, each thermal cycle consisted of a 5-min hot period and a 2-min cool period. Typically, the TBC top coat reaches in the used laser-rig a stable near-constant temperature after 1 min of heating, whereas the substrate cools down to RT (B 30\u00b0C) after 2 min of cooling. Both TBC architectures were tested until 863 cycles were reached.",

In the case of Quadlayer coating, GZO column tops were successfully covered by protective dense YAG ''caps'' but deeper and narrower intercolumnar gaps were not filled by YAG, thus retaining the desirable strain tolerance of the columnar GZO. It may be noted that deposition rates and microstructures of individual sublayers correspond well to our previous studies with single-layered top-coats where their microstructural features are discussed in more details (Ref 13, 15) . (Fig. 2a) , it may be stated that TCF lifetimes of both coatings were fully comparable. It is important to note that TCF test is often considered as ''isothermal'' because thermal gradient is formed within the coatings only shortly after their insertion into the preheated furnace and during the cooling stage. For most of the 1 h cycle time, samples were thus homogeneously heated to 1100\u00b0C. Time-lapse of sample photographs at the beginning of the cooling cycles enabled direct observation of the failure propagation (Fig. 2b) . Cavities started forming within the coating since approximately 90% of the relative TCF lifetime (i.e., after * 700 TCF cycles) and eventually merged, which led to rapidly propagating large-scale delamination of the coatings (Fig. 2b) . When the testing continued, cavities interconnected with sample edge. Also, buckling and throughthickness cracking of the coating could be observed above the delaminations as the coating was no longer supported by the substrate. It should be noted that darkening of the coating edge as apparent in Fig. 2(b) was observed from the very first TCF cycles and may be caused just by more intensive heat loss at sample circumference due to enhanced heat radiation and better access of cooling air. Nevertheless, even if edge darkening indicated circumferential coating failure, especially during the late test, its propagation rate and total area were negligible. Formation of cavities within the multilayered ceramic top-coat induced namely by in-plane cracking was confirmed on cross sections of failed coatings (Fig. 3) . After the TCF test, bond-coat showed strong internal oxidation but the coating failure occurred predominantly above bondcoat, i.e., above TGO, within TC1 YSZ layer or at TC1 YSZ/TC2 GZO interface. It may be therefore assumed that the columnar structure of GZO provided the desired strain tolerance of both coatings and deposition of the YAG overlayer did not influence the coating failure mode. Please note that TCF lifetime of state-of-the-art TBC was for the same TCF temperature testing profile in the range of 600-800 cycles ( Ref 38) . Both multilayered coatings deposited in this study may be thus considered eligible for the next stage of properties screening by thermal fatigue test with strong thermal gradient, such as burner-rig test or laser-rig test.",

An infrared (IR) camera observation of the samples illuminated by laser confirmed homogenous surface temperature field in the central area of the samples corresponding to the laser spot diameter (Fig. 4b) . Toward the edges, temperature gradually decreased which was desirable for protection of the mounting fixture and prevented premature coating failure on the sample edges. All further analyses were carried out on material originating from the central ''hot zone.'' Thermal cycling profiles as measured by pyrometer (monitoring coating surface temperature) and thermocouple (monitoring substrate temperature 1.6 mm below the coating) are illustrated in Fig. 4(c) . For clarity, only first five cycles are shown but the system showed excellent repeatability of the thermal cycle profiles thorough the whole test duration. Also, please note that the high-temperature pyrometer did not read temperatures below 500\u00b0C. After activation of the laser, coating surface temperature increased in just 1 min from room temperature to approximately 1530\u00b0C (Table 2 ). Substrate temperature increase was slightly delayed as the heat wave had to reach the thermocouple, resulting in spikes in the history of temperature difference (plot in Fig. 4c) . However, within first minute of each cycle, both temperatures stabilized and their difference was * 460\u00b0C. After 2 min of cooling, the substrate reached room temperature. It needs to be highlighted that in order to establish a ''fair comparison'' of both TBC architectures regarding their thermal gradient cycle performance levels, the cycles were setup to such a way that provided (i) similar TBC and (ii) substrate temperatures, as well as, (iii) similar thermal gradients across the TBC/substrate system (Fig. 4 , Table 2 ).

Diffusion between ceramic sublayers was also observed as sharp interfaces were replaced by gradual ones (Fig. 7) . Similar interaction between YSZ and GZO (deposited by EB-PVD) was observed also, for example, in Ref 39. It should be noted here that due to the thermal gradient and expected low thermal conductivity of the deposited layers, local temperature in the individual layers was lower than the maximal surface temperature. Moreover, it may be expected that thermal field within the coating evolved in time due to the coating sintering and gradual coating failure (see further).

As mentioned above, Quadlayer coating originally seemed to be intact after the laser-rig test but ''crater'' failure developed during cutting of the sample on the metallographic saw (Fig. 5) . Logical explanation of the ''crater'' formation mechanism therefore is that laser-rig test induced horizontal cracking within the ceramic multilayered top-coat which delaminated when the crack reached critical length (or due to external forces during cutting procedure). It may be therefore speculated that if the laser-rig test continued, Quadlayer coating would have probably developed within few tens of thermal cycles the very same macroscopic failure as the Trilayer coating.

Shape of the ''dimple'' also confirmed previous observation from the free surfaces, i.e., that ''dimples'' were formed when individual GZO columns widening toward the free surface detached from the coating. Such gradually widening columns are often found above substrate/bond-coat asperities (see, e.g., Fig. 1 ). However, it took several hundreds of laser-rig cycles before ''dimples'' started to develop. Following mechanism of ''dimple'' formation was therefore proposed-oxides growing faster around the bond-coat asperities due to easier access of oxygen started to push the columns out from the coating. Pushing was alleviated by the shape of the columns widening toward the surface, which were not supported by interlocking with the surrounding columns. This created interfacial failure below the columns which mitigated heat removal from the topcoat and led to formation of hot-spots. Formation of such miniature hot-spots was indeed observed at the beginning of late laser-rig heating cycles and induced additional stresses and signalized imminent column detachment. After the column was detached, coating partially lost its protective function, which further promoted oxidation of material below the dimple due to elevated temperature and easier interaction with the surrounding environment.",

Moreover, the heating/cooling rates and dwell times of both thermal cycle tests tend to be significantly different. Consequently, the similarities observed in this work between TCF and laser-rig results are very interesting and are not very common. In spite of that, it is not the objective of this work to analyze in details why these similarities occurred.

Thermal cycling was based on repeated exposition of samples to periods of rapid heating, dwell at high temperature (TCF-60 min @ 1100\u00b0C, LR-5 min @ * 1530\u00b0C) and rapid cooling (TCF-10 min, LR-2 min). Both isothermal TCF test and gradient laser-rig test thus exposed coatings to demanding combination of (very) high temperature and thermal shocks which eventually led to coating failure accompanied with observable changes in the coatings microstructure, namely change of phase composition, sintering, and interdiffusion. \u2022 Coatings failure was observed after 800-850 TCF cycles (totaling thermal exposure to 800-850 h @ 1100\u00b0C) and 863 ? laser-rig cycles (totaling * 72 h @ * 1530\u00b0C). No statistically significant differences were observed between both coatings. In other words, Fig. 11 Coating failure at the bottom of the laser-rig crater. Arrows denote GZO residues on residues of TC1 YSZ Fig. 12 Cracking of the coating above the bond-coat in the areas adjacent to the laser-rig crater laser-rig test (namely maximum surface temperature, presence of thermal gradient, and heating/cooling rates during thermal shocks), both coatings exhibited in both tests similar failure. Bond-coat showed heavy internal oxidation, but coatings primarily failed due to horizontal cracking above the bond-coat, typically at TGO/ YSZ or YSZ/GZO interfaces, or within YSZ interlayer. Merging of gradually forming cavities eventually led to top-coat spallation and large-scale delamination. \u2022 It is hypothesized that the similitudes observed in the performance ranking and failure of these TBCs via TCF and laser-rig were influenced by these following factors that occurred in this study: (i) comparable temperature levels of the coatings and substrates, (ii) similar thicknesses of the TBCs, and (iii) near the same TBC/substrate thermal gradients. \u2022 During the late laser-rig test, both TBCs developed several miniature hot-spots which preceded detachment of individual GZO columns, thus exposing underlying sublayers. It should be noted that in laser-rig test, TBC surface temperature (* 1530\u00b0C) was higher than melting point of NiCrAlY (* 1400\u00b0C). Nevertheless, no bond-coat melting was observed which confirms that both TBCs retained their thermal insulation function until the end of the test.",
