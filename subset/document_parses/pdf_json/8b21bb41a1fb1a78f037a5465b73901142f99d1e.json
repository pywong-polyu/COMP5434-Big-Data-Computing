However, these data are likely an under-representation of the true pediatric infection burden as initial reports occurred in the setting of school closures and shelter-in-place orders. As the US economy reopens, a dramatic increase of cases has occurred in several states. Recent studies have shown that children may be both as likely to become infected as adults and to infect others, but are less likely to have symptoms, suggesting that they have the potential to be silent facilitators 2,3. A better understanding of the role children play in the chain of viral transmission is urgently needed.",

In contrast, a recently published study from Switzerland found only 8% of household cases resulted from child-to-adult transmission 8 , which may be due to differences in community virus circulation during the study period and strictness in social distancing recommendations. In our study of child-to-adult transmission cases, children were symptomatic for at least 4 days prior to seeking care, the time period when they were most likely to be infectious to other household members 5,9 . There has been varied rates of household transmission reported in other countries. We found that 46.5% of household members of a SIC developed symptoms or had laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 infection.

Median length of stay for hospitalized patients was 3 (IQR 2-13) days. Overall, 144 HCs were identified among 32 households: 58 (40%) CHCs and 86 (60%) AHCs. The median household size was 4.5 (IQR 4-6.7) individuals, median number of children was 2 (IQR 1-3) and adults was 2 (IQR 2-3). Of the total number of HCs, 67 (46.5%) developed symptoms including 31 (46%) after the SIC's first symptom (11 CHC and 20 AHC) and 36 (54%) before the SIC's first symptom (14 CHC and 22 AHC). The HCs developed symptoms at a median of 4 (IQR 3-10) days after or 4 (IQR 1-11.25) days before the SICs. Of the total number of HCs, at least 29 (20%) had known SARS-CoV-2 testing. Potential occupational exposures in AHCs were identified in 14 households including COVID-19 positive co-workers (n=4), occupation as household cleaners (n=2), factory workers (n=2), food industry workers (n=3), store clerks (n=2), or attendance at school/daycare (n=1). No AHCs worked in a healthcare setting. Nineteen of 32 (59%) parents reported they would give their child a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, 8 reported they would decline immunization, and 5 reported requiring more information.
