High-resolution chest computerised tomography scans were also obtained for all patients, showing diffuse ground-glass opacity with initial consolidation areas in all cases.

The results indicated that surgical face masks prevented the transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic cases. A single interesting case report revealed that one acute COVID-19 patient with a productive cough had transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 infection to five people in one vehicle when he did not wear a face mask, although nobody was infected in a second smaller vehicle the same patient travelled in wearing a face mask. 5 More recently, Chi-Chung Cheng et al. 6 analysed the incidence of COVID-19 per million population in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with community-wide masking compared with that of non-mask-wearing countries (Spain, Italy, Germany and France). These countries were chosen because they are comparable with Hong Kong in terms of population density, healthcare system organisation and social distancing measures. The incidence of COVID-19 in Hong Kong (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower than that observed in the other countries, suggesting that community-wide mask wearing may help control SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by decreasing the emission of respiratory droplets from people with subclinical and/or symptomatic COVID-19.",

First, the sample size was small, which prevents definite conclusions being drawn regarding the effectiveness of surgical face mask use. Hence, the findings need to be replicated in larger-scale studies. In addition, at the time the study was conducted, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs was based on qualitative RT-PCR. Therefore, we were unable to evaluate whether viral load in individual patients had an impact on environmental contamination. Although unlikely, the possibility cannot be omitted that both patients in Room 2 were SARS-CoV-2-negative by the time the study was conducted. Finally, although the participants were instructed regarding the handwashing procedure and were requested to carefully report the number of times they washed their hands and used the bathroom, none of these parameters were objectively recorded.",
