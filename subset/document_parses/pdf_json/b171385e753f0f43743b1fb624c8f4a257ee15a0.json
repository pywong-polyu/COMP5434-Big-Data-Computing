The laboratory is where students gain practical experiences using techniques and instruments that are central to analytical chemistry. Many instructors also incorporate projects into the analytical chemistry laboratory where students have more autonomy in the design and execution of experiments. In project-based experiences, students need to propose hypotheses, design and execute experiments, and then interpret data to see whether conclusions can be drawn or experiments need to be redesigned and repeated.",

Another approach involves two experiments suitable for an instrumental analysis course. These involve an amperometric measurement for the analysis of glucose and fluorescence measurement for the analysis of riboflavin.

Students were also provided with a shopping list of instrumentation, materials, and reagents shown in Table 2 . Since assembling the at-home laboratory kit by the end of the first week of the term is work that students would not perform with face-to-face instruction, 10% of each student's lab grade was based on emailing a photo of their athome laboratory kit containing all of the items listed in Table 2 . The cost of the instrumentation, which was priced through an online vendor, was approximately $60. The cost of all the reagents and samples priced through a big box store was approximately $40. Since many of the reagents and kitchen supplies (e.g., lidded jars, measuring cups, and measuring spoons) are commonly found in households, the full cost of the kit was expected to be less than $100 for many students. In order to mitigate the expense of the kit and to acknowledge the remote nature of the quantitative analysis lab, students were not charged the usual $30 lab fee associated with the course. Attributes of these at-home experiments include using glassware and balances, working with real samples, preparing solutions, pipetting, and titrations.",

            "text": "It was particularly important to develop experiments for remote learning that were inexpensive, flexible, and accessible to a range of student circumstances. At-home experiments using carbonate chemistry as the theme fulfilled these requirements. None of the experiments requires a heat source (e.g., a flame, hotplate, or oven). Only a surface and sink with running water are needed, which allowed students to complete these experiments at home or in campus residences. Each experiment was introduced during lab recitation, which was conducted synchronously via Zoom. Students could access their instructor remotely via Zoom during the normally scheduled 3-h lab period, as well as office hours, to address experimental difficulties. Students were allowed to conduct these experiments asynchronously as their schedule permitted. At SOU, students purchase their own protective equipment, including safety goggles, a lab coat, and appropriate dress to wear while performing experiments and this includes at-home experiments. Two of the six experiments were written up as lab reports, and students were provided with a rubric and an exemplar of a well-written report. Students wrote down the purpose, procedure, data, calculations, and results for each of the remaining experiments and emailed copies of their notebook pages to the instructor for grading. On the whole, interactions with students were less numerous and spontaneous than with face-to-face instruction. In some cases, this led to greater turnaround times when providing feedback on experimental difficulties. However, requiring students to complete pre-lab exercises allowed the instructor to assess student's prior knowledge and address potential misunderstandings. In addition, providing clear expectations and appropriate exemplars on report writing resulted in well-written laboratory reports that were similar in quality to those in previous years.",

            "text": "In the first experiment, students calibrated their 25-mL volumetric pipet and performed significance tests (Table 1) to compare their pipet's accuracy to that of another classmate. In the second experiment, students chose an antacid, either Alka-Seltzer (sodium bicarbonate) or Tums (calcium carbonate), and reacted one antacid tablet with excess vinegar (Alka-Seltzer) or 1.0 M citric acid (Tums) to determine the carbonate content. The carbonate content is determined by comparing the difference in weight between the initial reactants and final solution after evolution of carbon dioxide. Since the mass of the carbonate salt is listed in the active ingredients of these over-the-counter medications, students treated these tablets as primary standards. The accuracy and precision of this remote lab was quite acceptable. The percent relative error in the determination of CaCO 3 in Tums ranged from 0.3 to 12% (median 7.5%), and the relative standard deviation ranged from 1 to 6% (median 2.5%). In the third experiment, students modified the prior procedure to determine the carbonate content in a consumer product (e.g., baking soda toothpaste, calcium carbonate-based toothpaste or cleanser, cat litter, calcium supplement). They had to find the safety data sheet (SDS) for their product to estimate the carbonate content. They also had to calculate the sample size and volume of 1.0 M citric acid to ensure that at least 1.00 g of carbon dioxide was lost per trial.",

            "text": "The last three experiments involved the assay of a secondary standard (washing soda), which was then used as a titrant in two acid-base titrations. For example, the sodium carbonate purity in the SDS for Arm and Hammer Super Washing Soda [1] is 88% (w/w) because of waters of hydration. Students determined the purity of their washing soda by volatilization gravimetry. In the next experiment, students determined the pK a1 of ascorbic acid and its mass in a vitamin C tablet. The washing soda was used to prepare 0.20 M sodium carbonate titrant. Approximately 0.5 mL increments of titrant were added from a 35-mL plastic syringe, and an inexpensive pH meter was used to measure solution pH throughout the titration. Students then determined the titrant density using their 25-mL volumetric pipet, so the mass of each titrant addition could be converted to an accurate volume. Despite the use of a weak base as the titrant, the titration curve generated in this experiment (see ESM) can be used to determine the pK a1 of ascorbic acid, which is 4.17. Student pK a1 values ranged from 4.14 to 4.52, although the relative error for the mass of vitamin C ranged from 14 to 43%. Students also generated a firstderivative plot of their titration curve to more precisely determine the equivalence point volume. The final experiment, which was adapted from a hands-on remote lab posted on the Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL) website [2] involved the determination of potassium bitartrate solubility. Students prepared a saturated solution of Cream of Tartar 2 days ahead of the titration experiment. After decanting or filtering the saturated solution, 25 mL aliquots were titrated with 0.10 M Na 2 CO 3 . A curcumin indicator, which changes color from yellow to red-orange at pH 8, was used to observe the endpoint. Curcumin was prepared by extraction from powdered turmeric using 70% isopropyl alcohol.",

            "text": "In light of the COVID-19 pandemic this fall, two hands-on, remote-flexible laboratory experiments were implemented in Instrumental Analysis at Creighton University. One involved the analysis of glucose using amperometry, and the other an analysis of riboflavin using fluorescence spectroscopy. Both experiments are inexpensive, compact, and therefore portable. Both use standard household samples, making the chemistry amenable for at-home analysis. The two experiments were first utilized in a standard round-robin laboratory format with relatively little inquiry. They also served as the foundation for less structured, multi-week, inquiry-based group projects focused on method development. The laboratory classes were taught mainly in person. However, these two experiments' portability and remote flexibility were essential when students were isolated due to quarantine and isolation restrictions. In all, 7 out of 27 students needed to complete at least one experiment remotely. Experiences with these two experiments when implemented in hands-on, remote laboratory learning are described here. Learning outcomes of the experiments are given in the ESM. An at-home experiment for determining glucose in beverages using a commercial glucometer was developed. This experiment was adapted from a report that used blood-glucose test strips for introducing enzyme electrodes and modern biosensors to undergraduate students [3] . An overview and background information on amperometric blood-glucose meters and test strips are provided on the ASDL website [4] . Table 3 provides a list of materials needed for the experiment. A student handout, approximate costs of materials, instructor guidelines, and evaluation guidelines are provided in the ESM.",

At Southwestern University, CUREs are integrated into the curriculum through a series of upper-level laboratory courses in different chemistry sub-disciplines. For example, students in the Advanced Laboratory in Analytical Chemistry course typically complete a semester-long research project that introduces them to analytical methodology and instrumentation, basic statistical analysis, and techniques of sample preparation, extraction, and calibration. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Southwestern University moved all laboratory courses primarily to remote instruction this fall. When transitioning the analytical lab course fully online, it was important to provide students with hands-on experiences while also maintaining the learning outcomes associated with an in-person CURE to the greatest extent possible. In particular, the goal was to develop a student-driven \"authentic inquiry\" project [11] in which students worked cooperatively in small groups to propose a novel research question; identify and conduct analytical experiments to answer that question; determine appropriate statistical analyses for their experimentally collected data; contextualize their results within the broader scientific literature; and present their findings in oral and written formats.",

Building the spectrometers was a guided inquiry activity [11] with students required to have some common elements in their instrumental design, such as a 1-cm polystyrene cuvette as the sample holder and a smartphone paired with the ImageJ software [15] for data collection and processing (the student handout for this activity is provided in the ESM). However, students were encouraged to experiment with optimizing other components, such as their light source and housing, which led to considerable variation in spectrometer design among students in the course. These spectrometers provided students with inexpensive and durable instruments to measure absorbance values at home and were central to the research projects that were carried out later in the semester. In preparation for their research projects, students also characterized their individual smartphone spectrometers by analyzing figures of merit such as the linear dynamic range, sensitivity, and detection limit of a food dye. Additionally, they conducted two open inquiry experiments [11] to determine the concentrations of food dyes (both individually and as a mixture) found in candy straws and a bottled sports beverage. These lab activities, which were completed synchronously by students working in assigned groups within online breakout rooms, gave students practice collaboratively designing experiments while also providing them with opportunities to optimize their smartphone spectrometers and address differences that arose in their results due to variations in spectrometer design. To support these experiments, students were provided with a take-home laboratory kit [16] which included consumables (such as gloves and plastic cuvettes), beakers, a volumetric flask, a 10-mg balance, a 100-\u03bcL mini-pipette and 10-mL graduated volumetric pipette, food dye standards, and candy and beverage samples (further details about the equipment boxes are provided in the ESM).",

Final proposals included an overview of the system of study, a research hypothesis, the gap in the literature that the study addresses, a detailed summary of the research plan, and a list of supplies, if needed. Following submission of the proposals, the instructor met with groups again to discuss their proposed experiments and finalize details for distributing samples, analytical standards, and reagents to group members. This entire process was scheduled early in the semester to allow sufficient time to order project supplies and make them available for students to pick up at a designated campus location or to send via mail to students who were fully remote. Students had 3 weeks to complete their experiments, and each group submitted a final journal-style manuscript based on their results. Additionally, oral online presentations occurred during the last lab session of the semester, providing groups with an opportunity to explain their research results to others in the class as well as answer questions about their projects (handouts for each of these course assignments are provided in the ESM).",

Although these research studies were much smaller in scope than the ones that students complete in the lab course during a typical semester, the online projects accomplished the same overall learning goals while solidifying student understanding of analytical concepts such as extraction, calibration, and statistical analysis. Additionally, the scaffolding activities that were developed for the online lab this semester better prepared students to design their own research projects, and many of these activities will be integrated into the course following the pandemic.",
