            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immense impact on the health care system, worldwide. There is an increased need for new intervention strategies or for possibilities to identify individuals at risk. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with an exacerbated host response in patients with severe COVID-19. Neutrophils are known to infiltrate into the infected lung during SARS-CoV-2 infections [1] . Severe COVID-19 is shown to be associated with dysfunctional mature neutrophils that massively release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [2, 3] . NETs consist of a DNA backbone decorated with several antimicrobial components that serve to entrap and kill various pathogens [4] . The host itself is known to produce dornases (DNases) to recycle NET-structures and to avoid tissue-damaging effects of NETs during infectious or noninfectious diseases [5] [6] [7] . However, in the case of an overwhelming release of NETs, they contribute to thrombosis [8, 9] , autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematous [10] , acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [11] , and other diseases [12] . In COVID-19 patients, NETs have been shown to contribute to immunothrombosis in ARDS and vascular occlusions [13, 14] . Several authors have demonstrated that plasma levels of NET markers were elevated in patients with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls [15, 16] . Furthermore, amount of NET-marker level have been associated with respiratory support requirement and short-term mortality and declined to level found in healthy individuals 4 months post-infection [17] . An association between circulating markers of NET-formation and clinical outcome was observed, demonstrating a potential role of NET markers in clinical decision-making [17] .",

Besides a massive induction of NET-formation in the SARS-CoV-2-infected host, a noneffective or deficient host nuclease activity to efficiently degrade NETs might also contribute to COVID-19. The aim of our study was to quantify the level of NET markers and DNase activity in a cohort of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls to evaluate if reduced or blocked DNase activity might be a risk factor for COVID-19 with focus on elderly patients and sex differences.",

            "text": "As shown in Figure 1 , human blood-derived neutrophils release NETs in response to SARS-CoV-2, consisting of DNA-histone-1 complexes and neutrophil elastase (shown in Fig. 1a) with a thickness of up to 14 \u03bcm (shown in Fig. 1b) . These data confirm previously published data [26, 27] . Our data presented in Figure 2 confirm increased NET markers in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. As NETs consist of DNA, the amount of free eDNA was evaluated by a Pico Green assay in the plasma/serum. A tendency for more eDNA was detectable in male compared to female patients (shown in Fig. 2b) . Hereby, it needs to be considered that eDNA in serum might originate from sources other than neutrophils [28, 29] . However, Figure 2c -e shows that eDNA correlates with the number of neutrophils, strongly supporting that it might mainly derive from neutrophils. In accordance with these data, also the nucleosome level as an additional NET marker besides eDNA [30] was significantly increased in CO-VID-19 patients, with highly significant alterations seen for male patients (p < 0.01) (shown in Fig. 2g) . Again, nucleosome values correlate with neutrophil numbers (shown in Fig. 2h-j) . A limitation regarding the comparison of NET markers between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients is that the analysis was performed with serum from controls and plasma from patients. In online supplementary Figure 1 , we, therefore, show control data from measurements of NET markers in plasma and serum of three COVID-19 patients, indicating that measurement of NET markers in plasma and serum yield similar results. Only the graph with nucleosome data (in online suppl. Fig. 1) shows a clear tendency for higher nucleosome levels in serum. Since measurements of nucleosome levels in plasma may underestimate the level in serum, the difference in nucleosome levels between controls and COVID-19 patients may, in fact, be even greater. This goes in parallel with a recent study that investigated two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients from Belgium and Germany and detected that circulating nucleosomes may serve as potential marker to monitor COVID-19 progression [31] .",

Furthermore, areas with signals for MPO and DNA/histone-1 complexes in proximity were observed inside the alveolar septa of the lung from the COVID-19 patient. High-resolution imaging shows that NET-releasing neutrophils are positive for MPO inside the nucleus confirmed by a co-localization of DAPI signal (blue) and MPO (red), resulting in white staining (shown in Fig. 3b ). This is a typical feature shown by NET-releasing neutrophils that undergo NETosis.

These data indicate that elderly male patients have an impaired DNase activity and, subsequently, an impaired ability to get rid of NETs during infection. This explains the higher NET-marker values in male patients seen in Figure 2 . It is quite important to consider that NETs are still excessively formed in severe COVID-19 patients despite the presence of increased DNase activity seen in this cohort. These data indicate that the host DNase is not able to efficiently degrade and eliminate NETs completely during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as also seen for other infections e.g., Streptococcus suis meningitis [37] .

Furthermore, positive correlations with the D-Dimer level and DNase activity (online suppl. Fig. 2 ) were observed again in male CO-VID-19 patients, indicating a potential additional role of LL-37 in the risk of NET-associated thrombosis of male COVID-19 patients by stabilizing NETs against DNase degradation. As it is known from literature that TT blocks LL-37 expression, male patients with low TT show higher LL-37 expression [41] . Interestingly, low serum levels of TT are speculated to predispose men, especially elderly men, to poor prognosis or death during COVID-19 [42] . In line with these aforementioned publications, a significantly higher LL-37 level was detected in the male CO-VID-19 cohort with a low TT level (Fig. 6m) , leading to the hypothesis that a high LL-37 level besides low DNase activity may be an additional risk factors in COVID-19 patients when stabilizing massive NET-formation in the infected host (Fig. 6n) .",
