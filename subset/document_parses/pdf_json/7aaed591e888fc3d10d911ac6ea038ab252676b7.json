Aim: To examine the importance of video visits for the treatment of male sexual medicine at our academic center during the period of peak telemedicine use in April 2020. Methods: We collected and compared deidentified data from all nonprocedure, adult outpatient encounters conducted as either office visits in April 2019 (n = 1,949) or video visits in April 2020 (n = 608). The primary International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10) labeled as diagnoses from all encounters were collected, with most encounters linked to several disease codes (n = 4,584). Demographic data were also collected. We performed comparative analyses on Stata (College Station, TX, USA) with significance set at a = .05. Main Outcome Measures: Disease codes were categorized based on their use and classification in urological care and the proportion that each category made up within the outpatient practice was calculated. Results: In comparison to the office visits, which took place in April 2019, male sexual medicine visits in April 2020, during the peak of telemedicine use, made up a significantly larger overall share of our practice (P = .012), defined by relative rises in encounters pertaining to male hypogonadism, infertility, penile abnormalities, and testicular abnormalities. Outpatients seen over video visits were also younger than outpatients seen during the previous year over office visits (58.9 vs 60.8, P = .008). Further, race and ethnicity characteristics in the outpatient population were unaffected during the period of telemedicine use. Conclusions: During the period of historically high telemedicine use following the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, encounters associated with male sexual medicine made up a significantly larger portion of our outpatient practice. Although the full influence of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be delineated, our findings suggest telemedicine use is compatible with the field of sexual medicine.",

            "text": "Accordingly, the role of telemedicine in the field of urology has expanded dramatically in recent months. A 2020 cross-sectional analysis found the use of telemedicine in clinical urology practices across the globe has nearly tripled during the pandemic. 5 The European Association of Urology now advocates for the formalization of telemedicine into the field of clinical urology, citing reduced healthcare costs, improved face-to-face time, and greater satisfaction for both providers and their patients. 6 Remote care has proven to be safe and effective throughout the pandemic for the treatment of prostate cancer, urinary incontinence, urinary stones, and urinary tract infections. 7 Despite the recent surge in telemedicine, very little has been documented regarding the use of remote visits for the care and treatment of sexual medicine patients. 8 A 2020 meta-analysis identified only 2 published studies (Leusnik et al, 2006 , Van Lankveld et al, 2009 ) investigating the application of telemedicine for sexual dysfunction, the findings of which strongly support the use of the remote format. 9, 10 The field of sexual medicine seems primed and well-suited for the use of telemedicine as many of the most common male sexual dysfunctions, such as erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and hypogonadism, have the potential to be safely managed via remote encounters. 11 While it is estimated that nearly 50% of men will suffer from erectile dysfunction in their lifetimes, only 1 in 4 will seek treatment, with men often citing the stigma and shame of impotence as reasons for avoiding care. 12, 13 Therefore, the objective of our study was to examine trends in the utilization of video visits for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction at our academic center during the period of peak telemedicine use in April 2020. We aimed to answer how the rapid adoption of telemedicine affected patient composition and diagnoses seen by our urology department amid a pandemic.",

Data were gathered for all adult (\u226518 years) outpatient encounters during the months of April 2019 and April 2020 (n = 3,601). The study was approved by our center's Institutional Review Board (IRB00251253). All encounters during April 2019 and 2020 were categorized based on EMR coding as occurring via a remote, telemedicine video visit or as a traditional, in-person office visit. Office visits that were deemed ineligible to be translated to a remote format (ie, outpatient procedures, cystoscopy) were tagged and excluded from comparative analyses (n = 743). From the remaining eligible encounters, 2 groups were constructed: unique patients seen via in-person, office visits conducted during April 2019 (n = 1,949) and those seen by video visits during April 2020 (n = 608).",

The primary International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10) labeled as diagnoses from all encounters during these 2 study periods were collected, with many encounters linked to one or more disease codes (n = 4,584). After collection, these disease codes were categorized based on their use and classification in urological care. The categorization of sexual medicine use was aided by the aspects of care identified in Dooley et al, 2020 and Novara et al, 2020. 7, 11 Relevant disease codes included erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, pyronine's disease/ penile abnormalities, hypogonadism, low libido, and others (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 ). Using the prevalence of various diseases codes in office visits and video visits, the proportion, or share, that each category made up within the outpatient clinic was assessed.",

Our findings provide evidence that the compulsory rise of telemedicine in April 2020 came with a significant shift in the makeup of our outpatient practice; while some aspects of clinical urology shrank in terms of their proportion of the practice, male sexual medicine rose significantly. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 caused unprecedented interruptions in patient care, and despite a rapid shift to telemedicine, the medical field suffered losses of care across specialties, including urology. 16 This was reflected in our study period, as our practice saw a dramatic fall in overall patient visits and a swift rise in telemedicine use, which paralleled the national trend. Nonetheless, the encounters occurring over telemedicine in our practice were constituted by a substantially higher share of sexual medicine visits.",

            "text": "Recent literature suggests the use of telemedicine has been reliable, safe, time-efficient, and cost-effective in the setting of clinical urology during the COVID-19 era. 7, 17, 18 Even prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, the compatibility of telemedicine in the field of male sexual health had become apparent. Popular Direct-to-Consumer websites, such as \"Hims\" and \"Roman,\" saw their web traffic increase by 1,688% between 2017 and 2019, perhaps representing the paradigm shift already occurring in sexual medicine. 19 Telemedicine provides men with the opportunity to discuss extremely personal and often stigmatized health issues, such as impotence and infertility, from the security and discretion of their own homes. 20 The rise of remote platforms for the treatment of male sexual health emphasizes the competitive advantage and outreach telemedicine stands to offer to practitioners who can safely and effectively adopt these new modalities. 11 Concerns have been raised regarding these \"pill-mills\" 20 and the ability of Direct-to-Consumer platforms to safely treat patients, such as men with erectile dysfunction, who are at a substantially higher risk for comorbid conditions (ie, cardiovascular disease) that are indications for referral to outside specialists. 19, 21 The superior ability of primary care physicians and urologists to treat, diagnose, and if needed refer their patients via telemedicine could improve patient safety amidst the rapidly evolving landscape of remote care. Nonetheless, we must also recognize the potential shortcomings of telemedicine. Lack of data protection, lapses in patient confidentiality, and clear physical barriers to a full clinical assessment are all emerging issues that must be addressed in the years to come for this promising modality to be maintained in clinical practice. 6, 22 Although the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be adequately delineated in our findings, the study period we chose, albeit tumultuous, may offer insights into the new zeitgeist in medicine that is developing. Remote care has the ability to address limitations in mobility, reduce unnecessary visits to the clinic, and improve overall access to care. 22 While the COVID-19 pandemic may soon become the past, its effects on healthcare delivery are believed to be enduring. 6, 17, 20 ",

A recent digital equity survey found that 25\u221230% of internet users who are limited in English proficiency, older than 65, or had an annual income of less than US $25,000 lack the basic digital literacy needed to send an email, fill out an online form, or even search for information. 24 These disparities are particularly concerning in the scope of sexual medicine; for example, men with erectile dysfunction who are older than 65 are most likely to be affected, yet least likely to seek treatment. 12 While telemedicine offers the potential to improve healthcare access and costs, arduous effort must be taken in its adoption to assure health equity is not diminished. For example, academic centers in the United States have recently developed initiatives designed to improve appropriate utilization of telemedicine by providers and assure patients may access video platforms prior to scheduled encounters. Such programs include telemedicine workflow sheets for physicians, web-based video tutorials, and outreach programs to elderly patients. 25 Limitations As stated previously, limitations of our study included its adjacency to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study period was selected in order to observe peak utilization of telemedicine in our practice, although we must acknowledge that this period limits the external validity of our study. Further, as our study was conducted during a period of rapid telemedicine expansion in our department, the preferences of our urologists, such as how quickly they adopted the new medium, cannot be adequately captured in our study. We hope that our future investigations are conducted in collaboration with multiple academic centers, with study periods that may be established in a setting unaffected by the ongoing national emergency.",
