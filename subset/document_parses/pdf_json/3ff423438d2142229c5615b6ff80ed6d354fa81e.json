After culture at the appropriate temperature (see Note 1) employing permanent shaking, a 500 \u03bcl probe of each sample is drawn the next morning or 48 h after picking the colonies, and stored for few hours at 4 \u00b0C during isolation of plasmid DNA using standard procedures for DNA preparation from small culture volumes.7. The isolated DNA is analyzed by treatment with appropriate restriction enzymes (e.g., HindIII for Edmonston B-derived MV).8. Probes of clones displaying the expected DNA pattern after agarose gel electrophoresis are used to inoculate 200 mL LB medium, each containing the respective selection antibiotic. 24 or 48 h after inoculation (the bacteria optimally being still in the logarithmic growth phase), bacteria are pelleted and plasmid DNA is isolated using standard procedures for DNA isolation from medium sized bacterial cultures.9. After checking the integrity and identity of the isolated plasmid DNA by enzymatic restriction nuclease treatment and agarose gel electrophoresis, the genome plasmids now containing the modified MV genomes are ready for the rescue of recombinant viruses.At least three protocols for the rescue of recombinant measles virus are available[5,45,46] (see Note 5), which differ mainly in the cell lines, plasmids, as well as the transfection protocol used for the transfection of recombinant MV DNA into the rescue cell line.
