They need to be equipped with novel tools, applications, and resources-that have emerged during the pandemic-to gain access to breakthrough findings; know the latest developments; and to address their specific needs for rapid data acquisition, analysis, evaluation, and reporting. Because of the complex nature of the virus, healthcare systems worldwide are severely impacted as the treatment and the vaccine for COVID-19 disease are not yet discovered. This leads to frequent changes in regulations and policies by governments and international organizations. Our analysis suggests that given the abundance of information sources, finding the most suitable application for analysis, evaluation, or reporting, is one of such challenges. However, health professionals and policy-makers need access to the most relevant, reliable, trusted, and latest information and applications that can be used in their day-to-day tasks of COVID-19 research and analysis. In this article, we present our analysis of various novel and important web-based applications that have been specifically developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and that can be used by the health professionals community to help in advancing their analysis and research. These applications comprise search portals and their associated information repositories for literature and clinical trials, data sources, tracking dashboards, and forecasting models. We present a list of the minimally essential online, web-based applications to serve a multitude of purposes, from hundreds of those developed since the beginning of the pandemic. A critical analysis is provided for the selected applications based on 17 features that can be useful for researchers and analysts for their evaluations. These features make up our evaluation framework and have not been used previously for analysis and evaluation. Therefore, knowledge of these applications will not only increase productivity but will also allow us to explore new dimensions for using existing applications with more control, better management, and greater outcome of their research. In addition, the features used in our framework can be applied for future evaluations of similar applications and health professionals can adapt them for evaluation of other applications not covered in this analysis.",

Governmental and non-governmental organizations as well as health professionals, scientists, researchers, analysts, statisticians, decision-makers-belonging to any field-are working closely on various aspects of this pandemic. The abundance of information portals, search engines, scholarly databases, and repositories make the right and suitable sources indistinguishable from the irrelevant and incorrect ones. As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in an early situation report [1], the rapid global spread of COVID-19 has been accompanied by a \"massive infodemic\", i.e., an overabundance of information-some accurate and some not-that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. It can cost lives of people as everyone's safety is at stake and people do not hesitate in believing anything they receive on social media or looking for online solutions to their worries.",

As such, there has been an increase in the registration of webpages relating to the Coronavirus and NCSC has identified a list of over 300 domains that are using the terms \"COVID-19\" or \"coronavirus\" in their website address. According to TechRepublic, nearly 2000 malicious COVID-19-themed domains are created every day and more than 86,600 new domains related to the pandemic are considered \"risky\" or \"malicious\" (https://www.techrepublic.com/article/nearly-2000-malicious-COVID-19themed-domains-created-every-day/). According to Clarivate analytics, domain registrations related to the pandemic have surpassed 100,000 since 1 January 2020 and the largest surge occurred in the week following the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March (https: //clarivate.com/markmonitor/blog/COVID-19-domains-whats-going-on/). It is also estimated that Coronavirus-themed domains are 50% more likely to be malicious than other domains (https://bit. ly/35fsRcO) (shortened URL). This calls for identifying the legitimate, reliable, useful, and technically correct sources of information that can be readily used by those whose work and decisions have an impact on other people's lives.",

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 crisis, is constantly evolving and understanding the trends in its evolution is fundamental to control the pandemic. In decoding the nature of the virus, there have been unprecedented sequencing efforts, so far, producing over 100,000 genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] . However, it is not only the SAR-CoV-2 genetic sequencing, the scientists and researchers are trying to figure out the comorbidities, the long-term effects of the illness and subsequent recovery, its transmission and control, among various other aspects on public health.

To cater for their own needs as well as to help fellow community members in the research, exploration, analysis, evaluation, and reporting tasks, the authors utilized their information technology skills to identify specialized resources appropriate for the given tasks. As computers and information technology are indispensable part of modern research, particularly in health research [4, 5] , it was imperative to look for computer applications developed specifically for COVID-19. At the same time, we did not want to explore niche applications suitable for a segment of the population. Thus, instead of searching for desktop or mobile-phone applications, we preferred to identify those applications that are openly accessible from anywhere, by anyone, at any time. Given the ubiquity of the Internet and the Web browsers, we focused on Web-applications for COVID-19. These Web applications (sometimes known as Web apps) are advanced websites with focus on specific functions and involving specific databases to work with. The web-based applications that we have searched and selected are different than and superior to ordinary websites as they have a complex architecture consisting of databases, server-side scripting or programming languages, business or functional logic [6] , and information organization that has been specifically created for COVID-19.",

The repositories are constantly updated with new lists, packages, data, applications, and programming tools on a daily basis. The repositories are organized by popularity (number of stars given by users on GitHub), number of updates made by the maintainer, or according to the time of recent update. As such curated lists are general purpose and categorized by various themes, they are well suited for general surveying by anyone exploring the pandemic; however, as they are not designed with specific goals in mind, they turn out to be an overwhelming exploration of a sea of information for a researcher who is interested in interdisciplinary work to find the most suitable resource for a given task.

This lack of access to specialized information can be seen in various efforts specific to COVID-19. Tableau, the company behind one of the widely-used applications for data visualization, mentions that more than 27,000 visualizations (https://public. tableau.com/en-us/s/COVID-19-viz-gallery) have been published across the world pertaining to COVID-19. However, due to the categorization of these visualizations into broader areas (government, healthcare and public health, economy and business), finding a visualization of interest through their search mechanism is akin to finding a needle in the haystack. The categories are not sorted in any order and the site does not provide any means for searching or filtering through these visualizations. Thus, how can a researcher belonging to a field of research identify the most relevant of these portals that can be useful in his research?

For our objective of identifying a variety of COVID-19 research and analysis applications for health professionals, searching through literature would only mean identifying research-based efforts. However, research commercialization and the race of creating better and useful products [22] has resulted in the era of Research and Development (R&D) where startups and innovative firms with focused products are innovating more than the giant players of the domain [23, 24] . Thus, in addition to the literature databases for identification of such applications, we also explored open research-based repositories, search engines and social media in search of any developments in COVID-19. Figure 1 illustrates our methodology. Instead of searching through time-tested and established literary data sources that would search in their general databases of articles, we used search portals specifically developed for tracking COVID-19-related peer-reviewed articles, letters, commentaries, opinions, pre-prints, and case studies. Such portals have emerged as meta search engines that combine several databases in a single location. The NIH COVID-19 portfolio (https://icite.od.nih.gov/covid19/ search/) is one of such meta search engines that pulls data from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, medRxiv, Research Square, and SSRN. Therefore, searching through the NIH portal is preferred than searching through each of the referenced databases as the duplicates are also taken care of. An advantage of searching through specialized portals is that the researcher does not have to include terms like \"COVID-19\" or \"coronavirus\". Using the query operators and filters of the NIH COVID-19 portal (see Section 5.1.2), we mainly searched for articles containing variations on following term combinations: \"dashboard\", \"visualization\", \"analysis tools\", \"data exploration\", \"question answer\", \"natural language processing\", \"information retrieval\", \"sentiment analysis\", \"epidemiological\", \"forecasting\", \"model\", and \"projection\". The search was carried out only on title and abstract of the articles to obtain only those articles that have major portions or contributions related to these terms. The results of these queries were exported as CSV files and then filtered using Python language, removing duplicates, leaving us with 876 articles at the end. The abstracts of these articles were then screened, and 53 articles were retained at the end.",

To help policy-makers understand how different policy decisions could affect the trajectory of the pandemic in their location, they developed three different scenarios. The current projections are based on current mandates (closing of educational facilities, non-essential businesses, ban on large gatherings, and mandatory mask usage), the mandates easing scenario projections are based on changes in the mandates, and the universal mask scenario assumes 95% mask usage with the current mandates. Thus, the projections can be adapted for different scenarios.",

All these applications return results on some user query, but the flexibility in search, filtering, and result analysis differ thanks to the advancement in NLP techniques and their applications in COVID-19 research, e.g., drugs recommendations [52] , semantic textual similarity of COVID-19 texts [53] , tracking positive CT imaging features of respiratory illness [54] , and so on. As such, a researcher may like to use these applications in parallel and analyze the results collectively.

The authors have made available the collected data for general benefit and use in a Github repository that can be used as a guideline by anyone interested in evaluating a new application. The data sheet (uploaded as a comma-separated values file) also contains additional details with some features not included in this article by virtue of the brevity of presentation. Interested readers may be directed to consult the repository. We deliberately chose generic features applicable to a broad range of applications.

In this article, we described a criteria-based framework consisting of 17 features for evaluation of the applications needed by the health professionals in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The variety of applications we consider for evaluation cover different stages of research and analysis such as understanding the scientific progress; analyzing latest research articles; exploring the emerging topics and trends; visualizing the relation between symptoms, drugs, and pathogens through semantic word clouds; and obtaining and analyzing the latest decoded genetic sequences related to the SARS-COV-2 virus. Our framework, currently consisting of generic features, can be extended with area-specific guidelines and features. In the future, the authors intend to apply machine learning and natural language processing techniques that can automate the evaluation process to a large extent. An automated application will be developed that can be used by independent researchers to evaluate any application using custom features.",
