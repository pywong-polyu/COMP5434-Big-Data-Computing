It describes the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious person through time. To date, R e estimates are based on clinical data such as observed cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths. These estimates are temporarily biased when clinical testing or reporting strategies change. OBJECTIVES: We show that the dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater can be used to estimate R e in near real time, independent of clinical data and without the associated biases. METHODS: We collected longitudinal measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Zurich, Switzerland, and San Jose, California, USA. We combined this data with information on the temporal dynamics of shedding (the shedding load distribution) to estimate a time series proportional to the daily COVID-19 infection incidence. We estimated a wastewater-based R e from this incidence. RESULTS: The method to estimate R e from wastewater worked robustly on data from two different countries and two wastewater matrices. The resulting estimates were as similar to the R e estimates from case report data as R e estimates based on observed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are among each other. We further provide details on the effect of sampling frequency and the shedding load distribution on the ability to infer R e . DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first time R e has been estimated from wastewater. This method provides a low-cost, rapid, and independent way to inform SARS-CoV-2 monitoring during the ongoing pandemic and is applicable to future wastewater-based epidemiology targeting other pathogens. https://doi.",

            "text": "A critical quantity to monitor an ongoing epidemic is the effective reproductive number (R e ). 1-4 R e describes the time-varying average number of new infections caused by a single infectious person throughout the course of their infection. Typically, R e is estimated from case report data (hereafter referred to as R cc ), including the numbers of new clinical cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. 1, [3] [4] [5] Here, we hypothesized that viral RNA concentrations measured in wastewater can also be used to estimate R e (hereafter referred to as R ww ). This independent data set complements existing R cc estimates to provide a more complete picture of transmission dynamics. R e estimates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are used to inform regional and national policies. 6, 7 The R e changes through time and reflects changes in the immune status of the population, policy, climate, and/or individual behaviors. 1, 2 It can thus be used to estimate the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions in disease control. 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] However, R cc estimates have some notable drawbacks. The most important aspect is that they depend on robust and accurate clinical case surveillance and reporting. Temporal changes in testing capacity, hospitalization criteria, or the definition of COVID-19related deaths can bias the R cc estimates. 1, 12 These estimates are also inferred with a delay: R cc is estimable once the infections occurring on that day tested positive and were reported as clinical cases. 1, 2 The distribution of infection to reporting delays is necessary to accurately infer R cc , yet differs through time and space, thus complicating the simultaneous computation of R cc across geographic regions. Wastewater data may provide an advantage over clinical case data in all these aspects.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements in wastewater can be used to understand COVID-19 epidemiology because infected individuals shed the virus into the sewer system throughout their infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been repeatedly detected in wastewater and sewage sludge globally, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and measured RNA concentrations or loads correlate with clinical case data. [13] [14] [15] 17 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater implies that there is at least one actively shedding infected person in the catchment served by the sewer system. In comparison with clinical testing, substantially fewer wastewater samples are required to track changes in infection incidence at the community level. 20 Wastewater data have also been integrated into compartmental models of infectious disease transmission, allowing estimation of epidemiological parameters, including incidence and the basic reproductive number R 0 (which corresponds to the R e in a fully susceptible population at the start of an outbreak). 21, 22 These model results are frequently validated against clinical case data, and the good correspondence between both supports the use of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements in wastewater to inform disease transmission dynamics. In addition, there are indications that the wastewater may track transmission dynamics more truthfully than cases, especially when test positivity is high. 23 Models relating SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater to incidence or transmission rates are driven by assumptions of virus excretion rates into the sewer system. Excretion (whether via feces, saliva, or sputum) varies by individual and through time after infection. Generally, virus excretion can be described using a shedding load profile, which captures both the temporal dynamics of shedding [in the shedding load distribution (SLD)], and the total amount of virus shed by an infected individual. Clinical studies in various settings have measured shedding from symptom onset onward. Notable examples include W\u00f6lfel et al., who measured virus concentrations in the stool of hospitalized patients 22, 24 and Han et al., who included symptomatic and asymptomatic children. 25 Benefield et al. combined such studies into a systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. 26 However, little is known about shedding prior to symptom onset. Given uncertainty and variation in estimates of SLDs, modeling approaches to relate wastewater to transmission have varied. For example, Kaplan et al. used an infectivity profile (based on virus concentrations in the upper and lower respiratory tract from Li et al. 26 ) rather than information on gastrointestinal shedding to estimate the basic reproductive number R 0 from wastewater data. 21, 27 More work is needed to determine both the SLD and the amount of virus shed during an infection to relate SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements in wastewater to epidemiology.",

Longitudinal samples of raw wastewater influent from Zurich and primary sludge from San Jose were collected over several weeks from late 2020 through early 2021. Samples were concentrated, viral RNA was extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA markers as well as pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA were quantified in each extract. PMMoV is a plant virus that is found in wastewater at high concentrations and in fairly constant loads and serves to detect anomalies in the collected sample or problems during concentration and extraction. 28 Sample collection and processing. Zurich approach. From 03 September 2020 to 19 January 2021, 24-h flow-proportional composite samples of raw influent (after fine screening) were collected from the Werdh\u00f6lzli wastewater treatment plant (Zurich). Samples were collected twice per week (Thursdays, Sundays) until October 29; afterward, samples were collected almost daily. This change occurred due to increased availability of funding and prioritization of daily sampling over replication. Samples were collected in 500-mL polystyrene or polypropylene plastic bottles, shipped on ice, and stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 8 d before processing. Samples were processed following the protocol of Fernandez-Cassi et al. 2021 . 23 Briefly, aliquots (50 mL) were stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then clarified by sequential filtration through 2-lm glass fiber prefilters (Merck) and 0:22-lm SteriCup filters (Merck). The filtrates were concentrated by centrifugation (3,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min) using centrifugal filter units (10 kDa Centricon Plus-70; Millipore), followed by concentrate collection from the inverted filter during 3 min at 1,000 \u00d7 g.",

From 15 November 2020 to 19 March 2021, 125 settled solids samples (approximately 50 mL) were collected and processed daily from the primary settling tank at the San Jose wastewater treatment plant (San Jose, California) using methods adapted from Graham et al. and described in published protocols. 15, [29] [30] [31] Briefly, 24-h composite samples were collected in clean plastic containers, immediately stored at 4\u00b0C, and transported to the lab for initial processing within 6 h of collection. The solids were dewatered by centrifugation at 24,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded. A 0.5-g aliquot of the dewatered solids was dried at 110\u00b0C for 19-24 h to determine its dry weight. Dewatered solids were resuspended in Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV)-spiked DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research), to a concentration of 75 mg=mL. This concentration of solids represented a concentration at which the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 assays was minimized based on experiments with solutions containing varying concentrations of solids 32 (see also Supplemental Material \"Managing PCR inhibition in San Jose sludge samples\" and Figure S1 ). BCoV was spiked as an external process control (1:5 lL rehydrated BCoV vaccine per milliliter of DNA/RNA shield). To homogenize samples, 5-10 5/32-in Stainless Steel Grinding Balls (OPS Diagnostics) were added to each sample before shaking with a Geno/Grinder 2010 (Spex SamplePrep). Samples were subsequently briefly centrifuged to remove air bubbles introduced during the homogenization process and then vortexed to remix the sample. Samples were either further processed immediately or stored at 4\u00b0C for processing within 7 d.",

After shedding, downstream processes further affect the total amount of viral RNA sampled per infected individual.

For the main analysis, we deconvolved by a SLD that was a combination of the incubation period (the time from infection to symptom onset) and the gastrointestinal SLD from Benefield et al. for the time from symptom onset to shedding. 26 Figure 3 from Benefield et al. 26 was digitized manually, and yielded a gamma distribution with mean 6.7 d and SD 7.0 d. 23 For the incubation period, we used the distribution of Linton et al.: a gamma distribution with mean 5.3 d and SD 3.2 d. 37 For additional comparisons, we exchanged the Benefield et al. distribution for the SLD upon symptom onset reported by Han et al. (gamma distributed with mean 4.7 d and SD 1.7 d), 25 or the symptom onset to death delay distribution from Linton et al. (gamma distributed with mean 15 d and SD 6.9 d). 37 Because the normalization factors N and M are difficult to measure and only influence R ww point estimates when off by several orders of magnitude, we made a simplifying assumption.

For the Zurich wastewater data, this was 1 \u00d7 10 12 gc per infection, and for the San Jose sewage sludge measurements this was 2,663.7 gc/g dry weight per infection per day.",

Second, we used the R package EpiEstim to estimate the R e from this infection incidence. 4, 38 The pipeline further accounts for noise in the observation process by bootstrapping the observations prior to smoothing and deconvolution. Specifically, we block-bootstrap the log-transformed residuals between the linear interpolated original observations and the smoothed value. 2 To estimate R cc for Zurich, we obtained case data from the Health Department of Canton Zurich, restricted to cases in the catchment. We then used the pipeline from Huisman et al., 2 where we deconvolved by a distribution specifying the delay from infection to case confirmation. This was parameterized as the sum of a gamma distributed incubation period with mean 5.3 d, SD 3.2 d 37 ; and a gamma distributed delay from symptom onset to case confirmation with mean 2.8 d, SD 3.0 d (estimated from line list data for Canton Zurich, September 2020-January 2021).

SARS-CoV-2 wastewater measurements reflect the cumulative contributions of all infected individuals actively shedding virus into the wastewater. The amount of virus shed by each individual varies through time after infection and is captured in the shedding load profile. In general, this profile contains information about the timing of viral shedding-the SLD, which sums to 1and the total amount of virus shed, captured by a normalization factor N. To estimate the true number of infections in the sewer shed, it is important to estimate the exact value of the normalization factor N, as well as a factor M describing losses along the way from shedding to sample processing. However, to estimate R e it suffices to know the temporal dynamics of shedding and infection (described in more detail in the \"Methods\" section). As a first approximation, we assumed individuals do not shed prior to symptom onset and thereafter shed according to the gastrointestinal SLD reported by Benefield et al. 26 With this assumption, we found that the dynamics of infection incidence inferred from wastewater measurements in Zurich are similar to the dynamics inferred from clinical case data ( Figure 1C ). In particular, both data sources show a steep increase starting from mid-September and capture two peaks (indicative of R e = 1) around late October and early December, each of which is followed by relatively rapid decline in daily case incidence. We later tested the sensitivity of our results to the assumed SLD and normalization.",

If we consider the parameters yielding a fit within 10% from the optimum, the parameter ranges found in both locations are compatible and jointly suggest an SLD with mean between 6 and 9 d, and SD between 0.5 and 3 d. Longer time series and more locations would further constrain this distribution. In comparison with the delay between infection and case reporting, the SLD introduces a similar or lower mean delay to R ww . For Zurich, the cases were delayed with respect to infection by 8.1 d on average, which is comparable to the 6-9 d for R ww . For San Jose, instead, the delay distribution of the case report data had a mean of 9.8 d. There, the wastewater may lead the confirmed cases by 1-4 d, if the current testing and reporting regime is maintained.",

However, there is a wide range in published viral shedding loads, and it is unclear which-if any-accurately capture viral shedding dynamics of people within a catchment. Virus shed in saliva, sputum, and feces are possible contributors to the total amount of virus RNA in the wastewater. 43 Although upper respiratory tract swabs show peak viral loads around the day of symptom onset, there are indications that sputum samples peak a few days later, and feces even after that. [44] [45] [46] Studies differ in the inferred timing of peak viral load (even in the same bodily fluids), and there is a general lack of information to constrain dynamics prior to symptom onset. 47 Additionally, the duration and magnitude of viral shedding seem to differ within different populations (for example, due to age or severity of disease). 48, 49 However, these individual differences will probably average out in a sufficiently large catchment, and better estimates of the SLD are likely to become available as prospective sampling studies report results.",

R cc estimates are based on only the subset of infections, hospitalizations, and/or deaths that are captured by surveillance within the health care system. If this subset changes (for instance, due to developments in testing or reporting policy), the resulting R cc estimates will be temporarily biased. 2, 4 In Geneva, Switzerland, seroprevalence studies showed that the number of infections per reported case varied substantially, from an estimated 11.6 infections per reported case as of May 2020 to only 2.7 as of December 2020. 52, 53 During that period, SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater better reflected the dynamics than the clinical cases. 23 However, R ww estimates are also prone to biases. People's behaviors, such as defecation timing outside of a daily routine 54 and/or movement into or out of the catchment 55 can influence R ww estimates, particularly when the number of infected individuals is low. RNA signals may also be impacted during sewer transport, with persistence influenced by environmental conditions (i.e., temperature) and/or sewage composition (i.e., solids content). [56] [57] [58] [59] Furthermore, sample processing required to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA may introduce variation, as suggested by substantial dayto-day variation in measurements. 13, 15, 23, 60 Finally, R ww estimates are informed by the number and proportion of infected and/or shedding people within the catchment: If there are too few active shedders, R ww may be very sensitive to the increased fluctuations in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations.",

[13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] 61 The data collected within these campaigns could be used to estimate R ww with a robust method that is not influenced by heterogeneous testing and reporting strategies, and hence the method would be more applicable across geographic areas. Additionally, R ww estimates could be derived for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants and/or other pathogens for which SLDs are known. SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Variants of Concern (VOCs), are readily detectable in wastewater [62] [63] [64] as are other pathogens (e.g., norovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A). [65] [66] [67] This could provide the temporal, quantitative wastewater measurements needed to estimate R ww . Wastewater surveillance allows estimating R ww to track disease transmission dynamics in near real time, using low-cost, rapid, and geographically comparable methods, and such surveillance can be used when reporting clinical cases is not feasible, mandatory, or much delayed in comparison with infection and shedding.",
