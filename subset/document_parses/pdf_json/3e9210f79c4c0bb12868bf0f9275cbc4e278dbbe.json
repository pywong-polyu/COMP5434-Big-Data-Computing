However, most correlational studies on mindfulness and prosociality have relied on self-report measures. The present work aimed to address this serious limitation by investigating actual prosocial behavior. We further focused on mindfulness as a multi-dimensional personality trait to disentangle effects of different mindfulness aspects. In addition, we tested whether the relation between trait mindfulness and prosocial behavior emerges under a theoretical meaningful experimental boundary condition (i.e., feelings of guilt). In two studies (using four different samples; N = 1240), we did not find support for a positive link between trait mindfulness and (a) charitable donation and (b) behavior in an incentivized economic game, respectively. Evidence for manipulated guilt-level as a moderator was inconclusive. Taken together, the findings point to a more complex role of trait mindfulness for prosocial behavior. Limitations and ideas for further research are discussed.",

            "text": "Keywords Trait mindfulness . Prosocial behavior . Five facet mindfulness questionnaire Mindfulness is currently a hot topic in psychological research as well as in many parts of the society. Besides investigating the positive effects of mindfulness interventions on mental and physical health, a growing but still substantially smaller body of psychological literature addresses interpersonal outcomes (Creswell, 2017) , especially the question whether mindfulness benefits others. Exploring its prosocial nature, mindfulness has been investigated as an intervention and a personality trait; in the present research, we focus on the latter. Results of a recent meta-analysis showed a positive relation between trait mindfulness and prosocial outcomes supporting the prosocial nature of mindfulness (Donald et al., 2019) . We argue, however, that there are some aspects that seriously limit the evidence for the claim that trait mindfulness positively relates to prosocial behavior. Primarily, most previous correlational studies relied on self-report measures. In the present study, we address this gap by testing the relation between trait mindfulness and incentivized prosocial behavior-and in addition give this relation an additional chance by testing it under a theoretical meaningful experimental boundary condition (i.e., feelings of guilt).",

Specifically, it includes meta-cognitive awareness of one's internal mental experiences and observing them as such and to watch them come and go. That is, one takes the position of a neutral, nonjudging observer of one's own emotions and thoughts, without reflecting on their valence or their content in general. A mindful person is assumed to recognize each experience without ruminating about and identifying with it too much and without entangling oneself in additional thoughts and emotions by judging them (Bishop et al., 2004; Chambers et al., 2009; Karremans & Papies, 2017) . This state of present-moment awareness can be described as the opposite of unintentional mind wandering (Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010) or acting on \"auto-pilot\" (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999) and is supposed to have widespread effects on human functioning and behavior (e.g., Brown et al., 2007) .",

In light of the person-situation debate (Fleeson, 2004) , both perspectives are important to understand the whole picture since they address different questions. In the present research, we applied a trait perspective to address whether the frequency of being in a mindful state (trait mindfulness) relate to prosocial outcomes. In contrast, an intervention perspective asks whether increasing the situational level of mindfulness (through a mindfulness intervention) promotes prosocial outcomes. Although both perspectives are related, they are conceptually distinct and have different theoretical implications (Bless & Burger, 2016) . When reviewing evidence on mindfulness effects, it is therefore important to distinguish between evidence from intervention studies and evidence from correlational studies that include mindfulness as a trait (Van Dam et al., 2018) . In fact, most empirical studies addressed mindfulness as a personality trait and examined its relationship to other constructs in correlational designs (Brown & Ryan, 2003; Baer et al., 2006) . Therefore, testing the prosocial nature of mindfulness with correlational studies makes a valuable contribution to the literature-are those who experience mindfulness more often in their lives more likely to engage in prosocial behavior?",

Having its scientific roots in clinical psychology, research on mindfulness has so far focused almost entirely on its positive effect on individual well-being, mental and physical health, showing significant correlations with a variety of cognitive and affective indicators, such as lower levels of anxiety, stress and neuroticism as well as higher levels of positive affect, vitality and subjective wellbeing (e.g., Brown & Ryan, 2003; Baer et al., 2006) . One major reason for the positive effects on well-being is that mindfulness is linked to more effective emotion regulation, self-regulatory capacity and executive control, and less emotional reactivity (e.g., Hill & Updegraff, 2012) .",

            "text": "Although mindfulness research in the interpersonal context is still in its infancy (Creswell, 2017) , the literature so far suggests an almost unitary picture: mindfulness benefits others-children, romantic partners, friends, colleagues, or strangers (e.g., Geurtzen et al., 2015; . Surveying the mindfulness literature basically reveals two lines of arguments regarding why mindfulness is linked to prosociality: First, mindfulness is assumed to improve the ability of sustained attention and self-regulatory capacity (Chiesa et al., 2011) . This further attenuates automatic and impulsive processes and increases awareness of others' needs in the social environment (e.g., Condon, 2019) . Accordingly, it is argued that mindfulness should promote prosociality, especially in circumstances that typically inhibit prosociality (Berry et al., 2020) , such as the presence of bystanders (Condon et al., 2013) . Second, mindfulness is assumed to facilitate disengaging from mental contents by meeting them with nonjudgmental acceptance. This attenuates self-referential thoughts and emotions, further reducing boundaries between self and others and in turn increasing empathic concern (Berry et al., 2018) . According to these assumptions, both dimensions, acting with awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance, should be positively linked to prosocial behavior. Donald et al. (2019) reported a positive significant correlation between trait mindfulness and prosocial outcomes across 12 studies including 32 effect sizes (d = .73, 95% CI [0.51, 0.96]); no evidence for publication bias was found. However, we argue that there are some aspects that seriously limit the evidence: First, most of the studies relied on self-reports (for the most recent example not included in this meta-analysis, see Guo et al., 2021) . This is a serious limitation given that correlations between self-report measures can be inflated by shared method variance, especially when the measured constructs are socially desirable as in the present case. Only seven studies in the meta-analysis investigated actual prosocial behavior; all of them measured the extent to which the subject offered to help via email to an alleged (actually non-existent) victim of ostracism or by measuring the total number of ball throws towards an alleged (actually non-existent) victim in an online ostracism paradigm (Berry et al., 2018; Ridderinkhof et al., 2017) . Second, the observed effect sizes for actual behavior were only small-to-medium (d = .37) in contrast to selfreports (d = .89). Third, 17 of the 32 effect sizes resulted from three surveys on self-reported parenting attitudes such as responsiveness (Geurtzen et al., 2015; Parent et al., 2016a Parent et al., , 2016b . Fourth, in none of the included studies did participants' decisions involve any substantial costs for themselves when benefitting another person. In the included studies using actual behavior, all participants played cyberball and were then asked to write an e-mail to the other players while the degree of support towards the ostracized player served as the dependent variable. Given that trait mindfulness was unrelated to writing time in terms of total word count, writing a supportive e-mail as a requested task in the experiment did not entail substantial costs. This is a serious limitation concerning ecological validity, given that prosocial behavior often comes at a personal cost (Kawamura et al., 2020; Thielmann et al., 2020) , for example, in terms of money (e.g., donations) or time (e.g., voluntary service). Moreover, extensive social psychology literature suggested the link between intention and behavior to be imperfect (e.g., Ajzen, 1991) . Last, many consider psychology as science of behavior and should therefore not only rely on introspective self-reports and questionnaire ratings (Baumeister et al., 2007) .",

These multiple aspects, however, have not been considered in the analysis by Donald et al.

The present work aims to fill this relevant gap by investigating prosocial economic decisions that involve personal financial costs. Second, while Donald et al. (2019) analyzed trait mindfulness as a one-dimensional construct, we take a multi-dimensional trait perspective, in particular to disentangle the effects of the nonjudgmental and awareness facets, given that both dimensions are defining aspects in the mindfulness concept (Baer et al., 2006; Kabat-Zinn, 1990) . In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that trait mindfulness is positively linked to actual prosocial behavior. In both studies, we included the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006) . In Study 1, we assessed donation behavior to a charitable organization. In Study 2, we assessed actual prosocial behavior in a dictator game. We chose the dictator game because (a) measures of individual differences (e.g., personality traits) were shown to be highly influential here (Thielmann et al., 2020) , and (b) the dictator game is a parsimonious paradigm that models prosocial behavior in its simplest way: giving money to another individual.",

We chose the dictator game because (a) measures of individual differences (e.g., personality traits) were shown to be highly influential here (Thielmann et al., 2020) , and (b) the dictator game is a parsimonious paradigm that models prosocial behavior in its simplest way: giving money to another individual. In addition, in this study, we experimentally manipulated guilt-level to explore whether the relationship between the nonjudge facet and prosocial behavior depends on the perceived levels of guilt (Bless & Burger, 2016) . While prosocial behavior can be motivated by altruism (Batson & Powell, 2003) , it often results from the egocentric goal of avoiding and reducing aversive states, such as feelings of guilt and distress (Cialdini et al., 1997; Dovidio et al., 1991; Graton & Ric, 2017; Penner et al., 2005) . That is, the stronger people experience or anticipate feelings of guilt, the more likely they will engage in prosocial behavior. It can further be suggested that trait mindfulness and especially the nonjudgmental acceptance aspect are in general negatively related to feelings of stress and guilt because they are based on subjective negative judgments about a situation (Cameron & Fredrickson, 2015; Friese & Hofmann, 2016) . If such judgments are reduced by a tendency to accept present-moment experiences without automatic judgment, aversive feelings (e.g., guilt) and their behavioral consequences are attenuated. Thus, by manipulating guilt-level, we addressed the idea that trait mindfulness and especially the nonjudgmental acceptance facet could even be negatively linked to prosocial behavior, because of a presumed negative relation between this facet and feelings of guilt. Overall, with the next study, we provide the relation between trait mindfulness and prosocial behavior an additional (theory-based) chance by investigating an additional boundary condition under which the relation might emerge more likely.",

            "text": "Regarding the present findings, the conclusion of a general positive relationship between trait mindfulness and actual prosocial behavior appears to be premature and points to so far neglected boundary conditions. Contradicting the existing literature on mindfulness, we addressed the idea that trait mindfulness and especially the nonjudgmental acceptance facet could even be negatively linked to prosocial behavior. Given that one important aspect of mindfulness refers to nonjudgmental acceptance of present experiences, aversive feelings such as guilt should be attenuated. Assuming that people often engage in prosocial behavior to avoid or to reduce feelings of guilt (Graton & Ric, 2017; Penner et al., 2005) , attenuating these feelings would lead to less prosocial behavior. Thus, as a potential moderator for the relation between trait mindfulness and prosocial behavior, we manipulated feelings of guilt when having the possibility to engage in prosocial behavior. Despite the vast number of published articles on mindfulness, we are unaware of any empirical work linking the nonjudgmental aspect of mindfulness to actual prosocial behavior. In our studies, the overall evidence for manipulated guilt-level as a moderator was inconclusive: In Study 2A, prosocial behavior and the nonjudge facet were significantly negatively correlated in the high but not the low guilt condition. Study 2B revealed evidence in the opposite direction (a positive correlation in the high-but not in the lowguilt condition). In Study 2C, no moderation by guilt level was found. It could be that participants did not fully believe our coverstory about their performance feedback and the existence of \"Person A\"especially in Studies 2B and 2C which were conducted online. However, we did not assess study suspicion or general thoughts about the paradigm, so this is speculative. Moreover, using one-shot financial decisions to test this idea might not be the best choice to test this idea (Fleeson, 2004 ; see limitations below); a repeated measure of prosocial behavior would have been a better choice. Given the plausible theoretical arguments for the role of guilt level, this idea deserves further research using improved methods.",

Although this kind of behavior is part of everyday life, future research should thus investigate prosocial behavior in different areas (e.g., blood donation, engaging in voluntary activities). It may be that dispositional mindfulness is more strongly related to prosocial behavior in personal interactions (where compassion is more present) rather than in economic games. Furthermore, economic games reflect rather momentary behaviors rather than typical individual's behavior and thus might be more prone to situational variables than traits (Fleeson, 2004) . Nonetheless, the present studies reflect informative evidence for the field by showing that the relation between trait mindfulness and prosocial behavior is not as straightforward as it is described in the existing literature. In this regard, our study makes an important contribution and points to a more complex pattern of mindfulness and prosociality that needs further investigation.",

Notably, the terms mindfulness and mediation are often used interchangeably in both public discourse and in scientific literature. Valid interpretation of empirical results must take a proper account of exactly what types of mindfulness and mediation interventions are involved (Schindler, 2020; Van Dam et al., 2018) . Recent meta-analyses on the effects of various kinds of longterm meditation interventions (such as loving kindness meditation or mindfulness-based programs) on prosocial outcomes revealed mixed evidence: While Luberto et al. (2018) concluded that \"meditation can improve prosocial emotions and behaviors\" (p. 708), Kreplin et al. (2018) identified \"a number of biases and theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this area\". Exclusively metaanalyzing studies using experimental mindfulness interventions and assessments of actual prosocial behavior, Berry et al. (2020) reported an overall positive significant effect size (Hedges' g = .43). However, in contrast to compassion-related outcomes, effect sizes referring to generosity (studies using economic games) or instrumental helping behavior outcomes clustered around zero and \"may not be mutable to training in mindfulness\" (Berry et al., 2020, p. 17) . This observation speaks to the idea that prosocial effects of mindfulness might depend on the nature of prosocial behavior and might not hold for money-related helping behavior, rather for outcomes that are directly compassion-related.",
