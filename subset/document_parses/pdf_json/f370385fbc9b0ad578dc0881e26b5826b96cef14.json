Starting point is an observational diagnosis of present socio-political conditions, which have transformed crisis from a turning point into a continuation and radicalization of the existing order. In an attempt to understand the ongoing subversion of transformative potentials of crisis, a similar process of pacification and subversion of critique in dominant theoretical paradigms will be examined. It will be argued that both sociopolitical and main-stream theoretical processes work toward pacification of the status quo that raises both existential and theoretical concerns. In order to support the claim that a different relationship between crisis and critique is possible, it will be referred to Reinhart Koselleck's seminal study, Critique and crisis (1959), where it is shown how absolutist state generated its critique by Enlightenment and then Enlightenment conditioned radical changes in form of French Revolution. Relying on that example, the following questions will be raised: What kind of historical structures have been lost since times which generated Enlightenment as a critical stance? What kind of theoretical tools are we missing in post-Enlightenment post-modern times in order to conceptualize and condition radical changes? What is the role of psychological theorizing in sustaining adaptation to the existing order instead of arguing and demanding its radical change? How to reclaim transformative potentials of critique and crisis?",

Thus, the aim of this paper is to reflect on historical vicissitudes of relationship between crisis and critique in order to acquire more comprehensive tools for understanding present situation which poses many challenges to future patterns of development of humanity in social, economic, ecological, educational, cultural, and many other regards. After analyzing a historical example from pre-and Enlightenment times provided by Reinhart Koselleck in his study Critique and crisis, the changed conditions characterizing post-modern societies will be examined in order to identify processes and patterns which subvert a possible productive overcoming of crises. It will be referred also to psychological conceptualizations of crisis and critique as an additional source of arguments for making concluding claims that it is necessary to reclaim critique in order to turn crises into a possible instigation to emancipatory processes.",

For this reason, it is expected that the suggested time distancing from the present might be epistemically fruitful for an attempt to understand how developmental possibilities contained in present crises have been subverted.",

Its historical semantic origin lies in Ancient Greece and that not just in the Greek roots of both concepts (\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2-kr\u00edsis: power of distinguishing, decision, choice, election, judgment, dispute; \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9-kr\u00edn\u014d; \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd-krinein: judge, decide, choose; Proto-Indo-European root krei: sieve, thus distinguish) as it is the case with many concepts used in philosophical and scientific vocabulary nowadays. In this case, the very relation of the concepts of crisis and critique has a Greek root in their common origin in the same Greek word-krinein, from which later on two concepts became differentiated, with different historical trajectories and destinies-critique has had a longer usage, mostly as literary criticism, while crisis started attracting attention in the last centuries.",

While the former emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century (see, for example, Mannheim 1929) , the latter discoursive turn started reshaping social and human sciences in the second half of the twentieth century, even though the predecessors could be found already in the Renaissance. Sociology of knowledge relates knowledge production and validity of knowledge claims to social conditions under which producers and recipients of knowledge live and think, i.e., it argues for social foundations of knowledge. A very strong socio-genetic approach to cognition was shared also by the Critical Theory as elaborated in programmatic writing Traditional and Critical Theory by Max Horkheimer in 1930s (1937 . Nowadays, there is an influential orientation within epistemology named social epistemology. Martin Kusch (2002) , for example, argues for a communitarian revision of epistemology, which means that the source of knowledge is no longer an individual epistemic subject.",

Among discoursive approaches which are flourishing since the last decades of the twentieth century, Michel Foucault's is one of the most productive. Foucault (1971 Foucault ( /1981 understood discourses as sign practices which construct the meanings of objects, conveyed in the rules how to talk (or not to talk) on them, how to think of them and how to deal with them: \"in every society the production of discourse is at once controlled, selected, organised and redistributed by a certain number of procedures whose role is to ward off its powers and dangers, to gain mastery over its chance events, to evade its ponderous, formidable materiality\" (Foucault 1981, p. 52) . Thus, discourses do not copy reality but construct a specific view on it which then shapes approach to it. Therefore, discourses have a very important role in constituting subjective and social worlds. Within the broad field of discourse analyses, there are approaches which are specified as critical discourse analysis (see, for example, Parker 2015) and which are understood primarily as social critique-critique of power relations, injustice, inequality, violence.",

The situation which evolved as the consequence of the pandemic has been described as a plurality of crises. From the very beginning, the crises have been indeed accompanied by various voices of critique directed against the state management of the pandemic. However, it cannot be overseen that critical voices do not have the same space and support, to say the least, as regular broadcasting of statistical data on numbers of tested, infected, hospitalized, and dead of corona virus. Other means are used as well in order to subvert critique in the declared or assumed state of emergency. The situation is characterized by emergencies, exceptions, health, legal and economic concerns, mass lockdowns which include imposing curfews, closing borders, universities, schools, kindergartens, factories, shops, restaurants, hotels, libraries, cinemas, theatres, concert halls, museums, parks, then restrictions or even total suspension of public transportation, prohibition of all public events, suspension of political rights to demonstrate and assemble, or even to meet informally in groups.",

Nowadays, lockdown, used without translation in other languages as well (for example in German), describes almost universally adopted measures (the only two exceptions in Europe in the spring 2020 were Belarus and Sweden), taken by state authorities as means to prevent spreading of a very contagious corona virus Covid-19. At the same time, there are quite opposing views on lockdown, even among experts in the same field (for example, Melnick and Ioannidis 2020). However, I think it is important to add to the description or rather explicate a feeling and meaning of being stuck, which could be expressed by another, older word from the family of \"lock\"-namely deadlock. The word lockdown signifies also results of implicated actions-and indeed lockdowns have been ordered-and unfortunately even repeatedly ordered after a short period of selective re-openings-by governmental or local authorities, and this is an action which forbids other actions, or actions by other subjects and agencies. These features qualify lockdowns as belonging to a traditional repertoire of repressive, restrictive political mechanisms, and technologies of self, even though they are justified in terms of bio-politics (Foucault 1978 )-care of lives and supposedly care of life of every individual. The word deadlock, on the other hand, signifies the produced situation from the perspective of those deprived of exit options or at least viable exit options. Due to distribution and reproduction of power hierarchies also by semantic means and their pragmatic consequences, it is no surprise that the perspective of those having power to impose lockdowns has the semantic prevalence over the semantic position of those subjected to their power and experiencing to be at a deadlock.",

According to medical accounts, a closer contact with others could be risky because of virus transmission. Thus, everybody is a potential threat to everybody, even more so as it is possible to be infected without having any symptoms of illness. By referring to necessity of social distancing, the narrative on Covid-19 symbolically recreated a return to a presupposed natural state in which Hobbesian (1651/2020) rule applies-homo homini lupus. This is indeed, on the one hand, the most radical and explicit realization of individualism and, on the other hand, its self-destruction-if everybody is endangered by everybody, it is clear that under such conditions, no prosperity for anybody could be achieved. Hobbes has found a solution-he argued that from insights into unbearable consequences of such a natural state rational individuals came to the idea of necessity of a social contract, i.e., of building a protective state body which stands over individuals. Accordingly, state provides protection which no individual is able to provide by himself individually.",

Is this just an example of a conceptual confusion-among so many others-or is it rather a kind of double-bind messaging, which needs to be decoded? Even though we are advised to distance ourselves from physical objects as well as they can be temporary storages of virus, other human subjects are the primary objects to be avoided or kept on a supposedly safe physical distance. What is the referent of the \"social\"-is the other individual understood as a social being or is the physical space or distance promoted into a social space or distance? Given the dominance of individualism, grounded already in individualistic epistemology and methodological individualism, adopted widely not only by psychology, but also by other social sciences striving to follow epistemology and methodology of natural sciences, and the fact that individualism is accompanied by a fast spreading of a new wave of naturalism (the rise of evolutionary psychology since the 1990s is a telling example), and powerfully supported by political, economical and ideological neo-liberalism-it would not be justified to assume that a social understanding of individuals has suddenly replaced discourses of individualism which have been so powerful for centuries, since seventeenth century (Hobbes, Locke) . For sure, after conceptual plundering executed by both post-modernism and neo-liberalism, the concept of the social has very poor content and the concept of the societal hardly any.",

We learnt more than hundreds of years ago from Gestalt psychology that human subjects, under certain conditions, can perceive movement even though physically there is no movement-so-called phi-phenomenon. It is not the point here to refer to phenomena of illusions or hallucinations, or hysteric blindness, in order to argue that physical and mental do not correspond to each other in a relation 1 to 1. This means that they cannot replace each other. Consequently, it is important to be alert that a relatively simple wording-social distancingwhen analyzed becomes a peculiar language game with significant pragmatic effects.

Instead of the meantime abolished absolutist state, the norm nowadays is a democratic state, which means a state form which is supposed to represent beliefs and interests of the majority of its citizens, or at least majority of those who expressed their choices in elections. Even though such a state form should have overcome the historical opposition between state and society, this has not become a political reality so far. Some institutional changes have been introduced in order to allow for representation of ethnic minorities in parliaments. Other categories of minority interests or non-political interests are mostly addressed by non-governmental organizations. However, decreasing voter turnouts which characterize many elections-such a telling example are elections for European parliament (in the last election in 2019 total turnout was 50, 66%, but in 15 member states turnout was below 50%, for example in Slovakia only 22.74%, in Slovenia 28.89%, in Portugal 30.75%)-raise a more general question of legitimacy of the elected representatives or even question the whole model of representative democracy. Thus, instead of being the proclaimed historical solution at the end of history (Fukuyama 1992) , parliamentary democracy seems to need to look for new solutions for itself in order to regain its legitimacy.",

On the contrary, the neoliberalism, in its ideology and its practical applications, has deprived individual subjects of sources and supportive tools for their development. These sources and tools have to be provided by society and cannot be provided by any individual alone. This is the consequence of the fact that society cannot be reduced to a sum of individuals. As rightly pointed out by sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1992) , society cannot be reduced to a sum of interactions either. Nevertheless, discoursive atomizations of society have been quite seductive. Classical associationism, applied in accounts of nature, psyche, and society, is a very telling example, which has substantially shaped modern sciences, and quite powerfully psychology as well, as pointed out by Kurt Danziger:",

Understandably, what is desired is to provide conditions to move to a better situation than before the crisis. This would be a proper validation of the crisis, i.e., of transformative potentials it bears.

This chapter offers steps in elaborating such an alternative in building and critically expanding on insights from Vygotsky's project.
