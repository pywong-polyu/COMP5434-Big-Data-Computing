The surge in healthcare demand due to COVID-19 has placed hospital physicians under increased stress and pressure 1 while other physicians were forced to rapidly shift workforce practices 2 or begin utilizing telehealth platforms 3 for medical services. Physicians were already at a higher risk of burnout, depression, and suicide prior to 4 and the global pandemic has added to increased levels of stress. 5 Physicians are facing frustration, fear due to a lack of adequate personal protective equipment, 6 exhaustion, and traumatic patient outcomes which are exacerbated by physical distancing measures and social isolation. 7 These experiences may worsen mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.",

            "text": "Existing literature suggests that past pandemics have resulted in an increase in stress and mental health symptoms among healthcare workers. 8, 9 Studies involving the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak showed that healthcare workers experienced mental health effects including high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. 10 Physicians practicing in various specialties experienced psychological trauma as a result of caring for patients infected with the virus. 10 A 2007 study published in the BMJ Emergency Medicine Journal found that as many as 93% of emergency department physicians who treated victims of the 2003 SARS outbreak reported symptoms associated with PTSD. 10, 11 Healthcare workers face many stressors when treating patients with a respiratory virus, including the risk of infection while performing daily tasks, the fear of infecting family and friends, and fear related to being seen as a source of contagion. 11, 12 COVID-19 healthcare workers across the globe are experiencing similar stressors. A cross-sectional study published by Lai et al 1 involving 1257 healthcare workers across multiple regions in China found that healthcare workers involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and direct care of patients with COVID-19 had a greater likelihood of negative mental health symptoms, specifically depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. A recent study in India evaluated rates of depression, anxiety, and stress in 152 physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 and found rates of 34.9%, 39.5%, and 32.9%, respectively. 13 Xu et al 14 conducted a study in China on the surgical staff within a hospital and found that anxiety and depression symptoms of the staff during the COVID-19 outbreak were significantly higher when compared with a non-outbreak time period. Healthcare workers with occupational exposure to COVID-19 have also limited their contact with friends and family or changed their usual methods of coping, to limit exposure to others 15 but potentially exacerbating feelings of distress. Although national organizations have called for wellness initiatives 16 and support interventions 17 have been created for healthcare workers on the frontlines, physicians remainvulnerable to the negative mental health effects of caring for COVID-19 patients while balancing their own physical and emotional needs. 18 The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between the proportion of workday spent treating patients with active COVID-19 infection or physical sequelae and depression, anxiety, and PTSD outcomes in US physicians. While most physicians have been impacted by the pandemic, we hypothesized that those physicians who spent more time treating COVID-19 would suffer from higher scores on depression, anxiety, and PTSD rating scales.",

This global health crisis required physicians and other healthcare workers to abruptly alter occupational practices within their workplace. Although physicians may face stress or trauma while providing patient care, this novel virus created unfamiliar experiences, such as working with inadequate personal protective equipment, quarantined or infected coworkers, possible staffing shortages, potential pay cuts, and a lack of knowledge about methods of transmission or most effective treatments. These experiences, combined with the significant mortality rate associated with COVID-19, may have intensified mental health symptoms of physicians on the frontline. 32 Our cross-sectional study included 1724 US physicians and revealed that physicians who spent a greater proportion of their workday treating patients with COVID-19 in Spring of 2020 experienced greater symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Young, female trainees may be more susceptible to experiencing greater levels of anxiety. These data are consistent with other studies examining the mental health of physicians treating COVID-19. 1, 33, 34 Several systematic reviews have also indicated that numerous cross-sectional studies across the world have found a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in healthcare workers during the pandemic as well as a correlation of worsening mental health symptoms with occupational exposure to patients infected with COVID-19. 32, [35] [36] [37] [38] Physicians specifically who treat COVID-19 patients in Turkey, 39, 40 China, 1 and Pakistan 41 are similarly experiencing an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, healthcare workers in Italy 42 and China 43 who treated patients with COVID-19 experienced an increase in PTSD symptomatology, with similar findings to our data.",

However, our data suggests that the impact of COVID-19 caseload may be greater for trainees. A recently published study by Kannampallil et al 34 found that resident trainees at one academic medical center who treated COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher levels of stress and burnout. Yet, academic training centers vary in practices and policies around the country. The response to COVID-19 has also differed across the country among various residency training programs. These residency programs may have needed to change resident call schedules, create virtual educational presentations due to limitations on large gatherings, or adjust staffing practices to reduce transmission amongst residents. 44 In our data, we observed that among physicians who treated COVID-19 patients, residents across the country had worse average mental health scores than attendings. These resident trainees may be experiencing challenges associated with balancing clinical duties, long work hours, and educational responsibilities exacerbated by the new stressors created by the global pandemic. Our data suggests that residents who are treating COVID-19 may benefit from additional mental health support or resources, shift breaks, or time off to address mental or emotional fatigue. 15 Furthermore, residency programs should place an emphasis upon the mental health of trainees and offer resources to address potential psychiatric symptoms of residents, regardless of occupational exposure to COVID-19.",

It might be expected that Emergency Medicine physicians would demonstrate a higher level of depression, anxiety, and PTSD scores due to their direct contact with COVID-19 patients. However, when comparing physician specialties after adjusting for all other variables, their scores were not significantly greater than other specialties. Interestingly, Infectious Disease physicians reporting more time treating COVID-19 patients reported less severe mental health scores. Infectious disease physicians were the smallest specialty group in this study, and this finding may be due to selection bias since the survey was conducted in Spring of 2020 when the infectious disease physician workforce was likely busier than usual. Infectious disease physicians may also be better prepared than other physicians to deal with a pandemic, by understanding the epidemiology and disease course of a novel virus, possibly mitigating the impact upon mental health scores.",

Due to the method of recruitment, 56.4% of the physicians in our sample work in an academic setting, so our descriptive results that do not adjust for work setting over-represent this group. According to physician census data compiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), 64.0% of actively licensed physicians are men, 35.1% are women, and 0.9% are unknown. 48 This differs from our sample of 44% men, 56% women, and 5 participants who identified as non-binary. Our sample was younger than the data compiled by the FSMB, but the FSMB study also excludes residents from their data. 48 The use of multiple imputation mitigated the impact of incomplete surveys and item non-response under the assumption that data were missing at random given the observed data.",

Long-term mental health resources should be provided to physicians without repercussions. 55 Lastly, future studies should investigate the long-term mental health effects of COVID-19 upon physicians.
