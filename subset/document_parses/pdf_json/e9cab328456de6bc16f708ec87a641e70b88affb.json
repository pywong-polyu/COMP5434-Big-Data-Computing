We report a case with the false-positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing in which chest computed tomography (CT) findings challenged the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. 1, 2 On February 16, 2020, a 36-year-old man presented to a local primary healthcare clinic with a mild cough and subjective fever for 1 day. He had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients. Physical examination revealed a body temperature of 38.4\u00b0C. A routine blood panel showed normal ranges of white blood cells count (8.9\u00d710 9 /L), neutrophils (6.1\u00d710 9 /L), and lymphocytes (1.8\u00d710 9 /L), as well as a high level of C reactive protein (25.2 mg/L). An oropharyngeal swab tested negative for influenza A and B but positive for SAR-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on February 17. The patient's chest CT showed large, mixed, ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lower lobe of right lung with partial consolidation, distribution along with bronchovascular bundles, and a little effusion of the right oblique fissure (Fig. 1, Panel A) .",
