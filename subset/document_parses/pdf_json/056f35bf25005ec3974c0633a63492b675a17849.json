            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on population health and wellbeing. Research efforts are underway to identify vaccines [1] , improve testing [2, 3] , understand transmission [4] , develop serologic tests [5] , develop therapies [6] , predict risk [7] , and develop mitigation and prevention strategies [8, 9] . Biomedical informatics is central to each of these research efforts and for the delivery of healthcare for COVID-19 patients. Critical to this effort is the participation of informaticians who typically work on other basic science or clinical problems. The goal of this editorial is to highlight some examples of COVID-19 research areas that could benefit from informatics expertise. Each research idea summarizes the COVID-19 application area followed by an informatics methodology, approach, or technology that could make a contribution. This is followed by some practical suggestions for getting started. These are organized under sub-disciplines for biomedical informatics including Bioinformatics that focuses on basic science questions, Clinical Informatics that focuses on the delivery of healthcare, Clinical Research Informatics that focuses on research using clinical data, Consumer Health Informatics that focuses on the use of mobile devices and telemedicine, and Public Health informatics that focuses on research questions at the population or community level. It is our hope that this piece will provide motivation and make it easy for some informaticians to adopt COVID-19 research projects.",

Phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary connections and relationships among individuals or groups of species. These relationships can be identified through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate the evolutionary origins of traits of interest, such as DNA sequences. Similar to tracing your ancestry through a DNA test, a phylogenetic analysis approach can be used to help map some of the original spread of the new coronavirus and trace a SARS-CoV-2 family tree based on its rapid mutations, which creates different viral lineages. Note that many countries have shared an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data via the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data or GISAID (https://www.gisaid. org). GISAID has generated a phylogenetic tree of 3123 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples between December 2019 and April 2020. In particular, Nextstrain, an open-source software package (https://nextstrain.org), uses SARS-CoV-2 genome data to help track the spread of disease outbreaks. For example, it could be applied to tell researchers where new cases of the coronavirus are coming from. This can be crucial information for investigating whether new cases arrived in given countries through international travel or local infection. One caveat is that the number of genetic differences among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes is close to the error rate of the sequencing process. Thus, there is a possibility that some of the observed genetic differences may be artifacts of this process. However, rapid data sharing for SARS-CoV-2 is the key to public health action and has led to faster-thanever outbreak research. With more data sharing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, more genetic diversity will become apparent making it possible to better understand how the coronavirus is being transmitted.",

For other viruses, we know that some individuals have a natural immunity whereby even when exposed to the virus, they do not develop infection. For example, the well-known CCR5-delta32 allele has a variation that protects individuals who have been exposed to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); they are protected from developing AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) [10] . Because of this, researchers are gearing up to study the genomes of COVID-19 positive patients in comparison to controls (COVID-19-negative patients). For example, Stawiski et al. investigated coding variation in the gene, ACE2. ACE2, the human angiotensinconverting enzyme2, is a cell surface protein that the viral spike coat protein SARS-CoV-2 engages to invade the host cell [10] . What would be optimal for these and other genome-wide analyses, to identify potential risk and protective variants, are individuals who test positive for the virus but remain asymptomatic. These individuals will be more difficult to identify because of the lack of widespread testing (most individuals without symptoms are not being tested). However, the research community is building large, international, collaborative consortia to address this challenge, such as the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://www.covid19hg.org/). Much like understanding the viral genome will be useful for drug development, identifying the genetic variation in the host DNA that is either increasing the risk of, or protection from, SARS-CoV-2 infection will enable us to identify putative targets for therapeutics and vaccines.",

In addition, imaging plays an important role in assessing patients with worsening respiratory status [12] , which is crucial for monitoring and treatment planning. Given the fast-growing volume of COVID-19 cases, to help alleviate the huge manual evaluation burden on clinicians, there is an urgent call for researchers in imaging informatics (or radiomics) to work on developing automated image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) methods and tools. To achieve these goals, major efforts have been initiated to address two critical research foci. The first is to create large-scale high-quality imaging data repositories (e.g., Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 Imaging Data Repository, https://www.rsna.org/COVID-19) to accelerate collaborative research on image-based COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. The second is to develop innovative AI methods for automatic image analysis for COVID-19 diagnosis and severity assessment. To get started on supporting these efforts, below we suggest a few relevant resources for interested imaging informaticians. Several COVID-19 resource and initiative web portals have been created by major organizations such as American College of Radiology (ACR), Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics (EuSoMII). These portals offer important information on policies, guidelines, discoveries, initiatives, data sets, and/or other relevant resources. Given the rapidly growing AI-based imaging literature on COVID-19, it is worth noting a recent review article [13] , which provides comprehensive coverage on a variety of interesting topics, including AI-empowered contactless imaging workflow, AI in lung image segmentation, AI-assisted diagnosis and severity assessment, AI in follow-up studies, public imaging datasets for COVID-19, and future directions.",

Symptom screening tools have been developed to aid patients in distinguishing COVID-19 symptoms from common colds and flu. Telemedicine is helping keep patients at home by deploying chatbots to answer patient COVID-19 questions and providing virtual visits and consultations to limit the number of individuals exposed to COVID-19 and to manage patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. This reduces resource utilization and overburden on the care delivery system. Capacity and resource management tools can generate projects based on regional infection counts and current patient admissions to estimate the number of patients that will require hospitalization, intensive care unit beds, medications, and mechanical ventilation. These projections can improve clinical response times and inform triage care strategies. Donation and resource inventory tools can be helpful for identifying, cataloging, and distributing personal protective equipment (PPE), homemade masks, and other critical medical supplies to those fighting on the front lines. Informaticians can support these efforts by 1) educating patients and care providers about data science resources and electronic health record (EHR) platforms for building point-of-care solutions, 2) joining the open-source community efforts to develop these technologies, and 3) volunteering with the information services divisions within their healthcare organizations to deploy telehealth tools and engage in patient management projects.",

These complex practices have made it non-trivial to collect even the most basic information, including who is being tested and who is positive. These data are essential both to the care of individual patients and to health providers who need to design these care systems and plan for what is coming next. These data are also being reported to government agencies in multiple new manual processes. The work that has been done to build these data collection systems is extraordinary and commendable.

This is critically important because false-negative results could lead to the inappropriate non-use of PPE or insufficient clinical and epidemiological monitoring. The rate of such false-negatives is also highly variable across time, as the disease prevalence changes, and across multiple patient, provider, and geographic factors. To fill in these knowledge gaps, there is a big need for the design and application of methods for estimating such parameters from in-practice data.

As a first step, healthcare institutions can create patient registries to maintain reliable lists of COVID-19 patients and cases (e.g., confirmed, ruled out, uncertain). These data must be updated regularly (daily or several times each week) and contain a broad set of data elements representing demographics, prior medical histories, current medications, comorbidities, diagnoses, procedures, outcomes, etc. to serve a broad base of clinical investigators and scientific inquiries. To adequately code all patient data, image processing will be needed to encode salient radiological findings, and natural language processing will be needed to extract symptom onset, severity, and duration among other variables. Secure informatics platforms such as Integrating Bench to Bedside (i2b2) and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE), Trinetix, and Atlas play an important role in standardizing and harmonizing clinical data to common data models (CDMs) including i2b2, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet), Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR), and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). Once COVID-19 patients are indexed within the patient registry and their clinical data has been extracted, transformed, and loaded into these frameworks, clinical researchers can execute secure, privacy-preserving, and federated queries across all participating sites using any framework to identify patients for clinical trials, generate scientific hypotheses, and conduct observational studies. Both aggregate and individual-level information can be made available with appropriate data governance, ethical review, and institutional agreements. Informaticians can support these efforts by 1) developing technologies and algorithms for extracting, encoding, and mapping raw EHR data to emerging COVID-19-specific CDMs, 2) engaging in existing and emerging consortiums, both grass roots and nationally-sponsored efforts, across Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) and informatics networks, and 3) connecting with clinicians to develop and share informatics tools and predictive models that identify clinically-formative, actionable insights from heterogeneous, temporal data.",

There are several drugs that may therapeutic use in COVID-19, namely: hydroxychloroquine sulfate, chloroquine phosphate, remdesivir, carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir and elbasvir. These medications were designed for treatment of various diseases, including lupus, malaria, cancer and HIV.

For example, the birth and pregnancy outcomes following drug exposure can be assessed using EHRs for drugs potentially useful in treating COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine. This is important as the hydroxychloroquine clinical trials for COVID-19 specifically exclude pregnant women from enrolling in their studies.

Early research has suggested that individuals, who have medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, or asthma, may be at higher risk for severe disease and/or worse outcomes from COVID-19. Additionally, early data suggests that some medications such as ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin release blockers (ARBs), or non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may be linked to worse health outcomes due to COVID-19. However, these reports are primarily based on small, observational datasets without rigorous, epidemiological study designs. As such, these associations are met with much controversy in the literature. With the accumulation of COVID-19 positives and negatives, along with access to EHR data, including comorbid conditions and medications, researchers will be able to develop more thorough studies of which medical conditions are associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes and/or which medical conditions place individuals at higher risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19. Additionally, if these data are paired with genetic data from EHR-linked biobanks, we may be able to determine if some of these differences in COVID-19 severity and/or outcomes related to comorbidities and medications are also related to host genetics. Fortunately, there are several efforts to establish data-sharing consortia that provide an opportunity for informaticians to assist with analyses. For example, the Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR, or 4 CE (https://covidclinical.net/), has released summary-level COVID-19 data from several countries including France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, and the United States along with a preprint of the initial analyses [16] .",

In a time when behavioral guidelines are continuously adjusted based on new data, consumer education is essential to conveying and disseminating actionable and timely information. Patient portals and other web sites can provide educational content that can be tailored to individual information needs as well as literacy and health literacy levels. Furthermore, systems can include an interactive component that can facilitate decision support and selftriage.

The system is already being used extensively and performs with high sensitivity in recommending emergency-level care for symptomatic patients. It also prevents unnecessary visits. Tools that have been traditionally used for patient monitoring at home and the community can also be useful in generating data that provide insight into disease spread and health needs.

Finally, in times of \"social distancing\", vulnerable populations such as older adults living alone are at greater risk of increased social isolation, which is often referred to as a silent epidemic and great health risk [18] . Digital tools have the potential to connect individuals for the delivery of social services, and creation of virtual peer support groups and connected communities including friends and family members.

In addition, activity sensors such as the accelerometer have been used to detect fatigue. While high resolution computed tomography (CT) images of a patient's lung may provide a more reliable indicator of infection, the high cost and low scalability make this approach infeasible to apply widely at the general population level.

Design and deployment of population-level testing should be a primary goal for the effective containment of COVID-19. In conjunction with apps developed by informaticists, contact tracing along with case isolation can proceed effectively to control outbreaks [8] . Such efforts are thought to have curtailed the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore and South Korea.

In recent years there have been many exciting efforts to combine natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and social media scraping to monitor clinical outcomes of interest such as foodborne illnesses [20] . There may be an opportunity to work towards adapting such informatics approaches to monitor and perhaps even combat the dissemination of 'bad' information through automated responses that redirect individuals to sources identified as reliable within the scientific community. Rule-based systems such as 'expert systems' could be combined with NLP technologies to construct such monitoring and response frameworks. Equally important is the consumer health informatics task of developing clear, concise, and easily navigable informational resources for COVID-19, that summarize up-to-date information and guidelines but also link summary information back to relevant primary sources, attempt to quantify the certainty/ reliability of available information, and offer explanations of reasoning whenever such information or guidelines need to be updated.",

Data on the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases is available at country/regional/city levels and by studying the progression and spread of disease in regions affected close to the time of the initial outbreak, meaningful projections of infection rates can be made for areas which will be affected later. For example, by modeling daily regional cumulative COVID-19 cases, regional differences in the trends can illuminate the comparative effectiveness of different policy decisions and can identify countries and policies that have succeeded in slowing the rate of COVID-19 spread, providing evidence for the adoption of effective public health policies by areas still in the early phases of the pandemic.

Medical informatics tools can improve the efficiency and scalability of up-to-date evidence synthesis for COVID-19 related research. For example, clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools can be used for literature screening and information retrieval. Software such as Abstractr [21] [22] [23] and DistillerSR (https://www.evidencepartners.com/) has been used to reduce manual effort in literature screening. Beyond literature screening, DistillerSR is also a useful tool for the management of the multi-step workflow of systematic review process. Recently, DistillerSR made its tool freely available for systematic reviewers and researchers to conduct systematic reviews related to COVID-19. For meta-analysis, tools such as Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) (https://www.meta-analysis.com/), RevMan (https://training.cochrane.org/online-learning/core-software-cochrane-reviews/ revman), and macros in Stata (https://www.stata.com/), are available for standard metaanalyses. However, for COVID-19 related research, more sophisticated methods are needed in order to address unique features related to this topic. For example, the quality of the reported findings in the above-mentioned 3700 manuscripts is expected to be highly heterogeneous, especially for those manuscripts that have not been peerreviewed. It is critically important to properly account for such heterogeneity across studies. Furthermore, the reported findings may be subject to more severe publication bias and outcome reporting bias [24] , as the analysis of the data and reporting of the analysis results are likely to be based on different protocols. Visualization tools, sensitivity analyses, and inference based on bias correction models can be useful in evaluating the quality of the evidence [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . In addition, novel visualization tools, such as the tornado plot in a cumulative meta-analysis [32] , will be valuable for presenting how the cumulative evidence on answering a COVID-19 related question evolves over time. R packages including 'meta', 'metafor', 'metasens', 'netmeta', 'mvmeta', mada' and 'xmeta' are useful for advanced meta-analyses with these needs. Finally, online platforms for meta-analysis, such as programs with shiny interfaces, are in great need for offering convenience to COVID-19 researchers in summarizing and synthesizing results.",

These models have been widely used in making projections and informing policy-makers in constructing mitigation strategies for the disease. One weakness of these models is that they treat individuals in a given population as homogeneous, with constant risk rates, exposure rates, infection rates, and recovery/death rates throughout the larger group. This is a gross oversimplification which is a primary factor of the models' limited predictive accuracy. Statisticians have been engaging in COVID-19 efforts with statistical models using functional data or time series modeling techniques. These models often use covariates or latent factors to account for population heterogeneity and provide uncertainty quantification, thus improving on a weakness of the SEIR models. However, these models do not present the dynamic infectious disease process which may limit their interpretability and accuracy in forecasting. One key area of quantitative research that can emerge from this COVID-19 crisis is hybrid epidemiology-statistical models. That is, models based on SIR or SEIR frameworks that stochastically show the transition probabilities as differing according to person or environmental covariates, accounting for clustering effects, and effectively propagating uncertainty in the forecasting. These can combine the strengths of each type of model, and given the broad availability of large scale data on mobility, density, demographics, etc. that vary in different communities, they can produce much more realistic models and more accurate projections to guide policymaking.",

In addition to understanding the direct health impacts of the disease, there is a public health need to understand the secondary effects of COVID-19-related healthcare disruption on access to and timeliness of care for other urgent conditions, and resultant effects on health outcomes. Prioritizing healthcare resources for COVID-19 patients and efforts to depopulate healthcare settings in order to reduce healthcare-related disease transmission has resulted in reduced access to care for patients across the spectrum of clinical need and severity including delayed access to surgery for cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, and others with time-sensitive conditions. Public health informatics can play an important role in informing our understanding of how the effects of healthcare disruption propagate across a community, affecting access to care, and population health. Answering questions about the effect of healthcare disruption on population health requires three components: (1) access to data on healthcare utilization and outcomes, (2) data on timing and types of public health and hospitallevel interventions, and (3) causal inference methodologies that support our ability to draw conclusions about the causal effects of these interventions. Data on health care utilization and outcomes can be obtained from a variety of sources including individual and multi-institutional EHR data and claims databases. Data on public health interventions are already being compiled by researchers, including national and international databases of policy changes (https://is.gd/CQs6th, https://is.gd/LvvUiz, https://is.gd/ mlCu2I). Finally, disentangling the causal impacts of COVID-19 itself; interventions at the local, state, and federal level; and interventions and innovation at the individual health system level requires the rigorous implementation of study designs and analytic methods for causal inference. A number of techniques in common use in health services and econometrics research can be harnessed for this purpose including interrupted time series and difference-in-difference designs [33] .",

Numerous studies have been published of late in this realm, including studies on pharmacovigilance [35] , identifying user behavioral patterns [36] , identifying user social circles with common experiences (like drug abuse) [37] , monitoring malpractice [38] , and tracking infectious/viral disease spread [39, 40] . Population and public health topics are most addressed, although different social networks may be suitable for specific targeted tasks. For example, while Twitter data has been utilized for surveillance and content analysis, a significant portion of research using Facebook has focused on communication rather than lexical content processing [41, 42] . For health monitoring and surveillance research from social media, the most common topic has been influenza surveillance [43, 44] . From the perspective of informatics and NLP, proposed techniques have typically been in the areas of data collection (e.g., keywords and queries) [45, 46] , text classification [47, 48] , and information extraction [49] . While innovative approaches have been proposed, there is still a lot of progress to be made in this domain.",

We hope, through the numerous examples of research we have considered in this editorial, informatics researchers and practitioners can see possible avenues for their work. There is no dearth of opportunities related to COVID-19 for those working in informatics, and it is our hope that informaticians will vigorously explore these as they arise. Furthermore, we hope that those who are not informaticians will appreciate the contributions that informatics researchers can bring to their respective fields as we all seek to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects around the world.",
