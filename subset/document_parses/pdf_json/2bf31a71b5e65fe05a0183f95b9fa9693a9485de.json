After that, we extend the convergence results to a class of multistage SNCPs whose decision variable of each stage is influenced only by the decision variables of adjacent stages. Finally, some preliminary numerical tests are presented to illustrate the convergence results.",

Since the multistage SCP reveals uncertainty more elaborately, it is expected to obtain better solutions compared with the single-stage or two-stage case, especially in a relatively long decision-making period. Of course, it is also challenging in both theoretical analysis and numerical algorithms because of the complexity of uncertainty.",

            "text": "Deterministic variational inequalities and complementarity problems have been extensively discussed; see monographs [11, 12] and the references therein for more details. In the last decade, stochastic variational inequalities (SVIs) have received more and more attention [19, 25] . In [2] , by rewriting the single-stage stochastic linear complementarity problem through a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) function, the quasi-Monte Carlo method was adopted to solve the reformulated problem. Xu employed in [30] the SAA approach to analyze the discretization of single-stage SVIs. In [7] , Chen et al. adopted the expected residual minimization (ERM) approach to formulate the single-stage SVI and a smoothing SAA approach was proposed to solve the ERM formulation. In [3] , Chen et al. extended the ERM procedure to general two-stage nonlinear SVIs. In [23] , Rockafellar and Wets first proposed the formulation of multistage SVIs and lay the foundation for the further investigation of two-stage or multistage SVIs. Next to [23] , Rockafellar and Sun adopted in [22] the progressive hedging method (PHM) to solve the multistage SVIs when the support set is discrete. Inspired by [3, 20, 22, 23] , Chen et al. investigated in [6] a discretization scheme for two-stage stochastic linear complementarity problems. In [4] , Chen et al. considered the SAA approach for two-stage stochastic generalized equations and its application in two-stage nonlinear SVI-SCP problems. In [17] , Jiang et al. adopted the regularized SAA approach to solve a class of two-stage SVIs and applied them to the crude oil market. In [5] , Chen et al. modeled crude oil market share under the COVID-19 pandemic using two-stage stochastic equilibrium. In [16] , Jiang et al. discussed the quantitative stability as well as the rate of convergence for a class of two-stage linear SVI-SCP problems. For a comprehensive review of recent development in two-stage and multistage SVIs, we refer to [29] .",

Compared with the single-stage or two-stage case, the convergence analysis results of the SAA of multistage cases are quite limited. The existing results concentrate on multistage stochastic programming problems; see [21, 26, 27] . To the best of our knowledge, there are few results about the SAA approach and corresponding convergence analysis for multistage SCPs. According to these existing results, there are mainly two possible approaches to sample from a random process. The first one is to view the random process as a whole and sample from its (joint) distribution; the other is the conditional sampling.

Of course, the tth stage decision variable x t is assumed to depend only on the available information until time t, i.e., \u03be [t] . Or, equivalently, x t = x t (\u03be [t] ).

Since \u03be 1 is deterministic, we also neglect \u03be 1 and write \u03be j [2] as \u03be j 2 . Similar to the notation in the preceding context, we usex 2 (x 1 , \u03be 2 ) and x * 1 to denote the optimal solution of the second-stage problem of (13) for given x 1 and \u03be 2 and the optimal solution of the first-stage problem of (13), respectively. Moreover, according to Theorem 3, we have that the SAA problem (14) has the unique solution by viewing that the underlying probability distributions are discrete. We usex N 1 ,N 2 1 to denote the first-stage solution of problem (14) andx N 2 2 (x 1 , \u03be j 2 ) to denote the second-stage solution of problem (14) for given x 1 and \u03be j 2 . It should be mentioned that the convergence analysis of SAA of three-stage SNCPs (between problems (13) and (14)) is not a trivial extension from SAA of two-stage SNCPs. The main reason is that the second-stage problem in (13) changes when the SAA procedure is conducted (see (14) ), which makes the SAA convergence of the first-stage problem of (14) to that of (13) harsh. To derive the convergence result, we need the following standard assumption.",

Finally, some numerical tests have been presented through PHM to illustrate our theoretical results. There are still several questions that need to be addressed. We just analyze the asymptotic convergence of the conditional sampling approach for multistage SNCPs. What is the rate of convergence of the conditional sampling approach for multistage SNCPs? We leave this as our further research. Moreover, based on our numerical experience, the cost of solving three-stage SNCPs in PHM is relatively expensive with large sample sizes.",
