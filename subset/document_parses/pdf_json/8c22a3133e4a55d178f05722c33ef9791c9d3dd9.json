This proposed mode anticipated that factors technological knowledge (TK), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and psychological knowledge influence ES. This paper explains previous literature on perquisites, the phenomenon of TK, EO and psychological knowledge, and ES. This conceptual paper targets the scholarly works that provide support for the proposed model. A significant contribution of this paper is to propose an original relationship between prerequisites, phenomena, and consequences in ES. The proposed model shows a novel conceptualization of how these constructs may be connected to affect ES outcomes. This study enhances the literature by providing the theoretical literature of forerunners and outcomes for ES. In addition, this study has important implications for practitioners and entrepreneurs to generate success in entrepreneurial activities. Based on new insights, this study also developed and suggested new approaches and opportunities for future research.",

Based on the previous literature and theories, this study suggests that EO significantly affects PsyCap, enhancing the use of capital resources in an entrepreneurial context (Hasan et al., 2019) . The PsyCap in entrepreneurship plays a significant role in accelerating the firms' operations, thus determining long-term business success. The potential psychological ability enhances the individuals' commitment to the organizations' goals, leading to a higher organizational performance which is significant for achieving the firm's long-term success. Undoubtedly, positive PsyCap influence the firms' performance (Hasan et al., 2020) , thus preserving the business's long-term progress. In particular, the literature shows that PsyCap has increasingly gained popularity, propelling organizations to enhance their output, thus accomplishing business success. The psychological components (e.g., resilience, efficacy, optimism) yield the organizations to foster their productivity, thereby ensuring firms' long-term achievement (Lee and Yang, 2019) . Consequently, the dimension of PsyCap makes the organizations achieve excellence (Larsson and Thulin, 2019) , promoting business success.
