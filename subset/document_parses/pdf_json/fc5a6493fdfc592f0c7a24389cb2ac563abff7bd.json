The scale scores can be used to track family and parent impact of their child's feeding over time. To our knowledge interventions directly for family and parent impact of pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) are not evidence based at present. There are evidence based interventions for improving an infant or child's feeding outcomes (Lukens & Silverman, 2014; Sharp, Jaquess, Morton, & Herzinger, 2010) , and some programs are beginning to assess and report more comprehensively by seeking parent report of their own stress or satisfaction with treatment (Dahlsgaard & Bodie, 2019; Marshall, Hill, Wallace, and Dodrill, 2018) . In the last several years, there has been increased attention to parent and family outcomes in PFD treatment, partly because clinicians question generalization of clinic outcomes into the home setting, or non-feeding specific parent stress assessments have resulted in high scores (Sharp, Jaquess, Morton, & Herzinger, 2010) .",

PRO measures require input from the intended respondents early in the measure development process to establish content validity (Francis, McPheeters, Noud, Penson, & Feurer, 2016) . There are two tools available to measure impact of feeding disorder on parent and/or family. One, the Feeding Swallowing Impact Survey (FS-IS; Lefton-Greif et al., 2014) lacks evidence that parents were directly involved in the survey development. The second was in an unpublished dissertation: the Pediatric Feeding and Swallowing Disorders Family Impact Scale (Redle, 2007) . The Pediatric Feeding Swallowing Disorders Family scale is a 44-item scale using a 5-point response option (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree) that measured challenges and concerns in the family related to care for a child with feeding disorders, with higher scores indicating lower family impact. It does meet some criteria for PRO measure development, such as parent involvement in item development. Initial items were developed from interviews with 20 primary caregivers of children with feeding problems, pilot-tested with eight caregivers, and then revised (Redle) . The final scale was then field-tested with 136 caregivers of children with (n=90) and without (n=46) feeding disorders; and Redle reported a single factor was identified using exploratory factor analysis.",

Additionally, the sample size used in the factor analysis was not sufficient for generating meaningful factor structures (DeVellis, 2012) . This indicated the need for further testing.

To modify the scale, the research team first evaluated original items systematically. Items that did not directly measure the impact of feeding on the parent or family were removed. For example, items that assessed the child's skill for eating (ex. \"My child can bite and chew foods like other children his/her age\") or observable symptoms of problematic feeding (ex. \"My child gags while eating\") were removed. The remaining items were then reviewed and revised for consistency of format and clarity. Next, items were divided into two separate pools: one set items that assessed impact on family and another that assessed impact on parent. The two Feeding Impact Scales were created from this process: the Parent Impact Scale and the Family Impact Scale. Response options for the Feeding Impact items remained as originally designed, on a 5-point Likert scale, but the direction of the response options was reversed for easier interpretation of the scores (from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\"). With the new response options, higher scores indicate greater impact on the parent and family.",

To participate in the study, parents had to be at least 18 years old, able to read English, have internet access, and have an infant or child less than 18 years old with feeding problems. Parents less than 18 years old were excluded to eliminate potential confounding of adolescent parenting.

Additionally, parents were recruited locally through a hospital feeding clinic and nationally through Qualtrics response panels. Qualtrics response panels are a registry of individuals interested in participating in market and other research. Qualtrics matches potential participants with a particular survey's inclusion criteria. This recruitment strategy allowed for geographic and racial-ethnic diversity of the sample as well as diversity in terms of the child's underlying cause of feeding problem. Diversity of the sample is important for developing a tool with participants who reflect the population. Parents were offered a small incentive at survey completion (value less than $10).",

IRT can be used to evaluate psychometric properties of an existing scale and its items, to optimally shorten the scale when necessary, and to evaluate the performance of the reduced scale. IRT assumes unidimentionality (van der Linden & Hambleton, 2013), thus with two different dimensions in the Feeding Impact Scales (Parent Impact Scale and Family Impact Scale), we ran IRT analysis separately for each scale. Given the 5-point Likert response scale, a graded response IRT model was determined to be most appropriate (Paek & Han, 2013) .

Items were also evaluated for item location (b parameter) to maximize variation in item location along the trait continuum (Nguyen et al., 2014) . Poor fit items were evaluated using adjusted p-value of .001 based on the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) .

Overall the sample for this study was representative of the larger population of infants and children with PFD. Typically, more male children have PFD than do females, and our sample represented 57.4% male children (Sharp, Jaquess, Morton, & Herzinger, 2010) . Also the main other diagnoses reported were developmental delay and a history of premature birth, this is also a reflection of common co-occurring conditions noted in other studies (Field, Garland, & Williams, 2003; Sharp, Jaquess, Morton, & Herzinger, 2010) . As a parent report measure, it is easy to administer and to track both when a child is in clinic and at home. IRT analysis facilitated selection of items that gave the most information, fit within the graded response model, and provided unique contributions to their respective scales. The Parent (12-items) and Family (13-items) Impact Scales have good internal consistency reliability, and are at a desirable reading level for health-related materials.",

Most of these were significant. Weak correlations between measures of theoretically related, yet different constructs can be interpreted as meaningful because they were not hypothesized to be strongly correlated (Abma et al., 2016) . Most relationships between scale scores were in a hypothesized direction, for example, it was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between a child's symptoms of problematic feeding and the impact on the family. However, the relationships between the Feeding Impact Scales and the FAD-GF were unexpected. Contrary to what was hypothesized, parents who perceived more personal impact (Parent Impact) of their child's feeding disorder reported significantly better FAD-GF scores. Also unexpected, was that the relationship between the FAD-GF and the Feeding Impact on Family was not significant. This could mean that the FAD-GF is measuring something conceptually unrelated to the Feeding Impact Parent and Family. Or, it may be that greater parent impact of feeding has a paradoxical outcome of improving family function in a compensatory manner. More work is needed to explore the relationships between family functioning and impact of feeding on the family system.",

These scales specifically measure the parent-reported impact of feeding on parent, and on family. The Feeding Impact Scales can be used to assess outcomes for families of children in interdisciplinary care for PFD. It can be administered on paper, in electronic charting, or via a survey platform, and this can be adjusted as needed for data format and security, as well as ease of administration for the parent. For example, an intensive day treatment program for PFD can mail ahead the questionnaire for parents to bring to a first visit, or parents could complete it while in the treatment center. If a telehealth appointment, it can be sent ahead in a digital survey or chart form for providers to have the information on hand. This will allow the team of providers to adjust and tailor interventions for optimal success in the child's natural environment. The benefits to nursing and interdisciplinary processes will be ability to develop interventions that are more tailored to the challenges parents and families experience, thus improving effectiveness and outcomes. Work was recently completed to establish norm-reference values which guide interpretation of the Feeding Impact Scales and item scores. A recent development of response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been that many PFD treatment programs have gone completely to telehealth format. Knowing parent and family impact of feeding will be more important than ever, as they are critical providers of feeding care in their own homes. Note.",
