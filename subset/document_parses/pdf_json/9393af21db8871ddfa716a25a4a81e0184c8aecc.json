Autistic adults reported lower quality healthcare than non-autistic adults across 50/51 items, including poorer access to healthcare and poorer communication, alongside increased anxiety, sensory sensitivity, system-level problems, shutdowns, and meltdowns. Differences between groups were stark: aggregated health inequality scores predicted autism diagnosis, even after stratifying by sex. Autistic adults were also more likely to have chronic health conditions than non-autistic adults. There were no significant differences in healthcare quality for autistic adults before and during the pandemic, although they received relatively poorer quality healthcare than non-autistic adults across both periods.",

Interestingly, autistic participants selected different and greater barriers to health-care compared to non-autistic adults, including emotion regulation (especially fear/anxiety), patient-provider communication, slow processing speed, sensory sensitivity, concern about cost, and healthcare navigation [28] . These studies emphasize unequal access to healthcare for autistic individuals as well as additional barriers, but it is difficult to assess how generalizable these findings are due to their small sample sizes. The present study aimed to establish whether there are differences in chronic poor health and self-reported healthcare quality of autistic and non-autistic individuals across several domains (including current healthcare behavior, sensory experience, communication, anxiety, access and advocacy, system problems, and shutdowns/meltdowns). It also aimed to determine whether these issues improved or became worse after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. While research into health and healthcare remains priorities for the autistic community [29, 30] , future research may also help motivate individual providers, healthcare systems, and policymakers to consider the importance of equity in healthcare access and quality.",

The questionnaire included 63 questions on health and healthcare, including questions that were multiple-choice, used a 4-point Likert Scale (with the options Strongly Agree, Somewhat Agree, Somewhat Disagree, Strongly Disagree), and requested open-ended free text responses. Further information on the content of each of these sections can be found in the additional file.

Survey collection took place from July 2019 to January 2021. Our non-autistic sample may be biased toward individuals with an interest in autism, as the study advertisements and consent form indicated that the study compares the experiences of autistic and non-autistic adults. However, we attempted to mitigate this bias by advertising our study to the general population via paid advertisements on Facebook and Reddit. In addition, we excluded all individuals who reported that they suspected they were autistic, or who were awaiting assessment, or who self-diagnosed as autistic. At all stages of recruitment, both autistic and non-autistic individuals were invited to participate. Our use of social media advertisements enabled us to attempt to recruit a diverse, international sample, including people from 79 countries. N = 4158 individuals accessed the survey. Any individual aged 16 years or older who consented to participate was eligible. We excluded n = 1371 individuals due to incomplete response, failure to consent, or unconfirmed age (for ethical consent reasons). Although nearly all questions on the survey were optional, an incomplete response was defined as a participant who failed to complete any questions across all of the following sections: sensory experience, communication, anxiety, access and advocacy, system problems, meltdowns, shutdowns, or autism-specific experiences. In addition, a further n = 112 participants were excluded due to suspected duplicate response. We were able to use an existing survey setting in the Qualtrics system to prevent individuals from responding to the survey multiple times from the same IP address. However, as the survey participants were all anonymous, there was no direct way to exclude individuals who had responded to the survey multiple times. Thus, we used an algorithm to identify potential duplicate responses, excluding all participant records that matched any previous participant record across 12 criteria (autism diagnosis (yes/no), specific autism diagnosis, type of diagnosing practitioner, year of autism diagnosis, autistic family members (yes/no), age, country of residence, sex assigned at birth, current gender identity, education level, ethnicity, and AQ-10 score). Finally, as the study was anonymized, all autism diagnoses were self-reported; however, to confirm a clinical diagnosis, we asked participants to provide further information including the type of practitioner who diagnosed them (e.g., psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, pediatrician, etc.), their year of diagnosis, and their specific diagnosis (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, Asperger's, etc.). N = 26 further individuals were excluded from the study (both the autistic and non-autistic cohorts), as we were unable to confirm their autism status (e.g. awaiting assessment, suspected autism, or self-diagnosed as autistic). The final sample included n = 2649 individuals (n = 1285 autistic individuals).",

Perfect separation occurs when the value of a covariate directly predicts the value of the response variable (e.g. all non-white individuals are autistic); as such, the model cannot be reliably fitted, increasing the errors (and thereby 95% confidence intervals) dramatically.

This section of the survey served to provide information about the severity of distress that unmet health needs or a poor-quality healthcare experience could cause autistic or non-autistic individuals. Once again, we used Fisher's exact tests and binomial logistic regression (as described above) to determine if these experiences differed between autistic and non-autistic groups. Figure 1 shows the question provided to all participants asking whether their previous healthcare experiences had ever resulted in shutdowns or meltdowns. All participants (both autistic and non-autistic) were also provided with the accompanying definitions of what is meant by 'shutdown' or 'meltdown' in the context of this survey. Weir et al.

' We then added together all of the points for each subsection and divided by the total number of questions of each section to get a composite score from 0 to 1. As all items in each section were optional, only questions that were answered by each participant were factored into this calculation. However, we also ran a sensitivity analysis excluding all participants with Tables S2 and S3 . Second, we used the same procedure to calculate a total score across all answered questions from any of these sections-once again, excluding unanswered questions from this analysis. Using these scores, we than ran both unadjusted and adjusted Binomial Logistic Regression models ('glm' function of the 'stats' package) to determine whether likelihood of being diagnosed with autism differed based on each of the subsection healthcare inequality scores or the total healthcare inequality score. We ran this in the whole population, as well as in sex-stratified AFAB and AMAB groups, respectively.

In addition to affecting healthcare quality itself, these experiences are also contributing to far greater rates of anxiety, shutdowns, and meltdowns associated with common healthcare experiences than among non-autistic people. Further, this is the first study to quantify that these issues exist individually and are also clear when aggregated into a health inequality score (overall and for each of the sub-domains). The results replicate findings from earlier cross-sectional studies of medical databases and self-report surveys to suggest that autistic assigned female and assigned male at birth individuals have increased risks of mental and/ or physical health conditions compared to sex-matched peers [4, 12] . This includes 1.6-5.4 times increased risk of arthritis, breathing concerns, neurological conditions, anorexia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) among autistic compared to non-autistic assigned female at birth individuals, as well as 3.0-16.8 times increased risk of anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, insomnia, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and self-harm among autistic vs. non-autistic sex-matched groups. When using a p-threshold of < 0.001, there were no significant differences in risk of physical health conditions between autistic and non-autistic assigned male at birth groups. However, previous studies suggest otherwise [4, 7, 11] , and the study supports increased risk of arthritis, breathing concerns, diabetes, heart conditions, and neurological conditions among autistic compared to non-autistic assigned male at birth individuals when using a less stringent p-threshold of 0.05. The sample is heavily biased toward assigned female at birth individuals (comprising approximately 63% of both the autistic and non-autistic groups). This was expected based on the study methodology, as they are more likely to participate in online, self-report survey studies [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, taken together, these factors suggest that the lack of significant differences in lifetime prevalence of physical health conditions between assigned male at birth groups may be due to underpowered analyses.",

These findings emphasize differences in demand and perceived access to healthcare between autistic and non-autistic adults, despite some indicators of similar levels of basic healthcare coverage. This discrepancy may be accounted for by complex care needs accompanied by systemic issues, noted previously by both providers and autistic adults themselves [19, 27] . In addition, it may be a result of sweeping differences in self-reported healthcare quality between autistic and non-autistic adults, overall and in the areas of sensory experience, communication, anxiety, access and advocacy, and system problems. Notably, these differences are so stark that the derived healthcare quality score can predict autism diagnosis with 72% accuracy and 94% sensitivity in unadjusted regression analyses.",

There were no significant differences in healthcare quality before and during the pandemic among autistic adults. This may be representative of the consistency of healthcare quality for autistic adults over time-or these analyses may have been underpowered, as this sub-sample included a relatively smaller proportion of participants whose most recent healthcare appointment occurred after the onset of the pandemic. When using a less stringent p-threshold of 0.05, non-autistic adults' healthcare improved after the onset of the pandemic across at least one measure. Specifically, non-autistic adults were more likely to endorse the statement ''The healthcare professional attempted to help me OR odds ratio, 95% CI 95% confidence interval, Sig. significance level, ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, SAD seasonal affective disorder, PTSD posttraumatic stress disorder a Binomial Logistic Regression adjusting for age, ethnicity, education, and country of residence P-value: < .001 = * ; < .0001 = ** ; < .00001 = *** with my symptoms' after the onset of the pandemic than they were before. All other measures of healthcare quality were not significantly different for non-autistic adults before and after the onset of the pandemic. One of the defining features of autism is differences in social communication, and the study supports that these differences may affect perceived healthcare quality. Autistic adults are far less likely than non-autistic adults (specifically, 20-36% as likely) to report being able to describe their symptoms, understand what their healthcare professional means, or bring up a healthcare concern if not prompted by a healthcare professional. They are also over twice as likely as non-autistic adults to report not asking all the questions they would like to when meeting with a healthcare professional. While the study focuses on perceived healthcare communication from the perspective of the patient, it has also been suggested that differences in social communication may contribute to two-way communication difficulties between autistic and non-autistic individuals (perhaps related to the 'double empathy' problem) [38, 39] . There is some evidence that these challenges may apply in healthcare settings, as physicians have previously noted that challenges with communication with patients as well as caregivers can serve as barriers to care [19] . The study is not able to test directly whether this phenomenon could apply in a healthcare context, as we did not collect data from healthcare providers as part of this study. Future research should consider perceived communication between patients and providers from both perspectives, in order to understand these dynamics more clearly and develop appropriate strategies for both parties to improve communication.",

Their relevance to healthcare has been recognized previously in studies of healthcare professionals and qualitative accounts from autistic adults [19, 23, 26, has not yet been investigated in large, comparative samples of autistic and non-autistic adults. Strikingly, for every 10 non-autistic participants that reported being able to describe how their symptoms, pain, or sensory sensitivities feel in their body to healthcare professionals, only 2-4 autistic participants reported the same.

            "text": "While this is the largest study of healthcare experiences of autistic adults, as well as the first large-scale study comparing their experiences to those of non-autistic adults, there are several limitations that should be kept in mind. First, these results relate to perceived differences in healthcare quality among autistic and non-autistic adults-rather than information about the number of appointments or average expenditure. Differences in social communication are a core feature of autism. As such, autistic individuals may be more candid about their experiences than others, which may partly explain differences in perceived healthcare quality. Second, the results of this study are not generalizable to the entire autistic population. Due to the use of a lengthy, online, self-report survey, the study is unlikely to represent the experiences of autistic individuals with moderate to severe intellectual disability, those without internet access, or those that are not able to fill in a lengthy online survey. Third, the sample was biased toward assigned female at birth individuals, UK residents, white individuals, and those who had completed an undergraduate degree or higher education-limiting its applicability to other groups. Fourth, the study employed a cross-sectional, convenience-sampling design and the recruitment via autism databases and social media likely left the study open to sampling bias. Therefore, it is possible that these biases may have resulted in under-or over-estimations of true group differences in prevalence of health conditions or healthcare quality. Fifth, while the study attempted to recruit adults from the general population for the study as a comparison group (particularly using advertisements without initial mentions of autism on Facebook and Reddit), the non-autistic group may be biased toward individuals with an interest in autism, undiagnosed autism, or those who suspect that they may have autism. To mitigate this risk, all individuals were excluded (from both the autistic and non-autistic groups) who reported self-diagnosing autism, suspected autism, or were awaiting autism diagnosis. In addition, the mean AQ-10 scores and Wilcoxon signed rank test results reported in Table 7 show clear delineation between autistic and non-autistic groups (as well as between autistic vs. non-autistic assigned female at birth individuals and autistic vs. non-autistic assigned male at birth individuals, respectively), in regard to autistic traits. Still, it is possible that the results may underestimate true group differences between autistic and non-autistic adults regarding lifetime prevalence of health conditions or healthcare quality. Finally, the study may be subject to winner's curse, a phenomena common to epidemiology and genetics in which odds ratios are artificially inflated for the first study reporting a significant difference than later studies of the same group; as such, future research should work to confirm these findings and effect sizes. As noted for several reasons above, the point estimates and effect sizes reported above may not be representative of true risk between autistic and non-autistic adults, underlining the importance of future studies that employ a variety of methodologies. However, the present study shows the widespread group differences between autistic and non-autistic adults in self-reported quality of healthcare.",

As such, healthcare systems are not only failing to provide appropriate care to autistic adults, but also that these failures may be detrimentally affecting the length and quality of life of autistic individuals. Future research should focus on determining whether healthcare quality directly relates to poorer health outcomes. It is urgent that individual healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations, and policymakers work cooperatively with autistic patients and advocates to develop and implement strategies that improve healthcare quality and access.",
