This study described the weekly fluctuation from day to day of moral distress, coping, and general health in frontline HCWs who worked during the first epidemic wave (May-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Methods: This study has an intensive longitudinal design, and a convenience sampling procedure was employed to enroll physicians, nurses, allied health professions, and healthcare assistants. Data collection was performed using diary encompassed four sections: a socio-demographic form (required only at the baseline data collection) and three scales to assess moral distress, coping, and general health. Results: Results confirmed poor perceived health and mild moral distress in frontline HCWs, especially in HCWs with offspring, during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and the stability of their daily perception over a working week regarding moral distress, general health, and avoidant coping strategy, while approach coping strategy reported a slight fluctuation over time. Conclusions: Accordingly, on the one hand, these results confirm that outcomes regarding mental health and moral distress are pretty stable and provide insights, on the other hand, regarding the possible organizational interventions to support approach coping strategy as it seems more susceptible to variation over time.

Moral distress is a negative feeling, such as guilt and worry, that occurs in acute healthcare crises triggered by the inability to provide optimal care (11) . On the one hand, moral distress of frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder, low job satisfaction, intention to leave the profession, and physical symptoms, such as sleep problems (12) .

More precisely, despite some prospective longitudinal studies describing the short-and mid-term trajectory of outcomes referred to the HCWs' wellbeing and mental health, there is a lack of intensive longitudinal descriptions (16) . Thus far, the available longitudinal studies have mainly collected data considering the national-specific epidemic peak of waves of the COVID-19 pandemic; in this regard, the intensive longitudinal studies aimed at highlighting the fluctuation from day to day in responding to the challenges brought by the pandemic are still under-described (17) . An underlying assumption in the studies performed considering large time intervals for data collection (e.g., months between an epidemic peak and the following peak) is that the investigated constructs have some stability over time. However, if behaviors might theoretically show fluctuations as strongly dependent upon situational working conditions, the overall underlying assumption of stability of constructs might be misleading for phenomena such as moral distress, coping, and general health (if not empirically corroborated), undermining the possibility to interpret the current longitudinal descriptions of these aspects adequately (18) .",

Precisely, approach coping encompasses any behavioral, cognitive, or emotional activity directed toward managing a threat (e.g., problem-solving or seeking information) (25) . The fluctuations of approach coping strategy scores within the weekly data collection might reflect the need to take appropriate actions to face working challenges after distress levels have been subsided e when appropriate actions might have the chance to produce positive effects on solving challenging tasks (25) . In other words, approach coping strategy requires adequate levels of self-awareness (i.e., conscious knowledge of a specific situation and one's own feelings). These aspects suggest that positive environmental characteristics, such as high levels of interprofessional functioning, might help HCWs face challenging situations by employing an approach coping strategy (26) . Therefore, approach coping strategy appears to be the coping strategy more susceptible to be sustained by organizational interventions aimed at supporting interprofessional functioning, empowering HCWs (27) .",

On the one hand, in HCWs with offspring, the feeling that their work might be dangerous for their offspring (\"parenting stress\") for the risk of infecting them might have triggered moral distress responses (31) . On the other hand, the same feeling might enhance psychological distress, undermining the perception of an individual's health. For these reasons, during extraordinary situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, providing organizational and personal support to frontline HCWs (e.g., nutritional support for the family at home, solving accommodation and transportation problems, providing adequate personal protective equipment for joining the family) might be considered as a strategy to support the sound management of the pandemic, as well as the other disease containment measures.",

Given these results, long-term evaluations are required, and effective strategies sustaining the broad wellbeing of frontline HCWs are necessary with a long-term perspective to sustain HCWs in the current challenges, such as vaccine roll-out programs and community-based interventions to promote health literacy and adherence to health authorities recommendations (34) .",

First, the sample size was not powered to detect between-subject differences; for this reason, some detected interactions might be underestimated, such as in considering interprofessional patterns and differences. Second, some variables describing the daily organizational context, such as clinical complexity mean scores of the patients, staffing level, skill mix, task assignment, interprofessional functioning, have not been collected to avoid overwhelming participants. These variables could act as confounders if not controlled, and collecting organizational-level variables might have allowed researchers to perform multi-level analyses, which could be helpful to enrich the knowledge between theorized interaction from organizational context to approach coping strategy, the only unstable measurement over the weekly assessments, and the other measured variables. For this reason, future research should be powered for multi-level data.",

On the one hand, these results confirm that outcomes regarding mental health and moral distress are pretty stable and provide insights, on the other hand, regarding the possible organizational interventions to support approach coping strategy as it seems more susceptible to variation over time. Providing organizational and personal support to frontline HCWs should be considered a priority to sustain the sound management of the pandemic over long-term periods. Future research should be focused on describing in-depth the interactions between organizational context and approach coping strategy to detect an evidence-based framework encompassing the elements that might be enhanced to stimulating higher levels of approach coping strategy in frontline HCWs and containing adverse effects of job demands.
