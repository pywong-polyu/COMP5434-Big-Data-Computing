            "text": "Chloroquine (CQ, an antimalarial drug with anti-inflammatory properties) is a wellknown lysosomotropic compound. Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivatives came into the spotlight of the clinical interest in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [1] [2] [3] . By chemical nature, CQ belongs to cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs); it is a weak base due to its chemical properties (partition coefficient clogP = 4.63, and the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant, pKa, is equal to 10.1). CQ easily goes through membranous compartments and accumulates in acidic organelles where it is protonated and trapped, yielding an increase in the pH of this environment. Lysosomes are regulators of lipid metabolism [4] , and intact autophagy is required for the maintenance of lipid homeostasis in the endothelium [5] . CQ with its inhibitory effects on lysosomes and autophagy [6, 7] has a considerable influence on lipid metabolism, emerging as a key regulator of inflammation [8, 9] , proliferation [10] , hypoxia [11] , fat buffering [12] , stress responses [13] , and also endothelial cell death [14] . Pathological states, which result from endothelium perturbations, are mainly cardiovascular and metabolic complications [15] . CQ inhibits autophagy, but knowledge of the autophagy modulation by CQ in the endothelium is limited [16] . Therefore, it is not known whether CQ, by influencing the lysosomes and/or autophagosomes, leads to abnormalities in the metabolism of lipids in the endothelium. CADs are thought to alter the gene expression by hindering the activity of lysosomal phospholipases and enzyme transport but increasing the production of phospholipids, cholesterol, and even drugs or their metabolite accumulation. CQ as a member of CADs induces changes in cell metabolism and leads to phospholipidosis, defined as a lysosomal storage disorder [17] resulting in abnormal accumulation of phospholipids in tissues and lamellar body formation [18, 19] .",

Thus, reduced viability of cells ( Figure 1A ) was not the effect of inflammatory responses that were detected as an overexpression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or vWF. In turn, fluorescence staining for neutral lipids (LipidTox, Figure 1C ) showed a statistically significant increase (ANOVA; p \u2264 0.05) in the number of cytoplasmic lipid spots in the cells treated with CQ, and the effect was most pronounced at the concentration of 30 \u00b5M. . CQ affected cell viability at 50 \u00b5M, had no effect on vWF, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 overexpression, and increased the neutral lipid content (ANOVA, p-value < 0.05).

Increased Lyso-Tracker fluorescence intensity was observed for cells treated with CQ (1, 10, and 30 \u00b5M), as shown in Figure 2 . It has been previously demonstrated that increased LysoTracker intensity in response to CADs was related to lysosomal biogenesis and/or increased lysosomal activity [16] . It is possible that treatment with highly alkaline lysosomotropic compounds increased the number of lysosomes in cells in response to increased cellular pH. However, in our study, LysoTracker intensity in cells treated with 30 \u00b5M CQ decreased in comparison to those exposed to 10 \u00b5M CQ. That difference is probably related to CQ accumulation, observed by means of Raman imaging, described below. CQ at a concentration of 30 \u00b5M increased the number of lysosomes, but then accumulated in their interior area, causing its neutralization and subsequently decreasing the fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker. A slight decrease in LysoTracker intensity at 30 \u00b5M CQ in comparison to 10 \u00b5M may also suggest that the Golgi apparatus could be disrupted, but to verify this issue directly, further studies are required.",

            "text": "LysoTracker fluorescence intensity was observed for cells treated with CQ (1, 10, and 30 \u00b5M), as shown in Figure 2 . It has been previously demonstrated that increased LysoTracker intensity in response to CADs was related to lysosomal biogenesis and/or increased lysosomal activity [16] . It is possible that treatment with highly alkaline lysosomotropic compounds increased the number of lysosomes in cells in response to increased cellular pH. However, in our study, LysoTracker intensity in cells treated with 30 \u00b5M CQ decreased in comparison to those exposed to 10 \u00b5M CQ. That difference is probably related to CQ accumulation, observed by means of Raman imaging, described below. CQ at a concentration of 30 \u00b5M increased the number of lysosomes, but then accumulated in their interior area, causing its neutralization and subsequently decreasing the fluorescence intensity of LysoTracker. A slight decrease in LysoTracker intensity at 30 \u00b5M CQ in comparison to 10 \u00b5M may also suggest that the Golgi apparatus could be disrupted, but to verify this issue directly, further studies are required. In this paper, two types of HCS LipidTox staining were applied -LipidTox Deep Red Neutral Lipid Stain ( Figure 1C ) and LipidTOX Green Phospholipidosis Detection Reagent ( Figure 3 ), both suitable to study toxic side effects of compounds on lipid metabolism in mammalian cell lines. According to the manufacturer, the LipidTox Deep Red has high specificity to neutral lipids and an extremely high affinity for neutral lipid droplets. The LipidTOX Green Phospholipidosis Detection Reagent is dedicated to phospholipidosis Autophagosomes, with pH around 6 [21] , could also affect the fluorescent intensity of LysoTracker. In the context of CADs, this hypothesis was discussed before, since CQ is widely used as an autophagy inhibitor [6, 22, 23] . The acidic vesicular organelles could be a marker of autophagy, connected to the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain (LC3); therefore, to confirm the hypothesis about the relation between CQ and Autophagosomes, with pH around 6 [21] , could also affect the fluorescent intensity of LysoTracker. In the context of CADs, this hypothesis was discussed before, since CQ is widely used as an autophagy inhibitor [6, 22, 23] . The acidic vesicular organelles could be a marker of autophagy, connected to the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain (LC3); therefore, to confirm the hypothesis about the relation between CQ and autophagy, we performed immunocytochemistry for LC3 ( Figure 4 ). As expected, the CQ-treated cells at 10 and 30 \u00b5M concentrations were characterized by much larger LC3-positive structures compared to the control cells. The lipidated form of LC3 (known as LC3-II) is usually linked to the mature stage of autophagosomes. The autophagosome formation results in LC3 cleavage into LC3-I, which may be later transformed into a lipidated form by conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (L3-II). The LC3-II incorporated into autophagosomes is a clear indicator of autophagy, which may lead to the late stage of autophagy, including autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and/or lysosomal degradation [24] . CQ resulted in late autophagic inhibition by impairing autophagosome-lysosome fusion, similar to bafilomycin A 1 [25] . It was believed that those two compounds may block autophagy by a lysosomal pH increase, reducing the activity of lysosomal enzymes and their degradation capacity as a result. However, in [6] , the authors claimed that autophagy inhibition by CQ indirectly comes from Golgi disorganization and the effect on endosomal function [6, 23] . Therefore, increased autophagosome accumulation demonstrated in Figure 4 is consistent with previously reported results. At a lower CQ concentration (1 \u00b5M), fluorescence specific for LC3-possitive structures was not observed, but LysoTracker staining showed changes in the lysosomal and acidic structures of cells treated with 1 \u00b5M CQ (p-value < 0.0001).

CQ treatment caused accumulation of lipids within the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear region. In Figure 5 , Raman images show the distribution of selected biochemical components of the cells and CQ, based on the integral intensity of characteristic bands for each chemical species. Raman images showed cellular CQ at a concentration 30 \u00b5M, clearly indicating its lysosomotropic properties based on characteristic 1563 cm \u22121 band (as well as 1378 cm \u22121 -data not shown here) assigned to \u03bdC = C in quinoline and \u03bdC = C in the \u03b4CH quinolone of CQ [26] . The integration map of the band at 718 cm \u22121 for the choline moiety (v sym (N + (CH 3 ) 3 ) shows the distribution of choline-containing lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, the major phospholipids in eukaryotic cells [27] . Integration of the band at 2850 cm \u22121 reflects the overall lipid distribution and abundance (vCH 2 in the range of 2830-2900 cm \u22121 ). The nucleus was visualized by integration of a band characteristic of nucleic acids (v asym (O-P-O) at 785 cm \u22121 ). Regions in Raman images with an increased content of lipids and choline-containing lipids after stimulation with CQ show similar distribution in the perinuclear region, such as LysoTracker, LC3, and LipidTox (Figures 1-4) . These results clearly showed that CQ, a well-known lysosomotropic drug, induced an increase in the cellular lipid content.

This approach enabled us to extract average spectra from cell organelles that vary in biochem- The number of spots related to lipids in general and choline-containing lipids in particular, as well as their Raman intensity, was noticeably higher after the treatment with 10 and 30 \u00b5M of CQ ( Figure 5 ), which was confirmed by the increased fluorescence intensity of LipidTox Phospholipid Green staining ( Figure 3 ).

            "text": "Even though some general similarities in the lipid profiles observed in the Raman images of lipid deposits were found, their composition varied between used concentrations of CQ. The main differences are related to the presence of 426, 701, and 741 cm \u22121 (characteristic bands for cholesterol [32] ) and 1750 cm \u22121 (C=O stretching band indicates esterified form) bands, which indicate the presence of cholesterol esters [32] in lipid accumulations, detected after incubation with CQ 10 and 30 \u00b5M. Moreover, the spectra of lipids found in cells treated with a higher CQ concentration manifested a typical spectral profile of unsaturated lipids by the presence of 1266 cm \u22121 (\u03b4 = CH), 1660 (vC = C) cm \u22121 , and low intensity of 3005 cm \u22121 Raman features. The spectral shape and ratio of 1266/1305 or 1660/1440 cm \u22121 suggested monounsaturated lipids in the composition [32, 33] . For lower CQ concentrations, the protein content affected the spectroscopic signal from the class of lipid accumulations. Protein traces in the lipid deposits in cells treated with 1 \u00b5M CQ can be related to biological and technical aspects. The appearance of proteins in lipidic structures might be expected due to the presence of specific proteins associated with their structures as observed for lipid droplets. CQ treatment increased the content of choline-containing lipids in the perinuclear region ( Figure 7B ) but did not affect the nucleic acid signal intensity from the nuclear class as shown in Figure 7C . Raman imaging does not provide an adequate spatial resolution to investigate proteins exclusively attached to cellular or subcellular membranes, since the recorded Raman signal must be averaged from the whole volume of spots. Raman intensities of lipid accumulations and associated proteins can be related to protein aggregation around those structures. The technical aspect of mixed signals from lipids and proteins is related to the lateral resolution of the Raman system, applied sampling density, and finally, the voxel size that can also affect the average signal collected not only from the focal plane of lipid accumulations but also from the area above and/or below. Average spectra of lipid accumulations identified in cells treated with CQ are presented in Figure 7 . A direct comparison of spectra from 1, 10, and 30 \u00b5M of CQ-treated cells indicates increased intensities of the typical Raman signature of lipids (described above) and choline-containing lipids (718 cm -1 ).

The lipid accumulations were characterized by in vitro Raman and fluorescent analyses of HMEC-1 cells treated with CQ at a micromolar range of concentrations. Spectral profiles of lipid deposits strongly depended on the CQ concentration. However, there was no linear relationship between the total amount of cellular lipids and the concentration of the drug. While choline-containing lipid signals increased for all cells treated with CQ, Raman features of cholesterol esters (characterised by bands at 426, 701, 1750 cm \u22121 ) and an increased total lipid content (a band at 2850 cm \u22121 ) were observed in the endothelial cells treated with the higher CQ (10 and 30 \u00b5M) concentrations. The important observation of this study was the demonstration that endothelial cells treated with CQ showed an increased content of lipids with the choline moiety (718 cm \u22121 ) in the perinuclear region. Fluorescence and immunofluorescence (LysoTracker and LC3) staining confirmed the accumulation of lysosomes and autophagosomes in the endothelial cell exposed to CQ, suggesting that the occurrence of lipid deposits was related to lysosomotropism and autophagy inhibition by CQ. Further studies are needed to understand better the link between changes in lipid composition and accumulation in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region with the mechanism of autophagy in the endothelial cells.",
