COVID-19 is severely affecting peoples' lives on multiple levels and its consequences in terms of physical and psychological health are yet to be fully quantified. Nevertheless, some studies have begun to highlight the severity of the psychological effects determined by the pandemic outbreak. For example, moderate to severe psychological distress was reported in 53.8% of the study population involved in the recent study by Wang and colleagues on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and severe symptoms of anxiety were additionally reported in about one third of the participants [1] . Similarly, other studies reported high predominance of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress [2] along with poor sleep quality and even PTSD symptoms [3] as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the pandemic outbreak has produced-and is still producing-drastic effects on both the health system, which is facing a serious over-burdening, and the economic system, with a worldwide increase of poverty, social inequality and unemployment.",

Here, we sought to investigate this question by focusing on a specific decision-making phenomenon, known as temporal discounting (TD), that has been massively studied across several fields of investigation for its pervasiveness in daily life decision scenarios and implication for economic [5] , clinical [6] and social domains [7] . TD reflects the decay over time of the subjective value of rewards and it is usually studied using intertemporal choice tasks, in which participants are required to choose between a smaller but immediately available monetary reward vs. a lager but temporally delayed one [8] . Considerable variations have been shown in the extent to which human participants select/prefer an immediate vs. a delayed reward, with the specific pattern of choice preference varying on a continuum between farsighted (i.e., strong preference for delayed reward) and discounter behavior (i.e., strong preference for immediate reward). Importantly, temporal discounting has been extensively described as a trait-like variable, for the specific features of being (i) relatively stable over time, while exhibiting developmental and experiential changes; (ii) correlated across different decision domains and type of rewards; (iii) associated with activity in particular brain regions and certain genetic markers [9] . Indeed, because of its trait-like characteristic, the discounting pattern of preference has been associated with the spectrum of addictive disorders [10, 11] and several suboptimal life behaviors [12, 13] .",

For example, discounting behavior may encourage the pursuit of immediate benefits (i.e., sense of freedom) at the expense of long-term goals (i.e., reduction of the spread of the virus). In contrast, farsighted behavior might favor the adherence to restrictive measures due to the temporary postponement of short-term benefits (e.g., going out, visiting family and friends, traveling and enjoying freedom, etc.) in favor of a future greater benefit (e.g., health, end of the pandemic etc.)",

For example, the perceived level of risk may impact upon the willingness to adhere to containment measures. A recent study, for example, employed a task measuring the delay discounting of containment measures as a function of the perceived risk, showing that the perception of risk influences the discounting of compliance with isolation [14] . Similarly, Cannito and colleagues reported an increase in the discounting of disposable masks as compared to money, suggesting that the feeling of scarcity experienced during the pandemic determined myopia (i.e., shortsighted decisions) when choosing a pandemic-relevant commodity (i.e., face masks) [15] . Based on this reasoning, as a second aim of the present study, we sought to examine the association between the individual risky behavior and the attitudes about uncertainty associated with the pandemic outbreak, such as confidence in the future, perceived risk and confidence in the containment measures. Finally, we also investigated whether these variables modulated the main relationship between the individual patterns of choice preferences (i.e., discounting rate) and the Contagion Risk Index.",

As mentioned above, the current result was quite surprising considering that steeper discounting functions are typically associated with the pursuit of immediate gratification within suboptimal lifestyle routines (e.g., savings behaviors [36] , employment decisions [37] , educational investment [38] , energy conservation [7] , and financial decisions [5] ), sub-optimal life behaviors (e.g., obesity [39] , smoking [40] ) and clinical conditions (e.g., drug [10] and alcohol [11] abuse, gambling disorder [26] ). In particular, we expected that participants with a preference bias for immediate but smaller rewards (i.e., discounters) would be more likely to engage in behavioral patterns associated with the pursuit of immediate gratification (e.g., going out and meeting people) at the expenses of greater future gratification [41] . Interestingly, Wismans and colleagues also found that discounting preferences were positively correlated with both hygiene and social distancing compliance, while a negative relationship was found in the case of impulsivity [42] . Hence, these results appear in line with our study in suggesting higher compliance with COVID-19 regulations associated with steeper discounting functions (i.e., discounter behavior).",

Indeed, while the adoption of protective devices and social distancing reduce the probability of contracting the virus, they still do not guarantee the future reward of being safe.

People who underestimate the risks, who believe that keeping distance, wearing masks and being cautious are pointless restrictions of their freedom, or who just believe that everything is going to be fine and the pandemic is only a flash in the pan, clearly take a greater number of risks, which has an impact upon our collective ability to protect ourselves from the virus. Institutional Review Board Statement: Data were treated according to the European regulation GDPR n. 2016/679 and according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical review and approval were waived due to the lack of time to manage the request, given the tight timeframe in which the data collection had to be carried out. Participation was voluntary and electronically informed consent was acquired via the completion of the questionnaire. Participants could withdraw from the survey at any moment without providing any justification. The study was conducted with anonymous data sampling.",
