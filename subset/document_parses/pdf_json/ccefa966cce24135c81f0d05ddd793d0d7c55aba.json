One example, proposed early in the pandemic, is immunity passports, or documents verifying an individual's immunity to the novel coronavirus (based on antibody testing) and conveying increased rights, such as travel or return to work, for the individual with immunity. 1 Another example is mandatory service in a health corps or a compulsory draft for young individuals to be trained as first responders and essential workers to provide aid during the pandemic. 2 This paper considers another such extraordinary measure: allow certain groups of people to choose to be intentionally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to isolate and receive medical care in designated facilities ('safer infection sites'), where their risk of infecting others is minimised. Those who use safer infection sites will know the time and place of their infection, thus reducing their risk of asymptomatically transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to other people. For example, a doctor on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response, worried about unwittingly bringing the virus home and infecting their loved ones, could avoid this outcome by using a safer infection site. This option might be particularly valuable to those who live with people at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness.",

However, use of safer infection by other groups may also be defensible, such as other essential workers who are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially if they have inadequate protections in the workplace, do not have access to SARS-CoV-2 testing or live with people at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Also, given the high prevalence of 'at-risk' behaviours exhibited on many campuses so far during the Fall 2020 semester, use of safer infection by college students may also have value. Another population at significant risk of asymptomatic transmission is children attending day care and school. Given the significant harms associated with school closure and children's low risk of severe COVID-19 illness, children could be deemed a high priority population for intentional infection. One might even consider making safer infection sites available to people in general, following the logic of harm reduction. People are going to frequent bars, have parties and engage in other forms of social activity that pose a risk of virus transmission and even 'super spreader events'. In addition, there is anecdotal (though admittedly unverified) evidence that some people are intentionally trying to infect themselves with SARS-CoV-2. 3 Perhaps we should accept the inevitability of this risky behaviour and at least try to make it safer, by offering people safer infection.",

Safer infection would not be defensible for a group that has ready access to less risky ways of preventing infection and/or transmission, such as adequate workplace protections, a safe and effective vaccine (which has been shown to prevent infection and transmission, not just to reduce severity of disease) or highly accurate rapid testing. This paper sketches out the general case for safer infection sites, using the USA as a case study and considers their use by healthcare workers, healthy children, college students and the general Extended essay population. We consider ethical arguments for and objections to safer infection sites. It is worth emphasising at the outset that there are key empirical unknowns that must be resolved before advocating for safer infection sites-in particular, whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides lasting immunity to reinfection and how long people are infectious after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given these unknowns, the aim of this paper is not to advocate for safer infection sites but rather to consider 'in principle' arguments for them.",

Such facilities could be state funded and staffed or could be run by private entitles with oversight by public health authorities. For example, a national health service could run safer infection sites. Or a university, after approval from a local health department, could designate a dorm to be a safer infection site, hire healthcare workers to staff it and fund the whole operation themselves.",

Early data from the United States Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that at least 1/3 of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and result in 40% of the total viral transmission. Recent studies now show that at least three quarters of transmission occurs in the early days of infection, with almost half occurring when individuals are still asymptomatic. 4 Although some proportion of these individuals may go on to develop symptoms, live coronavirus sheds at high concentrations from the nasal cavity even before symptom development. 5 Thus, without equivocation, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a significant source of infection.",

It is conceivable-though speculative-that offering safer infection could be an incentive for students to return to campus, thus enabling universities to avoid financial losses. Other institutions might benefit from staged safer infection, in which small groups of workers are successively safely infected, helping the institution avoid the bad outcome in which the virus hits the workplace and infects many coworkers at once, undermining the institution's performance. The current White House administration narrowly avoided this scenario when President Trump contracted the virus after attending a largely maskfree event in the Rose Garden in late September. 6 The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, recognised this incident as a superspreader event, one in which the virus circulated within a wide orbit of President Trump's contacts. Many of Trump's high-level military, national security advisors and legislative members of the Republican Party (also known as the GOP) were exposed and placed in quarantine.",

He presents modelling results showing that, under certain assumptions about COVID-19 (which may or may not be accurate), a strategy of intentionally exposing young people while quarantining old people reduces deaths by 40%. 7 In this paper, we do not consider, nor do we endorse, mass use of intentional infection as a disease control strategy. Another respect in which safer infection sites could have public health value is that they offer a readymade population in which to conduct 'natural history' studies. Data could be collected on a daily basis of how the disease manifests in different people, how it evolves over time and individual characteristics that are associated with different manifestations of disease. Thus, even if the primary argument for safer infection site would be the benefits they offer to individuals, an ancillary benefit is the social value of research that could be conducted.",

Studies of SARS-CoV, a genetically similar virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, may help inform this discussion. Antibody testing for SARS-CoV, for instance, shows that immunity for this virus peaks at 4 months and offers protection for 2-3 years. 11 Thus, it may turn out that SARS-CoV-2 infection provides immunity for 2-3 years; however, safer infection sites would only make sense once there is additional evidence of immunity and more clarity about the duration of immunity. For the sake of argument, we assume that there is evidence that infection provides lasting immunity of known duration (eg, several months) and considers the case for safer infection given that assumption.",

We could also make workplace and school environments safer in other ways-for example, by having high-quality air filtration systems and mandating the use of masks. We could reduce infected people's risk of transmitting the virus by developing highly accurate rapid tests and making these widely available-in which case, people could simply isolate once they test positive and would not need to deliberately infect themselves in order to know when they were infectious. More generally, is not a better way of reducing asymptomatic (as well as symptomatic) transmission of the virus to have an effective public health response?

Shortages in PPE still exist, and in some products are worsening, in the USA, as supply chain deficiencies have yet to be solved. 12 As a result, hospitals, nursing homes and other medical practices have had to acquire supplies through back channels and expend time decontaminating disposable masks and gloves. Not to mention, these one-time use products, which are now being used until ineffective, increase healthcare workers' risk of disease exposure. As for 'Test-Trace-Isolate', some have questioned whether it is realistic to stand up sufficiently robust contact tracing efforts in all places, for in states in the USA with relatively weaker public health systems. 13 In May, most US states were not on track to have enough testing and contact tracing capacity. 14 Only 17 states have made some amount of staffing and/or transmission data publicly available, suggesting that 33 states continue to lack capacity for adequate contact tracing. While rapid tests are beginning to be deployed, these tests remain unavailable to many Americans, especially those who are asymptomatic. 15 In addition, even if protective measures are available, people may not follow them assiduously enough to minimise risks of infection and transmission. For example, an essential worker might have coworkers who do not reliably use PPE, would not get tested regularly and would not self-quarantine if exposed to a SARS-CoV-2-positive person. Offering this essential worker access to safer infection allows them to protect their families from infection even if coworkers are not willing to follow the rules.",

            "text": "It is also worth considering how a robust public health response might affect workers and students. Currently, there remains a significant rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in some areas, with the US case number nearing 7 million. If infection is already widespread in an area, a robust testing and contact tracing effort would investigate a large number of cases and identify a large number of contacts, who are asked to quarantine at home for 10-14 days. Many contacts will not actually be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and they might subsequently be exposed again and asked to quarantine again. Thus, some individuals could be asked to quarantine repeatedly, especially those whose work involves a higher risk of exposure. As more children return to school and the weather gets colder (which is likely to increase transmission), more cases may be discovered in schools and more schoolchildren asked to quarantine at home from school for 10-14 days. This repeated quarantine would be extremely burdensome. Will workers receive paid leave from work each time, if they are not legally entitled to it? When exposed individuals do turn out to be infected, how will they reliably avoid infecting the people they live with while they isolate at home? As COVID-19 cases continue to spread across the USA at a variable rate, it has been possible to conceive of a scenario where robust implementation of a 'Test-Trace-Isolate' containment strategy could be financially and practically burdensome on essential workers. Safer infection sites offer another alternative to those people who have a high Extended essay occupational or social risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. They could intentionally infect themselves, isolate away from their households while they recover and subsequently avoid transmitting the virus to others, potentially having to quarantine repeatedly and potentially losing wages.",

For example, a blog post published by the American Medical Association discusses this fear and how '(using PPE and following proper hand hygiene) are the things that you can do to not get sick and not bring anything home to your family'. 21 Healthcare workers have also intentionally separated from their families, moving into their garage or into a hotel, because they 'do not want to put (their family) at risk or, God forbid, get them sick'. 22 One healthcare worker lived in a pop-up truck camper in the hospital parking lot to avoid infecting her family. 23 This is a particular concern for healthcare workers who live with highrisk people, for example, people who live with pregnant partners or older parents. In the words of one nurse, 'There is a tremendous amount of fear and guilt that we could bring this home and hurt people that we love\u2026We have had colleagues who lived with elderly parents, who unfortunately have gotten sick and have had their parents get sick and passed'. 24 Safer infection sites would allow healthcare workers to avoid unwittingly transmitting the virus to their household members, to coworkers or to patients. This might be especially important for some healthcare workers, such as those who work in skilled nursing facilities, which have been hard-hit by severe COVID-19 illness and are a major source of COVID-19 mortality. Reports suggest that up to 1/3 of all virus-associated deaths are nursing home residents or workers. 25 Is it ethical to offer safer infection to healthcare workers? Or does intentional infection with SARS-CoV-2 simply pose too high a risk to healthcare workers, and thus it would be indefensible to encourage healthcare workers to take this risk by giving them access to safer infection sites?",

It is difficult to estimate a healthcare worker's cumulative risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic. Recent CDC data estimated over 160 000 healthcare workers have been infected in the USA, with 710 dying of the virus. 26 Notably, healthcare personnel status was only available for 24% of the total cases, indicating that this number could be up to 80% higher. From other sparse evidence, there was a 1% infection rate (over the period 1 January to 9 February) among healthcare workers in a hospital in Wuhan, China; early data from the Netherlands supported this 1% infection rate. 18 19 Frontline healthcare workers in some settings will be exposed to and caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 for a year or 2. Over this period, their cumulative risk of infection will depend on many factors, including the percentage of patients with SARS-CoV-2, the availability of PPE and other protocols in their clinical settings. However, it is reasonable to assume that the cumulative risk of infection will not approach 100%; thus, use of a safer infection site increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

This question is under discussion by bioethicists and researchers considering controlled human infection studies of SARS-CoV-2, in which volunteers would be intentionally infected with the virus as part of controlled studies of experimental vaccines and treatments. Expert opinion is mixed about whether the value of that research justifies the medical risks to healthy volunteers. 28 29 But at least some bioethicists consider it justifiable to intentionally infect young, healthy volunteers with SARS-CoV-2 as part of valuable research, so long as the medical risks are minimised by offering them medical care and isolating them for 14 days. 28 29 The intentional infection of young, healthy healthcare workers at their request differs in two important respects from the infection of young, healthy volunteers as part of medical research. First, many healthcare workers face a higher risk of infection at baseline than the average person; thus, as compared with study volunteers, they are undertaking less additional risk by being intentionally infected. Second, in the scenario we imagine, healthcare workers intentionally infect not because this provides social value, but because it reduces risk to their loved ones, avoids disruption to their home life, afford them peace of mind or has other benefits for them personally. Thus, the ethical issue is not whether it is ethically acceptable to encourage volunteers to altruistically undertake risk as part of a socially valuable research endeavour, but whether it is ethically acceptable to enable healthcare workers to undertake risk in order to benefit themselves and their loved ones. They are risking their health to do essential work, and many are under severe emotional and psychological strain. If safer infection provides them with greater peace of mind, reduces the disruption to their home lives, poses a level of medical risk deemed acceptable in other contexts, and healthcare workers make use of safer infection only after giving informed, voluntary consent, then there is a prima facie case that offering safer infection is ethically defensible.",

Up to a third of children who test positive are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, 30 making schools potential sites of asymptomatic transmission. In France, where schools were temporarily opened to a million students, a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases was seen after just a week, leading the country to close schools again. 31 On the other hand, early evidence suggested that children are less likely to transmit than adults and are not the 'super-spreaders' of the coronavirus as they are for the seasonal influenza. 32 For example, in New South Wales, they have kept schools open and across 10 schools with 12 cases, they found that only 1 in 695 was infected from these cases. 33 Despite this preliminary evidence, a more comprehensive study of OVID-19 paediatric patients conducted by the Massachusetts General Hospital provided critical data showing that children most likely play a larger role in the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 than previously thought. Their finding from nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that children can carry a high viral load, making them more contagious to others, regardless of their susceptibility to developing signs and symptoms of infection. 34 Even if available data suggest that in-school transmission is rare given proper precautions, schools are nonetheless remaining closed in some places because of the risk of transmission or the inability of schools to put proper precautions in place. (This is true in the USA as we write this in October 2020.) These school closures have negative effects on children, their families and the economy. 35 Children are missing significant educational opportunities that could potentially impact the rest of their lives, by impacting their cognitive development, social development and later earning potential. 36 Children, especially those living in poverty, are missing out on food, healthcare and other key services provided by schools. Schools provide children with physical protection against harm; with schools that serve as important abuse reporting centres closed, there has been a 50% decrease in calls to a statewide hotline for suspected abuse. The economy cannot reopen broadly with the workforce at home caring for their children. 35 Opening schools sooner rather than later will have widespread, multifaceted and significant benefits.",

Investigation into the children who are requiring ICU-level care revealed that 83% had underlying medical conditions. Chronic medical conditions among children are different from those among adults (eg, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease) and instead commonly involve developmental delay, inherited or genetic abnormalities and/or dependence on life-support technologies such as tracheostomy. 41 However, this risk, though small, is still orders of magnitude higher than the risks associated with vaccination of children, our standard means of ensuring widespread immunity to disease. Surveillance of vaccine-related adverse events has borne out vaccines' safety, though adverse outcomes in children do rarely occur. The risk of anaphylaxis, or a sudden, potentially lifethreatening, allergic reaction, does exist, although it is extremely rare in all age groups. One study found that the rate of anaphylaxis to be 1.31 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.84) per million vaccine doses or 0.000131%. While an estimated 2% ICU admission rate of known paediatric infections with SARS-CoV-2 may seem relatively insignificant, incidence of anaphylaxis after vaccine injection is less than 1/10 000 of the rate of ICU admission for children with SARS-CoV-2, for example. 40 In addition, our understanding of the COVID-related risks to children is still evolving. Beginning in May of 2020, there was an increasing number of cases of a disorder connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This autoimmune-like illness causes capillary leak, end-organ dysfunction and potential long-term cardiac, endovascular and pulmonary damage and even death. 40 So far in the USA, there have been almost 1000 documented cases of MIS-C with 19 deaths. 42 Research on genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 might reveal a mutation that is associated with an increased risk of developing MIS-C. 43 In that case, children can be genotyped prior to admission to a safer infection site and only those at low risk of developing MIS-C would be eligible.",

However, if they were enabled to intentionally infect and thereby become immune to SARS-CoV-2, they could return to school without posing this risk.

Many schools have elected to suspend in-person classes after having started with in-person attendance. The virus spread rampantly from one student to the next amidst fraternity parties. Waves of students on college campuses are becoming infected with the virusinadvertently, apathetically or recklessly. As of September 2020, there have been 88 000 cases linked to college campuses in the USA and at least 60 associated deaths; over 150 campuses have reported at least 100 cases. 44 Colleges have responded by not opening for classes at all, suspending classes for the semester, isolating students who tested positive in 'COVID-19' dorms or quarantining entire groups of people following a known exposure event. 45 Safer infection could have multiple benefits for college students and their contacts. It could prevent them from infecting others (eg, parents at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness). It would allow them to interact with each other and engage in sports and other extracurricular activities without fear of spreading the virus, which would have mental health and social benefits for them and give them a more typical college experience. If a sufficient number of students on a campus engaged in safer infection, this could reduce the chance of widespread infection, reducing rates of illness among students themselves, faculty, staff and workers who keep the colleges functioning (eg, food service and sanitation workers) as well as local restaurants and businesses. There would be economic benefits for the colleges and local communities if infection rates were low enough to allow colleges to remain open or to 'reopen' at greater capacity.",

When she saw park-goers being shamed on social media during the statewide lockdowns, she was reminded of the shaming gay men faced for having sex during the height of the AIDS crisis-an attitude that was both ethically problematic and unproductive. Marcus argues that it is unrealistic for people, who are social beings, to remain shut-in to their house for months on end. The real task, then, is to understand how we can mitigate the risk of contracting the virus as people venture out. Enabling people to meet with friends while wearing masks in a public park, for instance, is better than having them meet indoors, which they might do in response to public shaming. 48 Here, we have taken this idea of harm reduction to its logical conclusion, in the form of safer infection sites for the coronavirus. We can see this use of safer infection sites as analogous to safe injection sites or supervised consumption sites for illicit drug use: drug use is a risky behaviour of self and others, just as engaging in risky social behaviours during COVID-19 or intentional self-infection are risky behaviours for self and others. In the case of drug use, supervised consumption sites are places where community members can use illicit drugs while having access to clean supplies (eg, clean needles) and the supervision of trained personnel to respond in cases of overdose. 49 Over 100 peer-reviewed studies support the efficacy of supervised consumption sites in decreasing infections, overdose deaths and the corresponding costs of emergency services and hospitalisations. Analogously, perhaps safer infection sites could reduce the harm that individuals pose to themselves or others.",

However, the logic underlying safe injection sites and clean needle exchanges is that drug use is inevitable-as the thinking goes, individuals with active addiction will use; it is only a matter of how and when. Whether the same logic applies to intentional infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unproven as of yet, as there is only anecdotal evidence of people intentionally infecting themselves. Others against harm reduction strategies often take a more moralistic stance, and the concept of safer infection sites would not be immune from the usual objections.
