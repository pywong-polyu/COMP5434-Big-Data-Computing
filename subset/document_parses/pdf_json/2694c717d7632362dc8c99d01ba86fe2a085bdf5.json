Since the 18th of March 2020, these data have been made publically available for potential COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by members of the public. Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission. This is a particularly pressing issue as lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted and evidence of disease resurgence must be constantly reassessed. We further assess the correlation between NHS Pathways reports and a publicly available NHS dataset of COVID-19-associated deaths in England, finding that enquiries to 111/999 were strongly associated with daily deaths reported 16 days later. Our results highlight the potential of NHS Pathways as the basis of an early warning system. However, this dataset relies on self-reported symptoms, which are at risk of being severely biased. Further detailed work is therefore necessary to investigate potential behavioural issues which might otherwise explain our conclusions.",

These assessments are either completed via calls to 111 and 999 (which are respectively for non-urgent, and urgent medical problems), or through 111-online self-completed reports. The fraction of assessments corresponding to actual COVID-19 cases is unknown, but in the absence of wide-scale testing, the NHS Pathways dataset may be one of the best available proxies for COVID-19 incidence in the community.

This dataset contains daily numbers of calls to 111 and 999, as well as 111-online reports that were classified as potential COVID-19 cases by the triage algorithm. This algorithm follows a symptom-based approach, where the respondents are asked a series of questions to self-report their symptoms until an end point is reached, or the call is handed to a clinician [6] . Some individuals might report symptoms multiple times through the system, therefore the number of reports are not directly equivalent to the underlying number of cases. The number of reports are stratified by Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), gender and age group (0-18, 19-69 and 70-120 years old) of the patients. We mapped the CCGs to their corresponding NHS regions using publicly available CCG data [7] , and used this geographic resolution for our analysis.

After this, it becomes unclear if cases are still declining as confidence intervals of r and R e include the threshold values for growth / decline (respectively, 0 and 1) in all NHS regions. Trends in COVID-19 associated deaths in England showed more variation between NHS regions than the Pathways reports, with one potential explanation being differing fatality risk amongst cases due to age and comorbidities. As a national total, the number of reported deaths was found to be strongly correlated with the number of reported 16 days prior. However, if these data are to serve as an early warning for potential disease resurgence, further investigation will be required to ascertain whether this correlation holds beyond this period of decline in both trends which we have analysed here.",

In reality, self-reporting could be strongly biased by behavioural issues, such as the effect of news coverage which might lead individuals to pay more attention to their symptoms and report them. Inversely, individuals could reduce their perception of the risk of the disease over time as they become used to hearing about it daily, which would decrease their likelihood of noticing and reporting symptoms. Similarly, differences in self-reporting behaviours across various age groups would likely bias the age composition of the potential COVID-19 cases reported here.",

Therefore, the data we considered here most likely reflect the epidemic as a whole, rather than just in the community.

However, the more recent estimates of R e suggest that transmissibility might have increased again since, such that it is no longer clear that case incidence is declining. The main limitation in interpreting this result is that as true incidence reaches low levels in the population, the relative proportion of false positives among potential COVID-19 cases reported through NHS Pathways is likely to increase. In fact, if there were no more cases but an approximately constant number of false positives, the analysis of NHS Pathways data would estimate R e to be around 1. Nevertheless, the observed changes in estimated transmissibility over time, together with the potentially strong correlation between NHS Pathways reports and COVID-19 deaths time series suggest that future changes in R e could possibly be reflected in NHS Pathways data. Moreover, we found that, for the time period covered by our analysis, the NHS Pathways data were a good predictor of COVID-19 deaths reported 16 days later, making this data source a good candidate for designing early warning systems in the upcoming weeks as lockdown restrictions are progressively lifted in England. Further work is now needed to test whether this correlation holds outside a declining epidemic, and to investigate potential behavioural issues which might otherwise explain the trends we have highlighted in our analysis.",

A majority of all reports (86%) came from individuals between 19 and 69 years old (Figures S3 and S4) . Despite some temporal variation, the proportion of cases from this age group exceeded proportions in the general population in all NHS regions ( Figure S4 ). The proportion of reports of potential cases aged 0-18 years old decreased rapidly in all regions from mid-March (about 20%) to early April (about 10%). We note that the proportion of reports for 0-18 years old was lowest between the 9th and 23rd April, which corresponds to the period where reports from this age group were not included in the 111-online subset of the data. However, since this age group represents a minority of total reports, and reports for other age categories were also decreasing at that time ( Figure S5 ), this lack of reporting is likely not responsible for the overall negative growth rates we presented in our results. .
