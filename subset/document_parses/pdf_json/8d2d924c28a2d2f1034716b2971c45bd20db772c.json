At the end of 2020, the first immunization doses reached the population; 604,032,357 doses of vaccine had been administered by April 5, 2021 1 . Worldwide efforts resulted in the development of several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 with various distinct antigen delivery systems (non-replicating viral vector, protein subunit, inactivated virus, and mRNA) 2,3 . As of April 2021, CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China) was the most administered in Brasil 5 , using the inactivated virus as a component of the vaccine 2,3 . As the vaccine was administered across the complete range of ethnicities, comorbidities, and ages, phase I/II trial results may not perfectly reflect vaccine response times and seroconversion rates.",
