Chest x-ray for the patient showed patchy infiltrates in the right lung. The patient was admitted under Internal Medicine service as a case of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, which was later confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and was put on Enoxaparin 40 mg daily, IV fluids and acetaminophen upon admission according to hospital protocol. On day three of admission, patient started to have increased respiratory effort and was requiring oxygen support via high flow nasal cannula. He was then admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and his enoxaparin was increased to a therapeutic dose and was started on steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluid. A 16 Fr Foley's catheter was inserted for monitoring urine output and was a routine measure in all ICU patients. After 3 days in the ICU the patient became stable and was transferred to general ward. He noticed that he has a constant painless erection that he thought it is caused by the Foley's catheter and did not report it to hospital staff. Because of the high volume of COVID-19 patients and as a safety precaution, physicians did most of their rounds via Telemedicine video calls. Therefore, genital exams were only done when there is a complaint made by the patient. After spending 21 days in the hospital the patient was ready for discharge, and while removing the patient's Foley's catheter in preparation for discharge, the primary physician noticed the erection and the Urology team were consulted for suspected priapism. The patient reported that he has been having a constant erection for at least 10 days, which he noticed after Foley's catheter insertion. He denied any history of, pain, trauma, use of erectile dysfunction (ED) medications or treatment. He denied any voiding difficulty after removing the Foleys or prior to his admission. Patient vitals were stable. On examination, patient had a hard erection, no skin changes were noticed, no discoloration or tenderness. Patient labs revealed leukocytosis of 18.6 mostly neutrophils and platelet count of 470. Aspiration with 18 French gauge needle was difficult due to increased blood viscosity however, we managed to withdraw about 10 ml, which had no effect on the erection rigidity (Fig. 1) . Blood gases sent from the penis came back with PH = 6.86, pCO2 = 33.3 and, pO2 = 26.9 confirming and diagnosis of ischemic priapism. Phenylephrine 200 \u03bcg was then injected into the corpora cavernosa twice 3 minutes apart, and aspiration was continued until detumescence was achieved (Fig. 2) . The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics and was discharged 2 days later. On follow-up 2 weeks later via phone call, patient was still under home isolation and reported having nighttime erections with desire, no sexual encounters or ejaculation and, having mild itching at the aspiration site.",

The risk of VTE caused by factors such as inflammatory response, activation of the coagulation cascade and by the virus itself. The high number of activated cells by SARS-CoV-2 leads to an increase in blood viscosity [5] . Increase in the neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio appears to be related to disease severity [7] . This increase in blood viscosity may lead to obliteration of the small emissary veins in the subtunical space and subsequent ischemic priapism [3] .",
