Given that the emergency medicine reserve demand is affected by various factors during the public health events and thus the observed data are composed of different but hard-to-distinguish components, the traditional demand forecasting method is not competent for this case. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the EMD-ELMAN-ARIMA (ELA) model which first utilizes Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to decompose the original series into various components. The Elman neural network and ARIMA models are employed to forecast the identified components and the final forecast values are generated by integrating the individual component predictions. For the purpose of validation, an empirical study is carried out based on the influenza data of Beijing from 2014 to 2018. The results clearly show the superiority of the proposed ELA algorithm over its two rivals including the ARIMA and ELMAN models.",

            "text": "Given that the emergency medicine reserve is one of the strategic materials to deal with large-scale public health events, emergency medicine reserve management plays an important roles in building up the emergency response capacity. Intuitively, in case of a public health event, the lack of emergency medicines probably wastes valuable rescue time and results in much more loss. For example, at the end of 2017 when the influenza virus was rapidly spreading in several regions of China, the specific medicine \"Duffy\" was out of stock due to the unexpected demand surge, e.g., a shortfall of 310,000 boxes of \"Duffy\" only in Beijing. However, overstocking emergency medicines also leads to some major problems like the great stock cost and huge expiration cost. Only with the medicine reserve decision based on the accurate demand forecast, can the above problems be effectively solved. However, the emergency medicine reserve demand is affected by the mixed effects of very complex factors like seasonality, response speed, virus transmission rate (in case of an epidemic), communication network of the people, among others. Consequently, the observed data are composed of different but hard-to-distinguish components; therefore, the traditional demand forecasting method does not work for this case, which presents China Food and Drugs Administration (CFDA) an urgent challenge to optimize the safety stock of emergency medicine reserve. Motivated by the above theoretical as well as practical concerns, this work aims to propose a new forecast algorithm of more accuracy based on the decomposition-ensemble methodology.",

            "text": "The most widely applied paradigm of forecasting the medicine demand is composed of two phases. The first phase predicts the number of infected cases (persons) while the second generates the forecast of the quantity of medicine demand based on the outcome in the first phase. In terms of forecasting the number of the infected cases, system dynamics models and statistical models are the two mainstream approaches to predict the number of patients in public health events. The most typical system dynamics model is the classic SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick, which lays the foundation of infectious disease dynamics [1] . Since then, infectious disease dynamics models have experienced a rapid development, many variants have emerged, like SEIR model considering epidemic latency [2] , SIQR model considering isolation term [3] , etc. System dynamics models considered the evolution law and transmission characteristics of public health events, but the prediction accuracy of the models depends on the predefined epidemic transmission mechanism and the parameter settings. Besides, the dynamics of the parameters are expressed by linear models, which cannot capture the non-linear relationship among factors in the epidemic transmission process. Although some studies have tried to simulate the individual behavior and social network in the system with the help of complex network models, such as the random network, small-world network and scale-free network [4] [5] [6] , these models do not apply to the large-scale systems subject to high complexity.",

In the study of influenza incidence prediction, Rao et al. collected the data set of a reported influenza epidemic of hospitalized children in a certain hospital, identified the characteristics of the prevalent influenza virus subtypes in different months, seasons, years, and patients' age, and finally used ARIMA model to make the short-term prediction [13] . Wu et al. constructed a stochastic forest regression model for predicting the weekly incidence of influenza-like illness [14] . Furthermore, Tapak et al. made a comparative evaluation of different models for predicting influenza outbreaks, the result showed that neural network was better in outbreaks detection, and time series models had promising performances [15] . In the study of forecasting the incidence of hepatitis B, Wang et al. found that ARIMA model showed better forecasting performance than GM(1,1) model [16] . Zheng et al. showed that ELMAN model was superior to ARIMA (0,1,1) model in predicting the incidence of hepatitis B in Guangxi through comparative experiments [17] . In addition, Wei et al. announced that the ARIMA-GRNN mixed model performs better than the ARIMA model and the GRNN model in predicting the incidence of hepatitis [18] .",

However, these kinds of models are heavily dependent on the historical data, which explain why a statistical prediction model shows inconsistent performance in different studies. The \"data-driven\" nature makes the input data dominate the outcome of the statistical models, namely \"garbage in garbage out\". To provide the suited input data, it is necessary to decompose the original data into different components and select the statistical model according to the component characteristics. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) provides a way to solve this problem. EMD is an analysis and processing method for non-linear and non-stationary signals [19] and has been successfully applied in a wide range of fields, such as energy, finance, agricultural products, hydrometeorology, mechanical fault diagnosis, and so on [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Second, the denser population and complex movement of people within cities accelerate the spread of epidemic, with the spread of online public opinion, the sales of emergency medicines will show a stronger surge character. Finally, the needs of emergency medicines are also extremely urgent, as the availability of emergency medicines cannot be delayed after the disease outbreak, the lack of emergency medicines reserve tends to fuel social panic, which can lead to more serious social problems.",

In addition, considering the rapid population movements, frequent trade and commerce, and rapid development of the cities, premature demand data do not provide much guidance for the current forecast results.

There are many factors that affect the number of people affected by a public health event, for example, the number of people infected by a specific influenza outbreak may be influenced by temperature, moderation, population density, mode of transmission, precautions, and other factors. Therefore, the original time series tends to comprise very complex components, which renders a big challenge for the forecasting task. Despite that it is proved that including the key factors into the model can improve the prediction results [40, 41] , it is impossible to identify and quantify all the factors, consequently some useful components cannot be captured by the traditional models and are ignored as noise, which lead to unsatisfactory performance of the traditional models. To overcome the above problem, inspired by the studies [42, 43] , this paper uses Empirical Modal Decomposition method (EMD) to decompose the original data. EMD is an adaptive method suitable for processing non-stationary and non-linear series. EMD is totally data-driven and enjoys advantages compared to wavelet decomposition owing to its non-parametric nature. Out of the original data, a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) can be extracted, which provides more insight into the dynamics of the data and facilitates the forecasting work.",

This model employs EMD decompose the original series of cases (patients) into different components, then reconstructs all the components into several combinations to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Subsequently ELMAN neuro network and ARIMA are applied to the suited combinations by \"trial and error\" according to the characteristics, like linearity and nonlinearity in this study. Finally, the forecast of the emergency medicine reserve demand is generated with a projection coefficient by the rule of thumb. To validate the model, with the support of CFDA and Beijing CDC, an empirical study was carried out based on the weekly data of influenza cases in Beijing from 07/08/2018 to 25/12/2018. The results clearly show the superiority of the proposed ELA model over its rivals, which indicates the potential of the ELA model to be a more powerful tool for emergency medicine reserve management. It is notable that although this work promotes better understanding of applying the decomposition-ensemble paradigm to the emergency medicine reserve forecast work, some important issues are left to the future studies. For examples, when EMD generates a large scale of components, it is infeasible to identify the best combinations by \"trial and error\". Moreover, there are some optimization problems to be solved in the future, like the optimal length of forecasting horizon, the optimal number of individual models to be integrated, the optimal size of training set, and so forth.",
