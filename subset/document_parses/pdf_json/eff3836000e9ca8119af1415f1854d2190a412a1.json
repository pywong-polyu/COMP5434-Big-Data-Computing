SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks human alveoli and causes severe lung infection and damage. To better understand the molecular basis of this disease, we sought to characterize the responses of alveolar epithelium and its adjacent microvascular endothelium to viral infection under a co-culture system. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused massive virus replication and dramatic organelles remodeling in alveolar epithelial cells, alone. While, viral infection affected endothelial cells in an indirect manner, which was mediated by infected alveolar epithelium. Proteomics analysis and TEM examinations showed viral infection caused global proteomic modulations and marked ultrastructural changes in both epithelial cells and endothelial cells under the co-culture system. In particular, viral infection elicited global protein changes and structural reorganizations across many sub-cellular compartments in epithelial cells. Among the affected organelles, mitochondrion seems to be a primary target organelle. Besides, according to EM and proteomic results, we identified Daurisoline, a potent autophagy inhibitor, could inhibit virus replication effectively in host cells. Collectively, our study revealed an unrecognized cross-talk between epithelium and endothelium, which contributed to alveolar-capillary injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These new findings will expand our understanding of COVID-19 and may also be helpful for targeted drug development.",

As of early October, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 33 million individuals and caused more than 1 million deaths (World Health Organization, 2020). Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects human lung and causes severe injury and inflammatory changes. Within the intra-alveolar spaces of COVID-19 deaths, pneumocytes desquamation, proteinaceous exudate, interstitial inflammation, and lymphocytes infiltration is frequently detected [1] [2] [3] [4] . Alveolus is the functional unit of lung, which plays vital roles in gas exchange and prevention of pathogen invasion [5] [6] [7] . It is mainly composed of epithelial layer and extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries. The alveolar epithelium, its adjacent pulmonary microvascular endothelium, and extracellular matrix between them can form an alveolar-capillary barrier, serving as a host barrier. Though SARS-CoV-2 infection is localized primarily to the respiratory system, there is an increasing evidence of systemic dissemination of the virus to multiple organs, such as gastrointestinal tract, peripheral blood, urinary system, and so on [8] [9] [10] . All these clinical and pathological clues suggest the function of alveolar-capillary barrier is compromised in COVID-19, leading to the leakage of virus to the circulatory system.",

Currently, scientists have conducted a lot of works to elucidate SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interaction mechanisms by means of proteomics and bioinformatics, such as drawing SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map in host cells, developing network based-approach on HCoV-host interactome, and building a computational repository of SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interaction mechanisms [15] [16] [17] .

SARS-CoV-2 infection could activate antiviral and immune responses in epithelial cells and up-regulate proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL1\u03b1 and interferons (IFNs). These cytokines may be released to extracellular space, and further induced damage (immune responses) of adjacent microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, based on proteomic analysis and EM data, we found autophagy pathway was modulated in SARS-CoV-2infected cells. We tested some autophagy inhibitors, and identified Daurisoline had an obvious antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in host cells.",

The results showed, in both HPAEpiC cells and HULEC-5a cells, except for the nucleus, the largest proportion of DEPs were located in mitochondria, followed by endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of DEPs annotated to distinct sub-cellular compartments was performed to determine the potential relationships between DEPs. PPI network showed proteins within nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus underwent dramatic changes following viral infection in both cell types, and some DEPs were associated with at least one other protein ( Fig. 6a; Supplementary Fig. 3) .",

We then detected the mitochondrial ROS levels of mock-or SARS-CoV-2-infected HPAEpiC cells stained by mitoSOX Red fluorescent dye (a mitochondrial ROS indicator). As Fig. 6c showed, compared with mock-infected HPAEpiC cells, mitochondrial ROS level was significantly elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, especially the cells detected by viral Spike protein. It has been reported that ROS can diffuse from already damaged or activated cells to cells nearby, acting as an intercellular messenger 35, 36 . Therefore, we tested the extracellular ROS level for culture supernatants of HPAEpiC cells and HULEC-5a cells following viral infection by an ELISA kit. The results showed viral infection caused a very mild increase of extracellular ROS level (p > 0.05) in HPAEpiC cells (Fig. 6d) ; while viral infection had no effect on extracellular ROS level in HULEC-5a cells at all (Fig. 6e) . This result indicated ROS may not be the intercellular messenger that mediated the injury of HULEC-5a cells. At the meanwhile, proteomic analysis showed eight proteins annotated to responses to oxidative stress were significantly up-regulated in HPAEpiC cells following viral infection (Fig. 6f) . Among the 8 modulated proteins, we identified IL1\u03b1 which was annotated to response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0000302).",

Notably, we found some endoplasmic reticulum showed co-localization with viral particles in infected epithelial cells. Based on a research of SARS-CoV, nucleocapsids of SARS-CoV are firstly assembled within lumen of rough endoplasmic reticulum during viral replication 44 . Given SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV on evolution, SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar life cycle to SARS-CoV. Besides, we also detected an increase of peroxisomes in the infected epithelial cells. Peroxisome is a metabolic organelle with vital functions in deactivation of toxic substances and lipid metabolism 45 . A study reported enveloped viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1, can induce the biogenesis of peroxisomes for phospholipid plasmalogen synthesis, thereby enhancing virus production 45 . As SARS-CoV-2 has an envelope, and the increased peroxisomes may be related to virus replication as well. While, direct viral exposure had no obvious effect on pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. But, treatment with culture supernatant from infected alveolar epithelial cells seriously injured the endothelial cells, including mitochondrial over-fragmentation, decreased Golgi apparatus and disrupted adherent junctions.

Given the vital roles of these organelles in energy metabolism, protein and lipid synthesis, disturbance of these organelles may significantly affect the host cells. We reasoned the regulated proteins which were important for viral replication would be common to different cell types. By combining our proteomic data with published data 26 , we identified 13 overlapping DEPs which were shared in both HPAEpiC cells and Caco-2 cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intriguingly, among them, five proteins were located on mitochondria. This finding indicated mitochondrion may be a commonly hijacked organelle by SARS-CoV-2 across different infected organs. Western blot showed, two of the five commonly modulated mitochondrial proteins, NDUFA4 and TIMM23 were down-regulated in HPAEpiC cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the meanwhile, fluorescent assay indicated mitochondrial ROS level was elevated in the infected cells. According to published papers, elevated ROS can induce expression of IL1\u03b1 37, 38 . Here, we proposed a hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupted mitochondria and caused ROS over-production, and excessive ROS could induce IL1\u03b1 expression and secretion to extracellular space, which further affected adjacent microvascular endothelial cells.",
