It has had a devastating effect around the world, not only for public health, but also for the economy, labor market, and other facets of individual and societal life. Health systems have been put under high strain, and health professionals have experienced unusual and stressful work circumstances. With the aim of drawing lessons for nursing education, the present study analyzed, during the weeks of peak infection in Spain, the stress experience and coping strategies of a sample of 403 nurses from the Spanish health system. Specifically, we analyzed how tenure, stress appraisal, problem-focused coping, and support-seeking coping predicted nurses' awareness of their education needs, both in terms of technical-professional knowledge and skills and transversal skills. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that more tenure (years of experience) was related to lower stress appraisal (workload, \u22120.12, p < 0.05; insufficient preparation, \u22120.33, p < 0.001; and fear of contagion \u22120.36, p < 0.001) and more problem focused coping (PFC) strategies were related to higher awareness of professional (0.18, p < 0.01) and transversal educational needs (0.17, p < 0.01) while support seeking strategies just related to transversal training needs (0.10, p < 0.05). Moreover, the participants provided valuable input about specific contents to be considered in future nursing education programs. Implications for redesigning the nursing degree curriculum are analyzed in the discussion section.",

In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel pneumonia appeared in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and since then it has spread all over the world, which has led to lockdown measures in many countries. In a short period of time, the pandemic emerged and grew in every continent, and the peaks moved from East to West and severely strained the health systems of most countries. In Spain, the 'state of alarm' caused by the COVID-19 outbreak was declared on the 14th of March 2020, and at that point most of the medical centers were already saturated. It is not just a health crisis because it has also important social, economic, and labor market impacts [1] .",

In Spain during the months of April and May 2020, the period where we carried out the survey of this study there was overwhelming patient demands. The situation was worsened by a lack of appropriate infrastructures, equipment, and resources, and the urgent need to adapt management systems [5] .

In this crisis, they play an important role facing complex COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization, often with preexisting health vulnerabilities and complications or mortality [7] . Thus, they work under physical and emotional pressure, putting their lives at risk while fulfilling their duties [8] , especially when the protective equipment and safety procedures are insufficient and the work context is somewhat disorganized and chaotic. In this overwhelming context, it is important to study nurses' work experiences, their main sources of stress and their strategies to cope effectively. Moreover, based on previous pandemics, such as influenza, Yonge et al. pointed out that \"there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic\" [9] (p. 24) thus, they claim that research should address \"how emergency management principles can be incorporated into nursing curriculum\" [9] (p. 28). In the COVID pandemic context this question arose from the real situation where recent graduates were suddenly hired to work in hospitals.",

In addition, considering a detailed analysis of the psychological correlates we aim to identify significant predictors of the individual nurse's views on this important anticipatory coping [10] . This coping strategy aims to prepare future nurses to cope professionally with the pandemic demands. Specifically, we first aim to identify the individual views about the education provided in nursing studies related to infectious disease outbreaks, in terms of both professional knowledge and transversal soft skills, such as communication with patients and management uncertainty under time pressure. Second, we also aim to identify relevant personal and work experience variables during the COVID-19 crisis to identify their predictor role on the views about nurses' education needs. Thus, the research question is: during the COVID-19 pandemic, what relevant experiential antecedents at work influence nurses' awareness of professional education needs related to pandemics and mass causality emergencies (MCE). We also aim to clarify how these experiences unfold to influence their views on those needs.",

However, the needs and concerns of nurses and other health professionals in these types of crises have not been fully described in the literature [11] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, the work context suddenly changed dramatically, and professionals had to work with insufficient resources, ward and intensive care unit (ICU) shortages of beds and equipment, and an overload of infected patients. All of this led to the reorganization of services and processes, with limited effective coordination and management, a lack of personal protective equipment, and uncertainty about infected cases due to a lack of tests to identify them because some could be asymptomatic.

            "text": "Several theories of stress shed light on these stressful conditions. More specifically, the job demands-resources model [12, 13] states that when at work demands are higher than the resources available to effectively fulfill them, the distress increases. Thus, this model clearly predicts higher levels of stress in these circumstances. The demands are extremely high in several ways. This includes the quantitative work overload due to the large number of patients [14] . The qualitative overload was also high, due to a lack of knowledge and high uncertainty about the virus and routes of infection, treatments, and the severity of the effects and consequences [15] . There were severe emotional demands due to the fear of infection and concern about being a potential carrier of the virus to their own family [16] , as well as demands in dealing with people who are dying [14, 15, 17] . The stress was exacerbated by a shortage of resources. This was apparent and it was identified in a survey to health professionals (N = 2495) carried over by the foundation/institute for the sanitary assistance improvement (IMAS) [18] . First, there was a shortage of external resources, in terms of facilities [19] , equipment, and staff [20] to provide decent service. There was also a shortage of other external resources to protect the health professionals working in health services. Second, personal resources were appraised as insufficient by some professionals, such as limited knowledge and qualifications for the unexpected and excessive uncertainties about the disease and treatment [9, 21] . There were also changes in the work characteristics, with staff moving from their own service to respond to the new demands and job requirements [18] . Of course, occupational experience and tenure represented an important asset for health care professionals. First, professional experience is related to knowledge, skills, and competencies that are helpful when dealing with uncertain situations and problems. Second, the longer the experience as a health professional, the greater the possibility of having faced previous infection epidemics and crises, such as the SARS epidemic in 2003 or influenza A H5N1 in 2008-2009. This experience is a resource for managing stress in these uncertain circumstances. We assume that the years of practice will have a negative relationship with the level of stress appraisal in the special circumstances of this pandemic [7, 8] .",

            "text": "The conservation of resources (COR) theory [22] provides a theoretical base to study nurses' stressful experience. According to this theory, \"stress occurs (a) when central or key resources are threatened with loss, (b) when central or key resources are lost, or (c) when there is a failure to gain central or key resources following significant effort\" [22] (p. 103). Moreover, one important principle of this theory states that \"when people's resources are outstretched or exhausted, they enter a defensive mode to preserve the self which is often defensive, aggressive, and may become irrational\" [22] (p. 106). During the pandemic, people experienced an important loss of key resources such as employment [23] . Health professionals also experienced threats to personal (e.g., the lack of school for their children) and professional resources (e.g., the regular type of work and the normal levels of safety) [18] . Even more importantly, they experienced fear due to the risk of important losses. Most stressful experiences occur when professionals are confronted with outbreaks of lethal infectious diseases and are afraid of getting infected (or infecting others) [16, 24] . Within this context, \"nurses may experience high levels of psychological and emotional stress because health care systems will vary in their capacity to operate during large-scale public health emergencies\" [11] (p. 347). At the same time, the chronic and overly taxing situation drives the nurses' body, mind, and spirit into a state of tension, anxiety, and fatigue, and when these experiences cannot be alleviated over time, burnout may become a health problem [14] . Therefore, research is needed to study nurses' stress in this complex, unexpected, and threatening situation. Recent empirical evidence has shown that nurses who supported COVID-19 treatment in Wuhan experienced tremendous pressure. Their stress was higher when they worried about their families, spent a higher number of hours per week working, and experienced higher anxiety while working [14] . Koh et al. [25] , in a comprehensive systematic review of healthcare workers' perceptions of risk in previous pandemics, found that health professionals experienced stress due to their personal exposure to health risks and the threat this represented for their loved ones. They also reported stigmatization by their neighbors as a social source of stress because of their exposure to respiratory infectious diseases. These authors found that \"organizational implementation of infection control measures, avoidance of patients and complying with personal protective equipment were identified as risk-mitigating strategies\" [25] (p. 403).",

Thus, years of experience, as an indicator of tenure, may be considered a significant antecedent of stress due to high demands and low personal resources.

            "text": "The response to the COVID-19 outbreak during the peak period of the pandemic required great effort from nurses to cope with these stressful experiences. Coping is a crucial element in the stress process because it plays a relevant role in the development of its consequences. Lazarus and Folkman [26] defined coping as cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands appraised as taxing or as exceeding the person's resources [26] (p. 141). As Rodr\u00edguez et al. [10] state, \"coping with stress is a fundamental element that determines the capacity to reduce and control the damage and costs that stress can provoke\" [10] (p. 87). Literature has distinguished several types of coping. Dewe [27] classified the different types into two simple groups: problem-focused coping (PFC) and palliative or emotion-focused coping. PFC refers to a response of attempting to eliminate a perceived threat. Indeed, the most effective prevention strategy for work stress-related outcomes is to reduce sources of stress at work. Palliative or emotional coping aims to lessen the emotional discomfort triggered by the situation. Greenglass, Fiksenbaum, and Burke pointed out that palliative-focused coping often produces inconsistent results, and they recommend isolating social-support seeking from other types of emotional coping [28] . A meta-analysis by Viswesvaran, Sanchez, and Fisher [29] indicated the important role of social support in coping with stress. In the context of this research, it is worth examining the potential role of support-seeking coping (SSC). Several authors have pointed out that, instead of viewing some coping strategies as superior to others, it is important to adapt them to the particular demands and context [30] .",

We assume, especially in this highly threatening situation, that the skills to cope with the problems are important resources of nurses. In fact, nursing students faced with high perceived demands more often used coping behaviors that focused on the problem itself than those that focused on emotion [31] . However, the lack of personal resources reduced the motivation to initiate problem-focused coping strategies [32] . Thus, when stress resulted from the lack of capacity to deal with the demands, direct problem-focused coping (a stress-management strategy based on qualification to suppress the stressor) was less likely to occur, and other strategies such as support-seeking coping were expected to play a more significant role.

Successful services sector employees must possess a depth of understanding about their professional field (the vertical part of the T), and they must also have a fundamental understanding of the other disciplines they collaborate with (the horizontal part of the T) [36] and \"stronger communication and teamwork abilities than ever before in order to succeed in complex, global organizations and networks\" [37] (p. 543). Taking these vertical (technical and professional) and horizontal (interdisciplinary and transversal) parts into account, we aimed to identify the nurses' awareness of education needs related to pandemics and crises for nursing students. Awareness of education needs may become clearer when nurses cope with stressful demands and situations. Therefore, the need for competent professional preparation will also become more salient. In a similar way, when trying to cope with a stressful problem by looking for support from other colleagues, the importance of professional resources obtained through education may become more evident. In line with this rationale, we formulate the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 4. The higher the problem-focused coping, the higher the perceived need for education in both professional and transversal knowledge and skills.",

The scales were formulated after several interviews with nurses and nursing teaching staff to ensure face and content validity, and both scales showed satisfactory reliability (0.79 each). Construct validity was tested with a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showing that the data corresponding to the three items from the professional training needs factor and those corresponding to the transversal training needs factor showed a good fit to the model (\u03c7 2 = 9.64, df = 6, p < 0.001; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.06; goodness-of-fit index (GFI) = 0.97; adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) = 0.92; incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.99).",

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was computed with AMOS 26.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) [44] to test the hypothesized model with the maximum likelihood estimation method. The input for each analysis was the covariance matrix of the items. The goodness-of-fit of the model was evaluated using absolute and relative indices. The absolute goodness-of-fit indices calculated were: (1) the chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) goodness-of-fit statistic; (2) the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA); (3) the goodness-of-fit index (GFI); and (4) the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) [45] . Since the \u03c7 2 test is sensitive to the sample size, the calculation of relative goodness-of-fit indices is strongly recommended [46] . The following relative goodness-of-fit indices were calculated: (1) incremental fit index (IFI) and (2) comparative fit index (CFI) [47] . Since the distribution of the GFI and the AGFI is unknown, no statistical test or critical value is available [45] . As a rule of thumb, values near 0.08 for RMSEA indicate an acceptable model fit, and those smaller than 0.08 indicate a good model fit [48] . Relative fit index values greater than 0.90 indicate a good fit [49] . Finally, because data were all self-reported, there were concerns that the results might be influenced by common method variance. The danger is that at least some of the observed covariation between them may be due to the fact that they share the same method of measurement. Therefore, using IBM-AMOS 26.0, a Harman's one-factor test was conducted [50] .",

            "text": "The present study analyzed and extracted lessons from professional nursing practice during the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain that are relevant for nursing education. Our study aimed to identify the experiential antecedents that significantly predict nurses' awareness of the need to extend both professional knowledge and transversal skills about pandemics in nursing education. Our results showed that tenure, defined as years of experience, is a protector against stress in every facet considered: work overload, insufficient preparation, and fear of infection. These three stressors, in turn, predicted PFC. However, overload and fear of contagion were positively related to PFC, insufficient preparation presented a negative correlation. However, stressors did not predict SSC, except in the case of insufficient preparation, which presented a negative relationship, contrary to our hypothesis. The results indicated that the higher the insufficient preparation, the lower the SSC. These results suggest that a lack of preparation blocks both PFC and SSC because the lack of important personal resources [12, 13] decreases motivation and opportunities to effectively cope with the demands of the stressful situation. It is interesting to note that, for both types of coping, the lack of sufficient personal resources reduced coping actions designed to solve the problem, even when the solution could come from other more experienced colleagues. It is also noteworthy that stressful situations such as a high workload and fear of contagion did not induce higher levels of coping to obtain instrumental or emotional support. Future research should clarify the reasons for this. Possible explanations to be tested could be that overwhelming situations inhibit this type of behavior, or that other professionals who are also dealing with high volumes of demands are not available to fulfill social support functions. In general, our results support the hypotheses derived from the COR and JD-R theories. Other studies should also pay attention to another theoretical framework that also contributes to understanding high levels of stress: the effort-reward imbalance [51] . This theory states that stress also comes from the awareness that there is a negative imbalance between the contributions made and the recognition received. During the peak of the pandemic, people and the media conveyed gratitude and recognition to nurses, physicians, and other healthcare professionals as heroes (for instance, with applause every evening at 20:00 in all the Spanish cities during the lockdown). However, other messages were not as positive for recognition. For example, professionals complained that they were sent to the \"battle front\" with very limited protective clothing and equipment and important shortages in technology, staff, and other material resources to perform the required duties and demands [52] . Finally, those who had higher stress (and less experience), in their efforts to cope with the problems, are more aware of the need to include more professional and transversal knowledge and skills in nurses' education. In addition, those with a higher frequency of support-seeking behaviors are also more aware of the need to educate nurses in skills required in these situations.",

            "text": "In sum, the results showed that, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, nurses with higher stress and more active problem-focused coping became more aware of the need for future nurse education on public health crisis topics. As, Littleton-Kearney et al. [53] indicate, \"nurses comprise a large percentage of the health care workforce, so that adequate educational preparation for nurses is essential\" [53] (p. 103). They also point out that nurses remain unprepared to adequately respond to high-impact events. Thus, they emphasize that \"education for nurses, built on the all hazards approach, provides the framework for college nursing program curricula, and for continuing education (CE) and just-in-time instruction\" [53] (p. 103). The education of nurses as a service profession should take into account the T model emphasized by the service sciences [54] in order to better prepare nurses for interdisciplinary cooperation. According to this model, successful service employees must have in-depth preparation in their professional field (the vertical part of the T) and a good understanding of the other disciplines they collaborate with and transversal competences (the horizontal part of the T) [36] . The surveyed nurses' emphasis on transversal and horizontal skills revealed that this facet was important to nursing professionals. However, it is somewhat surprising that no mention was made of digitalization. In this pandemic, it is apparent that proximity does not necessarily mean physical proximity, and tele-assistance, tele-diagnosis, and even tele-interventions can be effective and safe for curing and caring for patients, and also for providing social and emotional support from their families [17] . Therefore, one important area that needs more attention in the nursing curriculum is training in the necessary digital competencies for e-health and the different services and applications being developed and implemented in this field. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the awareness of the need for digital technologies in healthcare. Physical distance does not prevent close interaction and presence when diagnosing or treating patients.",

However, the cross-sectional design, implying a lack of temporal sequence of the variables into the analysis, does not allow insights into causality. The sample due to online surveying does not match the gender or age distribution of the nurses' population. In fact, when comparing the gender and age distribution of the population on the 31st of December 2019 [55] with the distribution of our sample we found out that women (population: 84, 2%; our sample 93, 5%) and young and middle-age professionals (<45 years old: population: 59, 9%; our sample: 77, 45%) were overrepresented in our sample. In addition, the questionnaire developed to identify the educational needs, although paying attention to both professional and transversal knowledge and skills, only covered a limited scope of relevant contents. Although we also included an open question to obtain complementary information on the relevant topics to be considered, future studies will have to develop more comprehensive questionnaires and more deeply reflect on the implications of public crises for the nurse curriculum.
