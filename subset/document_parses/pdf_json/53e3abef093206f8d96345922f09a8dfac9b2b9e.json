Coupling with 3D printing, the use of 'off-the-shelf' microcontroller kits such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Micro: bit can now allow novel electronic products to be cost-effectively assembled, even by non-engineers without specialized equipment. It is with such enabling technology that even home-made measurement devices can be made easily, e.g., spectrophotometers [4, 5] , including those for psychology research use [6] .",

Non-contract infrared thermometers were previously reported to have a sensitivity between 4.0% to 89.6%, specificity between 75.4% to 99.6%, and a positive predictive value between 0.9% to 76.0% [8] . In fact, there are recommendations for its repeated measurements at hospital gantries [9] , given that IR thermometers are highly prone to external interferences by surrounding temperatures, relative humidity [10] , the site of measurement [11] , and the presence of oil (sebum) and sweat on the forehead [12] , as well as other factors in the immediate environment [13] . Apart from these innate factors, intrinsic human physiological factors such as fever [14] or exercise [15] can produce sweat to affect the measurements. With further confounding influence from the surrounding temperature and humidity that affect blood supply to the skin surface, which by generally lower than the expected body temperature [16, 17] , many IR thermometers, especially self-assembled ones can be inaccurate as they lack ambient temperature and distance sensors [7] for compensation.",

The selected IR temperature sensor has a field of view of 80 degrees. This translates to a D/S ratio of 1:1.68. Setting the average height of a human forehead of 58.3 mm as the constraint [25] , the maximum horizontal distance that the IR temperature sensor can reliably measure the temperature of the target, is approximately 4 cm.

Consistent with a previous study where a high performance thermal imaging camera also detected a lower temperature at various parts of a perspiring body [24, 31] , temperature measurements taken with an IR thermometer on wet foreheads can be inaccurate. However, there are no compensation measures that we could incorporate since we could not incorporate wetness detection. Therefore, compliance to the correct practice of measuring the right target location and for the surface to be dry are required to avoid false negatives.",

As measurements for oral temperature are widely used to non-invasively measure the body temperature, measurements of the forehead temperature can be used to establish a threshold in the screening for fever. The IR thermometer obtained a better precision compared to the alternative and more expensive non-contact IR devices and was improved distance compensation. In a separate study, tympanic and forehead temperatures taken by a BRAUN IRT-3020 had an error range of \u00b10.286 and \u00b10.392 \u2022 C [24] . Another study showed tympanic and forehead temperature errors of \u00b10.37 and \u00b10.36 \u2022 C respectively [32] . However, other contact devices such as the rectal thermometer, with a small error range of \u00b10.05 \u2022 C [33] outperformed our improved thermometer. Still, our improved device costs only a fraction of commercial IR thermometers and was sufficiently accurate to be considered as a low cost alternative (~USD 7.50, USD 10) to the current entry level IR thermometers (>USD 80) in the market. This non-contact device is more convenient than the tympanic or rectal thermometers.",
