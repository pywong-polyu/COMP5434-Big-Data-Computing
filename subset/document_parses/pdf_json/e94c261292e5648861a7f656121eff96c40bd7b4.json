In this observational study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of COVID-19 deaths. We apply a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 152 countries over 108 days (n = 6524). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables and isolate the UVI effect from potential confounding factors. After controlling for timeconstant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (\u2212 12%) and CFR (\u2212 38%). We find a",

This evidence is consistent with clinical studies in China and Italy that indicate comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases could be important risk factors for critical COVID-19 cases 8-10 . Epidemiology of COVID-19 provides evidence that vitamin D might be helpful in reducing risk associated with COVID-19 deaths 11,12 . If such a link is true, then it will be cost-effective to mitigate COVID-19 via sensible exposure to sunlight or via vitamin D nutritional intervention.

For example, many countries affected by COVID-19 in spring 2020 are in the northern hemisphere leading to a natural phenomenon that UVI increases over time. In addition, growth rates of the cumulated COVID-19 deaths are decreasing over time. This negative correlation between UVI and the cumulated COVID-19 deaths due to time is the source of the identification problem. We address this problem through our statistical analysis in which we flexibly isolate UVI from linear or non-linear time trends which can be either similar across countries or even country-specific.",

            "text": "Studies indicate that UV radiation may help in reducing the likelihood of transmission by inactivating viruses in transmission 40 . However, UVB radiation also plays another protective role via vitamin D skin synthesis. Since UVB radiation exposure is a major source of vitamin D, an increase in the likelihood of skin exposure to UVB radiation increases vitamin D synthesis, thereby reducing the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, Prior studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency increases the likelihood of weakened immune response 18, 41, 42 , infectious diseases in the upper respiratory tract 22, 43, 44 and the severity as well as mortality in critically ill patients 45 . From a biological perspective, there are several reasons to hypothesize that vitamin D may reduce the risk of severe cases and deaths in COVID-19 11, 46 . Vitamin D, through its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25 (OH) 2 D], plays an essential role in the immunomodulation of both-innate and adaptive immune systems 11, 46 . Vitamin D, via its active form, enhances innate immunity by the stimulation of antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and human cathelicidin, with anti-viral effects such as the ability to disrupt viral envelopes 11, [46] [47] [48] . It also modulates the inflammatory response by suppressing the excessive expression of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby reducing the risk of cytokine storm 11, 46 . Studies indicate that vitamin D, through its active form, 1,25 (OH) 2 D, may also play a protective role in modulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS), specifically in regulating the expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) 46, 49, 50 . Overactivation of reninangiotensin system (RAS) is increasingly associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 51, 52 . Emerging epidemiological and clinical evidence related to COVID-19 also suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 incidence 53-55 , severity 56 and mortality 57 , further providing evidence for the vitamin D mediated protective role of UVB radiation. Therefore, we expect that an increased skin synthesis of vitamin D due to increased UVB radiation increases the likelihood of immunity and reduces the likelihood of severe infections, thereby reducing the critical COVID-19 cases. Thus, we anticipate that an increase in UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) relates to a reduction of the number of COVID-19 deaths. Figure 1 summarizes these different factors that explain the potential protective role of UVB radiation in reducing COVID-19 deaths, mediated by vitamin D synthesis and deficiency.",

We focus on those 152 countries to ensure that the results are not biased by countries that are at a very early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, which would limit data points with respect to COVID-19 deaths.

The cumulative COVID-19 infections per country were on average 26,000. The casefatality-rate (CFR), as measured by the cumulative COVID-19 deaths divided by the cumulative COVID-19 infections per country, was on average 4.3% on 8 May. The growth rate of CFR on 8 May was on average -1.1% as compared to the growth rate of CFR across countries and time which was 2.6%. We use cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the main dependent variable to test our hypothesis linking UVB radiation to COVID-19 deaths and use the CFR to test the consistency of our results. On average, the first reported COVID-19 infection in each country happened 68 days before 8 May 2020. UVI is on average 6.8 representing a moderate to high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Figure 2 shows the cumulative COVID-19 deaths and the associated daily growth rates for Italy from 26 February 2020 until 8 May 2020. As time progresses, the cumulative COVID-19 deaths increase but at a slower rate. Initially, the growth rate is high at 42% (growth rate from 26 to 27 February) and it gradually slows to 0.8% (growth rate from 7 to 8 May). Figure 2 also shows the daily growth rates and daily UVI of Italy as well as the UVI values lagged by one, two, three, four and five weeks respectively. It is important to consider the lagged effect of UVI because synthesized vitamin D is cumulative and can be used later because it is stored in body fat 22 . Therefore, it seems more plausible that an increase of UVI today will continue to support an individual's immunity later i.e., in two or more weeks. Furthermore, the likelihood of skin synthesis is low in severely infected people, while they are hospitalized, indicating the importance of lagged UVI values.",

This insignificant finding is consistent with the fact that severely infected people are more likely to be hospitalized and therefore less likely to be exposed to UVB radiation during their hospital stay. We further recognize that UVB radiation may not make a real difference if someone is already severely infected and developed severe complications. The results also show that UVI has a stronger relation to COVID-19 deaths www.nature.com/scientificreports/ than CFR. We anticipate that the weaker association with CFR is plausible as UVI helps in vitamin D synthesis, making the infection less severe due to increased immunity, thereby prompting fewer people to take the test. The results of the robustness checks presented in Table S2 and Table S3 (Robustness Checks section in Supplementary Appendix 1) suggest that the relation of UVI on cumulative COVID-19 deaths is consistent (between \u2212 0.006 and \u2212 0.012) across different model specifications which isolate the association of UVI from underlying time trends in flexible ways. In fact, the most flexible model-Model 8 of Table S3 (Robustness Checks section in Supplementary Appendix 1)-reveals substantial and significant evidence of the UVI relation with cumulative COVID-19 deaths (\u2212 0.008, p < 0.05). The results of the robustness checks in Table S9 and Table S10 (Robustness Checks section in Supplementary Appendix 1) suggest that the association of UVI with cumulative COVID-19 deaths is stable even after considering governmental measures such as the lockdown (between \u2212 0.007 and \u2212 0.012). Figure 3 outlines that the decline of 1.2 percentage points in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths has significant long-run effects on the cumulative COVID-19 deaths. In order to simulate the long-run effects, we take the average number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths across all 152 countries as of May 8, 2020, i.e., 1800 as cumulative COVID-19 deaths at day 0. Figure 3 also outlines a scenario with a permanent unit increase of UVI over the baseline scenario of average UVI of 6.8 across countries is associated with 1,000 or 14% fewer deaths in 14 days.",
