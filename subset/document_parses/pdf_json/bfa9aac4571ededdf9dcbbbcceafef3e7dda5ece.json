            "text": "Background Telesimulation helps overcome limitations in time and local expertise by eliminating the need for the learner and educator to be physically co-located, especially important during COVID-19. We investigated whether teaching advanced laparoscopic suturing (ALS) through telesimulation is feasible, effective, and leads to improved suturing in the operating room (OR). Methods In this prospective feasibility study, three previously developed 3D-printed ALS tasks were used: needle handling (NH), suturing under tension (UT), and continuous suturing (CS). General surgery residents (PGY4-5) underwent 1-month of telesimulation training, during which an expert educator at one site remotely trained residents at the other site over 2-3 teaching sessions. Trainees were assessed in the three tasks and in the OR at three time points: baseline(A1), control period(A2), and post-intervention(A3) and completed questionnaires regarding educational value and usability of telesimulation. Paired t-test was used to compare scores between the three assessment points. Results Six residents were included. Scores for UT improved significantly post-intervention A3(568 \u00b1 60) when compared to baseline A1(416 \u00b1 133) (p < 0.019). Similarly, scores for CS improved significantly post-intervention A3(756 \u00b1 113) vs. baseline A1(539 \u00b1 211) (p < 0.02). For intraoperative assessments, scores improved significantly post-intervention A3(21 \u00b1 3) when compared to both A1(17 \u00b1 4) (p < 0.018) and A2(18 \u00b1 4) (p < 0.0008). All residents agreed that tasks were relevant to practice, helped improve technical competence, and adequately measured suturing skill. All residents found telesimulation easy to use, had strong educational value, and want the system to be incorporated into their training. Conclusion The use of telesimulation for remotely training residents using ALS tasks was feasible and effective. Residents found value in training using the tasks and telesimulation system, and improved ALS skills in the OR. As the pandemic has caused a major structural shift in resident education, telesimulation can be an effective alternative to on-site simulation programs. Future research should focus on how telesimulation can be effectively incorporated into training programs.",

FLS includes tasks related to suturing and knot tying with the usage of intracorporeal and extracorporeal techniques. There is ample evidence supporting the value of bench-top simulation to develop fundamental laparoscopic suturing skills, and FLS is a current requirement for certification by the American Board of Surgery [3] . Despite this, a survey of Program Directors (PDs) in the Fellowship Council reported that 60% of the PDs felt that graduating residents were not proficient in laparoscopic suturing [4] . This could be explained by the fact that skills required to perform laparoscopic suturing in the operating room (OR) may differ from the skills that are assessed by currently available programs such as FLS.",

However, these models have several limitations in terms of cost, availability and validity evidence to support them as measures of advanced laparoscopic suturing (ALS) skills. In order to address this need, our team developed ALS tasks for free needle suturing, using widely available and low-cost materials [8, 9] .

One of the main obstacles is related to the time constraints of the educators; it can be difficult to find educators for the sessions due to their clinical commitments, or lack of available educators able to teach the targeted skills. This is where telesimulation comes into play; it is a way for medical educators to reach trainees/ surgeons in other locations using telecommunication technologies [14] . This system removes the requirement for the learner and the educator to be physically in the same location and allows flexibility regarding when and how the training sessions could be scheduled. Hence, telesimulation has a lot of potential to be used for surgical skills training, without the need for the physical presence of an experienced and knowledgeable educator [15] . These benefits are especially important and amplified with the strict limitations to on-site simulations due to the Covid-19 pandemic [16] . Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate whether training using ALS tasks through telesimulation is feasible and has educational value at improving skills in the OR.",

Currently, many institutions have delivered grand rounds, workshops and other didactic teachings virtually [24] . However, when it comes to skills acquisition and assessment, including for laparoscopy, the training of surgical residents was hindered. Hence, programs have been investing in ways to provide simulation training outside of the hospitals or simulation centers [25] . One of these options is telesimulation, which can have a beneficial role within a program to conduct simulation training sessions from a distance. Telesimulation might usually be applied to training of residents/surgeons in remote or resource-limited locations, where expertise in a particular skill or procedure is lacking. However, telesimulation can also be used within the same program, where the trainees can be provided with the necessary simulation materials and have telesimulation sessions (in groups or individually) with their senior colleagues or faculties [26] . This can help address logistical and scheduling issues and becomes especially important with the social distancing rules and limits in the number of individuals allowed in a simulation laboratory at one time.",

Formative Feedback Tools are assessment instruments that were previously developed for our simulation tasks, and validity evidence has been established for them as measures of laparoscopic skills in these tasks [17] . In addition, a pilot study that was presented at a Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) conference showed the value of FFTs in providing feedback to improve trainee skill [29] . We have published a comprehensive literature review of available assessment tools for laparoscopic suturing skills in the OR, and procedures that commonly require laparoscopic suturing [30] . Based on the results, GOALS had the most validity evidence in the context of operative assessment through direct observation by an attending surgeon, which is why we have used GOALS for intraoperative assessment in this study.",

Nonetheless, this was a feasibility study, and we were interested in exploring how telesimulation training could be structured and implemented, and the perceptions of the trainees. Additionally, it could be important to explore the logistics of how telesimulation might be used within or across institutions, or for trainees to practice from home (e.g., if they could be provided with the necessary resources). Also, our study was able to show skill improvement in the simulated setting and transferability of these skills to the operating room. Nonetheless, due to our limited sample size and single group design, we need further studies to confirm this transfer of skill. Hence, future studies could examine widespread adoption of telesimulation within a larger curriculum and explore the impact of telesimulation on skills acquisition in the OR.",

This study's implementation of a curriculum to teach advanced laparoscopic skills using telesimulation resulted in improvements in performance, not just in a simulator, but transferrable to the operating room. Although the COVID-19 pandemic imposed challenges for accrual of trainees in this study, this also created some urgency in developing novel ways to train residents and rapidly accelerated the adoption of videoconferencing platforms across teaching and learning.
