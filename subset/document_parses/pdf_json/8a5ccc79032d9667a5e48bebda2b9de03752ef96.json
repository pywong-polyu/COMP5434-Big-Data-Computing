The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. This study examines the association of parents' perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the pandemic. Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Nearly 20% of parents had hit or spanked their child in the past two weeks alone. Parents' perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents' perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in \"lockdown.\" Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.",

The link between poverty and child maltreatment is wellestablished (Cancian, et al., 2010; Slack et al., 2004; Slack et al., 2011) , wherein food insecurity and housing insecurity contribute to child abuse and neglect (Marcal, 2018; Slack et al., 2011; Wood et al., 2012) . Given the historic economic crisis unfolding during the pandemic, the risks for families to slide into povertyas well as experience food and housing insecuritywill mount.",

Parents reporting elevated distress are at higher risk to engage in physical neglect (Lee, 2013; Slack et al., 2011; Stith et al., 2009 ) as well as maternal and paternal physical abuse (Kim et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2011; Miragoli et al., 2018; Schaeffer et al., 2005; Tucker et al., 2017) . Initial reports suggested that depression rose in the days immediately following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wang et al., 2020) . Such evidence of mental health challenges may translate to an escalation in the risk for child maltreatment and neglect (Rodriguez et al., 2016; Stith et al., 2009) . Depression in particular is implicated as a potent risk factor for both child abuse (Espinosa et al., 2017; Schaeffer et al., 2005) and child neglect (Lee et al., 2012) . With robust effect sizes reported between depression and child abuse and neglect (Stith et al., 2009) , increases in depression also predict subsequent increases in psychological aggression toward children among mothers already involved with child welfare (Conron et al., 2009) . Higher levels of depression have also been observed in mothers of maltreated children relative to a matched sample of mothers (Mennen & Trickett, 2011) . Consequently, depression has been a consistent predictor of child abuse and neglect predating the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Although required in order to prevent disease spread, social distancing removed social, educational, and community supports that buffer parents in times of crisis. Indeed, research shows that parents who are at risk to engage in physical child abuse are less likely to perceive their social networks as satisfying (Ono & Honda, 2017; Schaeffer et al., 2005) , and lower social support satisfaction predicts increases in child abuse risk over time (Rodriguez et al., 2018) . In contrast, greater perceived social support is associated with lower risk of child neglect (Freisthler et al., 2014; Stith et al., 2009) as well as lower physical child abuse risk in both mothers and fathers (Rodriguez et al., 2016; Smith Slep & O'Leary, 2007) . Social support is conceptualized as a resource parents can access, serving a protective function by decreasing parents' stress to reduce their abuse risk (Tracy et al., 2018; Tucker & Rodriguez, 2014) . Given the guidelines of the pandemic, social support as a critical asset was thereby curtailed for many parents.",

In addition, we examined whether parents' perceived difficulty in parenting due to social isolation and social distancing, employment status, and depression were related to parents' reports of changes in their neglect or discipline use since COVID-19. We conducted additional analyses examining whether associations were robust to the inclusion of variables that measured actual time (i.e., number of days) spent social distancing and in lockdown.",

Participants who met the study criteria were sent an email from Prolific regarding their eligibility to participate in the survey. Participants were provided with a brief description of the survey via the Prolific website. In order to be eligible, individuals had to have U.S. nationality and be age 18 or older. If they chose to participate in the survey, they were linked through the Prolific platform to a Qualtrics survey designed and managed by the research team. There is no response rate to report because this study utilized a convenience sampling approach, wherein only those individuals who actively chose to participate in the study could participate. Thus, there was no predetermined sampling frame to reference to calculate a response rate. The research team did set a predetermined target enrollment number, and when that number was reached the survey automatically closed. Furthermore, we do not have information on individuals who might have viewed the study details on the Prolific platform but decided not to participate, or on individuals who wished to participate after enrollment for the survey was already closed. Notably, it took less than 24 h for the survey to reach its target enrollment number.",

An odds ratio of 1 indicates there is no association between the predictor and the odds of the outcome variable occurring; an odds ratio greater than 1 indicates the odds are increased for a particular outcome occurring; and an odds ratio less than 1 indicates odds are decreased for a particular outcome occurring. It is important to note that odds ratios and their confidence (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthen, 2006) .

All analyses controlled for symptoms of parental depressive symptoms in the past 2 weeks, sex (male/ female), race, education level, age in years, total household income in the last year, and number of children. To determine whether the estimates of perceived social isolation on maltreatment risk were robust to the reported number of days engaged in social distancing and lockdown, robustness checks used two variables that assessed the number of days spent in social distancing and lockdown since the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Within these robustness checks, social distancing days and lockdown days were not significantly associated with any of the dependent variables, with one exception: a one-day increase in social distancing was associated with a 14% increase in the odds of spanking/ hitting child(ren) more often than usual (OR = 1.14, p < .05).",

            "text": "The results of this study provided support for our key hypothesis that parents' perceived difficulty in parenting due to social isolation would be significantly associated with risk for child maltreatment. In the weeks immediately following the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing guidelines issued by the U.S. White House, parental perceived social isolationi.e., the extent to which parents indicated that social isolation and social distancing made it difficult for them to parentwas related to risk of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression toward the child (shouted, yelled, or screamed at children), measured using items from a validated scale of parent-to-child risk for child maltreatment (CTS-PC) (Straus, et al., 1998) . Significant associations held even when accounting for predictors of child maltreatment such as unemployment, income, and parental depression, and were also robust to analyses that included variables assessing days spent social distancing and days spent in lockdown. Consequently, the current findings underscore that parents perceive that their social isolation is interfering with their parenting after accounting for actual time spent in isolation. These results are consistent with research showing that social isolation was associated with greater risk Note: OR = odds ratio. *p < 05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 Note: OR = odds ratio. *p < 05, **p < .01, ***p < .001 of neglect during the pandemic (Bullinger et al., 2020) and a longitudinal study that showed that loneliness during the pandemic related to increases in parents' use of behaviors such as hitting, spanking, and verbal aggression during the pandemic (Rodriguez et al., 2020 ). In the current study, perceived parental social isolation was not associated with physical punishment (slapping/spanking) using the CTS-PC. However, perceived parental social isolation was associated with a 124% increase in parents' selfreport of spanking or hitting their children more than usual since the COVID-19 global health crisis began. Analyses indicated that a one-day increase in social distancing was associated with a 14% increase in the odds of more spanking or hitting since the pandemic. Notably, nearly 20% of parents said they had hit or spanked their child in the past two weeks alone. Thus, taken as a whole, implications are twofold. First, physical punishment was common during this period, with one in five parents indicating they had hit their child in just the past 2 weeks. Second, parents felt that they were using physical punishment more often during the pandemic. Although social isolation was not associated with slapping and spanking in the current results, a recent longitudinal study comparing mothers' use of spanking controlling for prepandemic scores showed increases in mothers' use of spanking (Rodriguez et al., 2020) . In the current study, changes in employment status were significantly associated with increased risk of physical punishment, which is consistent with prior research showing that unemployment status may increase risks associated with abuse and neglect (Slack et al., 2004 (Slack et al., , 2011 . The results suggested that when parents were spending more time with children (social distancing) and experienced the stress of employment loss, risk for physical punishment of children increased.",

To address this limitation, the survey asked parents about whether they had increased their use of behaviors in the past 2 weeks, since the pandemic began. Although it would be ideal to have pre-pandemic measures of parenting behaviors and child maltreatment risk to assess whether there was an increase in behaviors following the pandemic (see Rodriguez et al., 2020) , the questions related to increased use of parenting risk behaviors serve as a rough proxy for a time lagged design. Analyses of these items (Table 3) showed a similar pattern of results to the CTS-PC items (Table 2) . Specifically, parents' perceived social isolation was associated with all of the items measuring increased conflict, including parents' increased use of discipline, yelled or screamed more at my children, had more conflicts with my children, had to leave children alone more than usual, and spanked or hit my children more than usual. The pattern of results were consistent with longitudinal research assessing changes in mothers' pre-pandemic parenting behavior relative to mothers' parenting behaviors during the pandemic (Rodriguez et al., 2020) .",

The emotional and psychological strains of perceived social isolation during a pandemic may be problematic for many adults who are parenting at least one child under the age of 12, after accounting for other challenging circumstances such as changes in employment status and parental depression. We conducted robustness checks to examine whether actual time spent in social isolation or lockdown were explaining the results related to social isolation. That is, parents who have spent more time in social isolation or lockdown may indeed experience increasing level of strain on parenting, particularly as social isolation removes key parenting supports such as babysitters, childcare, teachers, and others who provide care to children. However, the robustness checks indicated parents' perception of social isolation remained even after accounting for days in social isolation and days in lockdown days. This suggests that parents' perceptions of social isolation may be more critical than the actual days spent in isolation, at least in this early phase of the pandemic. Future research should explicitly examine the relative importance of parents' subjective experience of isolation over the more objective time spent in isolation in exacerbating child maltreatment risk as the current findings imply the former is more critical.",

As discussed in other research , this is notably higher than the rates of depression observed prior to COVID-19. During April 23-May 5 2020, the nationally representative U.S. Household Pulse Survey indicated that approximately 24% of U.S. adults had symptoms of depressive disorder (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020; U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). In comparison to an overlapping time period about 1 year earlier, during January to June 2019, 8.2% of U.S. adults had symptoms of depressive disorder (CDC, 2020). In addition, parents self-reported more stress (American Psychological Association, 2020) and declines in mental health during the pandemic (Patrick et al., 2020) . Overall, there is robust research to suggest a decline in wellbeing during the pandemic. The current study suggested that parental depression was associated with physical and emotional neglect, as well as most of the items measuring parents' reports of having more conflicts and using more discipline toward their children, a finding that is consistent with numerous prior studies showing similar associations (Dubowitz et al., 2011; Lee, 2013; Lee et al., 2012; Mennen & Trickett, 2011; Stith et al., 2009 ).",

            "text": "The CTS-PC items used herein assessed several components of child neglect -physical neglect (i.e., not able to provide children with enough food), supervisory neglect (i.e., leaving children unattended when another adult should be with them), emotional neglect (i.e., caught up in own problems and unable to tell child you love them) and neglect related to parental substance use/abuse (i.e., too high or drunk to care for children). Consistent with one other study to date (Bullinger et al., 2020) , results of the current study suggest that the conditions of the pandemic may increase risk for neglect. To place these concerns in the broader context, child neglect constitutes 60% of child maltreatment cases in the U.S. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Leaving children unattended (Coohey, 2003) and being unable to provide for a child's basic needs are two of the most common forms of child neglect (Hussey et al., 2006; Slack et al., 2004) . With parents facing unemployment, it is likely that parents will encounter difficulty meeting children's basic needs. Furthermore, for those parents who are working, supervisory neglect may be especially problematic given the widespread closures of schools and childcare centers, as well as social distancing guidelines limiting other caregivers such as babysitters, grandparents, and neighbors, who may provide care to children under normal circumstances. Supervisory neglect puts children at risk of injuries and accidents, among other concerns (Coohey, 2003; Morrongiello & Cox, 2019) . Substance abuse (i.e., being too drunk or high to care for one's children) is another common risk factor for child maltreatment (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). This study suggested that children may be at increased risk for these various forms of neglect during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Yet, it is important to note that most children and families are likely to demonstrate enormous resilience during this stressful time. A risk and resilience framework (Prime et al., 2020) describes how both risk-enhancing and protective factors can contribute to wellbeing, even during periods of stress and adversity. When considering factors that may promote wellbeing for parentchild relationships, one study conducted early in the pandemic showed that 53.6% of parents said they were hugging and showing physical affection toward their child, and the majority of parents reported showing more warmth and love to their children since the pandemic began . Parents reported that they were spending more time in nearly all child caregiving activities, such as playing, reading, and watching TV with their children . Over 70% of parents said they felt supported by their child's school to support their child's education . This study suggests that some families will adapt to COVID-19, and possibly even benefit from spending more time together. At the same time, children and families who were vulnerable before the pandemic may not have access to as many buffers to promote resilience during the pandemic.",

The sample was mostly White (73.2%), well educated, and middle-income. Given the sociodemographic advantages of the sample, it is plausible that estimates of the associations between parental perceived social isolation and maltreatment risk are conservative relative to the greater prevalence of these behaviors in more disadvantaged populations. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals and communities of color, in part because the impacts of COVID-19 are exacerbated by underlying socioeconomic and racial inequalities in the U.S. (Fortuna et al., 2020) . Future research should consider how chronic stress may exacerbate parenting stress and parental mental health problems during a time of extreme adversity, and how the potential impacts of chronic stress may be particularly challenging among vulnerable families. The current findings showing the potential adverse effects of the pandemic on parenting for a sample with greater resources and buffers may be interpreted to imply even stronger reason for concern among marginalized communities.",

The current reactive approach to child welfare has neglected the importance of prevention, largely responding to the most dire cases of maltreatment (Klika et al., 2018) . A public health oriented approach to child welfare would respond to families at multiple levels of care (e.g., through primary and integrated care, school systems, community and church organizations; mental health and community health services), permitting more expanded points of contact for families that would be nimble during times of crises (Herrenkohl et al., 2020; Higgins et al., 2019) . Such settings could implement brief, cost-effective screenings that would recognize risks earlier to initiate referrals as needed. Enhanced screening for poverty and economic hardship, trauma exposure, and parenting behaviors that put children at risk during well child visits may be an important step. Safe Environment for Every Kid is an evidence-based program that is uniquely well situated to help health care professional respond to economic strain and parenting stress among their patients (Dubowitz, 2014; Dubowitz et al., 2009) . In addition to individual-level interventions to help parents manage economic strain and related parenting stress, there is clearly a need for better policy solutions to support vulnerable families, including federal income supports, direct cash assistance, enhanced food assistance programs, and expanded housing support (Gassman-Pines & Gennetian, 2020).",

Telehealth services witnessed accelerated adoption (Moreno et al., 2020) , which has prompted many to consider how to effectively and safely provide services to vulnerable children and how best to reach parents. One report highlighted the use of video calls, texting, and messaging apps as economical ways for home visitors to connect with parents during the pandemic (Supplee & Crowne, 2020) . The current study findings suggest a need to inquire with parents about their sense of isolation and mental health status. Depression could potentially be detected by routine, cost-effective mental health screening. Such regular brief check-ins may permit triaging those most in need of referrals for more intensive telehealth services (Moreno et al., 2020) . Online parent groups can reduce parents' sense of isolation and improving their mental health. Health providers can administer brief screenings and conduct brief virtual check-ins with those at higher-risk. Proactive screenings may help professionals to provide resources to families in need, and can also help to identify parents whose wellbeing is deteriorating as the pandemic persists. When children are at school, schoolbased trauma-informed programs may be especially effective at helping to mitigate the mental health consequences experienced during the pandemic .",
