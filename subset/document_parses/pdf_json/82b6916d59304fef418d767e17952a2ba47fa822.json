Drawing on the time series forecasting literature, this brief report contributes to the growing body of evidence around the issue of domestic violence during the pandemic. Arrest data from Miami-Dade County (US) are leveraged along with a robust approach towards model identification, which is used to generate a suitably accurate forecast against which the observed pandemic period domestic violence data can be compared. The pattern uncovered for Miami-Dade County was similar what was found in other U.S. cities that during the pandemic experienced spikes (+95 CI) in the level of domestic violence arrests that were greater than expected. Interestingly these spikes appeared shortly after dips (-95 CI) in observed arrests fell below the expected level.",

The numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and lives lost are well above any other major pandemic in recent memory. Aside from the public health toll, the pandemic has also shuttered businesses, produced significant unemployment, and disrupted businesses. As well, and for present purposes, the virus and especially its associated lockdown policies have been linked to increases in certain types of crime, in particular homicides and domestic violence. 1, 2 In this study, we further the investigation of how crime, specifically domestic violence, was affected by pandemic lockdowns in one populous but as-of-yet unstudied area, Miami-Dade County, which is home to almost 3 million people, with over two-thirds identifying Hispanic origins. Importantly, our work goes beyond the extant research, especially on domestic violence, in numerous ways. We leverage an approach to forecasting that has hitherto not been leveraged in the extant criminological and criminal justice literature that takes advantage of candidate models, cross-validation and error metrics to identify the most optimal forecast. Further, and importantly, we attempt to describe (quantitatively) extremes in the underlying pattern of domestic violence levels both in terms of both positive and negative spikes. Finally, we evaluate multiple temporal windows, the first that seeks to capture more immediate effects during the early months of the pandemic and then a longer period where changes in the level of stringencies implemented at both the state-and county-level.",

Using police-recorded domestic violence arrest data for Miami-Dade County between January 2018 and September 2020, we forecasted the daily number of arrests per day for two periods, March 30, 2020 to May 18, 2020 (50 days) and for a longer period between March 30, 2020 and September 14, 2020 (169 days). In both cases, we compared the forecasted number of domestic violence arrests to the observed daily arrests during each of the periods. In this analysis, we selected these two periods because on March 30, 2020, Governor DeSantis of Florida issued a stay-at-home order for South Florida counties including Miami-Dade where over 58% of the state's cases were concentrated. This order remained in full-effect until May 18, 2020, and thereafter there was a three-phased approach adopted towards an increased, phased in reopening with Miami-Dade County moving into phase two on September 14, 2020.",

On average, Miami-Dade County experiences approximately 20 domestic violence related arrests per day, and this varies from 10 to as many as around 30.

There were five instances where the number of arrests were lower than the confidence bands, these occurred on April 7, 20, and 22, as well as on June 4 and 18, 2020.

While the coronavirus has affected just about every aspect of the lives of people around th world, our study continues to investigate specific adverse effects of the pandemic, and in particular the lockdowns that were initiated to help stop the spread of the virus on domestic violence. Using Miami-Dade County as our study site, we examined how domestic violence was affected by the pandemic lockdown period.",

While not causal the lows followed by these highs in arrest numbers in Miami-Dade County provides important guidance around what police, policy-makers, and others involved in helping to reducing injury may look for as indicators in a potential spike in the incidence of arrests during potential future lockdowns.",

Our work, however, is not the final word on this issue. For example, we could only examine crime in the form of arrests, and thereby are unable to capture those domestic violence incidents that go undetected and underreported. As well, given the large Hispanic population in Miami-Dade County, more in-depth data should be collected given what is known about the uniqueness of domestic violence within the Hispanic milieu (De Faria, 2021) . Lastly, although most of Florida and Miami-Dade County has been open without lockdowns, it will be important to continue to track domestic violence moving forward, especially since people-especially (undocumented) immigrants-continue to feel the pain and anxiety associated with bleak gainful employment prospects and vaccine rollouts.",
