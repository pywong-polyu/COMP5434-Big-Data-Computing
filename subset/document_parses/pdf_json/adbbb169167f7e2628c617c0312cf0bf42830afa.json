            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown meant a greatly reduced social and economic activity. Sound is of major importance to people's perception of the environment, and some remarked that the soundscape was changing for the better. But are these anecdotal reports based in truth? Has traffic noise from cars and airplanes really gone down, so that more birdsong can be heard? Have socially distanced people quietened down? This article presents a case study of the human perception of environmental sounds in an urban neighborhood in the Basque Country between 15 March and 25 May 2020. The social restrictions imposed through national legislation divided the 69-day period into three phases. We collected observations, field audio recordings, photography, and diary notes on 50 days. Experts in soundscape and architecture were presented with the recordings, in randomized order, and made two separate perceptual analyses. One group (N = 11) rated the recordings for pleasantness and eventfulness using an adapted version of the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol, and a partly overlapping group (N = 12) annotated perceived sound events with free-form semantic labels. The labels were systematically classified into a four-level Taxonomy of Sound Sources, allowing an estimation of the relative amounts of Natural, Human, and Technological sounds. Loudness and three descriptors developed for bioacoustics were extracted computationally. Analysis showed that Eventfulness, Acoustic Complexity, and Acoustic Richness increased significantly over the time period, while the amount of Technological sounds decreased. These observations were interpreted as reflecting changes in people's outdoor activities and behavior over the whole 69-day period, evidenced in an increased presence of Human sounds of voices and walking, and a significant shift from motorized vehicles toward personal mobility devices, again evidenced by perceived sounds. Quantitative results provided a backdrop against which qualitative analyses of diary notes and observations were interpreted in relation to the restrictions and the architectural specifics of the site. An integrated analysis of all sources pointed at the temporary suspension of human outdoor activity as the main reason for such a change. In the third phase, the progressive return of street life and the usage of personal mobility vehicles seemed to be responsible for a clear increase in Eventfulness and Loudness even in the context of an overall decrease of Technological sounds. Indoor human activity shared through open windows and an increased presence of birdsong emerge as a novel characteristic element of the local urban soundscape. We discuss how such changes in the acoustic environment of the site, in acoustic measurements and as perceived by humans, point toward the soundscape being a crucial component of a comprehensive urban design strategy that aims to improve health and quality of life for increasingly large and dense populations in the future.",

            "text": "\"Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character. . . such as sounds, for the true character of sound in shaping societies is in its spatial spread. . . and the real paradox is that although sounds are pronounced in time, they are also erased by time\" (Schafer, 1977 p. 162) . How does the soundscape change over time? In The Tuning of the World, Schafer (1977) describes measuring a collection of fire engine sirens covering seven decades. He found that their signal had gotten louder by \"nearly half a decibel per year on average\" (idem p. 186). This observation supported his general thesis that urban noise levels have increased in industrialized societies, to the detriment of animals and human inhabitants alike. In what may seem as a reply, Arana (2010) analyzed a large number (876,480) of noise measurements taken in the Spanish cities of Pamplona and Madrid between 1999 and 2003 . Contrary to Schafer's results, he found a statistically significant decrease in the overall sound level. The findings were translated to inspire politicians and designers; for example, the \"remarkable reduction\" of noise that had been observed in one district was attributed to the implementation of pedestrian areas.",

Interdisciplinarity has suffused research in the past decade, such as the Soundscape Support to Health program (Berglund and Nilsson, 2007) and the Positive Soundscapes Project (Davies et al., 2013) . Viewed from this perspective, soundscape studies have a natural affinity with environmental psychology, even if goals and methodologies are sometimes different.",

In the United States, Jacobs (1961) advocates in The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) that while looking at real cities \"you might as well also listen, linger and think about what you see.\" Not far in time, Gehl in Europe claims for a closer attention to the Life Between Buildings (1971) . The perceivable, intangible aspects of the city environment are linked with physical, tangible components of the architecture as well as the urban design of our human ecosystem. We consider the soundscape as one of the intangible layers of the city. Ultimately, the way we arrange the invisible linkages will determine crucially the form of the city. It will revert to us as a society and will shape behaviors and habits. Thereby, the urban ecosystem we design today is intended for future generations. As shown by Arana (cit.) , soundscape research can contribute to improving people's quality of life through urban planning initiatives.",

            "text": "There are few examples of experimental soundscape studies of the kind found in, e.g., medicine or psychology (but see Aletta et al., 2016b , for a covert intervention study). It would be impractical or unethical, or both, to try to implement a double-blind study on the physical scale of cities or nations, or on the temporal scales of decades that Schafer imagined. That being said, we find ourselves today in an extreme situation, with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic sweeping through human societies in every country and every city. It offers an unusual opportunity to put the acoustic environment to a test, almost as if the pandemic lockdown restrictions in various places were conditions in a social experiment at huge geographical and temporal scales. From the urban design point of view, the situation triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak has opened up possibilities to observe how the city environment changes under extreme circumstances. \"For a few weeks, the world has rehearsed a post-carbon world, a world not dependent on the car, a world that only consumes what is necessary, a world that only produces the essential, a contained and selflimited world, a world that understands what it is socially relevant and productive\" (Fernandez, 2020) . Such a context can be used as a testbed not only of environmental changes but also of a desired potential future city with other types of mobility (maybe the city without petrol cars) and different behaviors and proxemics (social distancing). The soundscape is a significant first intangible tester of these changes in a new imposed situation as it happens to be the COVID-19 pandemic. Until now, the tangible-intangible duality has been used for two purposes, not far from the city ecosystem. One is in the field of marketing, in the form of tangible and intangible assets. Another is the field of cultural heritage, which involves physical constructions that intertwine with intangible values and social traditions. In the latter, the \"intangible\" has already earned a certain rank as a formal category. Our goal should be to broaden the term and to define as \"intangible\" any feature of the city fabric that is not directly physical. This includes the soundscape.",

Firstly, that loudness would decrease; secondly, sounds linked to machinery and human interaction would decrease; thirdly, human outdoor activity would decrease; and fourthly, birdsong would increase.

Citizens are generally confined in their residencies; schools, shops, and other services are suspended; leisure and sports activities are forbidden. Restrictions to local, national, and international mobility vary. In this article, we refer to three phases defined by the severity of the restrictions. Table 1 briefly illustrates the restrictions to mobility and activity applied in each phase. Phase 1, which lasted approximately 2 weeks, initially allowed citizens' mobility to reach their workplace while suspending any other activity. Phase 2 saw an increase in the severity of the measures with the total suspension of any non-necessary activity. We identify the beginning of Phase 3 with the ease of the most restrictive measures -notably, the permission for kids to spend up to 1 h a day outdoors -which preceded the launch of the socalled \"Plan de Desescalada\" (Consejos de Ministros de Espa\u00f1a, 2020) on 28 April.",

Our observation point (see Figure 1 ) is located in Las Arenas, a neighborhood in Getxo, which is a municipality on the estuary of the River of Bilbao. Getxo, a traditionally residential agglomeration with 77,000 inhabitants, lies 12 km from Bilbao, the largest town of the Basque Country. The area is gentrified with few high-rise buildings. Following a trend that is common all over Europe, it is home to an aging population where almost a quarter of the inhabitants are 65 years old or above. The economy of Getxo is essentially based on the third sector (services), which accounts for 92.4% of the turnover of the municipality, with a very weak presence of production from the primary and secondary sectors (EUSTAT, 2020). In order to be able to analyze the soundscape variations from an urban spot that is representative of the city as a whole, we need an observation point that can record different layers of activity, granting that none of them overlaps and covers totally the others. From a mobility point of view, coexisting light traffic [pedestrian, bicycles, and personal mobility vehicle (PMV)] and traditional heavy traffic (cars and freight) must be present. As for human activity, public space should offer both a static gathering space (plaza or alike) and a transit. Regarding economic activities, the spot ought to host shops and bars, mirroring the usual premises of an average residential street of Getxo, including delivery services. Recordings should, in an optimal scenario, be taken from a first floor to avoid distortions and to better engage with street activity.",

Our observation point is halfway (95 m) to both wheel traffic roads and on the point of convergence (gradient) of the isophonic lines defined by the \"Noise White Paper\" of the municipality of Getxo (see Acoustic Environment section). Hence, we can observe the consecutive layers of sound coming from heavy traffic but also record and analyze dynamic and static public space occupation on the plaza together with commercial activity on the ground floors. The observation point also gives the opportunity to record human activity related to work and leisure at a wide range of time without dealing with a too-dominating traffic noise. Nonetheless, being our observation point halfway to both extremes of the road (where car traffic is allowed), we still can identify motor vehicles flow if existing.

Similarly, Le is for evening time, 19:00 to 23:00, and Ln is for nighttime, between 23:00 and 07:00. For the neighborhood of Las Arenas, AQO is set at Ld = 65 and Le = Ln = 55.

The SSQP includes eight adjectives: pleasant, exciting, eventful, chaotic, annoying, monotonous, uneventful, and calm. These words were originally selected for representing equidistant and equally strong semantic concepts, spanning a circumplex with the horizontal axis labeled Pleasantness and the vertical axis Eventfulness. In our adapted version, the circumplex and adjectives are presented as shown in Figure 6 . While listening to the recordings (in individually randomized order), the rater continuously pointed with the computer mouse to the adjective that \"best described what you feel the soundscape is like\" (Axelsson et al., 2010) . From the response time series, the mean angle and distance from the center were calculated for each of the 50 soundscapes across raters. This yielded values for Pleasantness and Eventfulness for each soundscape recording.

To build a taxonomic classification of perceived sounds, we chose an empirically grounded approach (Scott-Ram, 1990; Atkinson et al., 2000 ; see also Lindborg, 2016) . With the frequency counts in mind, we sorted each of the original 5,581 annotations within exactly one of the following 22 categories constituting Level 1: bird, animal, geophony, conversation, communication, body, individual, group, crowd, music, onomatopoeia, noise, action, object, material, signal, wheels, vehicle, machine, acoustic, spatial, and rest. Keywords for inclusion or exclusion speeded up the process so that \u223c55% could be automatically matched, while the remainder required individual attention. Next, we developed Level 2 of the taxonomy and automatically sorted (by keywords) each of the Level 1 categories into exactly one of the Level 2 categories: nature, voice, people, sonic, physical, traffic, and modifiers. Finally, we defined three categories in Level 3 Natural, Human, and Technological, to correspond to the typology for sounds in soundscape first advanced by Schafer (1977) and developed by, e.g., Krause (2008) and Axelsson et al. (2010) . This process yielded the taxonomic classification illustrated in Figure 7 , with examples given in Table 2 . The agreement was very good among the expert raters (N = 12), in terms of the proportions of Natural, Human, and Technological sounds in their annotations of soundscapes, as indicated by Cronbach's alpha = 0.92, 0.95, and 0.93 for the three categories, respectively.",

Such correspondences are also sustained by the Taxonomy obtained from the annotations. On Day 4 of the confinement, the first author notes \"I never noticed how much human voice resonated in the little plaza in front of our window. [. . .]\" Interestingly, in a Phase 1 marked by restrictions to human mobility and activity, the predominant perception of the soundscape of Day 4 is \"extremely annoying\" (see Figure 9 ). Annotations for the same day register a clear predominance of Human (annotated as a source of sound 28 times) over Natural (15) and Technological (12) sounds with the indication, at Level 0 of the taxonomy, of words such as \"people talking, \" \"voices, \" \"whistle, \" \"human conversation, \" \"human voices, \" and \"dialog between man and woman.\" On Day 14, an \"Extremely Calm\" day for soundscape Evaluation is described as \"near silence\" in the author's notes, while annotations show a prevalence of technological sounds further described as \"traffic, \" \"distant traffic, \" and \"car passing distant\" (or \"medium distance\"). Day 16 stands out in the diary notes, in the context of the restrictions imposed by Phase 1 (\"making noise is feeling alive\") as well as in the evaluators' assessment (\"clearly annoying\"). Annotations register a clear predominance of technological (32) over Natural (13) and Human (7) sounds. As mentioned, Phase 2 was characterized by a strengthening of restrictive measures both to mobility and human activity. Day 19, the third day of Phase 2, is described as \"Extremely Uneventful\" by evaluators, while annotations highlight both human and technological sounds, the latter mainly referring to indoor activity (\"glass bottle, \" \"objects on surface, \" \"hit plate, \" etc.). Notably, the diary note for that day read \"In the silence, someone's getting ready for lunch.\" Day 28 registers a clear predominance of Human (39) over Natural sounds. On the contrary, diary notes define it as a fully natural experience (\"Birds, birds, birds.\"). Evaluators describe it as \"Extremely Pleasant, \" leaving us in the doubt as to the perceptual dimension that is responsible for the pleasantness. The first day of Phase 3, when restrictions start to be lifted with kids being allowed outdoors for 1 h a day, marks a turning point in the lockdown diary notes (\"Is it excitement I am hearing in the air?\"). Evaluators define the same day as \"Extremely Chaotic, \" while Human and Natural sounds appear almost equally in the annotations (27 to 26). As restrictions are progressively lifted, Human sounds emerge as the prevailing source in the soundscape evaluations, as well in the diary notes. On Day 48, the author S is the value for Spearman's test; \u03c1 is the rank-order correlation; p is the probability, if the null hypothesis of independence were true, of a result as extreme as the one obtained. By convention, a p-value lower than 0.05 indicates a significant association between variables. Asterisk codes for degree of significance: ***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05.",

Across the whole period, the average daytime sound level was 56.3 dBA, which is in line with the pre-lockdown municipality measurements of urban noise levels at the site (see Acoustic Environment section). The stable Loudness, contrary to expectations, might be explained by changes in people's behavior, evidenced in the significant decrease in Technological sounds (\u03c1 = \u22120.285, p = 0.045 * ) being to a sufficient extent compensated by the increase in Human sounds (\u03c1 = 0.263, p = 0.065). See Table 3 and Figure 8 (fourth row). 2. The decrease in Technological sounds during the time period, which was expected, indicates that the mandated restrictions on traffic circulation and human activities (with, for example, the temporary suspension of all construction works) had a noticeable influence on the soundscape at the site. Despite the site being a pedestrian area, the nearby main road is characterized by both private and public traffic circulation that can be heard from Calle Paulino Mendibil. Additionally, and perhaps due to the absence of direct sources in traffic noise at the site, the occasional construction works have a notable impact on the local soundscape. See Figure 8 (second row, right). 3.

The former showed no change over time (\u03c1 = 0.16, p = 0.25 n.s.), while the latter increased (\u03c1 = 0.35, p = 0.013 * ). A closer look to the evolution in the perception of Human sounds during the different phases can help explain the results. Figure 8 (second row, middle) suggests that people's activity level increased steadily throughout the time period, as evidenced by Human sounds, and was the highest in Phase 3. The diary notes substantiated this interpretation. The word \"children\" progressively appears from Phase 3 onward, when children started to be allowed outdoors after having been confined indoors in the first two phases. 4. The results in regard the expected increase in birdsong were not conclusive. We have already noted during the development of the Taxonomy that the most commonly annotated word overall was \"bird, \" which (together with \"birds\") appeared in \u223c7% of the original labels. The amount of perceived bird sounds did not change significantly over time (\u03c1 = \u22120.09, p = 0.54 n.s.), as evidenced by annotations in the Level 1 category Bird. Neither did the Level 3 category Natural show a significant trend overall. However, inspecting Figure 10 , there was an increase during Phases 1 and 2, followed by a much lower level in Phase 3. This might be explained by factors regarding avian activity: seasonal shifts, mating periods, and noon being something of a siesta time for birds See Figure 8 (second row, left). As for the computational descriptors, AR increased slightly over time (\u03c1 = 0.28, p = 0.051), while Loudness Variability did not change appreciably (see Figure 8 , fifth row), and the two NDSIs (NDSI and the proposed perceptually based pNDSI) showed similar patterns and no significant change overall (Figure 8 , third row, left and middle). 5. Regarding a possible shift from fuel vehicles to light mobility (non-fuel vehicles), we analyzed two categories in the taxonomy, \"Vehicle\" and \"Wheels, \" both in Level 1.",

It takes the form of the diagram shown in Figure 10 , aiming to capture the essentials of the multifaceted aspects of our collaborative case study. Diary notes and Level 3 taxonomic categories (Human, Natural, and Technological; described in the Methods section) were organized by phases and further compared with the perceptual analysis results and with Loudness. We analyzed the text of each Diary note in order to assign it to one of the three categories, where possible. Associations were made based on human sounds, i.e., perceived to be produced by people. This includes voices, footsteps, and laughing (see Annotations of Perceived Sounds section for details). Natural sounds include birds, seagulls, rain, and dogs. Technological sounds include traffic, various objects, and noises. Figure 10 places the diary notes on a timeline, by phases. Illustrations visually represent the keywords associated with the corresponding categories in the diary notes, telling the story of each category's change over After 2 months of (almost) daily recording the soundscape of the little plaza in front of my window, as the Basque Country rolls out what in Spain is called \"Phase 1,\" with small retailers, hairdressers, hospitality open and people happily and maybe unwisely taking the road, I decided to stop publishing -even though I'll keep recording as we move toward \"the new normality\".

            "text": "The increase in Human-generated sounds appears to be the reason for a perceived increase in Eventfulness within the soundscape of the area and a higher degree of Loudness in Phase 3. In the initial Phase 1, leaving one's house was allowed only for work-related tasks and essential shopping. This represented a great change in the habits of local residents. As described in Site of the Case Study section, locals gather around the plaza in the hours before lunch (between 12:00 and 14:00, the time of the recording). Adults occupy local cafes for drinks, while kids play at the playground (during non-school days). During Phase 2, these habits were forcibly suspended, a fact that might explain the generally higher level of Pleasantness, which increased in this phase, and the generally lower level of Eventfulness, which also increased. Diary notes of Phase 1 capture the presence of human voices as an indicator of \"too many people\" being \"still around, \" \"enjoying a chat, \" and \"resonating in the little plaza.\" Human voices, perhaps amplified by the architectural features of the location (the arcade, see Site of the Case Study section), seem to be the most relevant image in the soundscape. In Phase 2, with additional restrictions to activity, humans seem to finally leave the scene in favor of birds and other animals (mainly dogs), which become prominent in the Diary Notes. Diary notes (\"Day 7. Of voices populating windows\" and \"Day 8. Stay inside but keep your window wide open, especially if it's Sunday\") remind us that neighbors tended to leave their windows open more often. Voices and human sounds were recorded as emanating from the inside of other apartments, revealing to the author the intimacy of family life (\"Day 19. In the silence, someone's getting ready for lunch\"). It is worth noticing that during Phases 1 and 2 (mid-March to mid-April), temperatures in the area were warmer than the average (Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda [AEMET], 2020). This might have contributed to residents moving part of their daily activities out onto their balconies and keeping windows open more often, which caused activities to be heard. As illustrated in Site of the Case Study section, the habit of sharing indoor life with the world outside is not common in this area of Spain. Diary notes confirm how exceptional such a behavior was: \"Day 22. A good thing of these days is that I am finally seeing my neighbors, from window to window. Nobody used to lean out of the window in this barrio [neighborhood] of mine, before\" and \"Day 65. Last night we had the last collective clapping for healthcare workers. What will happen to my neighbors now?\" An increased sense of community during and after lockdown has been reported by several sources. One study found that \"a substantial proportion of people felt that they had become more involved in neighborhood life following the lockdown\" (Jones et al., 2020) and that support among neighbors include \"raising morale through humor, creativity and acts of kindness and solidarity\" (idem). Another observer wrote that \"It's not just the help and practicalities, the socializing too is vital. Conversations across balconies, news being discussed and sometimes neighbors humming along to music being played next door\" (Banerjee, 2020) . This apparently new attitude might be connected to a psychological reaction to isolation during lockdown (Henley, 2020) and the need to share with neighbors during such a unique time. The limitations of the present study do not allow for a conclusive interpretation of results. It is difficult to say whether the local residents of the road kept their windows open due to the exceptional meteorological conditions or as the result of psychological reaction to isolation. Note that both Diary Notes and Annotations by the expert group indicate the influence of the indoor soundscape on the outdoor soundscape, which might be due to a reduction of other common sources of outdoor sounds. In fact, machinery and human interaction sounds decreased during the lockdown. This result needs to be considered within the context of the specific location under study, a pedestrian road where traffic noise even during normal times is within regulatory levels. Restrictions such as Phase 2 total ban of any non-necessary activity and a stop on constructions and home renovations should be taken into account. It is only in the last phase of the \"Plan de Desescalada, \" in mid-June, that this ban was lifted. It is well known by now (Garcia, 2020 ) that such restrictions on human activity had a strong impact on the local mobility of people and vehicles. In the whole Basque Country, public transport was reduced by 50% during Phase 1 and only recovered full capacity with the entrance in the so-called \"new normality\" in late June. Conversely, traffic of light vehicles in the Basque Country decreased by 95% (Direcci\u00f3n General de Tr\u00e1fico, 2020) during Phases 1 and 2, along with traffic of heavy vehicles, which is a wellknown source of noise pollution (Jacyna et al., 2017; Kulauzovi\u0107 et al., 2020) , decreased by more than 50% (Ortega Dolz, 2020). With the ban on mobility and closure of international borders, the local airport was exceptionally quiet, and the reduction in international air traffic was 95% (Alonso, 2020) . By contrast, maritime activity at the port of Bilbao fell by only 5% (Alvarez, 2020) . The disparity in reduction between these two types of trade and travel (air or sea) reflects not only their influence on the economy but also their very different levels of impact on the acoustic environment. In fact, if the maritime traffic does not affect the acoustic environment of Las Arenas, traffic from the airport can be heard at times over the area, mostly when, due to specific meteorological conditions, aircrafts land from the sea, thus flying over Calle Paulino Mendibil. Interestingly, the acoustic presence of aircrafts is also reflected in the diary notes, on Day 6: \"Day 6 of lockdown from my window in Getxo, Basque Country. It sounds someone [sic] is still flying out from here. Or in, who knows.\"",

As for human interaction, two factors are worth noticing: the influence of the reopening of cafes and restaurants, with outdoor spaces on the public pedestrian road being allowed extra hours in order to make up for the economic loss of the lockdown weeks; and the reopening of the children playground in the square located opposite the observation point, in a moment (Phase 3) where schools were closed, due to the end of the academic year, which coincided with the end of the \"Desescalada.\" Toward the end of Phase 3, the increase in Eventfulness is testimony to the progressive return of local habits and behaviors, described in Site of the Case Study section.",

Media have widely reported an increase in attention toward the singing of birds by both the scientific and artistic communities. From the launch of the first international global soundscape of spring dawn chorus created by artists and scientists (Morss, 2020) , to birdsong becoming \"more beautiful\" (Cockburn, 2020) or \"sexier\" (Chrobak, 2020) thanks to the absence of human activity, birds seem to have grown to represent the essence of the urban soundscape in lockdown to the point that they could condition political choices (The Economist, 2020). The results of the present studies seem to support these claims at least for Phase 2, when the most restrictive measures were applied to human mobility. In this phase, an increase in the presence of natural sound sources (mainly birds) is observable in the annotations as well as in diary notes, where the word \"birds\" is often noted down in isolation, as if it could contain by itself the whole imagery of a pleasant soundscape. In our study, Pleasantness increased during Phase 2, while Eventfulness decreased, allowing for relating the sonic image of birdsong with that of pleasantness and calm.",

            "text": "A separate reflection should be dedicated to the consequences of lockdown regulations on light mobility. Findings seem to indicate that a growth in perceived sounds of Wheels, a.k.a. manual (non-electric) PMVs, contribute to a perceived increase in Eventfulness, an increase in Loudness, and decrease of Pleasantness of the soundscape in Phase 3. Rather unexpectedly, scooters and other light vehicles seemed to produce a considerable perceptual annoyance, at least when used on pedestrian non-PMV-specific surfaces and nearby residential dwellings, such as the observation point of this study. During the same time period as the present study, according to a study by the Spanish insurance company Acierto and widely circulated by the media (Gutierrez, 2020) , the use of bicycles grew by as much as seven times. Purchases have increased by 30% since Phase 1 (Blanchar, 2020) . Usage of manual and electric scooters as well as other light mobility has also grown. Additionally, from Phase 3 onward, children were allowed out and expressly permitted, if not encouraged (Lucas, 2020) , to use PMVs such as skateboards, roller skaters, and manual scooters. At the time, extended media coverage was dedicated to the claim that \"the pandemic and this crisis is causing a rethinking of many issues in life. It will give much more voice to people who do not use but who suffer from the presence of the car. This element, essential in our culture, will no longer be the privileged element of the city. The post-COVID city will be the post-car city\" (Spanish urban planner Jose Ezquiaga interviewed by Mendoza P\u00e9rez, 2020). In our analysis, we highlighted how evidence could be found that in Phase 3 there was an increase of perceived sounds of Wheels (light vehicles) vs. perceived sounds from Vehicles (traditional fuel vehicles, cf. Figure 8 , third row, right). It is difficult to say whether these changes will be permanent, or whether a return toward private (mainly fuel-based) transport is to be expected, given the risks associated with traveling on public transport while the pandemic is still unresolved. In the months following lockdown, the motorcycle sector in Spain \"witnessed a growth above double-digit, still among great economic uncertainty\" (Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Empresas del Sector de Dos Ruedas [ANESDOR], 2020). We can posit though that the environmental presence of light mobility is important and that specific lane/pavements might be considered to be included as urban design criteria. It is indeed expected that in future cities, the traditional prominence of fuel cars will be superseded by a range of other kinds of mobility devices. \"The world of vehicles is exploding in thousands of shapes and sizes. We are witnessing our cities being more and more conquered by vehicles of different kinds, dimensions and number of occupants\" (S\u00e1daba, 2019) . Fumihiko Maki talks about the intangible \"linkage\" as the glue, \"the act by which we unite the different layers of activity and resulting form of the city\" (Maki, 1964) . Changes in mobility, means of communication, and social interaction will probably soon redefine the eventual shape of cities, a shift that the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have accelerated. On the one hand, the increase in light mobility will have an impact on the width and layout of traffic lanes and on the design and occupation and management of sidewalk curbs (Goffman, 2018) . On the other hand, smart working and a consequent decrease in face-to-face meetings might reduce the need for human displacement within cities. Koolhaas' \"event structure\" of cities (Kipnis, 1996) will become diverse and multifaceted. The limitations of the present case study do not allow us to generalize results in order to imagine potential scenarios of changes in the urban soundscape in the case of a decrease in fuel cars. Nonetheless, we believe that by measuring and analyzing intangible aspects of the city, such as the acoustic environment, we can gather precious insights to optimize the design of appropriate indicators for future quality of life, as well as health, and a better management of finite resources. In our study, we combined what Gehl and Svarre call \"Keeping a Diary, \" \"Photographing, \" and \"Tracking\" (our soundscape recordings) with quantitative and qualitative analyses, to understand the social behavioral changes triggered by the lockdown. Soundscape research provides crucial knowledge, allowing a better understanding of city life. This study contributes to opening up further research on the tangible-intangible duality in order to offer improved urban indicators for city and mobility design.",

It is yet too early to speculate about what might be learned from the experiences we -all of us -are currently making in exceptional times. Soundscape research provides vital clues to understanding the perception and design of the multimodal environment -how humans are psychologically, physiologically, physically, and socially affected by sound; and also, how other living creatures are likewise affected. It makes a constructive and oftentimes undervalued contribution. Will researchers, sound designers, and architects be part of a discussion with urbanists, policy makers, politicians, businesses, and indeed the general public, in seeking solutions to the mounting challenges to urban living conditions in the future?",

            "text": "We believe that the tangible-intangible duality can be applied as a holistic approach to include both objective and subjective indicators to the evaluation of urban soundscape. At the start of this article, we briefly recalled the origins of the soundscape movement and its influence on urban ecology and urban planning. Still, public endeavors such as the Noise White Paper of Getxo exemplify the fact that \"landscape architecture and related disciplines have not fully recognized the possibilities of considering sound issues in design projects\" (Cerw\u00e9n, 2017) . The Noise White Paper of Getxo is written in development of the Acoustic Pollution Decree of the Basque Government (Decreto 213/2012, de 16 de octubre, de contaminaci\u00f3n ac\u00fastica de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma del Pa\u00eds Vasco) that, undeniably, only focuses on the negative aspects of sound and/or noise in order to detect problematic points in the urban landscape and mitigate the effects and the subsequent discomfort they may cause. Furthermore, the project for the Law for the Protection of Landscape of the Basque Government (1998) does not make any specific mention of soundscape as one of the elements of urban planning. This is all the more remarkable given that for more than two decades the European Commission has had policies in place aimed at reducing noise exposure. Indeed, noise is still \"the ignored pollutant\" (King and Murphy, 2016) , but one way forward is to focus less on noise in general and more on how to promote specific and positively valenced sounds in the environment (e.g., Davies et al., 2013; Aletta et al., 2016a) . Our study aims to contribute to an understanding of the relationship between sound sources and holistic soundscape evaluation. Through this study, we employed a mixed methodology that aims to measure both tangible (such as loudness) and intangible (such as perception of quality) aspects of the environment of a specific neighborhood of the city of Getxo. We believe that it would be possible -and advisable -to introduce this approach to the analysis of the urban soundscape with the ultimate goal to include the attention to the audible landscape of the city in the procedures established by the law in terms of landscape protection and ultimately in the local urban planning policies.",
