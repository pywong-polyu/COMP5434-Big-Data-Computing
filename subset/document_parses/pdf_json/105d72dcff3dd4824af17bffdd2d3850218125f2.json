To ensure continuous current operation at the shoot through mode of grid connected inverter, a switched Z-source converter is utilized at the PV side. The PWM rectifier connected with the wind turbine transforms AC power into dc. Individual power converters with conventional PI controllers have been dedicated for each power source, and control strategy uses only one reference voltage so as to increase the maximum power tracking speed from both PV and wind sources. The battery energy management is performed by artificial neural network (ANN) to enhance the stable power flow and increase the lifespan of the storage system. Finally, the voltage at the point of common coupling is fed to ANN-based space vector-modulated three-phase inverter and the converted AC power is injected to the grid. The overall system performance is measured by estimating the quality of injected power. A stable operation of the proposed microgrid system is verified by varying input and load at the grid. A continuous-time simulation model is realized in MATLAB and is validated using experimental prototype. This benchmark system provides various research scopes for the future smart grids.",

            "text": "With the continuous increase in power demand due to the ever-increasing population, the power generation and distribution unit suffers from overburden and stress. To mitigate these, renewable energy came into existence by which a reliable and continuous power generation is promised by implementing microgrids [1, 2] . Among the investments in several renewable sources, wind and PV are in the frontline [3] . Around 26% of power is generated from renewable sources in all over the country in 2018, and by 2050 this production is expected to reach 100% by which the present global power demand will be made cheaper. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting the global economy at higher rate, a significant investment growth has been continuously notified in the power sector. However, the primary issue associated with these renewable resources is its discontinuous nature and by which the reliability gets affected [4] . To compensate for this, a secondary energy storage such as battery backup system has been utilized with inverter; therefore, the flexibility in storing of power is improved when compared with load regulation-based improvement of power quality [5, 6] . This distributed power system can be stand-alone or gridassociated system where the portion of the power is utilized by system load and balance power is supplied to the grid only if some additional energy pervades. To enhance the stable power flow and power quality at the grid side, various control methods have been addressed in the literature [7] [8] [9] [10] . To satisfy the local load feeding criteria and to maintain continuous power supply, grid-connected operation is highly recommended compared to stand-alone operation. Furthermore, there is a necessity that voltage and frequency of grid should be synchronized [11] . The configuration of microgrid is depending on the converter types used in between source and grid. As the outputs of PV and wind are different, converters like DC/DC and AC/DC are employed in addition to inverter for associating the grid with the energy sources. The type of converter to be utilized for a particular system will vary for all systems and is depending on various technical factors, configurations and power ratings [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

            "text": "As the PV array output is changing with time and of low amplitude, they cannot be applied directly to the inverter connected with grid. There arises a requirement of boost converters so that the panel voltage can be regulated and amplified. Therefore, the proper selection and design of converters is crucial as the system performance is highly relying on the efficiency of the DC-to-DC converters. The boosting ability of step-up converters can be improved using several ways such as cascaded switching technique [16] , switched inductance [17] , coupled components [18] , voltage lift [19] and voltage multiplication [20] . A high voltage gain is possible with the above techniques at the cost of high duty cycle and low efficiency. The drawbacks of conventional converters are mitigated by Z-source network which becomes a hot research topic. The Z-source networks utilize the shoot-through mode of inverters to retain the voltage buck inversion capability. The drawbacks of this network such as discontinuous current conduction, limited boosting ability and high voltage stress are overcome by modifying the conventional structure with switched topology which can also be used as a converter, inverter and rectifier [21] . This converter is more suitable for PV application where a converter with high voltage boost is always in demand. The below table justifies the selection of proposed converter in this work.",

As seen in studies, trial-anderror-based fixed perturbations with constant scaling are required to be initialized in direct duty cycle-based control. But this method results in reduction in tracking efficiency with extended MPP tracking time. To overcome the drawbacks of this adaptive technique, a reference voltagebased closed-loop PI controller can be implemented due to the fact that the MPP voltage difference is comparatively smaller than the difference in MPP current for various insolations [22] [23] [24] [25] . Considering the advantages of PI controller and to achieve better control performance over the former adaptive method, a PI controller-based MPPT is adopted for both the converters of PV and wind system. It is essential to operate both the PV and wind system in such a way that they produce maximum power to obtain high efficiency of the proposed system. The above-cited and other existing works concentrate on improving particular section but in this paper each and every module of the grid-connected hybrid renewable systems is presented. Moreover in this paper, automatic control of state of charging of battery is performed using ANN and its performance is compared with artificial intelligence (AI)based fuzzy controller to prove the energy management effectiveness. The developed model provides open testing platform for different control methods.",

            "text": "All the above converters and control techniques work only the energy available in PV and wind, respectively. Besides the variation in available energy during daytime and wind blowing period, there may be some time that both the sources fail to produce power. To avoid such nonavailability of power, a battery backup is implemented in the grid-connected system. A smart dispatch system is required to control the power dispatch from battery unit [26] . As the loads connected with the grid are uncertain and are liable to vary, conventional battery management scheme cannot be utilized to manage power flow among the battery and grid. The existing controllers supply the entire power of the battery to the grid if the load value increases and the battery may drain out completely. If this process continues, the battery lifespan minimized which in turn causes power outage and reduces the reliability of entire system. Thus, it is essential to implement smart controllers for efficient management of battery system [27] [28] [29] [30] . The outputs of converters of PV and wind sources and battery are connected at the common coupling point where a steady DC voltage is maintained the proposed system. This voltage is coupled to the grid via 3\u0424 voltage source inverter (VSI) and filter circuits. As multilevel inverter [31, 32] and z-source inverter [33, 34] employment makes the circuit complex and costly and reduces the system efficiency, a conventional VSI with LC filter is implemented in our system. Moreover, hybrid system facilitates continuity in power flow, thereby improving the reliability [35, 36] (Fig. 1 ). Figure 2 shows the hybrid energy setup with its converter and control system. The power source consists of an array of PV panels, a wind generator and a storage battery and power-conditioning converters to standardize the power output from the sources and an inverter to interface the grid and energy sources. The PV system is composed of an array of solar panels that are tied up with each other to extract the power output. A switched Z-source converter is implemented to increase the array voltage to a level equal to the DC voltage at the PCC. The wind system has wind blades, a turbine generator and a PWM rectifier to regulate the wind power. A series of batteries is placed to maintain a fixed voltage at the PCC and delivers the power to the grid when there is no output from the renewable sources. The secondary storage system has battery bank and a bidirectional converter that controls the battery's charging and discharging mode via ANN controller. This converter is used as an interface to link the battery terminal and the PCC and controls the flow of current when the voltage levels at the PCC and battery terminal are different. The gridinterfaced inverter delivers the DC power generated from the hybrid resources into the grid as alternating power. A supervisory control scheme is implemented for the inverter and battery and closed-loop PI controllers are dedicated for renewable system, which all together form a hybrid power control and management system. The supervisorycontrol system consists of artificial intelligence-enabled neural and fuzzy networks to coordinate the dynamic and steady power flow.",

The reference tracking error information is given through a suitable scaling factor as input to the ANN to produce the control pulses for the inverter. A constant operating frequency is achieved in both online and offline modes to control the inverter. The functional mapping estimation of ANN controller provides high level of fault tolerance. Knowledge on inverter model is not needed for ANN controller, but, the functional behavior of inverter should be precisely known while designing the ANN controller. (iv) Space vector modulation: Space vector modulation (SVM) is a regulatory strategy that becomes famous in the control and is generally applied in three-stage network associated inverter. SVM is complimenting best pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy because of the numerous highlights of SVM; for example, SVM can give 20% higher yield voltage than the sinusoidal PWM.",

Figure 26 represents the comparison of voltage gain of different converters, which indicates that the voltage transfer ratio is linearly varying with duty proportion. The voltage gain attains the peak value with 40% duty cycle and for the proposed SZS converter is nearly 10, and those for Landsman and LUO converters are 6 and 3.5 for 40% duty cycle. As the duty cycle is decreased, the switching losses are decreased but the overall performance of the system is not improved.",

A continuous power flow is achieved by balancing the energy between source and grid using battery storage system. The THD content in the grid current is maintained well below the IEEE standard level. The results discussed above prove that the individual control of the distributed sources is possible with the proposed system. The efficient tracking of optimum power of solar, the effective control of the rectified output of the wind turbine unit to follow the optimum power and the smart control of battery energy satisfy the continuous power availability, and also a steady power is given to the grid. The system thus made gives a power that is equal to the maximum capacity of the distributed system even when the environmental condition is unfavorable and delivers stable supply even when the power from PV and wind sources is nil. Also SPWM provides fixed switching frequency and easy control methods but suffers from compact efficacy of the DC voltage at the PCC. The proposed SVPWM gives out enough DC voltage by utilizing the proper duty cycle control and minimizes the harmonic content better than SPWM scheme. ",
