We recruited all the patients who had undergone chest CT-Scan and had demonstrated radiographic features of atypical pneumonia (highly suggestive of COVID-19). All the patients were admitted to the infectious diseases ward of IKHC. Written instructions on how to collect the two required specimens were provided for the patients who participated in this study. The first two naso-and oropharyngeal samples were collected by the patients (after reading the instructions) and sent immediately to a clinical laboratory. The following two naso-and oropharyngeal samples were collected (the nasopharyngeal specimen was taken from the opposite nostril) by the lab technician. Specimens were obtained by a sterile Dacron swab with a plastic handle and soon after collection, each swab was placed into a separate container containing viral transport medium (VTM). The specimens were transported to a clinical laboratory within 30 minutes of collection and were processed soon after delivery. Patients' demographic data and their clinical history were collected from their files. None of the patients had a history of having an occupation as a healthcare worker.",

Then, the specimen, 2019-nCOV-PCR positive control, and 2019-nCOV-PCR negative control were placed into the specimen wells of the amplification equipment. The first two steps \"reverse transcription\" and \"cDNA predenaturation\" were performed at 50\u00b0C (30 min) and 95\u00b0C (1 min), each with a single cycle, respectively. A 15-second cycle at 95\u00b0C, followed by a 30-second cycle at 60\u00b0C with 45 repetitions were performed. Then, the device cooled down to 25\u00b0C for 10 seconds to finalize the process. The device's software was used for calculation of the cycle threshold (Ct) values. For 2019-nCoV-PCR negative control Ct value > 40 and for positive control Ct value No\u2264 35 were defined based on each kit's instructions. The RT-PCR results were reported as positive or negative. The whole PCR testing was done by technicians who were blind to the type of the collected specimen.",

Thirty-two (64%) patients were male and 18 (36%) were female. The median age of participants was 56 years, ranging from 24 to 86 years. Among patients, fever (68%), muscle pain, and cough (60% each) were the most common chief complaints. The other symptoms are sorted in Table 1 . Hypertension (9 out of 50 patients), cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory illnesses (each 6 out of 50 patients) were the most notable underlying diseases (Table 2) . Four patients had a history of antibiotic therapy (two with Azithromycin alone, one with Ciprofloxacin and Azithromycin and one patient did not remember the name of antibiotic used). The patients had neither a history of prior hospital admission nor a history of PCR testing for their current disease. O2 saturation levels which were measured by pulse oximeter were \u226593% in 30% of patients and <93% for 70% of the patients when coming to the hospital for the first time. In this study, each patient had two sets of collected samples from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, one of each taken by patients their own and the other by a lab technician. Assuming patients with at least one swab showing a positive result as being infected with SARS-CoV-2, 26 out of 50 patients were infected. All patients with a double negative result for lab techniciancollected samples showed a double negative result in patient-collected samples, too. The Chi-Square Tests table showed a McNemar P-value of 0.039 for nasopharyngeal samples and 0.77 for oropharyngeal samples ( Table 3 ). The overall percentage of agreement among nasopharyngeal swabs taken by a lab technician and patients was 76% with a kappa value of 0.49 (P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.26-0.72) and the overall percentage of agreement among oropharyngeal swabs taken by a lab technician and patients was 76% with a kappa value of 0.49 (P=0.001, 95% CI: 0.24-0.74), after taking chance agreement into account (Table 4 ). Seven out of 50 patients had four positive PCR results for COVID-19 and 24 patients had four negative PCR results. Twelve patients were positive for both nasopharyngeal samples (taken by the patient and lab technician) and thirteen were positive for both oropharyngeal samples. Double negative nasopharyngeal PCR results (taken by patient and lab technician) were observed in 26 patients and double negative oropharyngeal PCR results were seen in 25 patients. Of remaining, ten patients had positive nasopharyngeal samples collected by the lab technician while their self-collected samples showed negative results and two patients had positive results for their selfcollected nasopharyngeal specimen whereas the lab technician-collected specimen was negative for PCR testing. For oropharyngeal specimens, this discordance also existed. Five oropharyngial samples, taken by the lab technician had positive PCR results while their selfcollected samples were negative and seven self-collected oropharyngeal specimens were positive for COVID-19 PCR with negative results for lab technician-collected specimens. In four patients, lab technician-collected samples were positive (two for both samples and two for one of naso-or oropharyngeal samples) whereas their self-collected samples showed negative PCR results.

Our findings about the nasopharyngeal samples showed a systematic difference as well as a moderate agreement between the two. In case of the oropharyngeal samples, although there is no systematic difference between these two collection methods, a moderate agreement (kappa value = 049) was observed between them. Accordingly, in neither of these cases, patient-collected samples can replace the samples collected by lab technicians. The positive tests were more observed in lab technician-collected samples and discordant results between naso-and oropharyngeal samples were more found in self-collected samples (12 patients for self-collected samples versus 10 for lab technician-collected samples). COVID-19 is a new disease and research and experience about self-collected nasal swabs are limited (7-10). However, several studies in pediatrics' field have shown that parental-collected midturbinate, nasopharyngeal, and/or throat specimens for detecting viruses such as human meta pneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses is an efficient and acceptable method (11) (12) .",

Selfcollected swabs were found to be highly acceptable, simple, and comfortable to use. Data from nine studies were meta-analyzed. Pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI: 80%-92%) and specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98%-100%), compared to professional-collected swabs in the diagnosis of influenza. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were used to assess the potential bias that would be introduced in studies that used the self-collected samples rather than professional collected ones.

Therefore, according to our study, selfcollection methods cannot be simply applied for COVID-19 patients.
