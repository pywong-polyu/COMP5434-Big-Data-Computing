It also advocates indirect measures like the five-level EuroQoL Group's five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) using the scoring algorithm for Chinese population, over direct measures [4] . The EQ-5D is a widely used and internationally validated instrument measuring utility on a scale between zero (death) and one (full health). Respondents value their own health against five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and grade their response according to three (3L) or, more recently, five (5L) levels of each domain. Values are converted to utilities using a reference population's value set. A valuation set is available for China and studies confirm that the Chinese version provides comparable results to the English version [6, 7] . Importantly, the EQ-5D has demonstrated validity, responsiveness, and reliability in assessing health outcomes specifically for breast cancer patients [8, 9] .",

            "text": "We synthesised studies reporting health state utility values for Chinese women with breast cancer, for the purpose of parameterising a cost utility model. For all combinations of sensitivity analysis the range of utility values stayed between 0.82 when combining all five studies, to 0.87 when combining the two most closely related studies (Table 11 ). This 0.05 difference is less than the minimal clinically important difference reported by Pickard for all cancers (0.10 to 0.12 ) [25] . As with all best Our study has a number of strengths, firstly it is based on a systematic and transparent literature search strategy designed to have high specificity to identify utility elicited by EQ-5D. Previous work has highlighted the need for strict inclusion criteria to minimise heterogeneity and cautions against pooling utilities derived from different instruments [27, 28] . In keeping with this, we restricted our study to EQ5D alone, therefore results are highly valid for cost utility analyses requiring utility for women with different stages of breast cancer in China. The quality of the studies has been assessed and is considered suitable for pooling the data. Another strength is that four of the five studies use value sets derived from China population. Literature has highlighted between region difference in value sets and noted the importance of using the region specific value set [27] . This is especially apparent in the case of Cheung, which reports the lowest mean utility Table 6 Summary of single arm meta-analyses of studies of breast cancer patients by TNM classification. [6, 29] . Therefore, including Cheung likely underestimates the utility of the general population in China. Ou is the outlier for region (Taiwan) and has the highest mean utility. Ou previously noted that the utility values were higher for Taiwan versus China. In addition, Ou includes only hormone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative subtypes. When only the three China studies are included (Li, Yang, Wang) for random effects model the point estimate drops from 0.84 to 0.82 and the lower bound widens slightly from (0.81, 0.87) to (0.77,0.87).",

The interpretation of I 2 is not well defined, as a guide, less than 40% may not be important; 30-60% indicates moderate heterogeneity, 50-90 indicates substantial heterogeneity and 75-100% considerable heterogeneity [33, 34] . Higgins has presented the case that \"in relation to study effect sizes any amount of heterogeneity is acceptable, providing both that the predefined eligibility criteria for the metanalysis are sound and that the data are correct\" [33] . Heterogeneity has been broadly described as clinical (variability in the participants, interventions, and outcomes) and methodological (study design, bias ) [35] . In our study the methodological heterogeneity is welldefined and relates to the study region (China vs. Taiwan vs. Singapore), EQ-5D version (5L vs. 3L) and index value sets (EQ5D5L vs. EQ5D3L vs. Japanese). This explained heterogeneity is quantified in the meta-regression.",

            "text": "The clinical heterogeneity is more difficult to disentangle and contributes to the unexplained heterogeneity in our study. Synthesising the studies according to TNM status reduces the heterogeneity, although it remains considerable. Similarly, synthesising studies according to PSRM status further reduces heterogeneity notably to zero for State R. We believe this reflects the mix of treatments in the individual studies. For example the studies reported a range of treatments which are difficult to compare across studies because they reported different treatment combination, some of which are overlapping (not mutually exclusive) (see supplement). Chemotherapy for example has been identified as associated with poor quality of life (Ou) . The study with the lowest proportion of patients having chemotherapy (alone) was Wang (up to 30%); Yang (up to 31%); Li (47%); Cheung (50%) and Ou (70%), (we note that these proportions of chemotherapy do not correspond to poorer quality of life values and further research is required to understand this relationship). Other studies have noted that chemotherapy is associated with poorer quality of life (Ou) . Not only are different treatment combinations provided, but the treatment setting also varies, for example in the Li study, 100% were inpatients compared to 29% in Cheung and 16% in Yang. Inpatient/outpatient mix is not reported for Ou and Wang. We can hypothesise that inpatients are \"sicker\" than outpatients and hence have lower utility. Another source of variability that it is not possible to explore in our analysis is the breast cancer subtypes. Ou included 100% patients with breast cancer subtypes HR-positive/ HER2-negative; (see supplement); Li included 54% with ER/PR positive; Yang includes 80% HER positive patients. Chueng and Wang do not report the breast cancer subtypes. Literature suggests that patients have slightly different prognosis and outcomes than other breast cancer subtypes such as Luminal A and B. The subtypes are not provided for all studies and it was not possible to explore this variable for heterogeneity. The remaining heterogeneity likely reflects the diversity in duration since diagnosis (see supplement). The random effects model is likely to better account for the heterogeneity, however we wanted to present both sets of results so that the reader Table 8 Summary of single arm meta-analyses of studies of breast cancer patients by duration since diagnosis can see that there is not a large difference between the model estimates.",
