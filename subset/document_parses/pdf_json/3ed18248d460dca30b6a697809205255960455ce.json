Although one problem may have multiple causes and lead to more than one intervention, it leads to only one outcome. The severity ratings of the outcomes of DRPs were categorized using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP) classification [19] . This classification comprises four categories according to ascending severity of the patient outcome: (1) circumstances or events that have the capacity to cause error (no error, subcategory A); (2) MEs occurred without posing harm to patients (subcategories B, C and D); (3) MEs caused harm to patients (subcategories E, F, G and H); (4) MEs resulted in a patient's death (subcategory I).

Otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was used, represented by medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) (25-75th percentiles). Categorical variables were represented by frequencies and percentages, and between-group differences were analyzed using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test if necessary. Variance inflation factor (VIF) values were calculated to measure the degree of multicollinearity among the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis (p < 0.1). A VIF of > 10 was considered indicative of multicollinearity and excluded from the logistic regression analysis. Based on the univariate analysis and VIF values, variables that were significant (p < 0.1) were included in the multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with the occurrence of DRPs.

This number was close to that in two studies, 0.39 from one study conducted in the neurology ward in Switzerland by pharmacists [18] , and 0.29 from the other study done in the inpatient ward and intensive care unit of the department of neurology in Egypt [16] . However, the average number of DRPs per patient in this study was lower than the following two studies: (1) the Brazilian study (1.26 DRPs per patient) using the trigger DRP classification [15] , (2) the Iran research (1.37 DRPs per patient) using the modified PCNE DRP classification V5.01 [17] . These studies showed a significantly different mean number of DRPs per patient in different hospitals. Study population size and setting, characteristics of the patient population, study duration, definition of DRPs, types of classification systems, patterns of medication use, and differences of clinical guidelines may contribute to the variations of DRPs prevalence among studies [20] [21] [22] .",

The findings that age and length of hospital stay were not factors predicting the occurrence of DRPs in our analysis were different from previous studies [15, 16, 23] . It was worth noting that whether patients were fed through nasogastric feeding was an important factor associated with DRPs. Since a significant proportion of patients admitted to the neurology unit may require nasogastric feeding, the use of modifiedrelease medication products can be problematic [24] . Modified-release drug products such as nifedipine controlled-release tablets, felodipine sustained-release tablets, and aspirin enteric-coated tablets when crushed may alter the release profile and location, which may affect its effectiveness and safety. However, because the doctors lacked knowledge on differences of various types of dosage forms, patients that were fed through nasogastric feeding were more likely to have DRPs [21] . In our study, treatment safety was the major type of DRPs. The result was different compared to the Brazilian and Egypt study, where the untreated condition was the major type of DRP identified. The result indicates the unique role that clinical pharmacists in China play in ensuring the safe use of medications for patients in the [15] [16] [17] [18] 25] . The highest rate of acceptance so far demonstrates that pharmacist interventions were highly useful for physicians and a sufficient relationship of trust between physicians and pharmacists. The fact that 86.8% of DRPs were rated at severity categories B to D (causing no patient harm) further proves the importance of clinical Abbreviations: C cause pharmacists in preventing medication errors and ensuring medication safety. Our study has the following limitations: (1) this was a single-center study and patient populations admitted into the neurology unit could not include all neurologic diseases due to specializations of the department, so our findings may not be generalizable to other hospitals and neurology units in China, and (2) medication review was performed by one clinical pharmacist, and (3) our study did not assess the relationship between patients' longterm outcomes and the resolution of DRPs.",
