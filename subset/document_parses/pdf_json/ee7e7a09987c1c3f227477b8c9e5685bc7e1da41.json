Three hundred individuals were asked to volunteer in the present study. All participants were recruited in Poland from September 2017 to July 2019. Finally, a total of 129 premenopausal women took part in the research and signed informed consent. Their ages ranged between 18 and 48 years old (M = 32.28, SD = 7.65). Self-reported weight and height were recorded. BMI was calculated using self-reported data. Their average body mass index was 30.54 kg/m 2 (SD = 3.69). In our randomized experiment, the participants were allocated into three groups: experimental group I (EG I, N = 43), experimental group II (EG II, N = 46), and wait list control group (CG, N = 40). Five questionnaires were included in the online survey at the baseline measurement (Day 0), at the end of psychoeducational intervention (Day 16) and 75 days from the start of the 15-day intervention (Day 76).",

The high prevalence of computer use provides novel possibilities for enhancing health service delivery (American Psychological Association 2015; Dening et al. 2019) .

These recommendations were related to the fact that: (a) the spread of obesity was constantly increasing and the cost of treatment constantly rising, (b) some of the studies have indicated that psychological factors may be involved in the development, maintenance, and treatment of obesity (e.g., Castelnuovo et al. 2016; Hemmingsson 2014; Marks 2015; McGowan 2016; Raman et al. 2013; Spieker and Pyzocha 2016; World Health Organization 2014; Yumuk et al. 2014) .

However, specialists still point to important problems (Kirk et al. 2012) . According to healthcare professionals, one of the barriers to obesity care and treatment has been the patient's poor emotional and mental health (Kaplan et al. 2018) . Patients believe that the difficulty arises from a lack of knowledge and motivation to change, an inability to control eating behaviors, and a preference for unhealthy food (Kaplan et al. 2018) . The significance of these variables in the development and maintenance of obesity was confirmed by the models developed by Marks (2015) , Hemmingsson (2014) , and Raman et al. (2013) . These models indicated that maladaptive emotional functioning was associated with unhealthy eating behaviors and distorted body image.",

These researchers postulated that in addition to changing abnormal eating behaviors, one should focus on changing one's emotional functioning and the relationship with one's own body (Kristeller and Hallett 1999; Kristeller and Wolever 2011; Wnuk and Du 2017) . Interestingly, one of these studies suggested that to achieve this goal, specialists should combine mindful eating training with Emotional Schema Therapy (Wnuk and Du 2017) . The efficacy of Emotional Schema Therapy is still being verified among overweight and obese patients. In turn, mindful eating training has often been used as a basic method of treatment among patients with excess body weight (e.g., Kristeller and Wolever 2011; Morvaridi et al. 2018; Seguias and Tapper 2018; Schultz 2017; Washington et al. 2017; Wnuk and Du 2017) . It turned out that intervention in the field of mindfulness promoted (both among overweight and obese people) (a) a reduction in anxiety and depression (Daubenmier et al. 2011; Kristeller et al. 2013 ); (b) the development of a proper attitude towards food and its enjoyment (Smart et al. 2015) ; (c) the regulation of problematic nutrition (Ouwens et al. 2015; Katterman et al. 2014; O'Reilly et al. 2014 ); (d) better control of food intake accompanied by an increased awareness of hunger and satiety signals (Kristeller and Hallett 1999) ; (e) an improvement in the assessment of one's body (Bush et al. 2014) ; and (f) an increase in weight loss effectiveness (Kidd et al. 2013) .",

However, based on previous research into emotional functioning, it was hypothesized that a theoretically consistent approach (TCA; an approach based on Emotional Schema Therapy) would be more effective than an eclectic approach (EA; the approach consisted of a combination of different approaches to treating emotional functioning, e.g., a combination of compassion-focused therapy (Gilbert 2009 ) and dialectical behavioral therapy (Linehan 2014)).",

Cronbach's alpha coefficient (reliability) for subscales in the non-clinical population was \u03b1 negative appreciation of body size = 0.80, \u03b1 lack of familiarity with body = 0.68, and \u03b1 general dissatisfaction = 0.80 (Brytek-Matera and Probst 2014). The presented analysis only focused on the two subscales-negative appreciation of body size (\u03b1 = 0.80) and lack of familiarity with one's body (\u03b1 = 0.85).",

As for emotion regulation, the type of intervention was not a differentiating factor, while in the area of the abovementioned variable related to body image, the first type was only effective than the second. These results may have been associated with one of the skills developed in the module of emotion regulation. It is worth emphasizing that the ability to differentiate between specific emotions was developed only in EG I (and not EG II). Thus, it may be the case that participants transferred the strategy of designing specific emotional experiences to relationships with their own bodies. Their activity related to emotions in respect of their own body would be based on the following steps: (1) identification of emotional triggers (e.g., social exposure), (2) cognitive assessment of trigger and cognitive restructuring, (3) behavioral experiments, (3) the acceptance of emotions, (4) modulating responses triggered by emotions, (5) implementation of behaviors causing deliberately selected emotions. These steps are consistent with the information presented in the book \"Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Eating Disorders\" (Fairburn 2013) in relation to triggers of maladaptive behaviors related to body and eating. In terms of mindful eating, lack of familiarity with one's body, and negative emotions, the web-based psychoeducation did not result in any significant changes-no differences between EG I, EG II, and CG on Day 16 and on Day 76. Moreover, these variables were at a similar level in both experimental groups. This means that both types of intervention did not lead to such strong changes in the abovementioned context, so it was possible to obtain statistically significant differences between the groups (possible explanations can be found here).",

However, no further changes in the abovementioned field could be observed-outcomes on Day 16 not differing significantly from Day 76. A similar result in the measurements on Day 16 and Day 76 was observed for all dependent variables in EG I and EG II (except for BMI). Perhaps there was a similar trajectory for the development of changes in all dependent variables, or changes in the one variable affected the level of other variables (e.g., an increase in emotion regulation may have promoted more mindful and healthy eating and a more positive relationship with one's own body). These assumptions were consistent with the results by Kidwell et al. (2015) . These authors have shown that changes in the adaptive regulation of emotions were associated with the development of more adaptive eating habits. Also, the other results of the studies (Bush et al. 2014 ) provided evidence that the use of mindfulness techniques supported a reduction in negative experience of one's own body.",

A possible explanation may have been the use of restrictive methods of weight loss by participants, a common phenomenon in people with excess body weight (Johns et al. 2014) . These behaviors usually lead to rapid weight loss followed by weight gain (the yo-yo effect), especially if people use many dietary restrictions (Osborn et al. 2011; Palm et al. 2017) . We can also assume that asking individuals to report their weight could impact on selfmonitoring of body weight.",

It should be remembered that BMI and body weight were measured twice, which results in a lack of sphericity assessment (Field 2018). The statistically significant outcomes were highlighted in bold. Details on the effect size can be found here groups (EG I, EG II-more overweight women than obese; CG-a reverse trend). In the future, it will be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions separately for both groups. It should also be noted that 16.18% of the women had a physical illness. This may have inhibited weight loss, despite the high effectiveness of psychological training (e.g., Bliddal et al. 2014; Green et al. 2015) . Moreover, other factors that could have affected the results were those associated with participants' age and their hormones and metabolic functioning. The reason for choosing premenopausal women was to increase the homogeneity of the group. Mention has been made above of the impact of hormones and metabolic functioning and of differences between the two groups (premenopausal and postmenopausal). Given that the participants are women up to 48 years of age, there are a significant number of these in the premenopausal stage. We should keep in mind the fact that there are also significant hormonal changes during this stage. Therefore, when analyzing our results, it is important to remember this limitation. Additionally, in subsequent studies seeking to gain better insight into how women function, one should ask about the symptoms of menopause (including changes in menses [e.g., cessation of menses or unusually light or heavy periods], hot flushes, and reduced sex drive).",

The abovementioned limitations may have been a source of heterogeneity of the group and may have had a negative influence on the validity of the experimental study by increasing withingroup variation (Brzezi\u0144ski and Zakrzewska 2016) . Moreover, one of our study's limitations is that body weight data is not available immediately after the end of the intervention. Some articles suggest that interventions result in meaningful weight loss at the beginning of the intervention, and weight gain a few months after the end of the intervention (e.g., Osborn et al. 2011) . Therefore, weight that participants may have lost during the online intervention could have been regained during the follow-up period. Other conclusions can be found here.",

The most important next step would be a longer-term trial to examine whether longer-term trial results in weight loss in overweight and obese individuals. Moreover, in future studies, it should be verified whether our intervention can be used to psychoeducation women both in the psychologist's office and in interdisciplinary teams. Because there was an extensive research done showing that conducting the online intervention is as effective as the traditional therapy model and introduction of web-based interventions to the traditional treatment was effective as well (Andersson and Titov 2014; Andersson and Hedman 2013; Mohr et al. 2010 ).",

Cronbach's alpha coefficient (reliability) for the general scale was 0.86 and for individual subscales: \u03b1 acceptance = 0.89, \u03b1 awareness = 0.82, \u03b1 non-reactivity = 0.77, \u03b1 routine = 0.75, \u03b1 distractibility = 0.81, \u03b1 unstructured = 0.60(Hulbert-Williams et al. 2014). The presented analysis only focused on the general scale (\u03b1 = 0.84).The Three-Factor Eating QuestionnaireThe Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18)(Brytek- Matera et al. 2017;Karlsson et al. 2010) contained three subscales: (a) restrictive eating (example item: \"I consciously hold back at meals in order not to weight gain\"); (b) uncontrolled eating (example item: \"Sometimes when I start eating, I just can't seem to stop\"); and (c) emotional eating (example item: \"When I feel blue, I often overeat\"). The results of the subjects were finally recoded on a 4-point scale. The higher the score, the higher the maladaptive eating behaviors were. The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18 had good validity(Karlsson et al. 2010). Cronbach's alpha coefficient (reliability) for subscales in the Polish adaptation of the questionnaire was \u03b1 restrictive eating = 0.78, \u03b1 uncontrolled eating = 0.84, and \u03b1 emotional eating = 0.86(Brytek-Matera et al. 2017).
