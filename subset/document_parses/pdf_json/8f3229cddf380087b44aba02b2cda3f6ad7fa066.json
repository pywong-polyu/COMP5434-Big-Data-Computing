The numbers of sparks generated by fireworks have a great impact on the algorithm performance. It is widely accepted that promising fireworks should generate more sparks. However, in many researches, the quality of a firework is judged only on its current fitness value. This work proposes a Learning Automata-based Fireworks Algorithm (LA-FWA) introduced Learning automata (LA) to assign sparks for a better algorithm performance. Sparks are assigned to fireworks according to a state probability vector, which is updated constantly based on feedbacks from an environment so that it accumulates historical information. The probability vector converges as the search proceeds so that the local search ability of the LAFWA turns strong in the late search stage. Experimental results performed on CEC2013 benchmark functions show that the LAFWA outperforms several pioneering FWA variants.",

Fireworks are initialized in solution space randomly in FWA and sparks are generated by the explosion process of fireworks. All fireworks and sparks are regarded as candidate solutions, and the explosion process is considered to be a stochastic search around the fireworks. The original FWA works as follows: N fireworks are initialized randomly in a search space, and their quality (the fitness value is used to represent the quality of fireworks in the original FWA) is evaluated to determine the number of sparks and explosion amplitude for all fireworks. Afterwards, the fireworks explode and generate sparks within their local space. Finally, N candidate fireworks are selected from all the fireworks and sparks as new fireworks of the next generation. The workflow continues until the termination criterion is reached.",

Zheng proposes the Enhanced Fireworks Algorithm (EFWA) [10] , five modifications combined with conventional FWA eliminate some disadvantages of the original algorithm among it. Li proposes GFWA which puts forward a simple and efficient mutation operator called guiding vector. The Adaptive Fireworks Algorithm (AFWA) [11] uses a new adaptive amplitude calculated according to the fitness value instead of the amplitude operator in EFWA. Based on EFWA, Zheng proposes the Dynamic Search in Fireworks Algorithm (dynFWA) [12] as an improvement. In dynFWA, the firework with the smallest fitness value uses the dynamic explosion amplitude strategy. Variants mentioned above optimize the performance by adjusting the explosion amplitude adaptively. [13] proposes a fireworks algorithm based on a loser-out tournament, which also uses an independent selection operators to select fireworks for the next generation.",

An learning automaton maintains a state probability vector where each component represents a reward probability of an action. The vector is updated through interactions with a stochastic unknown environment. LA tries to find the optimal action from a finite number of actions by applying actions to environment constantly. Environment returns a reinforcement signal which shows the relative quality of a selected action. An learning automaton receives signals and updates the vector according to its own strategy. When the termination criterion is satisfied, the optimal action is found out. So far, several PSO algorithms combined with LA have been proposed. Hashemi [15] proposes a PSO variant using LA to adaptively select parameters of PSO. A PSO variant that integrates with LA in a noisy environment is proposed by Zhang [16] . It uses LA through its unique selection mechanism to allocate re-evaluations in an adaptive manner and reduce computing resources.",
