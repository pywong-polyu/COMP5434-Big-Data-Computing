Each subscale contained 7 items. Participants were requested to use 4-point rated scales denoting severity to detect how far they have experienced each impact over the past week. Relevant items for depression, anxiety and stress were summed to calculate the scores. Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) [18] is a self-report containing 21 items denoting the experienced distress in response to traumatic events being living in the current pandemic situation also hearing news of deaths among medical professionals. Items correspond directly to 14 of the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD [13] . Respondents were asked to indicate the degree of distress during the past 7 days on each \"difficulty\" among the questionnaire list using 5-point scale ranging from 0 (\"not at all\") to 4 (\"extremely\") in response to COVID-19 as a stress-ful life event.

Those with clinically significant stress were 52.9% (Table 3 ). The result of this study was in accordance with the results of a study held in Saudi Arabia where the majority of medical students (73%) were found to be stressed [1] . Our results were higher than the finding of a study held in India by Vala et al. [15] who used the same psychometric tool and found that depression, anxiety and stress were 15.6, 17.2, 10.8%, respectively. Yet, only 1st year medical students were assessed in the last study. Also, our results are higher than survey held in China among college students as all in which the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students [5] . Another Chinese study found that deteriorated mental health status among Chinese students [4] . Wang et al. [16, 17] found that in total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; those who reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms was 28.8%; while 8.1% of the respondents showed reported moderate to severe stress levels. This difference may be due to involvement of large sample among all college students not only medical students.",
