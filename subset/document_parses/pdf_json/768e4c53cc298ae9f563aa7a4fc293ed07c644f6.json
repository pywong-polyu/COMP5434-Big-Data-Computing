Comorbid disease is a risk factor for worse outcomes (2) , and medications that modulate the immune system can have varying effects on COVID-19, depending on their mechanism of action. SARS-CoV-2, in addition to infecting the respiratory epithelium, can also infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract mucosa via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TRMPRSS) (3) . In addition to upper and lower respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 can be associated with GI symptoms such as anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea (4). Vedolizumab (VDZ), a monoclonal antibody against integrin, blocks the interaction between 4 7 integrin on CD4+ T cells and its receptor mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) on high endothelial venules (HEV) in the GI tract, with downstream blockage of lymphocyte trafficking into gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), (5) . VDZ is approved for the treatment of moderate-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in adult patients (5, 6) . Given its gut-specific mechanism of action, VDZ does not impact systemic immunity significantly and has a favorable safety profile (7) . However, VDZ is associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile and other intestinal infections (8) . Recent data report that VDZ may modulate ACE2 expression in the GI tract (9) .",

We compared all outcomes among adult patients on VDZ vs all other IBD therapies in the registry (VDZ vs. non-VDZ). As the category of all other medications is heterogenous, we additionally compared VDZ monotherapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monotherapy, which is the largest homogenous category of reported medications in the registry.

Of these, 536 (51.4%) patients were on an intravenous anti-TNF while the remaining 507 (48.6%) patients were on a subcutaneous anti-TNF. 354 (9.7%) patients were on combination therapy with an M a n u s c r i p t Manuscript Doi: 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjab071 7 anti-TNF and an immunomodulator. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients in VDZ vs. non-VDZ groups are reported in Table 1 . Compared to the non-VDZ group, patients on VDZ were slightly older (mean age 43.8 years vs 42.0 years, p=0.03), more likely to be white (86.0% vs 81.2%, p=0.01) and less likely to be Asian or Hispanic (1.8% vs. 5.0%, p=0.002 and 10.9% vs 14.9%, p<0.001, respectively). Of patients on VDZ, 209 (45.7%) were from the United States, whereas of those on other therapies, 1110 (34.8%) were from the United States (p<0.001). Compared to the non-VDZ group, more patients in the VDZ group had UC (53.8% vs 40.2%, p<0.001). Other baseline and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. Baseline characteristics of VDZ monotherapy compared to anti-TNF monotherapy are reported in the supplementary table.",

Lukin, Kumar et al reported in a case-control study that COVID-19 outcomes of patients on all biologic therapies, including VDZ (n=10), were comparable, although VDZ was not studied individually (11) . Similarly, Axelrad et al reported in a descriptive case series that there were no differences in outcomes among patients on VDZ (n=5) compared to other IBD therapies (12) . Given the gut-selective mechanism of action of VDZ and lack of significant systemic adverse effects (7), its safety in patients with COVID-19 is reassuring. It is important to note that the comparator, non-VDZ group is heterogenous and includes patients on all other medications such as 5-aminosalisylic acid, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and combination therapies, each of which can have varying impact on COVID-19 outcomes (13) .",

There was no difference in severe COVID-19 between the two groups, but the direction of the effect was consistent with that of hospitalization.

Limitations of this voluntary registry include the risk of reporting bias, which may lead to documentation of the more severe cases that come to the attention of healthcare providers, while the milder cases may remain undiagnosed or underreported. Conversely, frequently tested asymptomatic patients may be diagnosed incidentally. However, given the large sample size and representation of patients in various subgroups, this is less likely.
