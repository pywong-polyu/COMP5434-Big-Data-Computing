The effect of prescription of vitamin D (metabolites) for other indication previous to the hospitalization was studied with respect to patient survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and hazard ratios support an association between prescription of these metabolites and patient survival. Such association was stronger for calcifediol (Hazard Ratio, HR = 0.67, with 95% confidence interval, CI, of [0.50-0.91]) than for cholecalciferol (HR = 0.75, with 95% CI of [0.61-0.91]), when prescribed 15 days prior hospitalization. Although the relation is maintained, there is a general decrease of this effect when a longer period of 30 days prior hospitalization is considered (calcifediol HR = 0.73, with 95% CI [0.57-0.95] and cholecalciferol HR = 0.88, with 95% CI [0.75, 1.03]), suggesting that association was stronger when the prescription was closer to the hospitalization.",

            "text": "Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a large number of diseases including immune disorders and infections. The causal role of vitamin D for rickets and osteomalacia is well demonstrated and its role in aggravating osteoporosis is well accepted 1 . Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), the threshold nutrient of the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES), is acquired by cutaneous synthesis under the influence of UV-B light and in minimal amounts from the diet. It is transported, like other VDES metabolites, by vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). Vitamin D is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in the liver, through the action of 25 hydroxylase (mainly CYP2R1 and some other P450 enzymes). 25OHD or calcifediol is the best biomarker of nutritional status. It is also is substrate for the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D or calcitriol through the action of 1\u03b1 hydroxylase (CYP27B) in the kidney for its endocrine actions, and in multiple cells of the body for its auto/paracrine action. The systemic hormone calcitriol binds with high affinity to its nuclear receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), regulating transcription of a large number (~ 3%) of genes, with a broad spectrum of functional activities 1 . However, its extra-skeletal effects are more disputed. Several Mendelian Randomization studies demonstrated that genetically low serum 25OHD concentrations increase the risk of multiple sclerosis 2 and a meta-analysis found a reduced incidence of upper respiratory infections when supplements of vitamin D are given to relatively vitamin D deficient subjects 3 . There are now multiple association studies 4-10 and meta-analyses 11-13 linking a poor vitamin D status with increased risk 4,8-10 or severity of COVID-19 infections 4-7 .",

The NICE experts agreed that a poor vitamin D status was associated with more severe outcomes from COVID-19 but without proof of causality, especially because the risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes are also risk factors for low vitamin D status 14 . This is also the conclusion from a recent Cochrane analysis 15 . Moreover, a recent study on systematic drug repurposing for COVID-19 based on machine learning has found that, among others, the VDR protein could have a protector effect over pathways affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection 16 , suggesting a potential protecting role for VDES metabolites such as cholecalciferol, calcifediol or calcitriol. This drug repurposing study used mechanistic models 17 of the COVID-19 disease map 18 to find relevant interactions between proteins (already targets of drugs with other indications) and the pathways affected by COVID-19 disease infection either directly or downstream, collectively known as the COVID-19 disease map 18 , thus providing mechanistic evidences of the protective effect of VDES metabolites in COVID-19.",

The RMST curve represents the expected survival days (on average) that subjects from the prescription group have with respect to untreated patients during the hospitalization time considered. Figure S4 shows that calcifediol prescription shows a significantly better survival than untreated for most of the 30 days interval studied.

            "text": "Andalusia, with 8.5 million inhabitants is the third largest region in Europe, having a population similar to Austria and being bigger than half of the countries of the European Union. Moreover, it has the largest population under a universal EHR. All data recorded by the Andalusian Public Health System is stored in the BPS. This allowed an unprecedented region-wise cohort study of 15,968 patients, which corresponds to all the COVID-19 patients that were hospitalized between January and November 2020. This large-scale RWE study clearly shows that prescription for whatever indication with VDES metabolites significantly reduces the risk of death in patients hospitalized for COVD-19, This effect is stronger in patients who received a prescription for calcifediol, but also occurs in patients who received a prescription for cholecalciferol and inconclusive in the case of calcitriol (due to the small sample size its effect was not statistically significant). To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of prior prescription of VDES metabolites (cholecalciferol, calcifediol or calcitriol) on death in patients hospitalized for COVID. Moreover, due to the country-size scale of this observational study it is easy to mimic the randomization element of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and properly compare treatment groups, given the number of individuals available to properly adjust for all baseline cofounders 26 . Actually, the use of propensity scores provides additional adjustment to control for confounding variables 27 . Here, as shown in Table 2 , confounding effects between the compared groups due to the known variables associated to the outcomes considered can be ruled out. The Health record system can only identify subjects receiving a prescription but cannot verify the actual intake of the prescribed drugs. Compliance is usually highest shortly after the prescription and declines afterwards. Therefore, due to the short time between the prescription and start of the COVID-19 infection it is highly likely that most subjects have taken www.nature.com/scientificreports/ their vitamin D (metabolites). A lower compliance may even imply a relative higher efficacy as the number of prescriptions and number of COVID-19 hospitalizations are well documented. The consistency of the results presented here strongly suggests that patients who have been prescribed treatment preferentially with calcifediol (and less intensively with cholecalciferol) for other health objectives (usually for the prevention or treatment of primary or secondary osteoporosis or population at risk of vitamin D deficiency) presented a better response to COVID-19. In Andalusia, 25OHD deficiency (\u2264 20 ng/ml) is usually very prevalent in spring and winter (34.5 and 37.2%), which is maintained even in summer (26.9%), but was probably higher during the lockdown in the period covered by the present study. 25OHD due to its half-life of two to three weeks is used as a nutritional marker of endocrine system levels of vitamin D and is a substrate for the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D in multiple organs and systems 28 . However, the data used in this study did not contain information on the real doses of vitamin D or calcifediol taken prior the hospitalization. Therefore, it is unclear whether the better protection by calcifediol prescription compared to vitamin D itself is due to their intrinsic differences or was caused by different dosing.",

Initially, these were observational ecologic studies that described a higher incidence of COVID-19 infection and death in countries where vitamin D deficiency (or low sun exposure) was common 12, [30] [31] [32] . Thereafter, several studies evaluated the association between vitamin D status and risk or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Two recent meta-analyses have looked at published data linking vitamin D status with the risk or severity (ICU admission and mortality) of COVID-19 infections 12, 13 . Probably related to the selection of studies they came to different Table 2 . Matched covariates across treated and untreated patients. ADM columns contain the absolute number of treated and untreated and the percentage between parentheses. The column p-value corresponds to a \u03c7 2 test that systematically demonstrates that the values are equilibrated between both groups (no significant differences between ADM treated and untreated). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ conclusions, as one meta-analysis 12 found an uncertain trend and the other 13 a significantly increased risk of infection in subjects with the poorest vitamin D status. More relevant to the present study, one meta-analysis concluded that there was a non-significant trend between low 25OHD levels (below 20 ng/ml) and need for ICU admission, length of hospital stay or mortality 12 . The other meta-analysis with a greater restriction of highquality studies, which included 2,756 patients, found a significantly higher mortality (OR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.50 to 4.05), higher rates of hospital admissions (OR: 2.18, IC del 95%: 1.48-3.21 and longer hospital stay in subjects with the poorest vitamin D status 13 . These results suggest that improving serum 25OHD concentration may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 11, 12, 29 . In a recent RCT, patients with baseline serum 25OHD levels < 20 ng/ml were compared with two standard treatment regimens in Spain (calcifediol 266 \u03bcg/month and cholecalciferol 25,000 IU (625 \u00b5g/month).-At first month, 13.5% (95% CI 9.1-19.0%) of patients in the calcifediol group and none of those receiving cholecalciferol (95% CI 0.0-3.7%) reached serum levels of 30 ng/ml. At month 4, 35. 0% of postmenopausal women treated with calcifediol and 8.2% of those treated with cholecalciferol reached serum 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/ml (p < 0.0001). Few studies have compared the efficacy of calcifediol and cholecalciferol in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels and have reported similar findings. However, none of them compared monthly doses of both metabolites 33 .",

After propensity score matching, 6252 patients on calcitriol and 12,504 matched control patients were included in the study. Prescription of calcitriol was associated with a reduced risk of SARS-CoV2 infection (HR = 0.78, 95% 0.64-0.94), reduced risk of severe COVID-19 and reduced COVID-19 mortality (HR = 0.57, 0.41-0.80). In treated patients, regardless of renal function, there was an inverse association between mean daily dose of calcitriol and COVID-19 severity or mortality 39 . Supporting these general observations another recent study shows the association between vitamin D deficiency and higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization 40 .",

            "text": "From a mechanistic perspective, there is good reason to postulate that the vitamin D endocrine system may have beneficial effects on different stages of COVID-19 infections such as the early viral infection (by innate immunity antiviral effector mechanisms, including induction of antimicrobial peptides and autophagy) and the later hyperinflammatory phase of COVID-19 [41] [42] [43] . Moreover, activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling pathway may have a critical modulatory role to host responses in acute respiratory distress syndrome 42 by decreasing the cytokine/chemokine storm, producing a shift towards amplified adaptive Th2 immune responses, regulating the renin-angiotensin-bradykinin system, modulating neutrophil activity 44 and maintaining the integrity of the pulmonary epithelial barrier, stimulating epithelial repair [45] [46] [47] and decreasing the increased coagulability and prothrombotic tendency associated with severe COVID-19 41, 42, 48, 49 . Regulation of the renin-angiotensin-bradykinin system is of particular relevance in mitigating the progression of severe COVID-19, where over-activation of RAS is associated with a poor prognosis 50 . Moreover, the protective effect of drugs targeting the VDR and the GC (Vitamin D Binding Protein or DBP) proteins of VDES has been suggested in a recent study on systematic drug repurposing for COVID-19 16 . The ML study has demonstrated the relevance of drugs targeting VDR and GC (DBP) proteins in the activity of COVID19-related signaling circuits (see Table S1 ). These signaling circuits affect cellular processes involved in modulating the immune activity, decreasing the inflammatory response, but also in slowing down cellular energetics.",

Most likely this effect occurs through VDR stimulation.

In the light of the results obtained, calcifediol preferably, or cholecalciferol with a lower effect, can adequately meet these objectives. In fact, calcifediol may have some advantages over native vitamin D3. Thus, the former has a more reliable intestinal absorption (close to 100%) and can more rapidly restore serum concentrations of 25OHD as it does not require hepatic 25-hydroxylation 33, 51 . In fact, calcifediol is three times more potent than oral cholecalciferol in raising serum 25OHD levels 52 . This is especially relevant in clinical situations www.nature.com/scientificreports/ whereby rapid restoration of serum 25OHD is desirable and CYP2R1 expression is compromised 52 , explaining and giving causal consistency to the stronger association between survival and the prescription of calcifediol fifteen and thirty days prior to hospitalization by COVID-19. This cost-effective and widely available treatment could have positive implications for the management of COVID-19 worldwide, particularly in developing countries.",

Except for the case of cholecalciferol at 30 days, the prescriptions demonstrated a significant association with increased patient survival. From Fig. 2 it becomes apparent that calcifediol (HR = 0.67, CI [0.50-0.91]) shows a clearly higher association with patient survival than cholecalciferol (HR = 0.75, CI [0.61-0.91), when prescribed 15 days prior to hospitalization. However, if a larger period of 30 days is considered this effect decreases (calcifediol HR = 0.73, CI [0.57-0.95] and cholecalciferol HR = 0.88, CI [0.75, 1,03])",
