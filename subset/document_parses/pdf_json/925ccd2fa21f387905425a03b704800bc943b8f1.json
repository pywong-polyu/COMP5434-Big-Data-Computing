Under the background of global economization, communication in all walks of life is becoming more and more frequent and cross-language communication is inevitable. Cross-language communication is difficult for many people. e online translation system can greatly reduce the communication barriers between people of different languages. As an efficient tool, the translation system can realize the translation of different languages under the conditions of retaining the original semantics equivalent conversion. e article adopts the Internet of ings technology and big data model to build an English intelligent translation system, which can realize intelligent translation between multiple languages and English. e research results of the article show the following: (1) For samples with high semantic feature values, the correlation coefficient and similarity coefficient will be higher. erefore, it can be concluded that for different semantics, the similarity is generally positively correlated with its feature value and correlation coefficient. e translation speed of the system proposed in the article is the fastest among the three translation systems. When the number of sentences is 10,000, the translation speed of the translation system proposed in the article is 5.89 seconds, the translation speed of the network multilingual translation system is 6.74 seconds, and the translation speed of the traditional translation system is 10.53 seconds.",

When translating general sentences, the BLEU value of the method in this paper is slightly higher than that of the RNN cyclic neural network translation model; especially when translating complex sentences by machine, the BLEU value of the method in this paper is far higher than that of the RNN translation model. (3) e average response time will increase with the increase in the number of tests, and the success rate generally remains above 98%, close to 100%, indicating that the response time of the system operation is normal. e number of designed test cases for the data processing module is 90, the number of executed test cases is 90, and the execution rate can reach 100%. Normal operation means that in the process of operation, no fault occurs. In the system load test, the load of serial number 1 is normal, the average delay is 38 seconds, the average delay of serial number 2 is 48 seconds, the average delay of serial number 3 is 59 seconds, the average delay of serial number 4 is 62 seconds, and the average delay of serial number 5 is 47 seconds. e delay of data packets under all kinds of loads can meet the standard requirements.",

            "text": "In order to promote the development of the global economy, communication between all walks of life in the country is inevitable. As the carrier of communication between people, the free switching and transmission of languages in different countries is particularly important. Under the premise of retaining the original meaning of the sentence, it is very important to create an intelligent English translation system. Most translation systems can achieve normal communication in different languages, but they ignore the grammatical problems in the English translation process. e translation accuracy of the translation system can improve the quality of the English translation system and can also greatly reduce the communication barriers between different language groups. Based on the Internet of ings and big data model technology, the article designs an intelligent English translation system, which can not only realize the equivalent switching between multiple languages and English but also greatly improve the translation accuracy without affecting the original semantics. Literature [1] introduces CITAC technology for the design of intelligent full-text Chinese-English translators, providing an alternative, nontraditional approach to translate machine translation concepts into creation and reality. Literature [2] introduces the design motivation and overall architecture and describes the design concept and processing algorithm of its translation mechanism. Literature [3] puts forward relevant suggestions on the basis of analyzing the current situation of translation system development. Literature [4] focuses on the Chinese-English machine translation model based on deep neural network. Literature [5] uses a combinatorial technique to advance resourcelimited implementations, introducing different types of word alignment techniques in English-Hindi translation systems. Literature [6] emphasizes word alignment of English language pairs, which defines the process of establishing better translation relationships between words in parallel or bilingual corpora. Literature [7] proposed an intelligent design method of the English automatic translation system based on phrase translation combination. Reference [8] proposes an implementation plan and related strategies for bidirectional automatic translation between English and Chinese in response to the research and development needs of Sino-Japanese international cooperation projects. Literature [9] proposed the problems existing in the design of the current translation system and the problems that should be paid attention to in the future research work. Literature [10] proposed a language analysis research study of the English translation system based on fuzzy algorithm. Literature [11] introduced an interactive intelligent tutoring system, emphasizing the feasibility of integrating these functions into a common platform. Literature [12] improved the traditional machine learning algorithm and proposed an improved model combining statistical language, factor analysis, and support vector machine. Literature [13] introduced the design of an online hybrid machine translation system. Reference [14] uses the machine learning algorithm as the system algorithm and combines the CA-IAFSA algorithm to construct an artificial intelligence-based English intelligent system. Literature [15] analyzed the shortcomings of traditional English intelligent translation and realized the optimal design of the human interface system of English intelligent translation.",
