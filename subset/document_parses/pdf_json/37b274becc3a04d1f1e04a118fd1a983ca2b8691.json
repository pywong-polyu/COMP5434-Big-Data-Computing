Among the most pressing questions is how individuals adjust to the pandemic. This paper examines the emotional responses to the pandemic in a repeated-measures design. Data (n = 1698) were collected in April 2020 (during strict lockdown measures) and in April 2021 (when vaccination programmes gained traction). We asked participants to report their emotions and express these in text data. Statistical tests revealed an average trend towards better adjustment to the pandemic. However, clustering analyses suggested a more complex heterogeneous pattern with a well-coping and a resigning subgroup of participants. Linguistic computational analyses uncovered that topics and n-gram frequencies shifted towards attention to the vaccination programme and away from general worrying. Implications for public mental health efforts in identifying people at heightened risk are discussed. The dataset is made publicly available.",

Various behavioural research efforts have used text-based analyses concerning COVID-19 [9] [10] [11] . A large number of studies made use of Twitter data to perform textual analyses. Examples include the spread of misinformation on Twitter 12, 13 , emotional consequences of lockdowns studied through Twitter and Weibo data 14 , as well as the association between US partisanship and sentiment towards COVID-19 measures 15 . Other text data sources include Reddit, which has, for example, been used to characterise the linguistic difference between posters on the r/Coronavirus and the r/China_flu page 16 . Based on word frequency measures, the language difference between the two subreddits was low in January and February of 2020, but diverged for the rest of the year, indicating the emergence of two distinct communities characterised by their attitude towards the virus. In another study of Reddit data, linguistic features including the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC; Pennebaker et al. 17 ), sentiment analysis, and word frequencies were used to study changes in mental health discourse across 15 subreddits 18 . All in all, the studies above demonstrate how the availability of text data on social media platforms enables researchers to study the effects of COVID-19 on a large scale.",

Using 122M tweets posted throughout 2020, 19 propose that the psycho-social response to the pandemic occurs in three phases. Following Strong's 1990 model of the sociological reaction to fatal epidemics, refusal is followed by anger, which in turn is followed by acceptance. The authors made use of keywords from the original Strong (1990) paper, the LIWC, and lexicons for emotions, moral foundations, and pro-social behaviour to examine the occurrence of the three phases in the Twitter data. Aiello et al. (2021) note that refusal and acceptance decreased throughout 2020, whereas acceptance increased. When new waves of COVID-cases emerged, new waves of anger were observed in the language use on Twitter. In a similar endeavour, 20 examined social discourse within tweets from Italy straight after the first lockdown in March 2020. Tweets were collected by searching three hashtags related to the lockdown, after which networks of hashtags were constructed by examining co-occurrences of hashtags in tweets. The tweets were subsequently analysed for their sentiment polarity using the NRC lexicon. By exploring the emotional valence in the identified hashtag networks, the authors note that they observed co-existence of anger and fear with trust, solidarity and hope in the corpus. Emotional responses to the pandemic have also been examined by other means than text data, for instance in an exploration of the emotional appreciation of humour (memes, jokes) related to COVID-19 21 . In an online survey in April 2020, different clusters of emotional responses were identified (e.g., optimists and pessimists) which were found to be related to several variables such as gender, pre-existing health conditions, and political orientation 22 . In related research using an online task, participants who scored high on COVID-19 fear and negative emotion also judged words relating to COVID-19 more negatively 23 .",

Among the many potentials of text data is the possibility to use observational data-often produced as a by-product of human online behaviour (e.g., participation in online forums, see Salganik 24 )-as the lens through which we study human emotions, attitudes and behaviour. At the same time, pure observational text data often lack ground truth in the form of known emotional states, attitudes or even behaviours.

Doing so helps us study the phenomenon in a longitudinal sense and may allow us to pose new research questions beyond observational snapshot studies. Second, this paper seeks to shed further light on the emotional responses to the Coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, we are interested in the change that happened and consequently may have led to different emotional responses between the onset of the pandemic and a year later when the UK was about to open up the country again.

We contacted each participant who contributed to the first phase via the crowdsourcing platform Prolific Academic and notified them of a new data collection precisely one year after the original study. We used the identical questionnaire, task interface (with Qualtrics software), participant payment and exclusion criteria. The second phase of data collection ran from March to April 2021. The initial sample of phase 2 consisted of n 2 = 1839. After applying the following exclusion criteria, we retained n = 1716 participants: participants who did not write an English text (n = 67), wrote more than 20% punctuation (n = 6), did not input a valid Prolific id (n = 33, e.g., due to a typo) or were duplicates in the data (n = 17) were excluded.

The analyses suggest that, on average, the intensity of negative emotions decreased and that of positive emotions increased from the onset of the pandemic to the prospect of re-opening the country. These findings are not surprising: the first phase of data collection happened at a time where unequalled lockdown measures were in place, hence resulting in high scores for negative emotions and low scores for positive emotions. These then moved towards the positive in phase 2. The correlations between the two data collection points suggest that it is unlikely that the change towards less extreme scores in phase 2 is attributable to a regression to the mean. Instead, we found subgroups hinting at a more complex picture. Two clusters of participants emerged: one group exhibited a pattern in emotion change that we identified as well-coping. Participants in that group showed a general increase in positive emotions and a decrease in worry-related emotions. In contrast, a second group appeared to be less well-adapted after one year in the pandemic, with a pattern that we interpret as resembling resignation. Importantly, we failed to find straightforward explanations for these cluster patterns. While participants in the well-coping cluster were marginally older than those in the resignation cluster, neither gender nor linguistic differences emerged. Previous work 6 found gender differences in the topics of the first phase texts, but these patterns did not seem to be at play with the subgroups. Possibly, membership in either of the two clusters can be inferred from the texts that participants wrote. If that were the case, we would expect at least some predictive relationship between linguistic features of the text data and the participants' cluster membership. We tested this with supervised machine learning but failed to find an above-guessing prediction performance (see Appendix).",

These findings highlight that text data somewhat capture significant changes in society and that participants have them on their minds. The vaccine was the dominant word in phase 2, which mirrors the public discourse in the UK at the time of data collection. Interestingly, the notion of a vaccine was practically absent in the first phase. Follow-up analyses showed that individuals who mentioned the vaccine showed a more pronounced reduction in anxiety and sadness than those who did not refer to the vaccine.",

            "text": "A key challenge for public health may lie in the mental health effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having. With limited resources available, research such as the current study can help health care professionals identify individuals who may be at a heightened risk of more severe mental health problems. Related work, for example, has looked at changes in loneliness due to the various interventions introduced due to the pandemic 38, 39 . Understanding the relationship between an emotional response such as loneliness and text data produced by people is a promising avenue for research but is still in an early stage 40 . Importantly, our analysis showed that it is oversimplified to assume that a population processes the pandemic in a homogenous manner. Two radically divergent subgroups were identified. This, again, may aid mental health professionals and policymakers in their approach to handling the (mental health) consequences of the pandemic. Future work could test (1) how subgroups can be identified and (2) whether membership in a subgroup also corresponds to differences in mental health and possibly even the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. Our paper makes the connection between emotion data and text data. Although similar connections have been made in the past (e.g., 19, 20 ) , they lacked ground truth of the emotional states of text writers. By assessing 'ground truth' emotional states (albeit self-reported ones) and having participants write about them, we were able to examine linguistic correlates of emotions and worries. For clarification, the term 'ground truth' emotional states here denotes that the emotional states of individual participants were provided by the participants themselves rather than through an external annotation procedure. While we appreciate that emotional states are volatile, our dataset records the participants' emotional wellbeing at the time of conducting the task, thus representing their ground truth mental states when writing the statements. All in all, this approach can help us as a research community to test and ultimately harness the simmering potential of observational text data. Future work could, for example, use the dataset to assess whether text data from one phase can be used to predict emotions in a subsequent phase. Ideally, social and behavioural science research continues to adopt methods from the computational sciences and builds on the current work to further our understanding of text data as a means to study behaviour and emotions.",

While this was done to avoid the influence of potential confounds such as government responses, this somewhat limits the ecological validity of these findings. Whether our results are valid in other countries is an open question and hard to ascertain absent longitudinal data on emotion and text data from other countries. Second, as with all unsupervised techniques, the topic models and the clustering analysis contain subjectivity in the interpretation. Other researchers may have interpreted the clusters differently and hence yielded different conclusions. We acknowledge that subjectivity, and by making the raw data available, we encourage others to challenge our findings. Similarly, we have only focused on the core of the dataset but have not examined further variables such as socioeconomic status or self-assessed linguistic expression ability. All these data are now publicly available as part of this paper. Third, we have identified the two subgroups only through exploratory analyses and refrained from conducting further in-depth analyses on the properties of these groups. Ideally, similar studies could attempt to replicate the findings and solidify the evidence favouring heterogenous coping with the pandemic. Future work could then look at linguistic differences between these clusters (i.e., do the subgroups use different words and topics?).",

Understanding the emotional responses to a \"new normal\" requires an analytical toolkit that allows for the complexity in how people (struggle to) cope.

Our method demonstrated how text data can help us understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's lives, and how individuals work through and adapt to drastically changing circumstances. We believe that our data collection efforts and subsequent analyses represent a valuable resource to better understand emotional standpoints of the public, and we encourage other researchers to further exploit the potential of our presented dataset. www.nature.com/scientificreports/",
