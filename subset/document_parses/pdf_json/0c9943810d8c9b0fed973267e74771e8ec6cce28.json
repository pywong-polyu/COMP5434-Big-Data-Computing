Some migrant group's concerns around the vaccine are due to their lack of inclusion in the clinical trials, highlighting an urgent need to understand and address the reasons underlying these disparities in Covid-19 research participation [6] .",

Socio-political factors may include social deprivation limiting access to health services, and subsequently, participation in \u00c0 and awareness of \u00c0 health research. Participant-related factors may include language and cultural barriers, and mistrust towards researchers and research institutions. Fear, mistrust and access barriers are the effects of powerful upstream factors including structural racism, marginalisation and ethnic exclusion. Previous studies have noted that a good researcherparticipant relationship is a key facilitator of their participation [7] . Lack of ethnic minority participation has also been linked to racial discrimination and previous negative healthcare experiences [5] . A qualitative study in the UK seeking the views of ethnic minorities towards participation in Covid-19 vaccine trials identified a range of barriers including concerns around attending hospitals, lack of support if problems arose and language barriers between themselves and research staff, despite agreement that this research was necessary [8] .",

As of 27th March 2021, only 1\u00a243% of US-based studies investigating Covid-19 registered on Clinicaltrials.gov were collecting data about ethnicity, highlighting how this problem continues to go overlooked. Another review examining ethnic minority research participation found that the number of individuals from minority groups actually invited by researchers to participate in research was disproportionately small compared to their representation in the wider population [9] . Strategies to increase ethnic minority representation in medical research must seek to tackle the root causes of underrepresentation including systemic racism, racial discrimination and access barriers.",

Initiatives such as the INCLUDE project, which aims to promote the inclusion of underserved communities in clinical trials, are forming the basis for this much needed work and may provide fresh insight and useful action points [10] . Researchers and policy makers should be educated and supported to prioritise equitable access to research participation for ethnic minorities and migrants, particularly for conditions that disproportionately affect them. Strategies for overcoming participation disparities should not be ad hoc, but rather, part of a policy framework underpinned by Principle 13 of the Declaration of Helsinki. Practical solutions for increasing recruitment could include translating participant information into languages other than English, using diverse recruitment strategies to ensure study information and invitations reach potential participants among ethnic minority and migrant communities, and developing community engagement programmes to dispel rumours and misinformation which may erode trust in these studies [8] . Addressing factors connected to economic disadvantage (which may disproportionately affect certain ethnic minority groups) will also be needed, including reimbursement for childcare costs and travel expenses [9] . Being clear about the potential benefits of participation will be important, alongside consideration of cultural and religious schedules [8] .",
