Methods The patients with nAMD having IVI appointments between March 16 and June 1, 2020 (RP in Turkey) were included in this retrospective study. For adherence analysis, the patients who attended (Group 1, n = 44) and who did not attend (Group 2, n = 60) their IVI appointment visits during the RP (V RP ) were evaluated according to their last visit before the RP (V 0 ). For outcome analysis, the patients who attend V RP and have follow-up (Group 1a, 46 eyes) and who did not attend V RP but later attended for follow-up (Group 2a, 33 eyes) were evaluated for functional (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA [logMAR]) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography [OCT] disease activity) outcomes at the first visit after RP (V 1 ) and last visit within six months after RP (V 2 ). Patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation with anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) IVI administration at all visits. Results The adherence rate of the patients to V RP was 42.3% (44/104). The patients in Group 1 were significantly younger (mean \u00b1 SD years, 71.0 \u00b1 8.1 vs. 74.7 \u00b1 8.0, p = 0.024), had better median [IQR] BCVA at their first presentation (0.30 [0.54] vs. 0.61 [1.08], p = 0.023) and V 0 (0.40 [0.48] vs. 0.52 [0.70], p = 0.031), and had less hypertension (36.4% vs.",

Disease activity in OCT was significantly higher in Group 2a than Group 1a at V 1 (60.6% vs. 32.6%, p = 0.025). In Group 2a, the median (IQR) BCVA was significantly worse at V 1 (0.70 [0.58]) and V 2 (0.70 [0.59]) than V 0 (0.52 [0.40], p = 0.047 and p = 0.035, respectively). Conclusions More than half of the scheduled nAMD patients in TAE protocol missed their IVI visits during the RP, which resulted in a delay of their treatments. The delay of IVI treatment in those patients resulted in an increase in OCT disease activity and a decrease in BCVA.",

While the regular fixed-interval protocols adopt a strategy of applying IVI regardless of whether any sign of disease activity present, in the PRN treatment protocol, the IVI decision is made according to any sign of disease activity in monthly visits [5] [6] [7] . However, TAE is an individualized, proactive dosing regimen, in which, after three consecutive loading IVI doses, in-person visits and at-the-same-day IVI treatment intervals are extended (1 week to 4 weeks, to a maximum of 12 weeks) or shortened (1 week to 4 weeks, to a minimum of 4 weeks) according to predefined disease activity criteria [8, 9] .",

In healthcare practices, priority has focused on patients affected by the virus, and there have been substantial changes in specialties that are not directly related to COVID-19 [12, 13] . The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommended that ophthalmologists should stop providing any treatment to patients other than emergency cases, and various organizations such as AAO, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, and the Turkish Ophthalmological Association have tried to identify procedures that can be considered urgent and necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic period [14] [15] [16] . According to the American Society of Retina Specialists COVID-19 assessment dated March 20, 2020, a significant percentage of retina patients are at risk of permanent vision loss and should receive regular IVI treatment.

We decided to continue IVI administration based on our hospital's ICC recommendations, which includes reducing the number of patients and accompanying visitors in the waiting room; encouraging social distancing of 2 m; requiring the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, ocular shields, and suits, by the staff; requiring the use of surgical masks by the patients; and establishing IVI intervals of 20 min with disinfecting the operating room between procedures. As time progressed, guidelines and algorithms were published for patients receiving IVI during the COVID-19 pandemic; even template letters were developed for the nAMD patients and their families [18, 22, 23] . New treatment protocol recommendations and telemedicine consultations were also included in the literature to ensure the continuity of treatment in nAMD patients during the pandemic period and to avoid in-person visits [24] [25] [26] . However, continuing with pre-adopted protocols was an option, which enabled us to compare the patients' compliance with their IVI visits during the restriction period without any positive or negative interference.",

Considering the age and accompanying disorders of the nAMD patients, the fear of contracting COVID-19 from hospitals might have led to poor clinical attendance; therefore, informing the nAMD patients about precautions to minimize infection via an appointment letter or telephone call has been suggested to reduce non-attendance [31] . However, the decision to attend an IVI visit during the restriction period might have been affected by various other factors, such as traveling limitations, accompanied disorders, fear of contracting COVID-19 from sources such as public transportation, etc. [30, 32] . In their evaluation of 650 patients (with nAMD [76.6%], macular edema due to retinal vascular diseases [14.0%] , and other causes of MNV [9.6%]), Viola et al. demonstrated an overall IVI attendance rate of 37% during the COVID-19 pandemic despite their stratification of patients as ''emergent,'' ''urgent,'' and ''non-urgent'' and after discussing their scheduled appointments via phone-calls [32] . Although we did not stratify the patients and did not interfere with their decision to attend, the adherence rate in our study was higher than that for nAMD patients in the study of Viola [32] . In the same study, the patients who adhered to treatment were significantly younger and had a lower BCVA in the study eyes [32] . Patients who adhered to their appointments during the restriction period were also younger in our study; however, our patients had better BCVA in their study eyes at their first presentation and V 0 . This result might be explained by patients with better BCVA thought that they could maintain their visual acuity with IVI treatment, which may have motivated them to attend their appointments. Interestingly, we found that patients with hypertension were less likely to adhere to their IVI appointments during the restriction period than patients with diabetes or coronary artery disease. Although we did not evaluate the drugs used by the patients, we attribute this decision to arguments at that time that claimed that the use of antihypertensive medication (especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) increases the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and the severity of the disease [33, 34] .",

Skipping even one anti-VEGF IVI has been associated with a decline in BCVA and increased OCT disease activity in nAMD treated with the PRN protocol [36] . Therefore, there was a justified concern about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional and anatomical results in nAMD patients [23, 37] . It was recently observed that PRN treatment intervals increased during the period of COVID-19 restrictions, with a mean \u00b1 SD difference of 29.9 \u00b1 48.5 days between the preceding two visits before the pandemic [38] . This prolongation in the treatment interval also resulted in an increase in exudation in the structural OCT and a decrease in visual acuity, which was significantly associated with the extended interval time in multiple regression analysis [38] . To our knowledge, there is no study evaluating the TAE protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic in the literature. Recently, a study evaluating the unplanned extension of nAMD patients' treatment intervals before the COVID-19 pandemic in the Fight Retinal Blindness! Registry showed that the 6-month vision outcomes in patients whose treatment intervals were extended up to 10-12 weeks were similar to those with B 6-week intervals. However, there was a significant short-term risk to vision when the retreatment interval was extended beyond 12 weeks [39] . Similarly, in our study, a delay of mean \u00b1 SD of 13.9 \u00b1 6.2 weeks in the patients' treatment intervals resulted in a reduction in BCVA, which was not regained within 6 months.",
