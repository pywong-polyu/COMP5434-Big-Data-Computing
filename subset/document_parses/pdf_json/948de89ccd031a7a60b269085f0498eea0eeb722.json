Here we report the genome of a virus isolated in Pennsylvania (PA) in March 2021 that was identified as the highly transmissible lineage B.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01) that also has a mutation in the spike protein (E484K) that may negatively impact the efficacy of the immune response to the virus. Since February 2021, only a small number (n=60) of viruses with this profile have been detected in the US, and on submission of this manuscript only 253 have been reported globally (first in the UK in December 2020). Comparison of all currently available, high quality genomes with this profile (n=236), including 5 viruses isolated from PA during the same period, showed 59 independent acquisitions of the E484K mutation. We also show that there are at least 4 distinct versions of this virus circulating in the US, with isolates from Pennsylvania belonging to two of these groups. Increased genomic surveillance will be crucial for detection of emerging variants of concern that can escape natural and vaccine induced immunity.",

Isolates were also reported from 15 other states (New York, North Carolina, Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida, West Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Massachusetts, Washington, and Colorado). Of these isolates 48% were from Florida (n=17) and New York (n=12) and 28% were from New Jersey (n=7), California (n=4) and Pennsylvania (n=6). Two isolates were from Oregon (OR), Connecticut (CT), Maryland (MD), and single isolates are recorded from Georgia (GA), Texas (TX), Massachusetts (MA), Washington (WA), Colorado (CO), West Virginia (WV), Michigan (MI), and North Carolina (NC). The number of US isolates in March (n=47 including the PA isolates) was nearly 6 times the number of the isolates reported in February.

In the GNUVID typing system, these correspond to 7 of 10 CCs in the B.1.1.7 lineage. For each of these CCs, representative sequences without the E484K mutation have been circulating since at least November 2020, predating the first E484K in each CC. This raised the possibility that the E484K mutation was acquired independently in each of these CCs in independent events. To test the hypothesis of multiple acquisitions in a rigorous phylogenetic framework we queried the GISAID database for closely related genomes for each of the 236 high quality B.1.1.7+E484K genomes and retrieved 354 closely related B.1.1.7 genomes. Using the phylogeny reconstructed from the combined dataset we performed an ancestral reconstruction using Fitch optimization 16 , which revealed 59 de novo acquisitions of the E484K mutation in the B.1.1.7 lineage",

Paired-end and dual-indexed 2x150bp sequencing was done using MiSeq Reagent Kits v3 (300 cycles). Sequences were demultiplexed and basecalls were converted to FASTQ using bcl2fastq2 v2.20. The FASTQ reads were then processed to consensus sequence and variants were identified using the ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline (https://github.com/connorlab/ncov2019-artic-nf). Briefly, the pipeline uses iVar 20 for primer trimming and consensus sequence making (options: --ivarFreqThreshold 0.75). A bed file for the Paragon kit primers was used in the pipeline.

This process identified 354 non redundant B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7+E484K genomes close to the 236 study genomes. A maximum likelihood tree of the 590 (354 + 236) genomes was then produced as discussed.

Our laboratory at the Children's hospital of Philadelphia performed sequencing on randomly selected isolates collected since January 2021.Figure 1Ashows the diversity of 114 randomly sequenced genomes. Lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.429 (California), B.1.526 (New York) and R.1 (International lineage with the E484K mutation) accounted for 69% of the sequenced genomes in March. There was a massive increase in lineage B.1.1.7 from 2% (1/47) in February to 42% in March (15/36). Interestingly, one B.1.1.7 isolate from this surveillance collected on 3/24/2021 from a 52 year old male, carried the E484K spike mutation that is present in the South African and Brazilian lineages. To better understand the relationship between this isolate and publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we compared it to all available B.1.1.7+E484K high coverage genomes available on GISAID 13 (n=235). Since the first report by PHE in February, a total of 253 B.1.1.7+E484K genomes have been uploaded to GISAID from England and 14 other countries (Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, Wales, Turkey, Slovakia, Austria, Czech Republic and USA)13 .",
