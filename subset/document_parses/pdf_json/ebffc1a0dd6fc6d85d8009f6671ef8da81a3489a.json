            "text": "Natural killer cells are important in the control of viral infections. However, the role of NK cells during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has previously not been identified. Peripheral blood NK cells from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve subjects were evaluated for their activation, degranulation, and interferon-gamma expression in the presence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. K562 and lung epithelial cells were transfected with spike proteins and co-cultured with NK cells. The analysis was performed by flow cytometry and immune fluorescence. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins did not alter NK cell activation in a K562 in vitro model. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein (SP1) intracellular expression by lung epithelial cells resulted in NK cell-reduced degranulation. Further experiments revealed a concomitant induction of HLA-E expression on the surface of lung epithelial cells and the recognition of an SP1-derived HLA-E-binding peptide. Simultaneously, there was increased modulation of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A/CD94 on NK cells when SP1 was expressed in lung epithelial cells. We ruled out the GATA3 transcription factor as being responsible for HLA-E increased levels and HLA-E/NKG2A interaction as implicated in NK cell exhaustion. We show for the first time that NK cells are affected by SP1 expression in lung epithelial cells via HLA-E/NKG2A interaction. The resulting NK cells' exhaustion might contribute to immunopathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

SARS-CoV-2 is a \u03b2-coronavirus with a 79.5% sequence homology with SARS-CoV [2, 3] . The CoVs have been demonstrated to be able to adapt quickly and cross the species barrier, as happened with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), with resulting epidemics or pandemics. The effect of these infections on humans often leads to severe clinical symptoms and high mortality [3] . The number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cases is more than 22 million, with typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue [4] .",

            "text": "Several studies are currently investigating the potential response of the immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection [5] . It has already been shown that, during the infection, patients develop an uncontrolled immune response and hyperactivation of macrophages and monocytes [6] . This immune dysregulation is associated with an increase in Interleukin-6 (IL-6), neutrophils, natural killer (NK) [7] cells, and reactive protein C (PCR) and in a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes [5, 8] . Interestingly, NK cells showed a functional exhaustion with increased NKG2A expression [8] . NK cells are important effectors in antitumor and anti-infection immunity [9] . The activity of NK cells is controlled by activating and inhibitory receptors [10] . The CD94/NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) is a heterodimeric inhibitory receptor expressed by NK cells [11] . It binds to the nonclassical HLA class I molecule (HLA-E), which presents peptides derived from leader peptide sequences of other HLA class I molecules, including HLA-G [12] [13] [14] . The ligation of the peptide-loaded HLA-E with NKG2A transduces inhibitory signaling through two inhibitory immune-receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs, which suppress NK cytokine cytotoxicity and secretion [11, 12, 15, 16] . By now, no data are available on how SARS-CoV-2 might control NK cells. We evaluated the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in modifying NK cell functions.",

            "text": "Although the role of NK cells in the immune response towards viral infections is generally accepted, there are few data on the early NK cell trafficking in response to coronavirus infections [5] . The evaluation of NK response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to determining the innate immune response per se and for the cross-talk with adaptive immune cells [24] . We explored the migration, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion, and degranulation of NK cells in the presence of spike 1 (SP1) and spike 2 (SP2) SARS-CoV-2 proteins and SARS-CoV spike proteins (S). We used a cell migration system in a 5-\u00b5m transwells w/polycarbonate filter, without a cell barrier. We purified NK cells from the peripheral blood of control subjects ( Figure S1A ) negative for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viremia (data not shown). This condition ensured that NK cells were na\u00efve for spike proteins. We cultured NK cells in the presence of SP1, SP2 from SARS-CoV-2, or spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV and we observed no effect on cell viability ( Figure S1B ). We used CXCL12 as a positive control for NK cell migration [22] . We observed an increase in NK cell migration in the presence of both SP1 and SP2 (SP1 p = 0.021; SP2 p = 0.013 Student t test) ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, NK cell migration was induced by the SARS-CoV S protein (p < 0.01; Student t test) ( Figure 1A) . No modifications in cell viability were observed ( Figure S1B ). These data suggest that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins are able to chemo-attract NK cells. To evaluate if spike proteins are able to also induce NK cells' activation, we analyzed the secretion of IFN-gamma. We observed an increase in IFN-gamma secretion in the presence of SP1, SP2, and S-protein (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 1B) . The basal IFN-gamma secretion might be enhanced by the IL-2 treatment of NK cells, which is necessary for the in vitro maintenance of primary NK cells. ",

We obtained a mean transfection efficiency of 95% for SP1, SP2, and S proteins ( Figure 1C ). The K562 cell viability, evaluated by the LDH assay, was not affected by protein transfection ( Figure 1D ). We incubated NK cells for four hours with K562 and evaluated the expression of CD107a on CD56-gated NK cells ( Figure S1C ). We observed an increase in CD107a staining in all the culture conditions, with no difference in the presence of SP1, SP2, and S proteins in comparison with the untreated co-culture (S1 p = 0.078; S2 p = 0.087; S p = 0.081; Student t test) ( Figure 1E ,F).

We mimicked the expression of SP1, SP2, and S proteins inside Beas-2B lung epithelial cells, transfecting directly the proteins. We obtained an average 95% efficiency of transfection with all the proteins (Figure 2A ). The transfection did not affect cell viability ( Figure 2B ) and the expression of CK8 epithelial cell markers (Figure 2A ). We incubated NK cells for four hours with lung epithelial cells and evaluated the expression of the CD107a degranulation marker. We observed a decrease in CD107a staining in the culture condition with SP1-transfected Beas-2B cells (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 3A,B) . On the contrary, we observed an increase in CD107a expression in the co-culture conditions with SP2 and S protein-transfected Beas-2B cells, which is similar to that observed with the control of the transfection condition (null-transfected) and untreated co-culture (p = 0.079; p = 0.085, respectively; Student t test) ( Figure 3A,B) . To be sure that NK cells expressing CD107a were able to kill Beas2B cells, CFSE staining of target cells was detected by flow cytometry. We observed an increase in the Beas-2B CFSE+/7-AAD+ cell percentage in the co-culture with NK cells in SP2 and S protein-transfected Beas2B cells ( Figure 3C) , while there was a decrease in the Beas-2B CFSE+/7-AAD+ cell percentage in the co-culture with NK cells in SP1-transfected Beas-2B cells (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 3C ), confirming the results observed with CD107a staining (Figure 3A,B) .",

            "text": "Since viral proteins are commonly recognized and degraded by the proteasome inside the infected cells [25] , we hypothesized that SP1 peptides might be presented to NK cells. Intracellular peptide presentation is performed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, which are expressed by all nucleated cells. Firstly, we evaluated the expression of HLA class I molecules in Beas-2B cells transfected with SP1, SP2, and S proteins. When we stained the cells with anticlassical HLA class I molecules (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) antibody, we recognized a significant decrease in their membrane expression when lung epithelial cells were transfected with SP1 protein (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 3D ,E). SP2 and S protein slightly inhibited HLA-I expression (p = 0.039; p = 0.041, respectively; Student t test). Epithelial lung cells can express also non-classical HLA-E molecule [7] . HLA-E binds peptides primarily derived from specific signal sequences [26] and interacts with NKG2A/CD94 NK cell inhibitory receptors [15] . When we performed the lung epithelial cell staining with MEM-E/06 anti-HLA-E antibody, we observed no expression in basal conditions, which was not affected by SP2 and S transfection ( Figure 3F,H) . On the contrary, there was a significant increase in HLA-E protein (p = 0.011; Student t test) (Figure 3F ,G) and mRNA expression (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 3H ), in the presence of SP1 protein. HLA-E expression is controlled by the GATA3 transcription factor [12] , which is known to also be expressed by lung epithelial cells [27, 28] . We observed an increase in GATA3 protein (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 4A ,B) and mRNA (p < 0.01; Student t test) ( Figure 4C ) expression only in the presence of SP1. To confirm the transcriptional activity of GATA3 induced by SP1, we analyzed the expression levels of a target gene for GATA3, the Eotaxin3/CCL26 [29] . We observed the induction of CCL26 transcription only in the presence of SP1 (p < 0.001; Student t test) ( Figure 4D ). The treatment with a GATA inhibitor, the pyrrothiogatain [19] , reduced both GATA3 protein ( Figure 4A ,B) and mRNA ( Figure 4C ) expression. To be sure that the increase in HLA-E expression in lung epithelial cells transfected with SP1 protein is controlled by GATA3 transcription factor, we treated the cells with pyrrothiogatain. This inhibitory molecule reduced the expression and transcription of the HLA-E gene in Beas-2B cells ( Figure 3F ,H). The immune-fluorescence staining showed increased modulation of the expression of HLA-E molecules in the presence of intracellular SP1, which was reduced with the addition of GATA inhibitor ( Figure 5A,B) . To evaluate if SP1 peptides might be presented by HLA-E molecules, we performed MHCI (Major histocompatibility Class I) binding predictions, made on 26 April 2020 using the IEDB analysis resource ANN aka NetMHC (ver. 4.0) tool. We observed that an 8mer peptide in the SP1 domain (270-277, LQPRTFLL) showed a high affinity mainly for the HLA-E*0101 binding groove (IC50: 0.02) and in a lower extent for the HLA-E*0301 allele (IC50: 0.76), with a similar consensus motif with HLA-E binding (VMAPRTVLL) [14] . We might speculate that the induction of GATA3 and the binding of SP1 peptide might induce HLA-E membrane expression on lung epithelial cells. ",

The total number of NK cells decreased in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the expression of NKG2A on the surface of NK cells was increased, suggesting an exhausted phenotype [31, 32] . Interestingly, when the patients were rescued after the infection, NKG2A expression was decreased simultaneously with the increase in the number of NK cells [30] .

We evaluated the possible modification of surface HLA class I molecules on lung epithelial cells. The presentation of pathogen-derived peptides by HLA molecules and the genetic variability of HLA alleles in human populations account for their role in the individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or progression. We showed that S1 protein on one side diminished classical HLA class I molecule expression but on the other side upregulated HLA-E expression. The protein HLA-E is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex molecule that binds peptides derived from a specific signal sequence [14] . We recognized an SP1-derived HLA-E binding peptide that might stabilize HLA-E expression on the surface of lung epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the highest affinity is demonstrated for the HLA-E*0101 allele. HLA-E surface expression conferred cell resistance to NK cell lysis, interacting with the NK cell inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A [14, 38] . The involvement of HLA-E in the control of NK cell activation is confirmed also by the different results observed in K562 and lung cell models. K562 cells express no HLA molecules, providing no effective molecules to SARS-CoV spike 1 protein in order to control NK cells. For this, we observed IFN-gamma secretion and NK cell activation also in the presence of SARS-CoV spike 1 protein in the K562 cell model. On the contrary, lung cells, which express HLA-E molecules in the presence of SARS-CoV spike 1 protein, are able to inhibit IFN-gamma secretion and NK cell activation.",

We observed that HLA-E up-modulation by SP1 is controlled by GATA3 transcription factor. In fact, the treatment with GATA inhibitor reduced the expression of HLA-E even in the presence of SP1. GATA3 is a transcription factor that drives the differentiation of T helper (Th) 2 cells [28] , immune regulation [27] , and embryonic and adult non-hematopoietic cells' differentiation, including the lung [39] . The upregulation of GATA3 mRNA and protein by SP1 protein might have other important effects on lung epithelial cells that surely deserve to be evaluated. More interestingly, GATA3 is not only up-modulated, but it is transcriptional active, as showed by the induction of mRNA transcription of a GATA3 target gene, as CCL26. The induction of CCL26 might modify NK cell status. In particular, it has been shown that CCL26 is able induce the migration of NK cells infiltrated in the epithelial layers of nasal tissue [40] . We hypothesize that SP1 induction of GATA3 and the consequent secretion of CCL26 might induce NK cell migration, as we previously observed ( Figure 1A) . Further experiments are necessary to prove this hypothesis.",

These data are in agreement with the recognized crosstalk between HLA-E and NKG2A/CD94, that induces a higher surface level of HLA-E molecules concurrently with a prevalent expression of NKG2A receptor on the surface of NK cells [15] .
