Heating DNA solution was performed at 94\u00b0C for 5, 10 and 15 min, and also 72\u00b0C for 30, 60 and 120 min, individually. Moreover, heating the cells was done by incubation at 42\u00b0C for 2 h in different times such as before, during and after DNA transfection. Results Our data showed that the conformation of plasmid DNAs was changed at different temperatures with increasing time. The heat-treated plasmid DNAs (94\u00b0C for 10 min or 72\u00b0C for 30 min) indicated higher transfection efficiency than untreated plasmid DNAs (p \\ 0.05). Furthermore, heat treatment of cells before and during the transfection was higher than untreated cells (p \\ 0.01). Our results demonstrated that DNA transfection efficiency in cancerous cells was less than non-cancerous cells (p \\ 0.01). Conclusion Generally, these findings showed that transfection mediated by thermal stimulation could enhance gene transfection in mammalian cell lines.",

As known, the cellular uptake of naked DNA is very low in vitro/ in vivo (Dupuis et al. 2000) ; thus, many techniques were used to solve this problem including chemical, physical, and biological methods (Seow and Wood 2009) . Biological methods (e.g. virus-mediated method) have high efficiency, but they may not be safe. Chemical methods (e.g. calcium phosphate, and cationic polymers/ lipids/ amino acids) are less cytotoxic than biological methods (dependent on dose), but they may not induce specific immunity (Du et al. 2018) . Physical methods (e.g. electroporation, microinjection and gene gun) are used due to their minimal side effects, but they are limited in clinical applications (Shinde 2020) . Recently, the socalled 'physical-chemical' manipulations could improve the efficiency of gene delivery into the cell and also the nucleus (Mehier-Humbert and Guy 2005) . For example, heat treatment as a physical approach increased the total uptake of exogenous nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) into the cell. This approach was mainly focused on direct induction of heat in plasmid DNA or cell. DNA heating could change the DNA structure by separation of the double strands, and then breaking the covalent bonds of DNA single strand. These DNA modifications may influence the transfection efficiency (Hou et al. 2008) . Previous in vitro experiments showed that heat treatment of the cells increased lipid-mediated DNA transfection efficiency (Pipes et al. 2005; Takizaki et al. 2017 ) through caveolar endocytosis, and subsequently escaping from lysosomal digestion (Takizaki et al. 2017) .",

Among different HIV-1 proteins, Nef is an early-expressed protein which plays an important role in the downregulation of CD4 and MHC class I as a virulence factor for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pathogenesis (Kaw 2020) . Thus, Nef antigen can be considered as a possible attractive target in HIV-1 therapeutic vaccine development. Moreover, co-delivery of antigen with molecular adjuvants such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) is an important approach to improve the immunogenicity of DNAbased vaccines. Our previous study showed that heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) as a molecular adjuvant could enhance Nef antigen-specific immunity in HIV-1 vaccine development (Milani et al. 2017a) .",

The transfection efficiency rates of pEGFP-Nef, pEGFP-Hsp27-Nef and pEGFP-N1 were 53.00 \u00b1 0.40, 57.30 \u00b1 0.21 and 69.01 \u00b1 0.30 for treatment at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, and 57.40 \u00b1 0.51, 61.30 \u00b1 0.70 and 74.71 \u00b1 1.02 for treatment at 94\u00b0C for 10 min, respectively.

Based on these results, the heat-treated plasmid DNA at 94\u00b0C for 10 min showed higher transfection efficiency than the heat-treated plasmid DNA at 94\u00b0C for 5 min (p \\ 0.05), and untreated control (p \\ 0.01). No significant difference was detected in the transfection efficiency of heat-treated DNA at 72\u00b0C for 30 and 60 min (p [ 0.05). Moreover, heat treatment of DNA at 94\u00b0C for 10 min did not show any significant difference with heat treatment of DNA at 72\u00b0C for 30 min (p [ 0.05). Thus, heat treatment of DNA at 94\u00b0C for 10 min and 72\u00b0C for 30 min was selected to deliver DNA in other cell lines (Fig. 4A ). Heat treatment of the plasmid DNA at 94\u00b0C for 10 min and 72\u00b0C for 30 min was selected for transfection of Vero, HeLa and TC-1 cell lines.

These results indicated that heat treatment at 94\u00b0C for 10 min showed no significant difference with heat treatment at 72\u00b0C for 30 min, but it was higher than untreated control (p \\ 0.01). The transfection efficiency of pEGFP-Nef and pEGFP-Hsp27-Nef and pEGFP-N1 treated by heat at 94\u00b0C for 10 min in HeLa cells was 10.52 \u00b1 0.60, 12.71 \u00b1 0.83 and 14.08 \u00b1 0.21, and at 72\u00b0C for 30 min was 23.50 \u00b1 0.33, 24.81 \u00b1 1.10 and 28.03 \u00b1 1.03, respectively.

There is an urgent need to find simple, costeffective and potent delivery systems that would improve the transfection efficiency using much lower dose of plasmid DNA (Zhao et al. 2011) . A number of new techniques have been recently developed to introduce foreign DNA into cells. One approach is non-viral delivery system (Ho et al. 2021) . In this study, we focused on a commercial lipid reagent (lipofectamine) along with a physical method (heat shock under various conditions) for gene transfer in four mammalian cell lines with the same tissue origin (epithelial tissue). Several studies indicated the importance of heat shock proteins such as Hsp90, Hsp70 and Gp96 as an adjuvant for enhancement of humoral and cellular immune responses against infections (Corigliano et al. 2021; Dalimi and Nasiri 2020; Gupta et al. 2020) . Our previous study showed that Hsp27 could be used as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance HIV-1 Nef antigen-specific immunity in DNA-based immunization (Milani et al. 2017a) . Moreover, Hsp27 fused to HIV-1 Nef could increase the Nef expression in vitro (Milani et al. 2017b) . Therefore, the transfection efficiency of HIV-1 nef and hsp27-nef gene constructs linked to gfp gene as well as gfp gene was studied under different thermal conditions in four mammalian cell lines. These findings can help us to improve therapeutic vaccines against HIV-1 infections.",

For example, HEK-293 T and HeLa cell lines transfected with an EGFP expression vector (pEGFP) using Lipofectamine transfection reagent, showed that the EGFP expression was * 86.4% and * 52%, respectively (Basirnejad et al. 2018; Reed et al. 2006) . In another study, the transfection rates of HeLa cells with pCMV b-Gal using three cationic lipid reagents including FuGENE HD, Lipofectamine and X-treme-GENE were estimated approximately 43%, 31% and 4%, respectively (Asgharian et al. 2014) . Kong et al. reported that the uptake of DNA in cancer cells might be different from normal/nontumor cells due to gene mutations and the ability of endocytosis in vivo (Kong et al. 2017) . Moreover, transfection efficiency of human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 DNA construct using Lipofectamine and TurboFect in non-cancerous HEK-293 T cells (74.43% for Lipofectamine and 80.63% for Tur-boFect) was significantly higher than cancerous A549 (16.36% for Lipofectamine and 5.95% for TurboFect) and TC-1 cells (8.11% for Lipofectamine and 4.47% for TurboFect) in vitro (Shahbazi et al. 2018) . Therefore, transfection efficiency of the DNA/reagent complexes is dependent on the cell type. Chitosan, a cationic polymer, has high potential for DNA delivery into mammalian cells. A previous study indicated that the transfection efficiency of chitosan/DNA microparticles was normally lower than that of lipid/DNA complexes. Moreover, the uptake of chitosan-pSVb-Gal microparticles in HEK-293 cells was more effective than in HeLa and mouse fibroblastic 3T3 cell lines indicating that transfection efficiency of the DNA/reagent complexes is dependent on the cell type (Dastan and Turan 2004) . Our study also indicated that the transfection efficiency of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 into the non-cancerous cell lines (HEK-293 T and Vero) was effectively higher than the cancerous cell lines (HeLa and TC-1; p \\ 0.01). The reports showed that different cell lines may internalize a polyplex through various endocytic pathways leading to a variety of transfection rates (Rejman et al. 2005; Rejman et al. 2005; Von et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Heat treatment could alter the structure of the cell membrane in various cell types. For example, aminoacid uptake was impaired in human T-cell line , and in rat thymocytes . Moreover, heat treatment suppressed the facilitated diffusion of thymidine (Slusser et al. 1982) and enhanced the permeability of oligoamines (Gerner et al. 1980) in CHO cells. Heat-induced changes in the membrane potential were determined in normal and transformed hamster lymphocytes. Incubation for 1-2 h at temperatures between 38\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C resulted in a depolarization of normal cells and a hyperpolarization of SV40-transformed cells (Mikkelsen and Koch 1982) . Giovanella et al. showed that malignant cells (e.g. transformed 3T6 cells) were more thermosensitive than normal cells (e.g. untransformed 3T3 cells) leading to cell membrane permeabilization (likely due to an increased intracellular Ca ?2 concentration), and finally cell death (Giovanella et al. 1979; Hayat and Friedberg 1986) . These differences between the transformed and non-transformed cells might be due to differences in the cell membrane composition and topology (Hayat et al. 1986 ). In 2017, Tkizaki et al. reported that gene transfection could be enhanced by heat treatment. Moreover, heat treatment before transfection showed a higher increase in gene delivery than during or after transfection. Indeed, heat treatment increased the total uptake of plasmid DNA due to enhancing caveolar endocytosis and subsequently escaping from lysosomal digestion (Takizaki et al. 2017) . In another study, human lung carcinoma cell line (A549), human colon carcinoma cell line (SW480), human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7), murine melanoma cell line (B-16) and murine mammary tumor cell line (4T1) were treated for 10 min at 42\u00b0C immediately following lipid DMRIE-C transfection. Transient transfection efficiency was increased by heat treatment in A549, SW480 and MCF-7 cells. Heat shock likely influences the cells through an increase in the number of cells that uptake the plasmid (i.e. change in fluidity of the cell membrane), and/ or an increased stable integration rate (i.e. change in fluidity of the nuclear membrane or in chromatin structure) (Pipes et al. 2005) . In our study, heat treatment of the cells at 42\u00b0C for 2 h before transfection could increase transfection efficiency and gene expression in both non-cancerous (p \\ 0.01) and cancerous (p \\ 0.05) cell lines. It may be likely related to the induction of heat shock protein 56 (Hsp56), cholesterol uptake and finally an enhanced caveolar endocytosis (Takizaki et al. 2017) . Also, the effects of heat treatment on DNA structures and its bioactivities were studied by Hou et al. The heat-treated pEGFP-C2 vector at 94\u00b0C for 3, 9, 15, 21 and 27 min showed that the covalent bonds of DNA strands were broken by long-time heating process. The time of 4 min was selected to balance between the denatured DNA and the destroyed DNA for evaluation of the transfection efficiency of heattreated DNA. It was observed that the transfection efficiency of DNA in HEK-293 T was improved about 10% after heat treatment (Hou et al. 2008) . Our data also showed that heat-denatured plasmid DNA appeared at 94\u00b0C after 5 min and at 72\u00b0C after 30 min, and this rate gradually continued with increasing time. Our results showed that the transfection rate of heat-treated DNA at 72\u00b0C for 30 min was significantly higher than that at 94\u00b0C for 10 min in cancerous HeLa (p \\ 0.01) and TC-1 (p \\ 0.05) cell lines. Heat treatment of plasmid DNA at 72\u00b0C for 30 min, and heat treatment of cells before transfection could enhance the transfection efficiency in comparison with untreated control in HEK-293 T, Vero and TC-1 cell lines.",

            "text": "There is a correlation between the cell type and transcription machinery that influences transfection efficiency. Mammalian expression vectors containing the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer regions promote the constitutive DNA replication in most mammalian cells leading to higher levels of expression. However, the ability of cell lines is different for promotion of SV40 T antigen transactivation. The efficiency of transactivation is strongly related to the level of replicated DNA in the cells. In this regard, the potency of the SV40 enhancer region in HEK-293 and HeLa cell lines showed that the ability of HEK-293 cells to support SV40 T antigen was approximately three-to four-fold higher than HeLa cells. Moreover, DNA replication in HEK-293 cells was more effective than that in HeLa cells (Kelly et al. 1989 ). The delivery of plasmids harboring genes under the control of CMV promoter (e.g. pEGFP, pcDNA) could effectively force the translation of gene products in HEK cells and other transformed cell lines (e.g. COS & CHO). Thus, the difference between cells is due to the cellular environment (Thomas and Smart 2005) . Herein, we used pEGFP vector as an eukaryotic expression vector and HEK-293 T cell as a cellular vehicle. Our data confirmed the best gene expression in HEK-293 T cell as compared to Vero, HeLa and TC-1 cells. Lipoplexes (Cationic lipid-DNA complexes) are normally formed by direct mixing between cationic liposomes and plasmid DNA (Khalil et al. 2006; Felgner et al. 1995; Rejman et al. 2005) . Herein, we used lipofectamine 2000 reagent for lipoplex formation, as well. However, different uptake approaches (direct penetration or clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis) influence transfection efficiency and gene expression in various cell lines (El-Sayed et al. 2013; Khalil et al. 2006; Billiet et al. 2012; El-Sayed and Harashima 2013) .",

Also, heat-treated cells at 42\u00b0C for 2 h before transfection could increase transfection rate and gene expression in both non-cancerous and cancerous cell lines. In addition, the insert gene could affect the transfection efficiency. Some mechanisms were involved for thermal effects by different researches. Heat treatment/shock may change the fluidity of the cell membrane, intracellular processes (e.g. endosomal escape and delivery to the nucleus), and transcription and translation processes.
