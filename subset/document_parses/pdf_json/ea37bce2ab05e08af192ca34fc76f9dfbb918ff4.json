            "text": "Continuing medical education (CME) emerged at the start of the 20th century as a means of maintaining clinical competence among health care practitioners. However, evidence indicates that CME is often poorly developed and inappropriately used. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the literature in evaluating wider contexts at play in CME development and delivery. In this article, the authors present a unified theoretical framework, grounded in learning theories, to explore the role of contextual factors in public health CME for health care practitioners. Discussion with pedagogical experts together with a narrative review of learning theories within medical and social science literature informed the framework's development. The need to consider sociocultural theories of learning within medical education restricted suitable theories to those that recognized contexts beyond the individual learner; adopted a systems approach to evaluate interactions between contexts and learner; and considered learning as more than mere acquisition of knowledge. Through a process of rigorous critical analysis, two theoretical models emerged as contextually appropriate: Biggs principle of constructive alignment and Bronfenbrenner bioecological model of human development. Biggs principle offers theoretical clarity surrounding interactive factors that encourage lifelong learning, whereas the Bronfenbrenner model expands on these factor's roles across multiple system levels. The authors explore how unification into a single framework complements each model while elaborating on its fundamental and practical applications. The unified theoretical framework presented in this article addresses the limitations of isolated frameworks and allows for the exploration of the applicability of wider learning theories in CME research.",

            "text": "T he advent of continuing medical education (CME) in the early part of the 20th century was a turning point in the recognition of the importance of lifelong education among health care professionals (HCPs). 1 Thirty-nine systematic reviews since 1977 reveal that CME is effective in increasing HCP's knowledge, changing HCP's behavior, and to a lesser extent, improving patient outcomes. 2 However, there is ongoing concern that CME continues to be poorly developed: ineffective formats (eg, didactic lectures and conferences) continue to dominate, 2 with more than 80% of accredited CME activities not targeting higher levels of learning as defined by Bloom taxonomy (cognitive (Table 1) , affective, and pyschomotor domain). 3 CME selection is predominantly driven by the expectation that HCPs are able to accurately self-assess and determine their own learning needs. 4 Evidence suggests, however, that HCPs are unable to accurately self-assess their skill deficit 4 and often tend to overestimate their abilities. 5 As a result, HCPs are more inclined to select familiar CME topics in which they are already competent, potentially ignoring other areas of important and contemporary medical knowledge. 6 This concern about quality, 3 format, 2 and self-selection of CME 6 is aggravated further by the rapidly changing field of medical knowledge: it is estimated that the extent of medical knowledge covered in medical school doubles every 73 days. 7 The focus of this increased knowledge has moved toward matters relating to public health (PH) and quality patient care, 8 driven by the global recognition of changing population dynamics and health care needs. 9 In addition, the push for universal health care, 10 and the benefit of preventive primary care in the community, 11 requires that HCPs keep appraised of developments and knowledge within the realm of PH. Currently, only 50% of patients receive the appropriate level of preventive care. 12 Increasing this to 90% could save an additional two million lives a year with cost savings. 13 Because of the broad multiprofessional, multidisciplinary, and multiagency nature of PH, CME that cuts across clinical domains and is specific to the PH needs of a population is required. 14 Because HCPs are considered an integral component of the PH workforce, a unique responsibility exists to ensure they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills \"to provide relevant health promotion and disease prevention services in the health care setting.\" 15 (pg. 17) These issues necessitate the optimization of PH CME. As has been mentioned, CME is effective when offered and used correctly; however, this is not always the case. Understanding what role context may play in CME effectiveness has been identified as a research priority. 2 Indeed, within medical education, context continues to elude definition 16 ; as a result, there is increasing interest to define 17 and identify 18 context in CMErelated fields. Bates and Ellaway 16 examined 62 articles that addressed context in some way and developed a definition for context in medical education: Revised Bloom Taxonomy-Cognitive Domain Levels, Definitions, and Descriptive Verbs* A Unified Theoretical Framework for CME \"Context is a dynamic and ever-changing system that emerges from underlying patterns of patients, locations, practice, education and society, and from the unpredictable interactions between these patterns.\" (p. 814) This definition serves as the basis for the authors' understanding of context in CME.",

Within the realm of medical education research, these theories have tended to focus on the individual, as opposed to the sociocultural context in which HCPs function and learn. 24 Although focusing on the individual has proved a useful approach to medical education following the recommendations of the Flexner report (1910), the changing face of health care, and our evolving understanding of how students learn, necessitates a different approach in how we advance medical education to meet the needs of a rapidly progressing global society in the 21st century. 25 HCPs do not function in isolation; they are part of wider health care systems that stretch from clinical teams, in their immediate environment, to national health policies determining the type and standard of care that HCPs practice, which in turn are influenced by international health agendas and emerging concerns, such as SARS-CoV-2. Sociocultural theories of learning offer opportunities to examine how learning occurs across these systems \"at the level of the environment in which medicine is learned and practiced.\" 23 (p. 31) Indeed, isolating HCPs from this system complexity during training is unlikely to foster interprofessional abilities that are shown to improve patient outcomes. 26 Systems thinking is becoming increasingly popular within the field of PH 27, 28 and has proved useful in modeling impacts of educational interventions on opioid abuse. 29 Indeed, a funda-mental tenet of systems thinking is understanding how new knowledge is created, managed, disseminated, and integrated across systems to improve population outcomes. 30 Similarly, social learning theories assume a systems perspective by recognizing that knowledge is created through social interaction within complex systems. 31 These commonalities offer fruitful ground for using sociocultural theories of learning to investigate PH CME.",

Particularly within CME, there are numerous factors and stakeholders that play important roles in its development and delivery. 38 Freeth and Reeves 39 adapted Biggs 3P model in an attempt to identify these wider influences on learning opportunities within interprofessional workplaces. Their adaptation has proven effective as an analytical tool for synthesizing results in systematic reviews of interprofessional education. 40, 41 However, Biggs model does not allow the exploration of the effect of context on learning across systems because it aggregates them into a single presage factor. As previously mentioned, understanding how knowledge is created across systems is a fundamental aspect of both systems thinking within PH and social learning theories. It is on this point that Bronfenbrenner bioecological model of human development 35 offers opportunity for greater understanding of how knowledge is created across systems within Biggs model.",

From this, Bronfenbrenner defined four initial levels that make up educational environment's ecological structure, namely the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem (Table 3) . These level definitions offer concrete descriptions of key stakeholders within each system based on their degree of interaction with the individual. Such a reading of Bronfenbrenner's work allows for the possible expansion of components of Biggs model to provide further granularity of contextual factors that influence learning within and across systems. Applying Bronfenbrenner model addresses the potential shortcoming of using Biggs theory in isolation. Lave and Wenger view learning as occurring through participation in communities, whereby learners enter these \"communities of practice\" as peripheral novices and over time gain mastery in the skill set of the community. Learning thereby becomes a part of social practice, informed and influenced by the context in which it is situated, as opposed to the structure of pedagogy being the source of learning. This \"learning through social practice\" in turn changes the individual. The theory arose through research of apprenticeships.",

The second iteration focused on the role of the individual in their own development. The third and final iteration, referred to as the Process-Person-Context-Time (PPCT) model, highlighted the importance Bronfenbrenner placed on complex interactions between the individual and their immediate surroundings (proximal processes of development), and the influence of time, both longitudinal and historical, on that development. As a result, the fifth system, termed chronosystem by Bronfenbrenner, 43 was added to the model. It posits that development is shaped across the life course and through historical time past, present, and future. This is highly relevant in CME because the changing face of health care requires changes in the way HCPs maintain competency and develop professionally. 44 There is a large component of complementarity and compatibility between the two models described above. Both view the process of learning as an integral component of the outcome, although the models approach this from opposite ends: Biggs starts with the outcome, and then aligns the learning process to this outcome, whereas Bronfenbrenner observes how the learning process leads to the outcome (development). Both place the individual at the heart of the theory: Biggs talks about level 3 teaching, where the focus is on \"what the student does and how that relates to teaching\" 34 (p. 20) ; the importance of the individual to Bronfenbrenner was so great that the second iteration of their work focused wholly on the role of the individual in their own development. 43 Finally, although Biggs does not explicitly address time in their own model to the same extent as Bronfenbrenner chronosystem, it does point out that learning is not \"a one-off process but a continuing action learning cycle\". 34 (p. 281) This implies a concept of time in motion, although apart from its influence on evaluation, is not a major component of Biggs principle.",

This is supported by the theoretical perspectives of both models as described above. The practical implication of this longitudinal time implies learning is a continuous, ongoing process. To be effective, CME cannot be developed as a single interaction at a point in time. Indeed, empirical evidence supports the notion that multiple-exposure CME is more effective than singleexposure activities. 2 Finally, Bronfenbrenner's conceptualization of time is represented by the encapsulating chronosystem in which processes and systems of learning reside. This acknowledges that an individual's learning is shaped by changes arising in the historical era through which they live and develop, 43 and requires researchers to be cognizant of similar changes in medical education over the past decades. 47 These changes will occur more frequently as technology continues to impact health care education 48 and practice. 49 Thus, several generations of various pedagogical learning strategies will be present among HCPs undertaking any CME activity. 50 Failure to acknowledge the impact of these learning eras on the individual's preferred learning process may limit the effectiveness and potential impact of CME.",

The models applied in this framework complement each other and provide opportunity to explore the phenomenon of professional learning in CME with greater clarity than either model on its own. The unified theoretical framework that has emerged from this analysis offers a structured, theory based approach for use in CME research. This unified theoretical framework will form the a priori framework for a \"best fit\" framework synthesis of the literature 51 to develop a conceptual framework of contextual factors that play a role in PH CME. The evolution of this unified theoretical framework created from theories with a proven evidence base not only enhances the reliability of findings using the future conceptual framework but also progresses scholarship within medical education research.",
