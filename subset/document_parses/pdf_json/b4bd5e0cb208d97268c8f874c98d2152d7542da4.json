Recent developments in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things have made possible the collection of unprecedented amounts of agricultural data with the goal of making agricultural processes better and more efficient, and thus supporting sustainable agriculture. These data coming from different types of IoT devices can also be combined with relevant information published in online social networks and on the Web in the form of textual documents. Our objective is to integrate such heterogeneous data into knowledge bases that can support farmers in their activities, and to present global, real-time and comprehensive information to researchers.

In the information access and management in plant health domain category, the semantic annotation in BSV focuses on extracting information for the traditional BSV. Indeed, for more than 50 years, printed plant health bulletins have been diffused by regions and by crops in France, giving information about the arrival and the evolution of pests, pathogens, and weeds, and advises for preventive actions. These bulletins serve not only as agricultural alerts for farmers but also documentation for those who want to study the historical data. The French National Institute For Agricultural Research (INRA) has been working towards the publishing of the bulletins as Linked Open Data [12] , where BSV from different regions are centralized, tagged with crop type, region, date and published on the Internet. To organize the bulletins by crop usage in France, an ontology with 272 concepts was manually constructed. With the volume of concepts and relations augmenting, manual construction of ontologies will become too expensive [3] . Thus, ontology learning methods to automatically extract concepts and relationships should be studied.",

Moreover, in CODA application case, IsPestOf rule was defined but not instantiated. Therefore, a global knowledge base, that covers the crops, the natural hazards including pests, diseases, and climate variations, and the relations between them, is still missing. There is also an increasing necessity to a comprehensive and an automatic approach to integrate knowledge from an ampler variety of heterogeneous sources. -Linguistic preprocessing: Unstructured and semi-structured textual data are passed through a linguistic prepossessing pipeline (Sentence segmentation, Tokenization, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, Lemmatization) with existing natural language processing (NLP) tools such as Stanford NLP (https:// nlp.stanford.edu/), GATE (https://gate.ac.uk/) and UIMA (https://uima. apache.org/). -Terms/concept detection: At the best of our knowledge and from the state of the art study, there is no ontology in french that modulates the natural hazards and their relations with crops. Existing french thesaurus like french crop usage and Agrovoc can be applied to filter collected data and served as gazetteer. Linguistic rules represented by regular expressions can be used to extract temporal data. Recurrent neural network (RNN), conditional random field (CRF) model and bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) were applied for health-related name entity recognition from twitter messages and gave a remarkable result [2] . Once the ontology is populated, it could provide knowledge and constraints to the extraction of terms [17] . -Relation detection: Similar to term/concept detection, initially there's no ontology. A basic strategy could be using self-supervised methods like Modified Open Information Extraction (MOIE): i) use wordnet-based semantic similarity and frequency distribution to identify related terms among detected terms from previous step ii) slicing the textual patterns between related terms [8] . Once the ontology is populated, it could contribute to calculate semantic similarities between detected terms in phase i). ",

            "text": "New digital technologies allow farmers to predict the yield of their fields, to optimize their resources and to avoid or protect their fields from natural hazards whether they are due to the weather, pests or diseases. This is a recent area where research is constantly evolving. We have introduced in this paper work relevant to our problem, namely: the integration of several data sources to extract information related to the natural hazards in agriculture. We then proposed an architecture based on ontology learning and ontology-based information extraction. We plan in a first phase build an ontology from twitter data that contains vocabulary in the existing thesaurus. To evaluate the constructed ontology, we will extract crops and pests from the learnt ontology, and compare it with tags in pest observer. In the following iterations, we will work on ontology alignment strategies to update the ontology with data from other sources. To go further, multilingual ontology management with keeping tempo-spacial contexts should be investigated.",
