The link between ACEs and mental health on college students' sexual risk is still understudied. Using cross-sectional data from a sample of 327 college students in Sierra Leone, this study tested the hypothesized mediation model using structural equation modeling analysis. The results showed that ACEs significantly increased sexual risks. Specifically, ACEs increased the risk of early initiation of sexual activity and the number of lifetime sex partners, which in turn increased the risk of STDs. Furthermore, ACEs significantly predicted negative mental health and were significantly associated with an increased risk of STDs. Effective future intervention strategies should include health education programs to address the lifelong effects of ACEs and mental health treatment.",

Exposure to adversity and conflict may be associated with higher odds of engagement in risky behaviors, including sexual risk behaviors (Jessor and Jessor 1977) . Among individuals with a history of ACEs, risky sexual behaviors may represent their attempts to achieve intimate interpersonal relationships (CDC 2019; Noll et al. 2009 ). Further, the effects of war, conflicts, and poverty on Sierra Leone's health infrastructure cannot be underestimated. More than 60% of the population of Sierra Leone live below the United Nations' poverty line of US$1 per day. A lack of adequate shelter, food, and other basic needs at minimum consumption levels disproportionately impact young people in Sierra Leone or sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) increasing disease risk. For example, about 14,000 people are infected with HIV, and 11,000 die from AIDS-related illnesses daily in SSA. To put this into context, approximately 6313 COVID-19 related deaths occurred worldwide on September 4, 2020 (Worldmeter 2020).",

First, although at greater vulnerability for STD infection, this population is assumed to be educated and knowledgeable about STDs (Subbarao and Akhilesh 2017) . Second, despite the realities of the biological and cultural factors mentioned above, college students are assumed to be educated, resilient, and unaffected by the impact of ACEs (Kelifa et al. 2020) . Third, Sierra Leone is a less developed country (LDC) that struggles to maintain a steady STD prevention and treatment campaign due to budget constraints. For example, in 2017, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) gave Sierra Leone $5 million to help the government step up its HIV and STD prevention efforts (AHF 2017). By comparison, the U.S. spends $15.6 billion a year on adolescent sexual health programs (CDC 2018) . Such scarcity of resources may be associated with a high STD burden in Sierra Leone and other SSA countries.",

First, early initiation of sexual activity was assessed as a continuous variable that measured the age when the respondent had sexual intercourse for the first time. For this study, we changed from the continuous variable to a dichotomous variable using the cut off age of 15 years old based on the study conducted by Brown and colleagues (2017). Having sexual intercourse before 15 years old was categorized as 1 and having sexual intercourse after 15 years old was categorized as 0. Second, the number of lifetime sex partners was assessed as a count variable that measured the number of people the individual had ever had sex with. Lastly, mental health was conceptualized as anxiety and depression. We assessed participants' mental health problems by utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The ultimate mental health variable was comprised of these two variables. The PHQ-9 was developed by Kroenke et al. (2001) ; it is a 9-item self-administered questionnaire for the assessment of the severity of symptoms of depression for patients undergoing clinical treatment. A sample question is, \"In the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?\" Respondents indicated the degree to which each statement was true on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). PHQ-9 contained statements such as \"little interest or pleasure in doing things\" and \"trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.\" Scores have been organized on a scale of increasing severity of depression, ranging from 0 to 4. For this research, the mean of the PHQ-9 became central to the analysis (see Table 3 ), having a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.70. The GAD-7 scale was used to measure anxiety. This 7-item scale, developed by Spitzer and colleagues (2006), is a self-administered questionnaire for the assessment of how frequently anxiety symptoms appear for patients receiving clinical treatment or participating in clinical research. The GAD-7 measurements range over a four-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A multipart sample question is, \"In the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems: (1) not being able to stop or control worrying, and (2) feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.\" In this research, the analysis was undertaken using the mean for the GAD-7 (see Table 3 ). The Cronbach alpha for the GAD-7 was 0.82, which indicates strong relibility. Age was a control variable in this study.",

For this study, the sample size of 327 was adequate to test the SEM model with 9 indicators in the path model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the measurement model before testing the structural path model. The measurement model was tested to determine whether the observed items employed for measuring the two latent variables (adverse childhood experience and mental health) operated as valid indicators for the constructs. The structural path model then underwent testing to assess the hypothesized conceptual model. The structural path model offers a description of how all the variables for the projected model are interrelated. This model also displays the direct and indirect effects of specific variables on certain other variables in the model. This research looks at the direct and indirect paths from adverse childhood experiences to STD infections through the mediators of early initiation of sexual activity, number of lifetime sex partners, and mental health.",

The average number of lifetime sex partners among respondents was 3.24 people, ranging from 1 to 6 people. Approximately one-third of the respondents reported they had experience with sexually transmitted infections. Table 3 describes the means and standard deviations of the variables in the SEM model. Table 4 , the initial original model fit was inadequate. When estimating the factor loadings, five items (i.e., neglect, protection, incarceration of a house member, mental illness of a house member, and bullying) had a factor loading lower than 0.5. In contrast, all other indicators had a factor loading greater than 0.5 (see Table 5 ). According to Truong and Mccoll (2011) , factor loadings should be greater than 0.5 for better results. Therefore, the five items for ACEs were not included in the post hoc model. The reduced number of items based on the information of factor loadings and the incorporation of the error covariance resulted in an improvement in the model fit, as seen on Table 4 . The TLI and CFI values were above 0.98, suggesting an excellent fit of the data model. The RMSEA value of 0.05 met the criteria for a good model. Furthermore, the AIC values decreased from 14,623.46 to 6368 in the desired direction. The final model fit of the measurement model was also improved by allowing several items to co-vary based on the information from the modified model fit indices (see Fig. 1 ). Also, the reliabilities of ACEs and mental health were assessed with composite reliability (CR). If the value of CR is higher than 0.7, it is considered adequate. CR is calculated using the following formula: CR = (\u2211\u049a) 2 /[(\u2211\u049a) 2 + (\u22111 \u2212 \u049a 2 )]) (\u049a = factor loading of every item; Fornell and Larcker 1981) . Overall, the composite reliability of each latent construct was greater than 0.7 (ACEs = 0.84, mental health = 0.75).",

We also found that about 8% of the respondents reported engaging in sex when they were younger than age 15. This prevalence is similar to the rate of other countries in Africa.

We found that individual ACEs are associated with early-age sexual initiation, which also increased STD risk. The impact of ACEs, including physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, verbal humiliation that occurs while growing up with an abusive family member, can negatively affect neurobiology (Steinberg 2008) . One way to deal with some effects from ACEs is to learn to build one's self-efficacy by seeking the right kinds of relationships. For example, finding people who are supportive and provide positive interactions with others, which can forge strong social ties that build confidence. Without positive reinforcement, individuals may not have the confidence to refuse unprotected or unwanted sex. In a study with a sample of college students in Ghana (Asante et al. 2016) , students with higher self-efficacy levels for condom use were likely to use condoms. In helping female students develop self-efficacy, programs should consider genderpower inequality issues because Sierra Leone's Gender Inequality Index ranked 150 out of 189 in 2017 (United Nations Development Programme 2018).",

It is important that students treat their mental health issues while screening for and treating STDs. Accordingly, it is recommended that training programs for healthcare professionals include mental health screening tools and resources for referral of STD students with mental health problems. Importantly, service providers need to understand that these students are likely to experience fear, shame, and stigma about STDs that may affect appropriate screening and treatment (Fortenberry et al. 2002) .",

            "text": "Our study highlights that the associations between ACEs and diagnoses of STDs were significantly mediated by early initiation of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, and mental health problems. These findings are consistent with several previous studies' findings that compared with individuals who have no ACEs, individuals with ACEs are at increased risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety (Hughes et al. 2017; Kim 2017; Merrick et al. 2017; Rehan et al. 2017 ). In addition, exposure to ACEs, including emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and parental incarceration, is associated with risky sexual outcomes including multiple sexual partners and contracting STDs (London et al. 2017) . Service providers should carefully consider how early ACEs may exacerbate the risk of risky sexual behaviors and mental health problems, which are, in turn, associated with diagnoses of STDs. It is important to understand that exposure to ACEs has a lasting impact on risky sexual behaviors, mental and physical health. Notably, ACE screening and intervention, along with early education for sexual activity and screening for mental health problems, may be useful in addressing STDs among college students. For example, young men in Tanzania are less likely to use condoms if they have mental health problems such as depression and anxiety (Hill et al. 2017) . It is important to note that exposure to the decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone negatively affected individual mental health. Although our students may not have experienced war themselves first hand, most reported post childhood adversity through ACEs. Access to mental health care providers is a big challenge because of a dramatic shortage in such health care professionals (WHO n.d.) . In a country where physician density (per 1000) is 0.024, (WHO n.d.) . having adequate mental health care is almost inconceivable. Mental health trainings for various levels of service providers (e.g., social workers, community health workers, and nurses) could help address this mental health care provider shartages (WHO n.d.) .",

            "text": "This study should be interpreted within several limitations. First, no causal relationships can be determined because of the cross-sectional study design. For example, the link between mental health problems and diagnosis of STDs can be reversed. In other words, college students can feel depressed or anxious after getting an STD. However, as mentioned above, we found more evidence of the path from ACEs to mental health problems, and the path from mental health problems to the acquisition of STDs. Second, recall bias can exist in the measures, such as ACEs, as the events happened during childhood. Third, underreporting can exist because both ACEs and sexual activity are sensitive subjects. College students tend to underreport their ACEs, onset age of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, and diagnoses of STDs. Fourth, the ACE-IQ, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 measures in this study have not been validated with college students in the sub-Saharan Africa. When conducting future research, it may be helpful to use measures that can be validated with African college students. Fifth, the data do not include some important information such as self-efficacy and use of certain contraceptive methods, however, students were asked whether they used condoms as away to protect themselves against STDs. Lastly, we used convenience sampling to collect data from only two colleges in Sierra Leon. Thus, the results are not generalizable to students in other colleges, or those individuals who are not attending a college in the country. These study limitations link to implications for future research. Future studies should utilize a longitudinal study design for causality, recruit other college students and college-aged individuals who are not attending a college using probability sampling for generalizability, and test additional predictors of diagnoses of STDs, such as self-efficacy and use of contraceptive methods, to strengthen our theoretical model. A nother possible limition of the study is social desirability, especially given that the survey was completed in class around peers. They could have been less likely to disclose certain information given the nature of the topic.",

Unlike previous studies, our study uniquely examined the mediating roles of early initiation of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, and mental health problems on the link between ACEs and STDs in a sample of college students in Sierra Leon. As mentioned, more than 30% of our study respondents reported experiencing an STD. It is important to understand the direct and indirect associations between ACEs and STDs and their joint associations with mental health problems and risky sexual behaviors among college students in Sierra Leon. It is also important to support continued efforts to design more effective intervention and health education programs for college students with STDs by addressing the lifelong effects of ACEs on risky sexual behaviors and mental health problems.",
