Additionally, at local levels, further public health and safety measures were enforced, such as the wearing of masks and face coverings, regular hand washing and sanitising as well as practising social distancing. On a wider scale, a ban on most international travel was also put into effect in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.",

In soccer, the reported positivity rate in MLS in June 2020 was 2.7% (n=668 players), with the English Premier League also higher than this study (1.22%-1.74%). 3-5 7 It should be noted that the duration of testing is potentially different in the different sports due to the density of competitions and scheduling, as well as length of their respective seasons, which are likely to differ to timescales of US national soccer team events. As a result, COVID-19 testing prior to events may be more appropriate comparisons. For example, NBA, NFL, NHL and US Soccer all required two negative PCR tests to be returned to enter the event and allow safe. participation. Furthermore, NHL and NBA also detailed very similar protocol's with regards to minimising COVID-19 infection risk. As with the US Soccer Federation return to play manual, protocols regarding testing, social distancing, face coverings, designated essential staff and processes pertaining to Open access travel, provision of sanitised individual equipment and laundry services are all described. 8 9 The robustness and success of the US Soccer return to play manual is however reflected in the unique circumstances of the coordination of players joining from all over the world. This entailed the communication and testing of individuals subject to potentially different restrictions in their home authorities before multisegment long-haul travel to join the camp and thus compete safely.",

Moreover, holding events such as these, whereby players travel from all over the world, also incorporating opposition delegations, is evidence that defined and robust health and safety protocols can mitigate the risk of infection to hold international sporting events. These were largely centred around an aggressive testing cadence and the creation of a controlled camp environment. In particular, hosting an international female soccer tournament comprising of four other national teams (SheBelieves Cup) highlights their efficacy even more. In addition to this, we also demonstrated the possibility to safely incorporate players based in other continents (Europe, Central and South America). Through strict pretravel, arrival, in-camp and postcamp return testing and safety measures, it was possible to prevent the occurrence of COVID-19 infection in our controlled environments.",
