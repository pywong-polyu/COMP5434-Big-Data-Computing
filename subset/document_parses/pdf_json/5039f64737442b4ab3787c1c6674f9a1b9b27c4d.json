The large Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study, which is a nationally representative epidemiological study, is currently being conducted throughout the country in a phased manner [1, 2] . To date, the findings suggest an increasing prevalence of T2DM in both urban and rural areas, but with a comparatively steeper rise in the urban setting that is driven by rapid changes in dietary practices and greater physical inactivity compared to rural areas. A particularly alarming trend observed in India is the shift in onset of diabetes to people in younger age groups. In the ICMR-INDIAB study (Phase I), the demographic increase in T2DM was evident in the 25-to 34-year age group, and declined after age 65 years [2] . Of all patients with T2DM in India, the study found that 69% had not achieved the target level of HbA1c. Non-compliance to lifestyle measures and multiple other factors are responsible for nonattainment of glycemic control in Indians [3] .",

Clinicians are currently witnessing a greater choice of therapeutic options, which may be also useful in various combinations to address specific priorities. At the same time, polypharmacy, with its increased pill burden and dosing frequency, is inherently associated with poorer treatment adherence [4, 5] . Even in countries with high access to healthcare, only 39% patients have reported good medication adherence. In a study of 2741 patients on oral antidiabetic drugs, each 10% increase in oral diabetes medication adherence was associated with a 0.1% decrease in HbA1c (P = 0.0004). There is evidence suggesting that treatmentadherent patients are more likely to achieve better glycemic control than non-adherent patients [5] .",

In addition to reducing pill burden and improving compliance, combination therapy with two drugs may help patients achieve their target HbA1c faster than monotherapy. Early intensive therapeutic control has proven benefits in clinical outcomes. Long-term studies, such as, for example, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), have suggested that good glycemic memory leads to a significant reduction in any diabetes-related endpoint. The long-term follow-up of the UKPDS study showed a significant 24% reduction in microvascular disease and a 15% reduction in macrovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, along with a 13% reduction in all-cause mortality [6] . Results from the long-term follow-up of Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, the Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease study, the PreterAx and DiamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study, and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) also suggested improvements in microvascular outcomes with early intensive glycemia control; however, the macrovascular and mortality outcomes were not consistently improved in these studies. Despite intensive glycemia control having proven clinical benefits for several outcomes, the residual risk of cardiovascular (CV) death has remained a significant unmet need in patients with T2DM. Since 2015, a number of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated improved CV outcomes regardless of glycemia control; these agents now form an essential part of the armamentarium for appropriate cardiometabolic risk management in T2DM [7] . With this increased availability of therapeutic choices that may address various unmet priority needs, the question of 'rational combination(s)' in T2DM holds deeper and broader implications today. In the current setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, good glycemic control (along with control of other risk factors) has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with",

Evidence suggests that TIR complements HbA1c as a parameter of glycemic control, with higher TIR associated with better clinical outcomes [16] . Studies with SGLT2i agents as well as DPP4i agents suggest that these drugs have beneficial effects on TIR. The SGLT2i anti-hyperglycemic agents influence fasting as well as the postprandial components of glycaemia, and DPP4i antihyperglycemicagents have more prominent effects on postprandial hyperglycemia; both of these classes of medications are associated with lower risks for hypoglycemia. Glycemic variability (GV) has been an emerging target for preventing complications related to T2DM. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with SGLT2i and seven RCTs of DPP4i have demonstrated that these agents reduce glycemic variability in patients with T2DM [17, 18] . The Time in Range recommendations for South Asia suggests frequency for repeating TIR evaluation, which may be minimal for therapies such as SGLT2i and DPP4i with minimal glycaemic variability again reducing the cost and complications [19] .",

Interestingly, slightly lower rates of genitourinary tract infections (GTIs) were reported with the FDC as compared to SGLT2i monotherapy. Some of the probable reasons for such moderation of GTIs with the FDC, beyond improved glycemic control, may be the interaction of DPP4 and SGLT2 proteins at the renal tubular cell-membrane level, or the inhibition of the DPP4 enzyme present in certain pathogenic microbes that may render them inactive (Fig. 3 ) [52] .",

In addition, the presence of comorbidities and established CV and kidney safety and/or benefits of antidiabetic agents may mandate their choice over other conventional options. With the evolving evidence and guidelines across the world, we should now choose second-line agents such as SGLT2i and GLP1-RAs with proven CV benefits in patients with high CV risk followed by agents with proven CV safety if additional glycemic control is required.
