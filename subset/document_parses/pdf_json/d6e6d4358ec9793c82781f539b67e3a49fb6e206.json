In late December 2019, health authorities began to identify unknown viral pneumonia cases that started to spread to other parts of China. Due to how much it had spread by early January 2020, an identification technique known as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was applied, which enabled scientists in real-time to establish a diagnosis for these cases by way of distinguishing and isolating the novel Coronavirus from which viral pneumonia the patients were suffering was caused [1] .",

            "text": "By the end of January 2020, after succumbing to considerable pressure the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Due to action that was not taken sooner in many parts of the world, the virus spread to around 25 countries by early February 2020. With the numbers increasing, guidelines and criteria for diagnosis, treatment and preventative measures had to be established rapidly [1, 2] . Viral detection using RT-PCR identified the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be the disease which caused this viral transmission worldwide. This virus bore significant similarity to that found present within bats and was of the same family as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), therefore significantly narrowing down the likelihood that this had been somehow transmitted from bats to humans (owing to bats being the main reservoir for this virus). COVID-19 has a high recombinant and mutation rate due to its unique replication capabilities, enabling it to adapt to new host cells and different target sites [3] . So far, Covid-19 has been defined HCoVs-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and ARDS have been identified [15] . N sions of the Coronavirus will appear due to the large genomic potential, rapid m capabilities, high prevalence and wide distribution within the bird and animal k The emergence of CoVs is due to birds being able to carry this viral form and tr from area to area through flying and being capable of inhabiting in between [16, 17] . SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host cell Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 through its spike proteins. These spike proteins consist of two subunits, the recep ing subunit, which facilitates binding of the virus to the host cell, and the memb ing subunit, which allows for the fusing of the membranes of the virus and host c the virus binds to the host cell, the viral molecule then enters into the host cell [1 to entering the cells, the protease enzyme TMPRSS2 activates the spike proteins. T bination of activation and binding to ACE2 are required for successful admission cell [20] . Once entered they translate small parts of the virus onto non-structural The proteins then form an enzyme called RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase. The induces a double membrane vesicle, through the restructuring of the endoplasm lum of the cell. Once these vesicles are formed, continuous replication and tran are made of the sRNA gene coding for SARS-CoV-2 [21] . Once this is complete all proteins with the sRNA are collated in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi a of the cell, hence forming the new virus particle. These viruses then release an within the body, attacking target sites as mentioned above [22] .",

RT-PCR can detect the virus in asymptomatic persons, however, the test is capable of giving false-negatives hence patients may be tested twice before being confirmed as positive or negative [21, 23] . The RT-PCR kit remains an effective kit to use in the identification of SAR-CoV-2, however, one of the main worries for challenges arising from this analysis is that cases may have gone undetected; several studies have shown that the clinical sensitivity of the analysis of respiratory swabs was at around 70% effective. This was due to the timing of these swabs, the type of specimen obtained and the quality of the sample taken. The viruses present in the upper respiratory tract for the first several days following the onset of symptoms, hence after 5 days of symptoms, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify the virus via RT-PCR. In the latter stages, for correct and accurate reading, swabs from the lower respiratory tract will yield a higher rate of detection. Due to these nuances, it has been challenging laboratory professionals to truly define the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR and has required that negative results be interpreted in the context of the timing of the sample [24] . An example of problems faced for SAR-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is shown in Figure 2 .",

The next step was the replacement of the inactivated viral vaccine by a second vaccine based around fragments containing neutralizing epitopes that are safer and more efficacious to use.

These are thought to induce an immune reaction that is capable of stimulating an immune response. The inactivated virus was intended for use as a first-generation vaccine, this is due to the ease of generation of these inactivated viral particles. The next step was the replacement of the inactivated viral vaccine by a second vaccine based around fragments containing neutralizing epitopes that are safer and more efficacious to use. Several reports have shown that SARS-CoV-1 was inactivated with formaldehyde, UV light, and \u03b2-propiolactone which can induce virus-neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals [28] [29] [30] . \u2022 S-protein based vaccines: several recombinant based vaccines that have expressed the spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 were assessed in pre-clinical studies [31] . Reports have shown that candidate DNA vaccines encoding the spike protein stimulated an immune response. This led to the study showing that injected mice are protected for SARS-CoV-1. Wang et al. have produced higher titres of neutralizing antibodies and demonstrated that major and minor neutralizing epitopes are located in the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively [32] . Other groups also found neutralizing epitopes in the S2 subunit [33, 34] . Bisht et al. [35] have shown that intranasal or intramuscular inoculations of mice with highly attenuated Modified Vacciniavirus Ankara (MVA) vaccines encoding full-length SARS-CoV-1 S protein. This also produced neutralizing antibodies. Bukreyev et al. [36] reported that mucosal immunization of African green monkeys with an attenuated parainfluenza virus expressing S protein resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies and protected animals from infection by challenge with SARS-CoV-1. These data suggest that the S protein can induce neutralizing antibodies and protective responses in immunized animals [37] . \u2022 Vaccines based on fragments containing neutralizing epitopes: fragments that were responsible for the virus binding to receptors within a host cell were targeted. Patients and animals that became infected with SAR-CoV-1 reacted strongly to this type of vaccine. They were immunized and inactivated with a receptor-binding domain (RBD) [29, 38] . Absorption of antibodies by RBD showed the capability for removal of most of the neutralizing antibodies, RBD-specific antibodies isolated from these antisera have potent neutralizing activity [38, 39] . The immunized mice were protected from SARS-CoV-1. The antibodies purified from the antisera against SARS-CoV-1 significantly inhibited RBD binding to ACE2 [29, 38, 40, 41] . This suggested that RBD contains the major neutralizing epitopes in the S protein and is an ideal SARS vaccine candidate because RBD contains the receptor-binding site, which is critical for virus attachment to the target cell for infection [42] [43] [44] . Antibodies specific for RBD are expected to block the binding of the virus to the target cell. Therefore, RBD induces higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than those vaccines expressing the full-length S protein [31, 32, 35, 37, 43] .",

Several such MERS vaccine candidates have been developed and/or tested for efficacy in mouse models or camels [46] [47] [48] [49] . Viral vectors expressing full-length S protein of MERS-CoV induced S-specific antibody responses and/or T-cell responses in a mouse model via the intramuscular route, showed effective in vitro neutralization for MERS-CoV infection [47, 50] . Additionally, vaccination of mice with an MVA-based full-length S vaccine-elicited MERS-CoVspecific CD8+ T cell response and neutralizing antibodies, protecting mice against MERS-CoV [48, 49] . Intra-nasally or intra-muscularly administered MVA-S vaccineinduced mucosal immunity resulted in a significant reduction of excreted infectious viruses and viral RNA transcripts [45, 46] . [52] [53] [54] . While some are designed on the basis of the full-length S1 proteins [55] , the majority of them are based on viral RBD [53, 54, 56, 57] . These RBD-based vaccines are evaluated for immunogenicity and protective immunity in a number of MERS-CoV mice models. The antigenicity and functionality of these RBD proteins have also been extensively investigated. In general, subunit vaccines might not induce immune responses as strong as those induced by other vaccine types mentioned above. However, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines could be significantly promoted in the presence of an ideal adjuvant via an appropriate route [52] . In addition, it is also essential to maintain a suitable conformation of the protein antigen in the vaccine, such as the MERS-CoV RBD proteins [53, 56] . In terms of safety consideration, subunit vaccines should be accounted as the safest vaccine type. They do not contain viral genetic materials, but only include essential antigens for eliciting protective immune responses, thus excluding the possibility of recovering virulence or inducing adverse reactions [58] [59] [60] .",

Once all these steps are accomplished and satisfied, the next step will be drug development. Drug discovery and development is a time consuming and financially expensive process, mainly due to the research and development that goes into identifying this one treatment. On average, it takes around 12-15 years to develop. The average cost is around $1 billion. This figure includes the high number of failures, usually in the hundreds if not thousands: for every successful drug molecule that has gone into market. The molecule chosen is identified from around 5000-10,000 compounds that did not pass through testing [67] . The process of drug development and discovery requires a high amount of resources from the best scientific minds, to highly equipped labs and technologies.

Many previous projects researched into the original SARS virus, which was present in 2003. These projects came to a halt as the previous virus killed only 800 people and infected a small population. Earlier research showed that the spike proteins exhibited particular interest for targeting, via a vaccine, therefore giving scientists a foundation to work on.",

The billions of dollars invested was not for just research, but also for companies to manufacture these whilst research was being undertaken, as companies were taking the high risk, high investment, high reward approach towards finding a vaccine for COVID-19.

Nevertheless, this may come at a cost. The speed of vaccine development can have adverse effects, resulting in long-term studies and years of post-vaccine treatment. However, as is the case with most treatments, the benefits outweigh the risks and far more people-and to greater extent countries-need the vaccine, as economies have taken large hits, with livelihoods being crippled. With families losing a large number of relatives due to the virus, this vaccination is capable of restoring quality of life to hundreds of millions if not billions of people worldwide. The vaccination may have come more rapidly than normal, but could well be justified due to the reasons explained in this review. This vaccine will have a long-term effect on how research is viewed and can be undertaken for new vaccinations and other treatments. New strategies have been learned and have enhanced the effectiveness of processes within the research models for future therapies, finally speeding up potential treatments or therapies from being an interesting agent to being administered to the patient.

Nanoparticles containing MERS-CoV full-length S proteins can be prepared and purified from pellets of infected baculovirus insect cells. In the absence of adjuvants, these nanoparticles induced a lower level of MERS-CoV producing antibodies in mice. While in the presence of adjuvants, such as aluminium hydroxide (Alum) or Matrix M1, such antibodies were significantly increased and maintained. Thus, adjuvants are required for MERS nanoparticle vaccines and different adjuvants function differently in promoting the immunogenicity of these vaccines[45].\u2022 DNA-based MERS vaccine: Like the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-1, DNA encoding full-length S protein of MERS-CoV is utilized to develop MERS vaccines [31,51]. Indeed, intramuscular injections of mice with a synthetic DNA encoding full-length of MERS-CoV elicited potent virus-neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses, as represented by the secretion of INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and/or IL-2 cytokines in CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells, as well as the production of antibodies in immunized camels. \u2022 Subunit MERS vaccines: Protein-based subunit vaccines against MERS-CoV have been developed",
