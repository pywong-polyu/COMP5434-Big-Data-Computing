Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results.",

Though we tried to consider the influence of conformations and pockets in the D3Docking module, it is very difficult to comprehensively and precisely predict all the possible conformations and druggable pockets in a structural-based approach using molecular docking, and thus may lead to false negative prediction. Moreover, a few other docking platforms and computational tools have been developed and reported for the treatment of COVID-19. For example, COVID-19 Docking Server predicts the binding modes between COVID-19 targets and the ligands [11] . Shennong carries out structure-based virtual screening for COVID-19 using FDA approved drugs and drugs that are currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials as the library [12] . MolAICal supplies a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease [13] . Virus-CKB applies pharmacologytarget mapping to rapidly predict the FDA-approved drugs [14] and a network-based approach has been developed for drug repurposing [15] . However, there is no platform to predict target, perform virtual screening and discover drug candidates for COVID-19 with a ligand-based approach. Therefore, developing another parallel approach for target identification and virtual screening is necessary as an alternative to the structure-based scheme. Active compounds against coronavirus could serve as the starting points for a ligand-based scheme.",

Tanshinones, which are a series of natural products derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, were reported as inhibitors against the 3C-like and papain-like proteases of SARS-CoV [17] , with one of the compounds in this series exhibiting nanomolar level activity (IC 50 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M) against the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV. Several FDA approved drugs, including chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide and lopinavir [18] , showed in vitro activity in the inhibition of MERS-CoV replication at low-micromolar level (3-8 \u00b5M) . For the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, compounds represented by remdesivir and chloroquine [19] have demonstrated promising based on their in vitro or in vivo bioactivity. Dexamethasone, a type of corticosteroid medication, has been found to reduce the 28-day mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 [20] .

All currently reported active compounds against coronavirus and their potential targets are included in the D3Similarity database in order to discover more effective compounds against COVID-19. Representative active compounds and targets in the database are shown in Table 2 . ICV272 [24] was designed and synthesized targeting main protease that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription [25] . ICV272 showed good pharmacokinetic properties in vivo and low toxicity, suggesting that it is a promising drug candidate. The requisite roles of papain-like protease suggest that papain-like protease is an attractive target for antiviral drugs [26, 27] . ICV357 [28, 29] acts as a noncovalent competitive inhibitor of papain-like protease by inducing a conformational change. Natural compound ICV394 [30] potently inhibits the SARS-CoV helicase protein in vitro by affecting the ATPase activity. Remdesivir (ICV397) has been recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [19, 31] . The above compounds exert antiviral effects by acting on the protein targets of the coronavirus. In addition, host targets also play a very important role in the invasion of coronaviruses into organisms. In addition to its importance in regulation of hypertension, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated to be a target for the coronavirus [32] . ICV407 [33] inhibits SARS-CoV by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with ACE2. As the COVID-19 continues, active compounds against SARS-CoV-2 have been continuously reported. For example, Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) [34] was considered as drug target for SARS-CoV-2 treatment [35] . The DHODH Inhibitor ICV617 is a highly potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication (EC 50 = 1.96 nM) [36] . ICV618 can prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 as an inhibitor of PIKfyve kinase (IC 50 = 10 nM) [37] . Besides, ICV402 [38] , ICV416 [39] and ICV421 [40] also have potential bioactivity against coronavirus. Active compounds against coronavirus in D3Similarity provide useful leads for the discovery of antivirals that could prevent SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related infections and may also become a useful tool for studying fundamental mechanisms of compound.",

For target prediction, a graphical interface for user is shown in Figure 3 . We recommend that the users submit the input structure in common file formats such as mol2 or sdf to ensure the input file could be well handled by D3Similarity. Usually the evaluation of molecular similarity between the submitted molecule and those in the database would last for several minutes after the beginning of the calculation before the output result is returned, in which the information of the molecular structures and associated targets for top-ranking ligands will be provided on the webpage. The targets for top-ranking ligands are predicted potential targets for the submitted molecule. For example, human histamine N-methyltransferase, 3C-like protease and papain-like protease were predicted to be the top three potential targets of chloroquine, among which 3C-like protease was reported recently based on in vitro results [41, 42] . For virtual screening, a similar graphical interface as shown in Figure 4 is also provided. In this module, the users must provide the input database file in sdf or mol2 format to guarantee the program could correctly split different molecules out of the input database. Usually the calculation would last for several minutes for each molecule in the input database, and thus, the total running time would depend on the size of the input database. In the output result, molecules in the input database would be labeled as 'MOL_1', 'MOL_2', . . . based on the order in which they appear in the input file. By default, the results would be ranked by molecular similarity between the input compounds and the database ligands.",

In the 'top 10' targets of the similarity evaluation result, papain-like protease also accounts for a larger proportion for its reported inhibitors (Figure 6a -c) compared with that for other molecules (Figure 6d-f) . What's more, in general, in both the case studies, the usage of the '2D \u00d7 3D' scheme to rank the molecular similarity yielded better results than using either 2D similarity score or 3D similarity score alone, suggesting that the 2D and 3D score may complement each other after the multiplication. Thus, we recommend the users to employ the '2D \u00d7 3D' scheme as the default ranking scheme for molecular similarity.",

Virtual screening is a highly efficient approach to find potential antivirals, while identifying the potential targets is of great importance for understanding the bioactivity mechanism of both nowexisting and to-be-developed molecules against the coronavirus infection. On the basis of the previously reported D3Targets-2019-nCoV web server, which has already been embedded with a structure-based module named D3Docking, we released in this study the ligand-based module, termed as D3Similarity, which utilizes the molecular similarity evaluation with bioactive molecules with known targets or/and well-explored mechanism. 604 molecules were included in the ligand-based database and will be updated regularly. In the evaluation of different ranking methods, when applying the product of 2D similarity score and 3D similarity score (2D \u00d7 3D) to rank the results, D3Similarity correctly predicted the target of the inhibitors of 3C-like and papain proteases and outperformed the ranking results using either 2D similarity score or 3D similarity score alone. These observations demonstrated D3Similarity should be a complementary approach to docking-based methods for virtual screening and target identification of potential coronavirus antivirals. We hope this ligand-based module would be helpful to the drug development against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.
