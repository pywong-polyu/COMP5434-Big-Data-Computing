During crises like COVID-19, digitalization can facilitate the reception of remittances from relatives and friends. We analyze the effects of migrant remittances (MRs) on economic growth in ECOWAS countries with a special emphasis on the role of digitalization. The simultaneous equations and the seemingly unrelated regression method are used with data spanning from 1980 to 2017. Findings show that digitization is not a channel for transmitting the effects of MRs on economic growth in ECOWAS countries. However, digitalization constitutes a catalyst of the effects of MRs on economic growth in non-WAEMU countries, while it does not in WAEMU (a sub-regional block of ECOWAS). Nevertheless, remittances contribute to human capital accumulation, investment, and consumption in WAEMU countries. Policies aiming at strengthening digitization are welcome to foster the effect of MRs on countries' economies in ECOWAS, in general, and WAEMU in particular.",

Thus, according to Djajic (1986) , the transfers of remittances from migrants improve not only the wellbeing of the direct beneficiaries but also those who do not have relatives abroad. Indeed, migrant remittances can increase the level of consumption of the beneficiaries through their use for household consumption goods and consequently boost economic activity (Romano and Traverso 2020; Wagle 2016) . When invested, these funds can improve the level of domestic investment and, when used for the education (Jang 2019) , can increase the accumulation of human capital. Thus, the wellbeing of populations not benefiting from these funds improves through their external effects on investment and human capital accumulation.",

Migrant remittances promote increases in human capital, education spending, investment, and entrepreneurship (Melvin 2019; Jang 2019; Tsegai 2007; World Bank 2006) . When invested, migrant remittances can contribute to poverty reduction as they contribute to growth; and can create a considerable multiplier on output (Ratha 2005; Gupta et al. 2007; Fullenkamp et al. 2008) . Furthermore, migrant remittances represent the most important contribution of the diaspora to the development of the countries of departure (Romano and Traverso 2020; Zimmermann 2017) and they even today exceed public aid and foreign direct investment for many countries (Sobiech 2019; Zimmermann 2017) . Thus, the global amount of migrant remittances has reached US$431.6 billion and is the largest source of external finance for many developing countries (Clemens and McKenzie 2014) . This is the case of ECOWAS countries, since 1990. For instance, migrant remittance represented only about 2.61% of GDP, or US$45 million in 1990 while they reached US$1.88 billion in 2016. Referring to the traditional sources of finance, the migrant remittances represent about 7.79% of GDP in 2016, while official development assistance and foreign direct investment were estimated only at US$768 million and US$822 million, respectively, for all ECOWAS countries (WDI 2020) .",

Moreover, despite the importance given to digitalization technologies through the access to the internet in economic development as stated by African Union Agenda 2063 and SDGs (through Goal 17), the economic growth of ECOWAS countries is lagging behind. Indeed, a comparison between certain regions of the world shows that 44.95% of the population have access to the internet in ECOWAS against 12.08% in middle-income countries and 41.63% in high-income countries from 1980 to 2017 (WDI 2020). During the same period, middle-income countries came out on top in terms of average economic growth rate which was 2.73%; followed by high-income countries (1.62%), then ECOWAS countries (0.87%) while the standard for achieving the sustainable development goal is at least 7%. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of migrant remittances on the economic growth of ECOWAS countries with particular emphasis on the role of digitalization. Specifically, the aim is to analyze the effect of migrant remittances on economic growth, consumption, human capital, and investment, and finally to examine the moderating effect of digitalization and migrant remittances on economic growth through digitalization in ECOWAS.",

            "text": "The contribution of this article to the economic literature is empirical. Indeed, it can be observed that the crucial role of digitalization is largely ignored or rarely taken into account in the economic literature on the contribution of migrant remittances to economic growth particularly in countries with low financial inclusion, including the ECOWAS region. Most work analyses the effect of migrant remittances on economic growth through investment (Rocher and Pelletier 2008; World Bank 2006) , human capital (Mim and Mabrouk 2014; Mim and Ali 2012) , financial development (Sobiech 2019; Nyamongo et al. 2012) , and consumption (Romano and Traverso 2020; Rocher and Pelletier 2008; World Bank 2006) . Moreover, no study has simultaneously examined the role of digitalization in facilitating migrant remittances and their effect on economic growth, consumption, human capital, and investment. Yet, in times of crisis, digitalization, including mobile banking, can facilitate the receipt of remittances to relatives and friends. This can help reduce the likelihood of the vulnerable population falling into poverty. Pesando et al. (2021) found that migration is widely explained by the population's access to the internet. Internet access can be a key information channel in the development of migration policies. In the context of a health crisis such as COVID-19, digitalized payment can not only limit the spread of the pandemic but also improve the efficiency of governments and aid agencies with a significant reduction in transaction costs. The role of digital technologies, as channels for the transmission of migrant remittances, in stimulating financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa seems to be completely ignored in the economic literature. This article fills this gap by focusing on ECOWAS countries that have been part of a dynamic of economic and monetary integration for several decades.",

Stahl and Arnold (1986) reveal that MRs can have an important multiplier effect even if they are used for consumption. According to Mundaca (2009) , the positive effect of MRs becomes stronger when financial development is taken into account. Rocher and Pelletier (2008) argue that a large share of these funds is generally spent on current consumption while a smaller share is saved or invested.

These funds, invested in human capital, can increase the rate of emigration when distortion of the labor market in the country of origin is observed. Chami et al. (2005) argue that these funds can lead to the appreciation of the currency of the recipient country with adverse effects on economic growth. Rapoport (2017) corroborates this idea when he argues that MRs leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate of the local currency and, thus, weaken the competitiveness of the domestic economy. A study by Chami et al. (2005) show that remittances contribute negatively to economic growth in 113 developing countries. Moreover, due to the lack of childcare for migratory reasons of the parents, MRs can negatively affect children's education (Jang 2019; Hanson and Woodruff 2003; McKenzie and Rapoport 2010) . According to advocates of the neutrality of the effect of remittances on economic growth (Eckstein 2004; Rao and Hassan 2012; Senbeta 2013) , the level of financial development and the investment climate play an important role in the effect of MRs on economic growth. Rao and Hassan (2012) and Senbeta (2013) point out that the effect MRs on economic growth may be nil but these funds can affect economic growth through certain channels, including investment, financial development, total factor productivity, the real exchange rate, and output volatility.",

Similar results were found in India by Sutradhar (2020) ; in Rwanda by the study of Kadozi (2019) .

For him, the more developed a country is, the weaker, the effect of remittances on economic growth. The same method enabled Mim and Mabrouk (2014) to conclude that MRs have a positive and significant effect on children's schooling, enabling low-income households to finance their children's schooling. Human capital is also an important channel for transmitting the effect of these funds. In the same context, the work of Mim and Ali (2012) reveals that MRs have a positive impact on consumption, investment, and economic growth. They conclude that these funds have an effective effect on economic growth through human capital approximated by the gross enrollment rate in secondary education. Yang (2004) shows that by improving education, MRs can reduce child labor. Based on a co-integration relationship, Chnaina and Makhlouf (2015) show that a 1% increase in the ratio of MRs to GDP causes an equilibrium real exchange rate appreciation of 0.39% in Tunisia, and therefore, confirm the hypothesis of Dutch disease. On the other hand, an autoregressive model allowed Brahim et al. (2018) to show that an increase in MRs leads to a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate in the MENA region. However, Chami et al. (2005) , as well as Piracha et al. (2006) , find that remittances do not contribute to economic growth.",

These results are similar to those of Nyamongo et al. (2012) who found that MRs are complement of financial development in 36 African countries from 1980 to 2009. Adams and Klobodu (2016) use the generalized method of moments and show that MRs do not have robust effects on economic growth in 33 sub-Saharan African countries from 1970 to 2012. Unlike Adams and Klobodu (2016) a positive relationship between MRs and economic growth in SSA countries has been found by Lartey (2013) by using the same method. Although Pesando et al. (2021) link the internet as digitalization proxy to international mobility, they do not tackle the potential moderating effect of digitalization and migrants remittances on economic growth. Even if rare works have try to link the improvement of digitalization technologies to migration (Pesando et al. 2021 ) and the inflow of remittances in BRICS (Emara and Zhang, 2021) , the results revealed a non-linear relationship and there is a need of more investigation in other regions including ECOWAS. Broadly, the above empirical literature does not specifically address the effect of MRs on economic growth through digitalization, even though this relationship is crucial for much-needed financial inclusion and better orientation of migration policies. This paper aims at filling these gaps.",

Z it is the vector of the other variables used in the model and E it the error term. MRs can have a positive effect (Bettin and Zazzaro 2012), a negative effect (Chami et al. 2005) , or a neutral effect (Senbeta 2013) on economic growth. Digitalization (INT) is approximated by the percentage of the population with access to the internet (Emara and Zhang 2021; Myovella et al. 2020; Habibi and Zabardast 2020) . According to Myovella et al. (2020) and Habibi and Zabardast (2020) , digitalization positively affects economic growth. Internet access promotes trade and the transmission of the knowledge with positive effects on economic development. Investment is represented by gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in the percentage of GDP. Solow (1956) shows that investment makes a positive contribution to growth. Human capital stock (KH) is measured by the gross enrollment ratio in secondary education. It stimulates economic growth (Romer 1986 ) to the extent that large human capital can translate into significant productive capacity through externalities and contribute to economic growth. Household final consumption expenditure per inhabitants (CONSO) can also have a positive effect on economic growth because of the economic activity that can be boosted through increased consumption according to Keynesian theory.",

Foreign direct investment (FDI) represents net inflows relative to GDP. FDI can promote economic development through investment. Used by Sobiech (2019), access to a telephone (TELE), measured as a percentage of the population with access to mobile phones, can stimulate economic growth. The population growth rate (TCPOP) can contribute negatively to economic growth to the extent that increased population growth reduces real GDP per capita. The terms-of-trade index (ITE) can significantly affect economic growth (Brueckner and Carneiro 2017) . It is calculated as the percentage ratio of export unit value index to import unit value index, relative to the base year 2000. The interaction variable of MRs and access to the internet ( MRs it * INT ) makes it possible to verify the effect of MRs on economic growth through digitalization. Equation (1) then becomes:",

GDP is supposed to have a positive effect on investment according to the accelerator theory. Trade openness is the sum of imports and exports relative to GDP. It can have positive effects on investment since trade openness can help attract foreign direct investment. Human capital is measured by the gross enrollment ratio in secondary education.

The inflation rate can negatively affect consumption since the increase in the prices of goods and services reduces the purchasing power of households. Real GDP per capita should make a positive contribution to household final consumption because an increase in income leads, all other things being equal, to an increase in household final consumption. The rate of population growth may reduce household final consumption to the extent that an increase in population that is not proportional to the increase in wealth reduces the share of consumption expenditure.

Because of the non-cylindrical nature of panel data, the appropriate unit root test is that of Maddala and Wu (1999) . The results show that all variables are stationary at the level (Table 1 ). In the structural model (6), some dependent variables influence each other, so the residuals of the equations may be dependent over (Roodman 2009; Ahn et al. 2001 ) but also presents the results equation-by-equation (Roodman 2009 ). Moreover, when the panels present the non-cylindrical data and small in size, as the case in this paper, GMM estimators are biased and inconsistent, as argued by Flannery and Hankins (2013) . Indeed, when the panel size is small, the lag of the dependent variable is very persistent, and the instruments are of poor quality (Blundell and Bond 1998) . The use of the lag variable of DGP as an exogenous variable is, therefore, needed. In the framework of this article, the SUR method is the most appropriate estimation technique to be used. A test on the differences in the means of the selected variables shows a heterogeneity between the countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and those in non-WAEMU (a sub-regional group within the ECO-WAS region). After presenting the results for all ECOWAS countries, the sample is divided into two sub-groups (WAEMU and non-WAEMU) to further exploration on the role of digitalization in the effects of MRs on economic growth within theses sub-regional groups of ECOWAS.",

The Gross fixed capital formation, the final household consumption per capita, and the terms-of-trade index positively affect economic growth at 1% level in ECOWAS countries. In contrast, trade openness and population growth rate negatively affect economic growth in ECOWAS. The model with interaction variables revealed that digitalization have positive effect on economic growth while negatively affecting households' consumption in ECOWAS countries. The positive effect of the access to internet on economic growth in ECOWAS is similar to the results obtained by Myovella et al. (2020) for Sub-Saharan African and OECD countries and by Habibi and Zabardast (2020) for Middle Eastern and OECD countries. However, migrant remittance have positive and significant effect on economic growth in ECOWAS (Table 4 ). The positive effect of remittances on economic growth in ECOWAS countries is similar to the results obtained by Kadozi (2019) for the case of Rwanda, Abduvaliev and Bustillo (2020) for the Commonwealth of the Independent States of the Post-Soviet Republic, and Sutradhar (2020) for the case study of India. The remittances received could contribute to consumption (Romano and Traverso 2020; Wagle 2016; Tsegai 2007 ) and investment to boost economic activity (Melvin 2019) and, therefore, result in a positive effect on the economic growth of these countries. The moderate effect of digitalization show that digitalization is not a channel of the effect of migrants' remittances on economic growth in ECOWAS countries. ECOWAS, as part of the Sub-Saharan African sub-region, has low access to digitalization, and the development of digitalization policies as an engine of economic growth is needed to reduce the transaction cost of migrants' remittances. The human capital equation shows that remittances from migrants have no statistical effect on the gross enrollment rate in secondary education in ECOWAS (Table 4 ). This could be explained by the fact that remittances are used for other purposes and are not invested in human capital accumulation in ECOWAS. The rate of economic growth has a positive impact on human capital in ECOWAS since, as a country becomes wealthier, it can invest more in training with positive spillovers on capital accumulation. However, the labor force negatively affects human capital in ECOWAS. While migrant remittances and human capital contribute negatively to gross fixed capital formation, trade openness and access to credit positively affect gross fixed capital formation (Table 4 ). Mim and Ali (2012) found controversial results of the effect of MRs on investment. The negative effect of MRs on gross fixed capital formation can be explained by the fact that MRs can finance domestic development projects and, thus, gradually replace traditional investment in ECO-WAS countries. Bettin and Zazzaro (2012) then suggest that MRs may constitute an alternative source of financing productive investments for economic growth. In the same vein, Giuliano and Ruiz-Aranz (2009) argue that MRs can substitute for traditional sources of finance when the latter fails. For them, credit constraints are lifted if financial security is well developed.",

Household final consumption, gross fixed capital formation, and the terms-of-trade index contribute positively to economic growth in WAEMU as in ECOWAS. The elasticity of trade openness also has the same negative sign. In the WAEMU, migrant remittances (MRs) and economic growth contribute positively to human capital accumulation (Table 6 ). Benhamou and Cassin (2021 ), Sami and Fatma (2014 ), and Yang (2004 obtained the same results for the positive effect of MRs on human capital. These results suggest that in WAEMU countries, the increase in MRs improves human capital through the schooling of children. The results also revealed that human capital and economic growth rate negatively affect the gross fixed capital formation while remittances, trade openness, and credit to the private sector contributed positively to the gross fixed capital formation ( Table 6 ). The effect of migrant remittances on investment in the WAEMU is similar to the results obtained by Mim and Ali (2012) and Rocher and Pelletier (2008) . Indeed, an increase in migrant remittances translates into an improvement in the level of investment in the WAEMU. MRs and the economic growth rate have also contributed positively to households' consumption, while the population growth rate and access to the internet negatively affect final household consumption in the WAEMU (Table 6 ). The positive effect of migrant remittances on consumption in the WAEMU confirms that a large share of these funds is used for consumption purposes. Mim and Ali (2012) found that remittances have a positive impact on consumption. Rocher and Pelletier (2008) reported that a large share of remittances is used for households' consumption. Indeed, some developing countries have not yet reached an income of $1.9 per day to promote consumption. Under these conditions, migrant remittances appear to be an effective solution for supporting household consumption. In contrast to the WAEMU countries, the results show that migrant remittances negatively affect economic growth in non-WAEMU countries (Table 7) . However, household final consumption, trade openness, and access to the telephone have contributed positively to economic growth in non-WAEMU countries ( Table 7) . The positive effect of using telephones on economic growth in non-WAEMU countries is similar to the results obtained by Myovella et al. (2020) for Sub-Saharan African countries and OECD countries, and by Habibi and Zabardast (2020) for Middle Eastern countries and OECD countries. Non-WAEMU countries characterized by the low-tech, have more opportunities to develop digitalization as an engine of economic growth.",

Thus, this paper aims to analyze the role of digitalization in transmitting the effect of migrants' remittances on economic growth in Table 7 (continued) ECOWAS countries. It also examines the effect of remittances on human capital, investment, and consumption in ECOWAS. The SUR method based on a simultaneous equation model was used for this purpose on 15 ECOWAS countries over the period from 1980 to 2017. The results show that MFTs have a positive effect on economic growth in ECOWAS. We found that digitization is not a transmission channel for the effect of migrant remittances on economic growth in ECOWAS. The disparities between WAEMU and non-WAEMU countries (two sub-regional groups of ECOWAS) in terms of remittances were found. The results revealed that unlike the non-WAEMU countries, migrant remittances positively influence economic growth in WAEMU. They also contribute to human capital accumulation, investment, and consumption in the WAEMU. Except for the WAEMU zone, this paper concludes that digitalization is a catalyst for the effect of migrant remittances on economic growth. In terms of economic policies, migrant remittances are encouraged to stimulate economic development in ECOWAS. In the WAEMU zone, these funds should be channeled to human capital and investment. In allocating migrant remittances to human capital, ECOWAS countries should support policies to enhance digitalization to foster the effect of migrant remittances on economic development.",
