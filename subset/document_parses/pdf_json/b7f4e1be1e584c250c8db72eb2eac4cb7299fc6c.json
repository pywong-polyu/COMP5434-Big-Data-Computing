Seroprevalence was ~60% in three geographic regions, and only lower in Doha East at 43%. This is to our knowledge the first such evidence for herd immunity, or being near herd immunity, in a majority segment of the population in any country. This conclusion is supported by the fact that no major infection cluster has been identified in any CMW community in Qatar for several months up to end of 2020, despite the progressive easing of the social and physical distancing restrictions since June 15, 2020 [27] . Meanwhile, large clusters of infection were common in such CMW communities before, around, and shortly after the epidemic peak towards the end of May,",

This outcome agrees with findings of two other studies from Qatar where the infection severity rate has been estimated at 0.25% (95% CI: 0.11-0.49%) based on antibody and/or PCR laboratory-confirmed infections [10] , and at 0.37% (95% CI: 0.37-0.38%) based on mathematical modeling of the epidemic in the total population [33]-compared to 0.50% (95% CI: 0.22-0.99%) in this study. These rates are substantially lower than those estimated elsewhere [34] , often using early epidemic data, possibly because of insufficient accounting for the large denominator of undiagnosed asymptomatic or mild infections in young persons. These rates are also unlikely to be explained by lower co-morbidity levels as disease conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are at relatively high prevalence in Qatar [35] [36] [37] [38] , comparable to what is seen in developed nations.",

This outcome supports that most infections were asymptomatic or minimally mild to be diagnosed, in line with findings of a PCR community survey conducted earlier in Qatar in which 58.5% of those PCR positive reported no symptoms in the two weeks preceding the survey [7] . Another finding of the present study is that reporting of two or more symptoms was predictive of PCR positivity, but not reporting of only one symptom (table 2) , a similar finding to that of the earlier PCR community survey [7] . Lastly, a high proportion of those testing PCR positive had a Ct value >30, suggesting that nearly half of the PCR-positive CMWs may have acquired their infection 2-6 weeks earlier, given the common presence of prolonged PCR positivity in infected persons [25, 26] .",

To ensure representation of small age-nationality strata (such as younger persons of specific nationalities), towards the end of the study, all attendees in these strata (not only every 4 th attendee) were approached to participate. Operational challenges made it also difficult to track and maintain consistent logs of the response rate by the nurses in these QRCS centers, thus an exact estimate of the response rate could not be ascertained, though it A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 13 was estimated at >90% for antibody testing and at >70% for PCR testing.

Nevertheless, these limitations may have introduced selection bias for specifically the assessed PCR positivity prevalence and infection severity rate towards higher values, as participants may still have attended at the QRCS centers because of current-infection symptoms.",

Factoring the less-than-perfect sensitivity and specificity [49] would have increased the measured antibody-positivity prevalence to 58.1% instead of 55.3%. History of SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospitalization, and death was extracted through linking participants\" records to the national, centralized, and fully-integrated digital health information platforms, and thus it is unlikely that cases/events were missed.
