The impact of COVID-19 on fellowship training is pervasive, but to varying degrees regarding clinical duties, including call, inpatient service, and outpatient visits, and research activity. Restrictions regarding in-person clinical work was nearly universal, and new models and methods have been utilized for engaging fellows in inpatient work with less physical contact with patients and colleagues including outpatient encounters using telehealth and learning using virtual conferences and online resources. Research activity in bench-based and clinical research has been restricted for most programs.
