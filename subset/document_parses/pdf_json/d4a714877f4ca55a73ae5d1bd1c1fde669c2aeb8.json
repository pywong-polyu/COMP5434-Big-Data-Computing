Similarly, the number of patients with onset date t-2 and for whom onset dates were not available was estimated as f(2)N t . Therefore, the total number of patients for whom the onset date was not available, given an onset date of s, was estimated as \u03a3 k=1 f(k)N s +k for the long duration extending from s.
