A just society responds to a serious threat to the well-being of its people such as a viral pandemic to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the well-being of its members. This creates identifiable societal obligations which are discharged by the institutions and individuals within society that are situated to do so. There are therefore identifiable obligations resting on various societal institutions, such as government, churches, schools, and corporate institutions, as well as obligations resting on individuals. Should an institution or individual fail to act in ways consistent with these social obligations, they perpetrate an injustice on society and its members.",

A pandemic such as COVID-19 threatens the well-being of people in unique and serious ways. This means that society has a justice obligation to respond to the pandemic and to protect the well-being of people against its impact. Society's obligations rest on those institutions and individuals within society that are appropriately placed to discharge these obligations. A threat like the pandemic is so large and consequential that it takes collective action on a societal scale to combat and overcome it. This places obligations on all institutions and individuals within society to respond to the pandemic.",

According to this theory, a just society ensures for its members a minimum level of well-being as measured across six different dimensions: health, self-determination, security, reasoning, respect, and attachment. A life devoid of any of these components is not flourishing. Each of these components seem necessary to any conception of the good; they are things that everyone is presumed to want, whatever else they want. On this theory, society is to establish the kind of social environment that would allow people to reach a sufficient amount of well-being as measured by the six dimensions. Society is also to monitor and react to threats to well-being, things that may cause people to fall below sufficient levels on any of the dimensions. The theory shares much in common with another prominent contemporary justice theory, the capabilities approach of Nussbaum and Sen, which would lead to similar conclusions about the just society protecting the capabilities needed to achieve well-being (Nussbaum 2003; Nussbaum 2011; Sen 1985) .",

But I should note that this premise can also be grounded by reference to other prominent theories of justice, so that this premise would stand even if you are persuaded by a different theory of justice. Take Rawls' theory of justice (Rawls 1971) . Rawls puts forward a conception of justice that is egalitarian: the goods of life should be equally distributed, and unequal distributions can only be seen as just if it works to the advantage of the least well-off in society. The goods of life refer to those things that are neutral between conceptions of the good, that everyone is presumed to need. There is an overt focus on how well someone is doing: the least well-off in society form a benchmark for the fairness of the distribution of the goods of life. This clearly places the focus on flourishing or well-being. If there is a way to improve the wellbeing of the worst-off, justice demands that society do so. Daniels examines the implications of Rawls' theory for health, arguing that healthcare has special moral importance from the perspective of justice (Daniels 1985; Daniels 2007) . Rawls' theory is concerned with equality of opportunity to access the goods of life. Healthcare protects and promotes the health of people, thereby promoting fair access to opportunities for individuals. It is therefore straightforward to see that a just society is concerned with well-being, and that when the worst-off can be made better-off, society has a justice obligation to intervene.",

            "text": "A strict libertarian theory of justice is concerned with the maximum freedom for individuals that can also be compatible with the same freedom for everyone else (Nozick 1974; Sandel 2009 ). The focus of the theory is on individual liberty, with defined liberty-limiting principles meant to safeguard overall liberty. Libertarians typically are in favour of limited government and frown on paternalism. But even here, one can see arguments that a just society protects the well-being of its members. First, consider the harm principle, a libertylimiting principle articulated by Mill. The actions and choices of individuals and actions of institutions that make up the social fabric are not permissible when such actions lead to harm to others, and society should intervene to prevent such harm. Harm refers to a setback to interests, which is to negatively affect someone's wellbeing. Thus, society is attentive to the well-being of its members, and has obligations to act against actions or components of the social fabric that set back the wellbeing of its members. Second, consider the ways in which well-being is needed to ensure liberty. If someone's well-being is negatively impacted, it restricts their options severely. The dead, the sick, those suffering under the effects of a pandemic-they are not free. They can't decide what to do with their lives or pursue the good as they see it. They are consumed by the restrictions placed on them by illness and by getting through the suffering of the pandemic. Well-being, it turns out, is a necessary platform that acts as springboard for liberty. A society that sees liberty as the focus of justice should also be concerned with promoting the well-being that enables liberty in the first place.",

The ability to interact with others and form or maintain attachments are affected. Ultimately, liberty and self-determination also become affected as people become constrained by fear of disease, loss of functioning, and fraying of the social fabric. These would result from natural behaviour to avoid getting sick but would also follow from social distancing practices meant to minimize the pandemic.

            "text": "Let us consider this by reference to the example of racism. 1 Racism subjugates the well-being of an entire group of people because of unjust discrimination. Racist discrimination could decrease access to jobs and income, educational opportunities, and healthcare, and ultimately decrease the scope for self-determination. To protect well-being against racism requires cooperation from society's institutions and members. Government should enforce policy and regulations that prohibit racism. Business should act in ways that remove racist discrimination from business practices. Healthcare systems and educational systems should ensure fair access for those who have been excluded due to racism. Individual people are obligated to refrain from racist discrimination, treat each other with respect, and support societal policies and actions that stamp out racism. To deal with an affront to justice like racism takes the collective effort of all of society. It is not just a problem for government to address; it is no good for government to set a policy against racism if many people in society continue to discriminate based on race or if businesses find creative ways around anti-racism laws. To achieve justice, those on whom society's obligations rest should work together. 2 Ultimately, the lines between institutions and individuals blur-institutions are made up of individuals, and actions and decisions by individual people or groups of people fashion and shape the societal structure. A just society results from just actions by society's members and society's institutions in response to the moral claims placed on them by justice. 1 In a similar vein, Powers and Faden present arguments about how the dimension of wellbeing called respect place obligations on various components of society (Powers and Faden 2006, 22-24, 89-90, 191-193) . 2 I've argued a similar point elsewhere, defending a similar premise that society's obligations rest on those individuals and institutions that are so placed to discharge these obligations (Bester 2018) . In that paper, I examined the distribution of vaccination obligations within a just society given the focus of justice as well-being. There I concluded that measles vaccination is owed to children and that the obligation to vaccinate rests on identifiable institutions and individuals within society.",

For instance, the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which complicates case identification, and no vaccine or effective treatment exists (He 2020; Parodi and Liu 2020) . But importantly, the initial response in some countries (for example, the United States) also meant that the usual methods of containment were not employed early enough to have any hope of their being successful (Abutaleb et al. 2020; Beggin 2020; Ray 2020; Shear et al. 2020; Sommer 2020) . Testing was delayed and inadequate. Communication of preventive actions such as washing of hands and wearing of masks was delayed.
