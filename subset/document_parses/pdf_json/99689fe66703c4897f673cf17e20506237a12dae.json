Contradictory orders were flying fast and furious, more inclined to the political ideologies of the incumbent administration, rather than a response to an apolitical disease. Morning orders were rescinded by the evening, thereby not only confusing, but demoralizing, the entire workforce, who as such were dealing with the uncertainties of an, yet not well-known, enemy.",

We are still lucky that even though the disease is ravaging in the urban areas, it has largely spared the rural hinterland, but I fear it may not be for long, and at which stage, the deficiencies of the primary healthcare infrastructure in terms of primary health centres, community health centres and district hospitals will be exposed further. Already, there are signs that the government is waking up to this realisation and the sooner it does, the better it shall be for the future of the country.",

Instead of realising this fact and embracing the private sector with an all-encompassing hug, the government has always treated the latter with suspicion, disdain and a 'carrot-stick' policy. Successive governments have tried to reign and subjugate it through oppressive legislations and archaic regulations. This attitude needs to be changed and profit, albeit reasonable, should be accepted as ethical, moral and in fact a necessity for a vibrant and effective private healthcare system, to meet the health needs of the society. Crushing private sector at the altar of the socio-political agenda of the incumbent political dispensation is going to be to the disadvantage of all stakeholders, and last but not the least the government itself.",

Necessity is the mother of invention and a lot of bright minds, either by design or by default, developed new processes and technologies during the COVID-19 outbreak. Sure enough some of them will fall by the wayside, but at least some and more meaningful ones will continue to survive even after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, either because of the value they have demonstrated, or maybe even because of necessity. Connectivity in India has improved following the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) roll-out and Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) support through provisioning of free satellite time for public health initiatives. Technologies can now be leveraged, not only for diagnostics but also for healthcare delivery with successful models in South Indian states delivering intensive care through Tele intensive care units (ICUs) and ophthalmology services, specially for diabetic retinopathy, being delivered in rural areas through mobile care units. Thus, tele-medicine and tele-consultations would, in all likelihood, become a norm in the future. Remote sensing and monitoring and point-of-care testing would decongest the bursting at the seams tertiary care hospitals. For a lot of diseases and illnesses, for which we always believed that patient care in a secondary or tertiary care hospital was mandatory, domiciliary care and conservative management have dawned as an effective alternative. The flattening of curve in Delhi, and available infrastructure not stretching itself, was achieved entirely with the realisation that 'Domiciliary quarantine' was as effective as 'Institutional quarantine'. Even 'Analytics' to change 'Big data' into action and value-driven partnership of industry with physicians is the need of the day.",

All the routine vaccination programmes have taken a back seat. Schools are closed and the midday meal programmes are suspended.
