The necessary prerequisite is a criminal offense by a person with a mental disorder or illness that diminishes his/her criminal responsibility (1) . These patients are then treated with an aim to improve their mental health condition and concurrently protect the public from possible imminent harm. In some cases, treatment requires extended time as there is a public safety concern when recidivism risk is not sufficiently reduced. Increased attention is drawn to PT prolongation because disproportionately extended stays in forensic facilities can lead to human rights violations and the lack of respect for patients' autonomy (2) . The legal requirement of \"proportionality\" of PT as a criminal sanction is contained in European and Czech law (3, 4) . The cause for the prolongation of PT are unknown because PT duration is more or less stable in some countries (5, 6) . Interstate differences might be due to differences in legislation, processes, court trial procedures, or criminal policy (3, 7) . The service system setting and seemingly unrelated factors, such as the global democracy index, gross domestic product, and total healthcare expenditures, may also play a role (5) .",

Several studies have explored the sociodemographic and treatment-related characteristics associated with length of forensic stay (LoS), and while some are consistently replicated others are not. Sociodemographic predictors of a longer LoS are male sex, an early manifestation of offending behavior, committing multiple offenses over an extended period, and the severity of offending behavior (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, the relationship between offense severity and prolonged LoS has not been consistently replicated (8) . Clinical parameters predictive of longer LoS include previous psychiatric admissions, diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic vulnerability, resistance to treatment or persistence of symptoms, and committing an offense as a result of hallucinations or during discontinuation of drug treatment (8) (9) (10) (11) . In the treatment, a longer stay is predicted by a history of absconding, slow treatment progress, complex mental health problems, or severe assault on staff (15) . In a previous Czech study, we compared differences between longstay forensic inpatients and discharged patients and concluded that committing more than one violent crime in the past, lacking insights into the illness, and being uncompliant with the treatment regimen are significantly associated with continued hospitalization (16) .",

Almost three-quarters of our sample lacked close relationships and had a lower level of formal education, and only one-third lived independently. We contributed to previous evidence of the problematic socioeconomic situation of patients with psychotic illness obtained from a general patient sample in the Czechia (29) . The average age of our sample was 42 years, which corresponds to other cohorts (8, 11) . Older age was another factor associated with longer LoS in our cohort. The majority of our sample consisted of men (87.3%), which is similar to other European states (10, (31) (32) (33) . We found that male sex was associated with LoS, replicating previous results (9, 14) , while others found no association (11) . Our results align with previous findings demonstrating that the diagnosis of psychotic disorder or schizophrenia and previous psychiatric hospitalization predict a longer LoS (33, 34) . In contrast to some studies, we found that alcohol or substance use decreased LoS (13, 34) . In our sample, mood disorder was not associated with a longer LoS, which replicates previous results (10, 13) . Resistance to antipsychotic treatment (indicated by clozapine prescription) is a fundamental clinical factor increasing LoS in our sample. Our results also show that a higher total antipsychotic dose (calculated in olanzapine equivalent) is predictive of longer LoS. Higher antipsychotic doses may indicate treatment resistance in cases where clozapine is contraindicated. The impact of combined treatment with antipsychotics on LoS has been previously demonstrated (31) . The findings from our hospital indicate that psychotic symptoms are the main drivers of assaultive behavior among inpatients with psychosis; therefore, successfully targeting symptoms is essential for violence prevention (35) .",

Some findings point to the severity of an index offense as a robust predictor of prolonged LoS (10-12); we could not link serious offenses (murder or attempting it) to prolonged LoS. This could be explained by the fact that only a small minority of our sample committed a severe violent act (n = 10 attempted or committed murder), even though the PT of our cohort was sentenced for violent acts in the majority of the cases. Committing at least one sex offense is predictive of longer LoS (12) . In contrast, enrollment in the sex offender program was not associated with prolonged LoS in our sample. An explanation could be that perpetrators who cooperate with treatment successfully undergo a treatment program and are conditionally discharged. Those who do not cooperate stay detained for a longer period of time. Committing an index offense under the influence of substances is associated with a shorter LoS, which is in line with other studies (15, 17) . This can be explained by a relatively large proportion of patients accomplishing substance abuse programs in a medium-security ward. This finding is supported by the type of treatment-LoS association, substance abuse or combination treatment (substance abuse plus sex-offender or psychiatric patients). Those patients who are sentenced, tend to have shorter LoS than those with psychiatric or sexoffender treatments. Different treatment programs for different patient groups, according to diagnosis, could thus contribute to the difference in LoS (e.g., substance abuse programs run in the medium-secure ward vs. the rehabilitation program in the general ward).",

Our results show that patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders with higher symptom levels remain hospitalized for more prolonged periods, and are often discharged to social facilities because they lack housing possibilities. One explanation is that prolonged hospitalization in general psychiatry or a low-secure ward is caused primarily by psychosocial barriers rather than by the risks presented by a given patient. When psychosocial disability is an issue, the availability of the following community services affects LoS (12) . In addition, having an ongoing close relationship and being employed before admission to forensic psychiatry predicted shorter stays; this is a replication of the previous findings (8, 13) .",

This tool captures a higher level of forensic needs in substance abuse patients discharged from closed to medium-security wards. Therefore, accomplishing a substance abuse program is a prerequisite for the termination of inpatient treatment if there is no severe mental health issue. In contrast, those with psychiatric treatment programs in lowsecurity wards received lower scores. Thus, the prolonged stay is presumably caused by the unsatisfied complex needs of the group of patients with severe mental illness and rather than the risks they pose to society. We consider the HoNOS-secure suitable for routine use as it is simple to administer and sensitive to change (23) .",

It is essential to build community services that can meet complex social needs. A second group of patients with longer LoS are formed by those diagnosed with paraphilia. Individuals with substance abuse problems referred to PT have a shorter LoS. They are discharged even if their societal risk is relatively higher than that of people with psychotic diagnoses, which is reflected in higher HoNOS-secure score. We failed to find a relationship between crime severity and LoS. This can be interpreted as an indication that PT is functioning properly because it provides treatment for mental conditions rather than punishment for the crime committed. If the patient's health condition is stable or assured, the patient is conditionally released regardless of the severity of the index offense.",
