SARS-COV-2 can be effectively inactivated by 75% ethanol, according to Chinese expert's consensus [4] . As a result, many homes and public places have been equipped with 75% ethanol for surface disinfection of objects in order to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of exposure to ethanol. In 2021 alone, as of September 30, American Association of Poison Control Centers [5] had managed 18,168 ethanol exposure cases about hand sanitizer in children 12 years and younger. However, reports of high concentration of ethanol consumption in children are rare, especially in newborns. Therefore, we reported a case of acute ethanol intoxication in a 25-day-old newborn boy to raise awareness of the disease.",

Naloxone is considered to be an \" amethystic agent \" [11] , which can antagonize acute ethanol intoxication through pharmacokinetic mechanism. One possible mechanism of naloxone antagonizing acute ethanol intoxication and its behavioral effects is to accelerate ethanol metabolism by reversing the redox state disorder of liver nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) couples caused by drugs [12] . Moreover, clinical studies [13, 14] in China have concluded that naloxone has a definite curative effect on acute ethanol intoxication with few side effects, which is a recommended method for treating ethanol intoxication at present. Therefore, we chose to treat the child with intravenous naloxone. And after the above treatments, the symptoms of the child were quickly alleviated.",
