            "text": "Coronavirus disease , which was caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global public health concern. A great proportion of the world needs to be vaccinated in order to stop the rapid spread of the disease. In addition to prioritizing vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, an ideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fined-grained contact networks to prioritize vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due to the enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does not capture indirect fomite or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed a new vaccination strategy called Individual's Movement-based Vaccination (IMV) [5] , which takes both direct and indirect transmission into account and is based on the types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in the case of the influenza-like diseases. This paper studies the application of IMV to COVID-19 using its documented transmission parameters. We conduct large scale computer simulations based on a city-wide empirical mobility dataset to evaluate the performance and practicability of the strategy. Results show that the proposed strategy achieves nearly five times the efficiency of random vaccination and performs comparably to the degreebased strategy, while significantly reducing the data collection requirements.",

Several vaccination campaigns are being implemented all over the world to minimize the overall impact. Previous research devised various theoretical vaccination strategies in both pre-emptive (before the disease widely spreads) and reactive (as the new virus strain generated) scenarios [1, 2] . The method of developing a vaccination strategy includes simulating the disease spread in a virtual environment with the selected strategy and interpreting the results. Various factors such as the number of vaccinated individuals and the cost of collecting contact information are taken into account to evaluate the performance of a vaccination strategy.",

One of the simplest contact-based vaccination strategies is randomly choosing a set of individuals in the network population to be vaccinated (RV) [2, 3] . Another simple strategy is acquaintance-based vaccination (AV) where individuals are asked to name a person they met [2, 3] . Individuals named by the majority will be vaccinated. However, these two strategies both require a large share of population to be vaccinated for it to be effective. To counter this problem, degree-based vaccination (DV) was proposed [4] . This strategy vaccinates individuals that have the highest number of contacts in a given period since they are the most likely disease spreaders. Even though this seems to be the most effective strategy, collecting the exact number of contacts for an individual is costly and difficult to implement. People tend not to remember how many people they have met and therefore, and often give inaccurate answers. While contact tracing apps can automate collection of this data, their uptake has generally been low due to privacy concerns.",

In this strategy, individuals are ranked based on their frequencies of visits to different classes of locations. Locations are classified based on the potential number of contacts when an individual visits a certain place. Because it focuses on types of places visited rather than individual contacts, IMV improves privacy over the DV approach. Our work in [5] used the dataset collected from a location-based app over 32 days and performed traced-based simulations to evaluate the performance of each mentioned strategy for influenza-like illnesses. Although DV has the best performance in both pre-emptive and reactive scenarios, IMV achieves comparable performance while being realistically implementable [5] .",

Figure 1 shows the outbreak size for each of the four vaccination strategies as the vaccination rate P varies. The efficiency of each strategy with an outbreak size S is calculates as (3365-S)/3365. It clearly shows that RV has little impact on limiting the disease spread with the highest efficiency of only 19.0% for a vaccination rate P = 1.8%. The AV strategy does improve the efficiency up to around 82.2%. The IMV and DV have comparable performance with the highest efficiency of 99.0% for IMV and 99.6% for DV both on 2.0% vaccination rate. Next, we explore the required vaccination rate P that results in a contained outbreak size within 100 infections, shown in Figure 2 . The IMV only requires 1.6% vaccination rate to get under 100 infections while RV needs at least 86.0% and AV needs 65.0%. At a low vaccination rate P (less than 1.0%), the DV strategy outperforms IMV but the gap gets smaller as P increases. ",

Its benefit lies in its cost efficiency, as it requires only the types of places people visit and the frequency of visits. Our simulations exploring the effect of R-value reveal sustained benefits of IMV over the other practical strategies. Our findings can help inform ongoing rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines to maximise their efficiency in containing outbreaks.",
