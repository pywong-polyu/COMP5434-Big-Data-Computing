            "text": "Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewer systems, upstream of a wastewater treatment plant, is an effective approach for understanding potential COVID-19 transmission in communities with higher spatial resolutions. Passive sampling devices provide a practical solution for frequent sampling within sewer networks where the use of autosamplers is not feasible. Currently, the design of upstream sampling is impeded by limited understanding of the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewers and the sensitivity of passive samplers for the number of infected individuals in a catchment. In this study, passive samplers containing electronegative membranes were applied for at least 24-h continuous sampling in sewer systems. When monitoring SARS-CoV-2 along a trunk sewer pipe, we found RNA signals decreased proportionally to increasing dilutions, with non-detects occurring at the end of pipe. The passive sampling membranes were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 shed by >2 COVID-19 infection cases in 10,000 people. Moreover, upstream monitoring in multiple sewersheds using passive samplers identified the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater one week ahead of clinical reporting and reflected the spatiotemporal spread of a COVID-19 cluster within a city. This study provides important information to guide the development of wastewater surveillance strategies at catchment and subcatchment levels using different sampling techniques.",

SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments can be shed at the pre-symptomatic stage and detectable in wastewater days to weeks ahead of clinical testing, which enables early warning of incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Medema et al., 2020; Saguti et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022) . In most surveillance programs, it is typical to collect composite wastewater samples at the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) inlet, where autosamplers are readily available. For regions aiming to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission to near-zero levels, the limitation of WWTP-based sampling is that the results reveal the presence of viruses in the entire catchment with many thousands to millions of inhabitants, including RNA signals from hospitals and quarantine facilities. This thus hinders the early warning potential of wastewater surveillance to detect likely community transmission before more individuals become symptomatic and present for clinical testing. In regions where the society is living with COVID-19, holistic and evidence-based health data is required to inform response to the potentially surging caseload and unforeseen challenges such as new variants. Alongside testing and vaccine information, wastewater surveillance at both catchment and suburb levels can provide complementary information (CDC, 2022; Queensland Government, 2022; Victoria Government, 2022) .",

Monitoring sewersheds that exclude the inputs from known sources such as hospitals or quarantine facilities can enable the detection of disease emergence in local communities, narrow down source locations, and reduce uncertainties related to dilution and viral RNA decay in sewers (Ahmed et al., 2022b) . To date, applications of upstream wastewater monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 have been carried out at schools and colleges (Barich and Slonczewski, 2021; Betancourt et al., 2021; Bivins et al., 2021; Gibas et al., 2021; Gutierrez et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020) , nursing facilities and hospitals (Davo et al., 2021; Goncalves et al., 2021; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2020; Karthikeyan et al., 2021; Schang et al., 2021; Spurbeck et al., 2021) , and in sewersheds at the intra-city scale (Albastaki et al., 2021; Saguti et al., 2021; Weidhaas et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022) . Wastewater COVID-19 monitoring in upstream catchments has been recognized as a strategy that promotes faster public health actions in the management of the epidemic Prado et al., 2020) , e.g., to provide timely message to local residents and urge for mass clinical testing",

Small catchments and low case numbers could normally result in the short-term fluctuation of virus loads, leading to a great challenge of capturing as many toilet flushing events as possible to detect the sporadic pulses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Detecting such pulses requires an increased sampling frequency to capture the shedding events of a small number of infected cases, preferably over 24-h period (Ahmed et al., 2021) . Conventional autosamplers may not be sustainable for long-term upstream sampling due to their high expense, requirement of safe and secure space, and potential health and safety concern raising from residents, especially when considering that sewer manholes could be located near road, pedestrian, and in public areas. The use of passive samplers may be an alternative in this regard as they can capture and retain SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater Hayes et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Schang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022) , and can be deployed within an enclosed manhole without visibility or accessibility to publics. Recent studies demonstrated that passive samplers containing electronegative membranes could achieve time-integrative sampling with continuous uptake of viruses over 48 h (Habtewold et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022) . The low investment and maintenance cost are also favorable properties for the application of passive sampling in upstream monitoring, which may require intensive sampling events (e.g., daily) at multiple locations (Harris-Lovett et al., 2021) .",

To respond to this research need, our study aimed to understand the fate of SARS-CoV-2 during transportation in real sewer systems and determine the sensitivity of the passive sampler for detecting the number of COVID-19 infected cases in the monitoring areas. The performance of passive samplers in upstream settings was further assessed through a systematic upstream sampling program for SARS-CoV-2 in 11 individual sewersheds within a city (Brisbane, Australia) with low COVID-19 incidences during the study period. This study for the first time revealed the change and transport of SARS-CoV-2 signals in real sewer pipes and provided practical advice on wastewater sampling strategies, which will assist public health departments and water utilities to develop localized wastewater surveillance programs in catchments with different dimensions, population sizes, and prevalence of COVID-19.",

A hospital with a COVID-19 ward that housed all diagnosed cases that arrived from interstate or abroad was considered as a positive control, being the single known source of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. During 2020 and most of 2021, Australia and specifically the State of Queensland pursued a \"zero COVID-19 policy\" where it was mandatory for anyone who entered the country (or the State) to undergo a 14-day quarantine period of isolation. If a quarantined person returned a clinically positive result for SARS-CoV-2, they would be transferred to a COVID-19 ward of a local hospital for treatment. This policy had been very successful in minimizing the number of COVID-19 infections in the State. During the study period, no COVID-19 cases were reported in the catchment outside of the hospital.",

In the hospital, the COVID-19 ward was located in a separate building specifically connected to N0, while the majority of hospital effluent entered another trunk sewer line, thus the population movement due to hospital commuters was not considered. The selection of sampling sites was executed on QGIS (Version 3.4), which integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) visuals of sewer systems and demographic information at the mesh block level (the lowest geographic level of the Australian census). The site selection procedure and criteria are described in Supplementary material. The service area of a given sampling point Ni was a combination of the service areas of its upstream sampling point N(i-1) and an area specific to Ni. Information on service area and population size of individual sampling sites is listed in Table 1 . From N0 to N7, increase in wastewater flow rates was in line with the increment of population in the areas (Fig. 1b) , suggesting that these subcatchments mainly received residential wastewater without significant infiltration or exfiltration in the sewer systems. The dilution factor \u03b1 at Ni was determined by ratio of flow rates between N0 and Ni (Eq.

The number of GC of SARS-CoV-2 detected from each passive sampler (N GC , GC per sampler) was the amount of viral RNA accumulated over 24-h sampling period. Additionally, a 24-h composite sample (500 mL) was collected during each sampling campaign by an auto-sampler at the inlet of WWTP, allowing for the comparison between performance of passive and automatic sampling techniques.",

The infection rate is dependent on the number of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases and the total number of residences in the service area of a sewer manhole where the passive sampler is deployed (Eq. (2)). The number of residence (P) in the service area of a given sewer manhole was collected from the Census population data. The diurnal population movement within the monitored subcatchments was not considered due to the lack of real-time population data. During the three sampling campaigns, the exact number of patients in the COVID-19 ward was 15, 13, and 25, respectively, resulting in the infection rates of 0.8 -18.6 cases per 10,000 people at N0 -N7. In this study, we assumed that the virus shedding patterns of COVID-19 patients on the day of sampling could be represented by an average shedding rate. It was indicated that although virus shedding could have greater variance between infected patients, the associated uncertainty became limited for the estimated COVID-19 prevalence when there were more than 10 infection cases in a catchment .",

The number of residences is about 500,000 in Catchment A and 230,000 in Catchment B. In total 11 upstream sampling points were established for the routine wastewater monitoring with 7 sites (A1 -A7) covering approximately 30% of the total population in Catchment A and 4 sites (B1 -B4) covering approximately 70% of the total population in Catchment B. These sampling points were sitting on trunk sewer lines and the population size in individual service areas ranged from ~7,000 to 70,000 (Table 1) . None of these upstream sewersheds had COVID-19 facilities such as quarantine hospitals or hotels. On July 31, 2021, a public health alert was issued following the clinical confirmation of COVID-19 infections at local schools in Brisbane's west, which triggered an immediate lockdown for Brisbane city (restricting travel beyond houses except for prescribed essential activity). Lockdown of the city was lifted on August 7 (7 days later) and the final case linked to the cluster was reported on August 23. As per the health department's request, we immediately conducted a responsive upstream sampling program comprising daily 24-h sample collection coupled with intraday virus analysis and data reporting from July 31 to August 12. Five days after the lockdown was lifted, the sampling strategy was shifted to two consecutive deployments per week as a combination of 72-h (Mon-Wed) and 96-h (Wed-Sun) sampling, until no clinical case was reported and no virus was detected in wastewater (September 12). Information on the exposure sites (namely the hotspots where the confirmed COVID-19 cases had visited) was collected from the open contact tracing data source (Supplementary Table S1 ) (Queensland Government, 2022) . During the upstream sampling program from the end of July to mid-September, no rain event had occurred in individual monitoring periods within the two catchments, except for a slight rainfall (1.4 mm precipitation in 24 h) on August 9.",

We postulated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was initially shed from patient zero and five close contacts who stayed in the monitoring area of A1 before further transmission happened. Therefore, the first SARS-CoV-2 detection on July 22 at A1 could be attributed to these six cases, resulting in an infection rate of 2.9 cases/10,000 in A1 area (Fig. S4 ).

Signals of SARS-CoV-2 were observed until 2 weeks after the last clinically diagnosed case linked to the cluster was reported.

Community transmission might have occurred at the end of July when SARS-CoV-2 spread to suburbs beyond A1 and B1, corroborated by the reported COVID-19 exposure sites in other subcatchments (Supplementary Table S1 ). The relationship between the two time-serial datasets, namely the daily wastewater testing results and clinically diagnosed daily new cases (from July 30 to August 23), was assessed using cross correlation. The estimated lag values suggested that wastewater data could lead or be behind clinical data by three days, according to the dominant lags of -3 (ACF = -0.6) and 3 (ACF = 0.7). However, it should be noted that the cross correlation could be subject to the low number of cases (<150 people associated with the cluster) and a small time window of monitoring (<1 month) in this study. For example, this could be highly dependent on when individuals within the cluster developed symptoms and presented for clinical testing.",

As the change of viral GC in sewers was a combined result of physical dilution and potentially sorption and biodegradation processes, the spatial and temporal consistency of the flow-normalized gene counts indicated that dilution was the dominant factor influencing the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, compared to the less influence of RNA decay in sewers. This also implied the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which led to limited RNA decay over time in the monitored sewer pipe (<5 h considering the minimal self-cleaning flow velocity of 0.6 m s \u2212 1 ). To date, there is still limited study about the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in real sewer systems, and the available studies about RNA stability in raw wastewater (i.e., in-sample stability) reported mixed findings. Some observed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a few days (Bivins et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020) , while another study reported the first-order decay of virus RNA with half-lives from 4 h to 17 h at 4, 10, and 35 \u2022 C (Weidhaas et al., 2021) . Further investigations on the association between viruses and the solid fractions in sewer systems such as suspended solids, biofilms, and sediments are required to better understand factors for the fate of viruses in sewers which could potentially lead to false positives or negatives. Another issue that could affect the amount of GC captured by passive samplers is 'ragging' due to the accumulation of cloths, tissues, etc., around the samplers deployed in wastewater, which was observed occasionally at sampling site N4. For the passive samplers experienced ragging, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detectable but the number of GC attached on the passive sampling membranes could have been affected. Future research is needed to understand the potential impact of ragging on the uptake of viruses on membranes and optimize the sampler design to minizine ragging occurrence.",

(2020) used 24-72 h deployment of Moore-swabs to monitor wastewater from campuses and hospitals, which was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA originating from 1 -2 COVID-19 cases in a building (Liu et al., 2020) . Similarly, the 3-h deployment of tampon swabs was able to detect SARS-COV RNA in wastewater from university halls that contained 1 -2 COVID-19 cases . The passive samplers used in our study showed higher sensitivity, being able to detect more than 2 COVID-19 cases among 10,000 residents in a catchment. This sensitivity was further validated by the application of passive samplers for upstream monitoring of the spread of COVID-19 clusters in a city, where approximately 5 -6 initial infected cases in sewersheds with ~20,000 -32,000 residents could be identified, corresponding to the infection rates of 2 -3 cases per 10,000. Results of these studies demonstrated that passive sampling could be a reliable and cost-effective method to identify a few COVID-19 incidences related to a small group of population.",

The stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on passive sampling membranes is not yet understood, which requires further studies to investigate the interactions between electronegative membranes and enveloped viruses. Viral RNA shedding in stool could contribute a major uncertainty to the results of this study due to the potentially high variance between infected individuals and throughout the time course of infection (Wolfel et al., 2020) . Additionally, findings of this study were determined based on the performance of passive samplers under dry weather flow condition in separate sewer systems. In catchments with combine sewer systems or under wet weather conditions, the sensitivity of passive sampling devices may be compromised due to the enhanced dilution in sewer systems and thus a higher infection rate or longer sampling duration would be required for a positive detection.",

Manholes with a service area of 5,000 -25,000 inhabitants could be suitable sampling sites, considering passive samplers could be sensitive to over 2 COVID-19 incidences among 10,000 people in a sewershed. \u2022 In a medium-sized catchment (e.g., 25,000 -200,000 people) without known viral source, wastewater monitoring at WWTP influents using autosamplers can be adopted as the routine strategy. The detection of positive signals of SARS-CoV-2 in an influent sample could be used to immediately trigger upstream sampling to monitor the spread of disease in different parts of a catchment and locate hotspot areas. \u2022 In small-sized catchments such as at towns in regional areas with a small number of residents (e.g., hundreds to thousands), passive sampling can be applied as an efficient method that is sensitive to a few infection cases who might reside or travel in the catchments. As demonstrated in this study, the sampling strategy of two consecutive deployments (e.g., 72 h + 96 h, or with higher deployment frequency) will provide a full-time disease surveillance for a small catchment with sufficient sensitivity. The simple passive sampling device is of particular importance to regional and remote areas where clinical resource is limited. \u2022 The deployment duration of a passive sampler can range from hours to days, depending on the potential threat of the virus circulating in local communities. The commonly applied sampling strategy is 24-h deployment (daily or weekly depending on local needs). For longer deployment, SARS-CoV-2 signals could be detected with 3 -4 days deployment, because of the time-integrative uptake of viruses on membranes. However, the impact of long-term exposure on the uptake, retention, and stability of viral fragments on membranes requires further investigation.",
