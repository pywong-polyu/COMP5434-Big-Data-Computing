However, the increase in the number of college students not only brings great opportunities and talent dividends to the country but also brings a series of challenges and social problems, the most important of which is the employment of graduates. e number of college students is growing, but the employment cannot match the growth rate of college students, resulting in a considerable number of graduates facing the dilemma of unemployment once graduation, and the \"lying flat\" and \"gnawing the old\" are growing day by day. At the same time, although some college students find jobs, they cannot give full play to their professional strengths, and the post functions do not match the skills they master Tengrong [1] . In view of the above situation, the Chinese government has paid full attention to it, adopted a series of employment security measures for college students, and adopted different and flexible assistance policies for different implementation objects, such as students, universities, and enterprises Kurszewska et al.

Nowadays, the way of data generation extends to all fields of society. Almost everything will produce information data, and these information data are finally collected and counted to form a huge data set, referred to as \"big data\" Pang et al. [4] . It mainly refers to the data set whose data scale exceeds that obtained, saved, and processed by traditional data management software. It can analyze and process big data, collect and extract from massive and scattered data, so as to obtain valuable information for users, and then conduct discrete dynamic modeling to associate with college students' employment security Zhu [5] . Discrete dynamic modeling technology is also very practical. It is suitable for most fields and belongs to a comprehensive cutting-edge technology. With the continuous exploration and promotion of personnel in various fields, the technology has made great progress and has been successfully applied in various fields Pirbhulal et al. [6] . For example, the e-commerce platform uses the user search and browsing record data to recommend the products that users expect to buy, establish relevant models, and promote user consumption. e public security system uses all the monitoring data to obtain all kinds of information of the suspect, master its whereabouts, and make the big data play a major role in the reconnaissance work Cui [7] .",
