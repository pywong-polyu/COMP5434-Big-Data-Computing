This study explores how school closure influences parents' work style based on short panel data for the period of school closure from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Specifically, we analyze how the presence of their children influences parents' work at home and examine how the effect differs by the parent's gender. After controlling for various factors, we find that in cases where parents are full-time employees and the children are: (1) in primary school, mothers are more likely to work remotely, while fathers are less likely to do so and (2) in junior high school, the parents' work styles are hardly affected. This shows that mothers shoulder the burden of working remotely and caring for small children at home, while fathers tend to work in the office and spend less time with their childcare at home. Inevitably, COVID-19 has increased the inequality in the burden of child care.",

These questions are critical as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide in 2020. Unexpected shocks, such as a great recession, affect modern life and thus, time allocation (e.g., Aguiar et al. 2013; Gorsuch 2016; Pabilonia 2017) . The government has required people to work from home to contain the spread of COVID-19, which inevitably leads to recession. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed working styles and time use in various countries. A lockdown to cope with COVID-19 has increased the percentage of people who stay at home by 8% across US counties (Brzezinski et al. 2020) . However, people with lower-paying jobs are less able to work from home in the United Kingdom (Costa-Dias et al. 2020) . In contrast to other types of recessions, the recession caused by COVID-19 has a greater impact on sectors with high female employment shares (Alon et al. 2020) .",

Married mother whose child delayed school entry increases labor supply for married women (Barua 2014) .

Meanwhile, the Japanese government has declared a state of emergency, but did not mandate workers to go to work. Those who choose to go their workplace are not penalized. Japanese workers can decide whether to go to the workplace or work from home to care for their child.

In Appendix, we provide the information showing that the data used for this analysis is similar to the data based nationally-representative surveys. This study examines how workers have changed their way of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, we limit the sample to workers. Further, the effect of having a child in primary school is considered. We assume that respondents who have children in primary school are aged below 50 years. To compare people with similar characteristics, we further limit the sample to respondents aged below 50. In the alternative sample, respondents are aged below 40. Part-time workers are more likely to lose their jobs than full-time workers, especially in emergency situations. Salaried and formal workers have jobs that are more amenable to working from home than the average workers (Hatayama et al. 2020) . To scrutinize the effect of having children who attend school, it is important to compare people that have similar jobs. Hence, we further limited the sample to fulltime workers because they are less likely to lose their jobs. The main sample includes respondents who are workers aged below 50, with 2436 and 2009 observations for the male and female sub-samples, respectively. In each sample, observations with Table 2 . The survey questionnaire contained basic questions about demographics such as age, gender, educational background, household income, and job status, and about having children in primary school or junior high school. The job status has ten categories. 4 Full-time workers are classified into three categories. 5 Workers are further classified into seven categories. 6 We assumed that the job status did not change because the three waves were conducted within a month. However, it is possible that some fulltime workers lost their jobs during the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, in addition to the estimation results using a combined sample of waves 1-3, we also report the results using the sample of Wave 1, in which we asked respondents their job status. 7 Therefore, the respondents' job statuses are correct in the Wave 1 sample, even if they lost their jobs thereafter. Primary School, a dummy for having a child in primary school, is a key independent variable.",

Figure 2 shows that female workers' work-from-home behavior is almost the same as that of male workers if they do not have children in primary school. It is surprising that female workers' work-from-home behavior is distinctly higher than that of male workers if they have children in primary school.

As for workers with children in junior high school and others, there is no obvious difference observed.

Meanwhile, females with children in primary school were more likely to work from home than other females. Therefore, the gender gap for Japanese citizens with children in primary school is very large, while the gender gap for those who do not have children in primary school is very small. The lower part demonstrates that there is no difference between citizens with children in junior high school and others. This is observed not only for males but also for females. The findings in Fig. 3 are consistent with the argument of Hatayama et al. (2020) that women tend to have jobs that are more amenable to working from home than the average worker. However, within the same gender, there is remarkable difference in the work-from-home behavior according to whether citizens have children in primary school, although having children in junior high school did not make difference. Overall, the observations in Fig. 3 suggest that parental care for children in primary school is more essential than that for children in junior high school during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because primary school students are less mature. Figure 4 demonstrates the distribution of work-from-home behavior. Around 30% of female and 15% of male respondents completely practiced \"work from home\" (i.e., those who responded \"5\" to the questionnaire). Meanwhile, around 45% of female and 55% of male respondents did not practice this behavior at all (i.e., those who responded \"1\"). The females' work behavior is distributed between the two extremes, whereas that of the males' is concentrated in \"1.\" That is, the male respondents mostly have not practiced the behavior at all.",

As shown in Table 3 , Primary Student is influenced by Age and Years of Schooling. However, the income level is not considered predetermined because having a child changes the work style, leading to a change in income. Accordingly, income was not included in Eq. (2). In the same framework, the probability of a Junior High Student was estimated. We estimated ATE by matching each subject to a single subject with the opposite treatment whose propensity score is the closest. 11 We only asked information about child's school at March (in the first wave). We assume that children did not move up to the upper school during the studied period. 12 It is possible that primary school students entered junior high school in April if they were in sixth grade in March under the educational system of Japan. Similarly, junior high school students possibly entered high school in April if they were in third grade in March. However, we only asked respondents whether they have a child in primary school (junior high school) in Wave 1. Thus, we assume that Primary School and Junior High School are the same from Wave 1 to Wave 3. Table 4 reports the results based on a sample of workers aged 50 and 40. We see from Table 4 that the coefficients of Primary School are negative and positive for males and females, respectively. Furthermore, the results are statistically significant at the 1% level. This suggests that in households with children in primary school, working mothers are more likely to work from home, while fathers are less likely to work from home. Junior High School does not show statistical significance in any column. This indicates that children in primary school influence their parents' way of working, whereas children in junior high school do not. This reflects a difference in the necessity for childcare between children in primary school versus those in junior high school, who are considered to be more mature. Table 5 reports the results using a sample of full-time workers. Table 5 shows that Primary School has similar results to those in Table 4 . That is, the sign of Primary School indicates a statistically significant difference between males and females. The absolute values of its coefficients are 0.41 for males and 0.85 for females, using subsamples of participants aged below 50. This means that full-time male workers with children in primary school are 0.41 points less likely to work from home (on a fivepoint scale) compared with full-time male workers. Full-time female workers with children in primary school are 0.85 points more likely to work from home (on a fivepoint scale) compared with other full-time female workers. 13 In short, the impact of Primary School on females is approximately two times larger than that on males, although the impact is opposite between the genders. One reason that fathers were more likely to work outside during school closure is that their kids stayed at home and play loudly. Also, an alternative explanation is that fathers worked outside because their wife stayed at home and helped them to do so during March-April. Junior High School shows a significant negative sign in columns (1) and (2), but this becomes insignificant in columns (3) and (4). That is, the effects of Junior High School are not robust.",

What we found in this study partly reflects the fact that females' jobs are more amenable to working from home (Hatayama et al. 2020 ). In the post-COVID-19 period, it is plausible that females are more able to work from home, which improves women's social status. In the workplace, managers instruct working mothers with small children to work from home in consideration of their situation. Her husband might welcome that she works from home because he can focus on his work in the workplace. The spousal gap has changed the allocation of housework between husband and wife (Yamamura and Tsutsui 2021) . The gender gap is very large in Japan (World Economic Forum 2020). Accordingly, in the case of female workers with small children, women work not only as salaried workers, but also as caregivers for their children. Yamamura and Tsutsui (2020) found that people's mental condition worsened as the COVID-19 pandemic diffused. Within a household, the gender gap in the burden of work may have a negative influence on the mental condition of the mother and her child. 17 An increase in stress may lead a mother to abuse her child, which has a negative impact on child growth. Therefore, it is critical to consider how to maintain work-life balance and to reduce the gender gap between husband and wife for designing the post-COVID-19 society.",

Japanese workers are more loosely controlled by the government than in the United Kingdom. Hence, male workers can work in the workplace, which explains the difference. From a different perspective, women's social status in Japan is far lower than that of women in the United Kingdom (World Economic Forum 2020). Therefore, due to differences in bargaining power, working mothers are more likely to shoulder a larger burden. However, the increase in female burden generates stress, not only on herself but also on her child. From a long-term perspective, this has a detrimental effect on women's mental health and their children's growth. Thus, it is important for researchers to investigate the reason for the different impacts of COVID-19 on the gender gap in childcare between the United Kingdom and Japan. In future research, we should examine how the effects of COVID-19 differed between different cultural and economic settings by using more sophisticated approach such as the DID method or experiments.
