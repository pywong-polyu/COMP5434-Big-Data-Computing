            "text": "Introduction COVID-19 has significantly affected community health workers' (CHWs) performance as they are expected to perform pandemic-related tasks along with routine essential healthcare services. A plausible way to optimise CHWs' functioning during this pandemic is to couple the efforts of CHWs with digital tools. So far, no systematic evidence is available on the use of digital health interventions to support CHWs in low-middleincome countries (LMICs) amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The article describes a protocol for a scoping review of primary research studies that aim to map evidence on the use of unique digital health interventions to support CHWs during COVID-19 in LMICs. Methods and analysis Our methodology has been adapted from scoping review guidelines provided by Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al. and the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our search strategy has been developed for the following four main electronic databases: Excerpta Medica Database, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Google Scholar and reference tracking will be used for supplementary searches. Each article will be screened against eligibility criteria by two independent researchers at the title and abstract and full-text level. The review will include studies that targeted digital health interventions at CHWs' level to provide support in delivering COVID-19-related and other essential healthcare services. A date limit of 31 December 2019 to the present date will be placed on the search and English language articles will be included. Ethics and dissemination Formal ethical approval is not required, as primary data will not be collected in this study. The results from our scoping review will provide valuable insight into the use of digital health interventions to optimise CHWs' functioning and will reveal current knowledge gaps in research. The results will be disseminated through journal publications and conference presentations.",

With the advent of COVID-19, maintaining the credibility of the CHW concept is even more daunting as healthcare systems across low-middle-income countries (LMICs) are overwhelmed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. 3 In the wake of COVID-19, the CHWs are playing a significant role in preventing the transmission of COVID-19, 4 through promoting physical distancing and other precautionary measures like hand washing, wearing masks, contact tracing, recognising early signs of COVID-19, referring individuals for testing, providing isolation and quarantine guidance and COVID-19 vaccination. 4 ",

This has caused stress and anxiety among CHWs across LMICs. Some CHWs are apprehensive of becoming vectors of spreading COVID-19 in communities while others are concerned about contracting COVID-19 during household visits and transmitting it to their family members. 7 The pandemic has significantly affected the regular duties of CHWs which include the provision of antenatal and postnatal care, child immunisation and community case management of pneumonia, malaria, tuberculosis and diarrhoea. Assigning new COVID-19-related tasks to CHWs, within the scope of existing roles, pose the question of whether these COVID-19-related tasks will produce significant population health benefits and outweigh the risks posed to CHWs. Feroz et al 1 argue that public health departments, NGOs and social enterprises operating CHW programmes need to devise innovative solutions to strike the right balance between COVID-19-related tasks and other essential services as it makes little sense to divert all CHWs for COVID-19 response and vaccination at the expense of other essential services.",

            "text": "Prior to the pandemic, digital health technologies have been used by CHWs in LMICs to address a range of health issues related to maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, family planning, HIV/AIDS, general health, acute respiratory infections, infectious diseases and injury and trauma. [8] [9] [10] There is an opportunity to couple the efforts of CHWs with digital tools to optimise CHWs' functioning during this pandemic. Evidence suggests that CHWs equipped with digital tools can serve as a valuable lifeline to support the public-health response to COVID-19 worldwide, including population surveillance, information sharing, case identification, contact tracing, decision support, training and evaluation of interventions based on mobility data and communication with the public. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In LMICs, CHWs reportedly used a range of digital health interventions during the pandemic for remote data collection and health assessments, health education through short message service (SMS) and voice message, behaviour change through the use of digital megaphones and digital contact tracing using mobile-based tracking systems. 20 Numerous digital tools have been operationalised to optimise CHWs' functioning for COVID-19-related tasks and other essential health services including Living Goods' Smart Health app, DiMagi's CommCare, mHero and Medic Mobile's Community Health Toolkit. [21] [22] [23] Bhaumik et al 20 conducted a rapid evidence synthesis on CHWs' role in the COVID-19 pandemic in response to a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India. The review identified 36 articles, mainly from LMICs, which highlighted that CHW roles and tasks have been changed substantially during the pandemic and the most common additional activities were community awareness, engagement and sensitisation. CHW roles and tasks also changed considerably for countering stigma and contact tracing. 20 However, the review did not mention the use of digital health interventions to support CHWs' functioning during COVID-19. So far, no systematic evidence is available on the use of digital health interventions to support CHWs in LMIC during the COVID-19 pandemic. This gap highlights the need to explore unique digital health interventions to support CHWs in LMICs during pandemic response. This review aims to systematically explore the available literature on evidence-based digital health interventions presently being used to support CHWs' performance during COVID-19.",

In particular, the review will include original papers that focused on the use of digital health interventions to support CHWs in activities defined in Sections 2.1-2.7, client identification and registration, client health records healthcare provider decision support, telemedicine, healthcare provider communication, referral coordination, and health worker activity planning and scheduling, in the WHO's Classification of Digital Health Interventions. 29 For this review, the digital health interventions will include wearable devices, predictive models operationalised through clinical applications, health information technologies, health management systems and other innovations related to mobile health, telehealth and telemedicine that can guide diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. 30 Search strategy development , intervention (digital health interventions) and settings (LMICs).

Although a quality appraisal of included studies is not required in scoping reviews, 26 27 34 we hope to improve the quality and rigour of our approach by limiting our search to original and primary research studies with well-established methodologies (randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, qualitative studies and study protocols). We recognise that our focus on primary research studies may exclude relevant reviewlevel evidence. However, since the review-level evidence on the use of digital health interventions to support CHWs during the pandemic is limited, our focus on primary studies will allow us to capture the range of digital health interventions and their associated barriers for adoption and use among CHWs in LMICs. In addition, operationalising the term 'CHWs' in our search was challenging since CHWs are known by many different names in different countries. Bhattacharyya et al 35 and Gilroy and Winch list altogether 36 different terms by which CHWs are known in different countries, which is not exhaustive. 36 Several in-depth discussions and a careful review of the literature were performed to inform our operational definition of 'CHWs'. We hope that our choice of search terms is purposefully broad enough to identify relevant digital health interventions being used to support CHWs in different LMICs during the pandemic. Future research should be considered to assess the effectiveness of these digital health interventions being implemented to support CHWs in carrying out assigned tasks in LMICs during the COVID-19 and beyond the pandemic period.",
