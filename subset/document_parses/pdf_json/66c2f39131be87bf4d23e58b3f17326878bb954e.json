This study explored the lived experience of a SARS-COV-2 diagnosis and subsequent quarantine among individuals in Germany who were diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 during the second wave of the pandemic (late 2020-early 2021), but whose diagnosis was unexpected due to a lack of a known contact, or the asymptomatic nature of their case at the time of diagnosis. In-depth interviews (n=22) were conducted by phone or video call, audiorecorded, and transcribed verbatim. Routine debriefings guided data collection and facilitated analysis, which followed a framework approach. Regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status, data consistently demonstrated a diagnosis and quarantine career marked by five emotional phases: overconfidence, shock and denial, coming to grips and asking questions, enduring, and cautious optimism as quarantine ended. These experiences suggest that providing trustworthy, easily accessible information regarding certain key aspects of the post diagnosis and quarantine period could benefit patients in terms of reducing stress, understanding the consequences of a diagnosis and mitigating foreseeable challenges in terms of personal, logistical and emotional issues. Follow-up research with providers and public health bureaus could inform how to best tailor such messaging for clients who experience an unexpected diagnosis.

Furthermore, while we note an expanding body of quantitative literature on asymptomatic COVID-19 (examining, for example, prevalence of asymptomatic disease spread (Yanes-Lane et al., 2020)), we find no qualitative literature teasing out the experiences of those who have been unexpectedly diagnosed, whether because they are asymptomatic, presymptomatic, have no known contact with a case, or did not recognize the onset of symptoms. Nevertheless, perspectives from this population are valuable because a majority of patients diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (Oran & Topol, 2021; Yanes-Lane et al., 2020) , and, for a variety of reasons, whether linked to vaccination status, a prior infection, or reduced perception of risk in general, future SARS-COV-2 cases may include an increasing amount of individuals who viewed themselves as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exceptionally unlikely to contract the virus. Capturing perspectives from such individuals may support health system efforts to devise tailored messaging, bolster effective communication and pre-empt such individuals for experiences that are inherent to quarantine (which may ultimately facilitate their ability to prepare for and maintain their quarantine). Finally, literature in the field of psychology underscores that the manner in which people internalize and process information is often intertwined with whether they expected the information (\"decision affect theory\") (Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, & Ritov, 1997) , we therefore view insights from such individuals as valuable as it may inform health counselling, and structural or psycho-social supports.",

Respondents who described their cases as mild reported engaging with the internet and with other information sources notably less, and During this phase, several respondents described having more time on their hands to sit and begin pondering, as one respondent said, \"over and over again: when did I actually get infected?\" (MALE, 34). While some quickly found an answer, for others this uncertainty persisted throughout quarantine and only gradually faded. Coupled with this question, respondents expressed concern about whether or to what extent they may have infected others. Respondents described worrying about being blamed for \"bringing COVID-19\" into communities, families, or workplaces.

This may lead to a sampling bias in the sense that respondents who are willing to conduct additional tests to aid a scientific study might be more likely to associate positive feelings towards science and studies, or they might be more concerned about COVID-19 or their status.

This seems particularly relevant for people who are unable to continue their everyday lives, for example, those who cannot work from home. This can be addressed by sending an email or letter with answers to the most frequently asked questions, suggested activities during quarantine, and a guide to follow post-diagnosis. We recommend local health authorities insert this information into their routine when informing positive cases. Another key issue to address is the experienced stigma after leaving quarantine, which speaks to a need to educate the public about the infectiousness of patients post-quarantine and how to behave towards those patients.",
