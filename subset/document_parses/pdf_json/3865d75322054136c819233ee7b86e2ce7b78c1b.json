            "text": "The highly contagious nature of Covid-19 attracted us to this challenging area of research, mainly because the disease is spreading very fast and until now, no effective method of a safe treatment or a vaccine is developed. A library of novel 1,2,3-triazoles based 1,2,4-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole and/or 1,3,4-thiadiazole scaffolds were designed and successfully synthesized. Different spectroscopic tools efficiently characterized all the newly synthesized hybrid molecules. An interesting finding is that some of the newly designed compounds revealed two isomeric forms. The ratio is affected by the size of the attached group as well as the type of the heteroatom forming the side ring attached to the central 1,2,3-triazole ring. The experimental spectroscopic data is in agreement with the DFT calculations at B3LYP 6-31G (d,p) with regard to the geometrical conformation of the prepared compounds. The DFT results revealed that the stability of one isomeric form over the other in the range of 0.057-0.161 Kcal mol \u00c0 1 . A docking study was performed using PyRx and AutoDockVina to investigate the activity of the prepared 1,2,3-triazoles as antiviral agents. Bond affinity scores of the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were detected in the range of \u00c0 6.0 to \u00c0 8.8 kcal/ mol showing binding to the active sites of the 6LU7 protease and hence could be anticipated to inhibit the activity of the enzyme. Verification of the docking results was performed using the M pro alignment of coronaviruses substrate-binding pockets of COVID-19 against the ligands. As per these results, it can be proposed that the title hybrid molecules are acceptable candidates against COVID-19 for possible medicinal agents.",

            "text": "The current health and economic concerns of the entire world due to Covid-19, motivated many research groups to dig for safe and effective treatment or/and vaccine for this fastspreading epidemic. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The eruption of this novel COVID-19 or 2019-CoV infection has posed a substantial challenge to the international scientific research community after the World Health Organization could not rule out the airborne transmission of coronavirus. [15] It is well known that there are no effective and non-toxic specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for this disease so far. Therefore, governments have to depend, mainly, on applying severe preventive and control measures that reduce the risk of possible disease spread, however, this solved a problem and created another. [16] Hence, in the absence of a cure for this virus, the door became widely open for urgent alternative approaches to control the spread of the disease. It has been confirmed that this virus is covered through folded structure and has a single-stranded RNA genome. [5] Possible easy and useful backbone approaches for many researchers, to help to face this international challenge, are the investigation of the fascinating pharmacophore and computational approaches. [17] Because the computational approach is a low cost, less time consumption and less error to identify promising drugs, hence, we have been motivated to address this challenge to explore the nitrogen heterocyclic compounds as potent antiviral candidates. It is related, here, to note that the first protein-ligand docking method was published more than three decades ago. [18] Heterocyclic containing nitrogen atoms have shown effective antiviral activities. For example, Ribavirin and Taribavirin namely 1-((2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide and 1-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamidine, are well known as nucleosides based 1,2,4-triazole motif and are the most effective antiviral drugs broadly approved. They have been systematically used against herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), respiratory syncytial, influenza virus and hepatitis C virus. [19] However, due to their broad cytotoxicity, their routine clinical uses became limited, therefore, recent efforts have been reported to modify the standard core by replacing the 1,2,4-triazole motif with another nitrogen heterocyclic ring to develop some novel ribavirin analogs. For example, new 1,2,3-triazoles based ribavirin analogs have been investigated, [20] (Figure 1 ), which were proved to be more effective than ribavirin in terms of antiviral activity.",

[27] [28] [29] [30] An interesting addition is that 1,3,4-oxadiazole core can exhibit supramolecular assembly through N\u00c0 H \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 S and C\u00c0 H \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 S, pointto-face C\u00c0 H \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u03c0 contacts and \u03c0 \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 \u03c0 stacking interactions. [31] Based on these findings, it is very promising that the present research will stimulate endeavors in the design and development of newer patent antiviral candidates. For this, the 1,2,3triazoles based functionalized 1,2,4-triazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole and/or 1,3,4-oxadiazole core have been successfully synthesized and fully characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Besides, the spectroscopic data of the isomeric forms were compared with the DFT results in this study. In this research study, one main protease crystallized COVID-19 structure (PDB ID: 6LU7) has been chosen for molecular modeling against our novel compounds. Computational docking analysis was performed using PyRx, AutoDockVina option based on scoring functions. [32] The outcomes exhibited multihydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives with 6LU7 protease. Docking bond affinity, (kcal/mol), scores of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were detected between \u00c0 6.0 and \u00c0 8.8 kcal/mol. As per these results, it can be proposed that our 1,2,3-triazole derivatives are good candidates against COVID-19 for possible medicinal agent.",

The approach adopted for the synthesis of dimethyl 1-(4-bromophenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5dicarboxylate (3) was based on a free solvent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of the dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate1 with p-bromoazidobenzene2 at 80-90\u00b0C for only 3 min (Scheme 1). The used aryl azide was prepared via the diazotization of p-bromoaniline in the presence of sodium nitrite solution in acidic media, followed by theazidolysis with sodium azide as described before. [33] The success of such 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was supported by the spectroscopic results of the resulted 1,2,3triazole-bis-esters 3 which were in agreement with its proposed structure. The 1 H-NMR spectrum displayed two distinguishable singlets at 3.88 and 3.94 ppm of the two nonequivalent methoxy groups of the ester functionalities. The two doublets recorded at 7.64 and 7.87 ppm were attributed to the protons of the p-benzene residue. Additionally, the 13 C NMR spectrum revealed no signals on the sp-carbon regions confirming their involvement in the cycloaddition reaction, and two additional The hydrazinolysis of the resulted 1,2,3-triazole-based ester 3 was carried out through its thermal treatment with hydrazine hydrate in refluxing ethanol for 4 hr and has successfully proceeded to afford the corresponding bis-acid hydrazide(4)in 90 % yield,(Scheme 1). The structure of the acid hydrazide 4 was deduced based on its NMR spectral data. The 1 H-NMR revealed the disappearance of the two methoxy groups and the appearance of two new broad singlets at 4.70 and 10.95 ppm attributed to NH 2 and NH groups, respectively, confirming the success of hydrazinolysis reaction. The 13 C-NMR The reaction between istothiocyanates and active N\u00c0 H groups resembles the early known proposed procedure by Douglas and Dains, [34] however, this methodology has been recently updated for related thiourea-related compounds. [35] Three novel bis-acid thiosemicarbazide carrying 1,2,3-triazole scaffold 5-7 were successfully prepared in 88-89 % yields by refluxing an ethanolic solution of the bis-acid hydrazide4 with phenyl, ethyl and/or methylisothiocyanate for 6 hr, (Scheme 1). Structural elucidation of the new acid thiosemicarbazides 5-7 was carried out based on their IR, 1 H, 13 C-NMR and elemental analysis data. Thus, the 1 H-NMR spectrum of the N-ethyl thiosemicarbazide derivative 6 revealed two sets of triplets on the alkyl group region at 1.06 and 1.12 and a multiplet at 3.47 ppm related to the two unsymmetrical ethyl groups. The two broad singlets recorded at 8.00 and 8.14 ppm were attributed to the two non-equivalents NH protons. Moreover, four singlets appeared at 9.54, 9.56, 11.11 and 11.14 ppm integrated for four protons related to the amidic (CONH) and thioamidic (CSNH) protons, respectively. The aromatic protons were also observed in their respective chemical shifts (7.64 and 7.85 ppm). Its 13 C-NMR data also supported the structure by the appearance of new aliphatic carbons around 14.30-39.46 ppm belonging to the two ethyl groups. Also, new carbon signals were recorded at 189.77 and 191.46 ppm confirming the presence of the thiocarbonyl carbons (C = S).",

Besides, the spectra showed also the presence of absorption bands at 3220-3365 cm \u00c0 1 assigned to NH groups, which confirmed the formation of the triazole rings in the thione form. These results were in agreement with those reported previously for similar compounds.

Three conformers have been studied and the conformational analysis was conducted to reveal the energy difference was in the range of 21.9 kJ/mol [41] The structure deviates of our investigated compounds from planarity due to steric hindrance created by the triazole rings as well as the attached methyl groups. Therefore, the scanned potential energy surface (PES) along dihedral N1\u00c0 C5\u00c0 C6\u00c0 N7 was carried out and the scan curve was shown in Figure 7 . The PES scan curve could show the optimized geometrical structure of the corresponding global minima. It is obvious that there is an existence of two energetically least lying conformers A and B.",

In order to find out the relative stability of each isomeric conformer for the phenyl and methyl derivatives, the corrected energy and the thermodynamic properties(enthalpy (H), and free energy (G)) were computed, Table 1. The results of the DFT calculations revealed that formA for compound 8 is in a lower energy structure than the other form B by 0.057Kcal/mol, hence more stable than its conformational isomer. However, form Bis more stable than the other form A for compound 10. The energy difference was by 0.069 Kcal/ mol. The slightly higher energy between both conformers A and B of compound 8 could be illustrated in terms of the steric hindrance of the bulk phenyl group with respect to the small methyl group of compound 10. Furthermore, the stability pattern is reversed by changing the attached group; conformer B is more stable for compound 8 while conformer A is more stable for compound 10. Further, the small difference in energy between both conformers of either the methyl or the phenyl derivatives does not mean their presence of interconverting equilibrium. This is because the presence of both 1,2,3-triazole rings adjacent to each other prohibits the free rotation around the C\u00c0 C single bond. Such difference in energy could be explained in terms of the kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities of form B of compound 8 and A for compound 10.",

The docked molecules, fitted in a cavity held by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction with the active sites of protease 6LU7 are presented in Table 2 . The binding affinities to the biological targets are usually considered in choosing possible drug candidates. Docking scores were considered the binding affinities (kcal/mol) with more negative values indicating better binding strength. Several coronaviruses (HCoVs) infect humans were identified and divided into two groups depending upon symptoms causes; the first group causes mild upper respiratory diseases namely, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU, and HCoV-229E. The second group causes severe acute lower respiratory syndrome namely coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerged coronavirus, COVID-19. [42] The phylogenetic tree divided these groups of coronaviruses into three clusters based on the similarity on their amino sequence of M pro , Figure 9 . The first cluster contains HCV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and MERS-CoV, the second cluster containsCOVID-19 and SARS-CoV and finally, the third cluster contains HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Based on Jin and others in 2020, the total number of amino acids in COVID-19'M pro is 306. [43] Promoters of coronaviruses are composed of three domains; domain I, contains amino acids from 8 to 101, domain II, which starts from 102 to184 and III, from 201 to 303 residues. A long loop region covered by residues 185-200 which is the region between domains II and Figure 10 , I. Conserved residues in the coronaviruses are distributed in different substrate binding sites, P1, P2, P4 and P5. Substratebinding was identified in a cleft between domain I and II. [43] COVID-19 binding pocket was comparable to that found in other coronaviruses. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] All 1,2,3-triazoles were docked to substrate-binding site residues of COVID-19. 22 amino acids are structuring the substrate-binding site, 50 % of them are conserved among the coronaviruses aligned Figure 10 . The closest coronavirus to COVID-19 is SARS-CoV, however, there is one amino acid (S46) in the substrate-binding site which is not alike. Nevertheless, none of the 1,2,3-triazoles tested bounded to this amino acid (S46) in COVID-19. Six identical amino acids were identified between COVID-19 and MERS-CoV. They are S45, M49, H 164, P168, T190 and A191. Yet, there are many amino acid residues in the pockets of COVID-19 and MERS-CoV is not alike.",

Important addition is that the two NH groups in 9 are involved in one hydrophobic interaction with the active sites in the protease whereas NH groups in 14 are involved in many hydrophobic interactions. Compound 9 displays no H-bond, whereas,14 shows three H-bonds, Figure 13 . This indicates that 14 is better bonded to the protease when compared to 9 as the more negative value indicating better binding strength. [54] including COVUD-19. Domains I, II and III are labeled.

The spectroscopic data of the synthesized compounds illustrated the presence of an isomeric mixture between two proposed conformers and these data were confirmed by the DFT simulation to show that the stability of one isomeric form with respect to the other in the range of 0.057-0.161 Kcal mol \u00c0 1 . However, the ratios of projected conformers were found to be affected by the size of the attached group as well as the type of the heteroatom forming the side ring. Based on the observations of virtual screening established using molecular docking performed to identify novel compounds that can be able to bind with protein structures of COVID-19 (PDB ID: 6LU7), we believed that the 1,2,3-triazole derivatives could aid in COVID-19 drug discovery. This is clearly manifested in the bond affinity obtained for ligands 3-17 indicating good binding potency against COVID-19. Authentication of the docking results was performed using the M pro alignment of coronaviruses substrate-binding pockets of COVID-19 against the 1,2,3-triazole derivative. In the future, these ligands could be used for the initiation of clinical trials.",
