While developing the model, a fraction of patients should be kept out during the training process (if separate dataset is available that should be used for testing and would result in a more robust model), to serve as a testing cohort and help validate the accuracy of the model, which can be done using confusion matrix analysis. Once the accuracy of the model significantly improves as compared to no-information-rate, the model could be deployed to new patients. Before deployment, sensitivity analysis would ensure that the variables of importance are relatable with actual clinical scenario. For the implementation of this model, the risk score could be provided to clinicians at the earlier stages of disease for new patients, which would then help them guide treatment or allocate resources based on risk of particular outcomes and plan for future treatment needs. Another area where such an algorithm can be used would be in clinical trials, where it could help in forecasting the probability of success of the trial.",
