Virus infection is known to be one of the most common causes of myocarditis. 3 Acute myocardial injury has increasingly been observed as an initial cardiac complication of COVID-19. 2 For our patient, there was concern for direct myocardial injury because SARS-CoV-2 can enter cardiac myocytes by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus disrupting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways leading to injury of cardiac myocytes. 1 Findings of severely reduced LV systolic function, SARS-CoV-2-positive status, and signs and symptoms of infection alluded to a viralinduced myocarditis. 2, 4 However, certain aspects on TTE, such as apical ballooning, made Takotsubo cardiomyopathy a part of our differential diagnosis.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac biopsy was not performed to limit exposure. These diagnostic studies would have been helpful in distinguishing between myocarditis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Viral myocarditis is distinguished by the presence of many inflammatory cells and interstitial edema on examination of an endomyocardial biopsy specimen, and a gadolinium enhancement pattern on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. 6 Our patient was managed with several medications with anti-inflammatory properties. These treatments helped reduce her myocardial injury and allowed for LVEF recovery. Proposed mechanisms of myocardial and lung injury are cytokine storm, which has been theorized to be secondary to an imbalanced response by type 1 and type 2 T-helper cells, and increased activity of the Notch pathway that increases proliferation of IL-6. 7 Tocilizumab is an immunosuppressive drug and an anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, which blocks IL-6 from binding to its receptor, and as a result stunts the immune inflammatory response. 8 Tocilizumab has been proven to be effective in treating patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 by improving clinical symptoms and stunting deterioration. 8 Furthermore, steroids are currently not being employed in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19, but perhaps there is a role for them in patients with COVID-induced myocarditis without other contraindications. 6 Employment of noninvasive techniques (bedside TTE and cardiac biomarkers) should be considered to assess hypotensive patients given the possibility of insidious and potentially deadly cardiac complications of COVID-19. More randomized trials are needed for each of these treatments to properly assess their impact on myocardial injury and cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.",
