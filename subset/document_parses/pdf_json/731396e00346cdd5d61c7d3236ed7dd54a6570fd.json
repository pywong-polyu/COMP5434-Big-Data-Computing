However, such strategies may not consider the wider economic, social and well-being impacts of isolation (4, 5) . 'Test to enable' strategies are designed to isolate those with infection while reducing or avoiding self-isolation for those without infection. Implementing a 'test to enable' approach could therefore lessen the impact of self-isolation on exposed individuals without infection and reduce onward transmission by improving case ascertainment for asymptomatic, paucisymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and, potentially, adherence to selfisolation (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Indeed, a recent study reported that 16.3% of isolating contacts of confirmed cases were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that a structureed approach to testing contacts of confirmed cases can support improved case ascertainment (11).",

It has been reported that the sensitivity of LFD testing is lower than PCR (57.5 -78.8 %); the sensitivity has been reported to improve to >90 % when tested using samples with higher viral loads (13, 14) . LFDs provide some added benefits compared to PCR, with a rapid turn-around time (usually less than 30 minutes), low cost and delivery outside of a routine laboratory environment. These features may help increase accessibility to testing for harder to reach groups and allow for a programme of repeated testing, improving the overall case ascertainment (8, 9) Here we describe an investigation into the acceptability of a self-administered daily 'test to enable' programme for contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using the Innova LFD antigen test during the first 7 days of isolation. On receipt of a negative LFD result, asymptomatic adult participants were exempt from self-isolation for a 24-hour period. The study was designed to identify barriers and strengths to a test to enable approach' for contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19, to inform the possible implementation of serial testing of contacts using LFDs as part of England's NHS Test & Trace strategy.",

This was higher than previously reported when contacts of cases were offered a PCR swab (39.5%; (11)), which may reflect the additional freedoms awarded by serial testing as part of a test to enable strategy. It is important to note that, in both studies a substantial proportion of those who declined self-reported that they had already been tested for SARS-CoV-2, had booked a test or were part of a testing programme which indicates that testing acceptability is high. Interestingly, 4% of participants declined as they had already tested negative, which is similar to that observed when contacts were offered a PCR swab, being 8.2% (11) and highlights the risk that an early negative result may be providing false re-assurance to individuals who may assume that a negative result will be valid for their full incubation period. Better information on interpretation of negative results may be needed if routine testing of contacts is implemented.

            "text": "Sample size was not determined by statistical power considerations and this is an important limitation that should be considered when interpreting the findings. The study was designed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a test to enable study, with further research planned to use more robust methodologies to look at associations. Secondary attack rates in particular should be interpreted with caution due to small numbers, with estimates of uncertainty for secondary attack statistics subject to random variation when underlying cohorts are small. Only close contacts who are named by the case are captured by contact tracing. These attack rates should be considered minimum estimates both because only those contacts who access testing can subsequently be identified as a case and because the matching process used to detect when a contact goes onto become case within NHS Test and Trace is highly specific. Secondary attack rates are also likely to underestimate the number of contacts, given the predominance towards the reporting of household contacts, which may be a result of the study being performed during a period of lockdown in England. A large proportion of contacts who became cases had reported activities outside of the household during their infectious period to NHS T&T but declared no contacts in these settings to NHS T&T. 13 -94 years All rights reserved.
