Rural residents tend to be older, poorer, 2 and are more likely to have chronic conditions associated with severe COVID-19 than urban residents. 3, 4 Rural health care infrastructure is strained by hospital closures 5 and health professional shortages, which limit access to primary and specialty care. 6 Half of rural residents are at high risk of serious illness due to COVID-19, creating stress on rural hospitals, 7 and COVID-19 is exacerbating inequalities in chronic disease outcomes already present in rural populations. [8] [9] [10] However, some rural communities are more resilient in coping with the strains associated with COVID-19 than others. 11 This report details COVID-19 incidence and mortality in nonmetropolitan America in the 33-week period from March 1 to October 18, 2020. State-level maps provide a visual assessment of the changing impact that COVID-19 has had on nonmetropolitan populations in three 11-week periods. The trends and maps illustrate the observation that nonmetropolitan populations are in need of substantive public health interventions despite their small and geographically dispersed populations.",

This scheme classifies all counties in the United States into one of six metropolitan categories (four metropolitan, one micropolitan, and one noncore). 1 A metropolitan county has one or more adjacent counties with at least one urban core area of at least 50,000 population. A micropolitan county has one or more adjacent counties with one or more urban cores between 10,000 and 50,000 residents. Noncore counties are all other counties that are neither metropolitan nor micropolitan. We collapsed the four metropolitan categories (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) into a single \"metropolitan\" category and the micropolitan and noncore categories into a single \"nonmetropolitan\" category. We use the nonmetropolitan categories as a proxy for rurality. Of the 3143 counties in the United States, 1976 (63%) are classified as nonmetropolitan.",

To calculate these rates, we summed case and death counts for each metropolitan category within the state, then calculated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates using the counts as the numerators and the 2019 population estimates as the denominator. We then created incidence maps and mortality maps that show the rate ratios of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan by state.

(b) Ratio of nonmetropolitan COVID-19 incidence rates to metropolitan incidence rate: 1-October 18, 2020. In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 COVID-19 cases occurred in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States. Incidence rates were calculated by tabulating county-level case and population counts into the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan parts of the United States. The numerator was the case counts and the denominator was the population counts. The National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties was used to define metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan and noncore) areas. (A) Trends show national nonmetropolitan and metropolitan incidence rates; nonmetropolitan rates first exceeded the metropolitan rates in early August, surpassed the peak (July) metropolitan rate in early October, and continues to accelerate at a faster pace at the end of the third period. (B) Nonmetropolitan to metropolitan incidence rate ratio maps identify whether the rates were higher in the nonmetropolitan or metropolitan areas of each states. Rate ratios \u2265 1 (red) have higher nonmetropolitan rates than metropolitan rates and rate ratios \u02c2 1 (blue) have higher metropolitan rates than nonmetropolitan rates. State maps of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan incidence rate ratios in three periods show that the highest COVID-19 incidence rates had shifted to the nonmetropolitan areas in many (n = 9) states during period 3 metropolitan rates during the first period, but case and death rates in nonmetropolitan counties surpassed those of metropolitan counties at the beginning of August. The metropolitan trends followed the national-level incidence rates, 15 which peaked in April, declined and plateaued for several weeks in May and early June, and began to rise again in late June. However, COVID-19 incidence rates for nonmetropolitan populations did not follow this trend ( Figure 1A ).",

While F I G U R E 2 (a) Daily COVID-19 mortality rates: March 1-October 18, 2020. (b) Ratio of nonmetropolitan COVID-19 mortality rates to metropolitan incidence rate: 1-October 18, 2020. In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States. Mortality rates were calculated by tabulating county-level case and population counts into the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan parts of the United States. The numerator was the death counts and the denominator was the population counts. The National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties was used to define metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan and noncore). (a) Trends show national metropolitan and nonmetropolitan mortality rates; nonmetropolitan rates first exceeded the metropolitan rates in early August, plateaued for several weeks, and appear to increase again in mid-October. (b) Nonmetropolitan to metropolitan mortality rate ratio maps identify whether the rates were higher in the nonmetropolitan or metropolitan areas of each states. Rate ratios \u2265 1 (red) have higher nonmetropolitan rates than metropolitan rates and rate ratios \u02c2 1 (blue) have higher metropolitan rates than nonmetropolitan rates. State maps of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan mortality rate ratios in three periods show that the highest COVID-19 incidence rates had shifted to the nonmetropolitan areas in many (n = 15) states during period 3 those rates fluctuated for most of period 3, they generally plateaued for this period, while the metropolitan mortality rates declined; the mortality rates in nonmetropolitan America were beginning to increase again toward the end of period 3. The national trend line is not shown because the relative size of the metropolitan population drives the national COVID-19 rates, which makes the trend line appear to overlap the metropolitan rates. Readers can review the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Data Tracker to see how the rates in nonmetropolitan America changed after October 18, 2020. 15 These trends are reflected in the COVID-19 incidence rate ratio maps ( Figure 1B) and mortality rate ratio maps ( Figure 2B ) for individual states. In many states, incidence rates shifted from being higher in the metropolitan areas in period 1 to being higher in the nonmetropolitan areas in period 3.",

One explanation for the rising rates in nonmetropolitan America is that rural communities may have missed some opportunities to contain the spread of COVID-19 despite factors, such as low population density and limited travel to and from rural locations, which could have resulted in less opportunity for COVID-19 exposure. 4 This may be related to differences in perception of COVID-19 risk among rural residents, who did not initially perceive their risk to be high. 16 This may also be related to the fact that major metropolitan areas were the first impacted by COVID-19, which may have informed public perception that the spread of COVID-19 was primarily an urban problem. 17 In this case, rural populations may not have adopted preventive behaviors, such as social distancing or facemasking, as early as their metropolitan counterparts.",
