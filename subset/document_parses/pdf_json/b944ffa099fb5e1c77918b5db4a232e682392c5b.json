We show that an early lockdown shifts the epidemic in time, while that beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, the epidemic tend to restart after lifting the restrictions.

We characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects. Our model is general, and while it does 1 arXiv:2004.04608v3 [physics.soc-ph] 14 Apr 2020 not analyze specific mitigation strategies, it highlights the relevance of some key parameters on non-pharmaceutical mitigation mechanisms for the epidemics.",

Our goal is general in nature, since we focus on two relevant decomposability conditions, under which partial dynamics influence the overall configuration of the system (see, e.g., [5, 6, 7, 8] ). We study how a) mobility restriction measures and b) timing of the lockdown lift affect the total fraction of infected, the peak prevalence, and, possibly, the delay of the epidemic.

Notwithstanding micro data on individual profiles are not taken into account, our simple compartmental model based on geographical and age classes uncovers relevant aspects, which provide some guidance to policy makers. First, we show that an early lockdown shifts the epidemic in time and that the delay is proportional to the anticipation time, with an intensity which grows with the strength of the lockdown. Beyond a critical threshold, the epidemic would tend to fully recover its strength as soon as the lockdown is lifted. As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be prepared during the lockdown. To provide some guidance on the relative importance of different general strategies, we first study how the sparsity of the matrix representing mobility flows across administrative regions influences the observed delays of the contagion. The relative strength of infra regional mobility with respect to inter regional mobility flows implies that, once the epidemic has started, it then tends to develop independently within each region [11] . Second, we study the impact of patterns of interaction within and between age classs, and we find its structure to be of primarily importance to estimate post-lockdown effects. According to our results, age-based mitigation strategies can be a key ingredient to contain rebound effects.",

Not to mention the difficulties in assessing the impact of variability in social habits during the epidemics [10, 15] . Moreover, especially in the early phases of the epidemici.e. the ones characterised by an exponential growth -different models sharing a given reproduction number R 0 can fit the data with equivalent accuracy (see discussion in the APPENDIX about fitting initial parameters).

We analyze an extensive data set on Facebook mobility data 3 [20] ; our analysis confirms that the lockdown has reduced both the travelled distance and the flow of travelling people. We consider the effects of lockdown measures on the parameters of our model. Lockdown is a non-pharmaceutical measure; hence the rate \u03b3 is the most unaffected parameter, since it is related to the \"medical\" evolution of the disease. Analogous arguments apply to the rate h of exiting a condition serious enough to be observed and to the probability \u03c1 of being observed by the national healthcare system (although \u03c1 could be influenced variations in testing schemes and alert thresholds). On the other hand, the transmission coefficient \u03b2 can be thought as the product C\u03bb of a contact rate C times a disease-dependent transmission probability \u03bb. Hence, if we assume that the speed of Covid-19 mutation is irrelevant on our timescales, lockdown strategies mostly influence \u03b2 by reducing the contact rate C between individuals.",

We first estimate model's parameters by least square fitting on the prelockdown period. Since in such range the data Y Obs show an exponential growth trend, we are possibly observing a very early phase of the epidemic, where \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 equals the growth rate of Y Obs (see APPENDIX for observations on the choices of initial parameters). For fixed \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3, the time of the epidemic start (that we conventionally assume as the time t 0 where the number of infected is 1) and the fraction \u03c1 of serious cases observed by the national healthcare service, allows to vary the values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 as long as their difference is fixed.

However, since the number of hospitalized patients and -most importantly -the number of patients in intensive care is only a fraction of O, lowering the peak puts less stress on the healthcare system. The ideal situation would be to have accurate data, an accurate model and accurate estimates of the parameters; as an example, in our model lifting the lockdown when the number of infected people per unit time \u03b2S(t)I(t)/N is lower that the average number of recovering people \u03b3I(t) would ensure that the number of infections [25] .

As expected, early lockdown (i.e. well before the \"free\" infection peak) reduces the height of the peak without much moving it forward in time. Conversely, lifting the lockdown too soon can make epidemic start again and reach values higher than the ones before the release. A peculiar and counter-intuitive effect can be generated if the lockdown is anticipated: in fact, a too early lockdown delays the start of the epidemic without attenuating its severity (see APPENDIX for the description of the effects of varying lockdown time). In other words, an early lockdown \"buys\" time, but it postpones the problem without mitigating its severity.",

Increasing the strength \u03b1 of the lockdown, not only corresponds to delaying the time at which it is lifted, but it also induces a stronger re-start of the epidemic in the post-lockdown (see APPENDIX for An additional counter-intuitive mechanism must be considered. Since an attenuation of \u03b1 corresponds to an effective reproduction number R eff 0 = \u03b1R 0 , at the critical value \u03b1 crit = 1/R 0 the epidemic neither grows nor decreases 4 . Thus, after t Lock the system stays stationary until the lockdown is released at t Unlock ; at this point, the epidemic starts growing again as it was before the lockdown. In general, if \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit , the system looks to ameliorate (infected, hospitalized, all the infective compartments go down) but as soon as the lockdown is lifted, the epidemic starts again to reach its full strength (see SI). Nevertheless, our estimate \u03b1 \u223c 0.5 > \u03b1 crit \u223c 0.3 for the Italian lockdown gives us hope that, perhaps, it will not be necessary to follow a repeated seek-and-release strategy in the post-lockdown phase.

As a consequence, the growth curves of the epidemic variables tend to converge to the same shape (see APPENDIX about using normalised data). In fact, regional info graphics released by the Italian National Healthcare Institute (ISS) [21] show that regional diffusion curves have a similar shape and different starting dates (see Fig. 3 ). This observation can be justified as follows: Italian regions are independent administrative entities, and most of the population tend to work inside the resident region [26] . Hence, epidemics propagate from region to region via the fewer inter-regional exchanges (Incidentally, Lombardy is the Italian region, which is most involved in international trade connections [27] , being the natural candidate for the initial outbreak of the epidemic). More practically, we estimate the delays by minimizing the distance among the observed curves (see APPENDIX for the details of the algorithm); results are reported in Tab. 2. Notice that, assuming Lombardy has been the first region (i.e. delay=0), the resulting regional delays are mostly correlated to geographical distances. We assume that the Covid-19 outbreak spreads independently in each region; as argued before, such an approximation is reasonable after the epidemic has started and is even more accurate under lockdown conditions. Hence, we apply the parameters for the entire country to regional cases 5 , where now the maximum number of individuals N i is the population of the i th region 6 . Then, by summing up all the S i , . . . , R i , respectively, we obtain a proxy for the global evolution of Covid-19 epidemic throughout Italy. To evaluate the effect of heterogeneity in time delays, we compare the number of daily cases O Delay = O Delay i (obtained by taking into account the regional delays t i as reported in Tab. 2) 5 Again, we are exploring qualitative scenarios and we do not aim to predict the real evolution of the epidemics: in fact, Italian regions are different for social contact habits, mobility, organization and capacity of health care provision, as well for factors that affect the medical parameters, like comorbidities, social conditions or pollution levels.",

Indeed, it could be unreasonable to keep locked the regions where the epidemic started earlier; on the contrary, regions where the epidemic began with some delay could experience a strong rebound when subjected to a premature lockdown lifting. In Fig. 3 we show the effects of lifting the lockdown at both regional (Async) and national (Sync) level in Lazio and Lombardy. Since not only epidemics, but also the ruin of an economy is a non-linear process, the Sync scenario can turn out to be even more disruptive than the epidemic itself (see also Fig. 2 ).

            "text": "As we have already observed in the previous Section, heterogeneity strongly impacts on the results within the model [28] . Since the transmission coefficient is proportional to the contact rate between individuals, the rates of social mixing between different age classes represent a well known important source of heterogeneity. This information can estimated either through large-scales surveys [25] or through virtual populations modeling [29] . While the POLYMOD [25] matrices have been extensively used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination for different age-classes during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [30, 31] , here they are used to support the design of a broad class of exit strategies. Hence, to account for age classes, we extend our model by rewriting the transmission coefficient as \u03b2C (see APPENDIX for a full description of the extended model), where \u03b2 is the transmission probability of the infection, and C is the sociological matrix describing the contact patterns typical of a given country. For lack of further information, we assume \u03b2 constant among age classes and C as in [25] . To simplify the analysis, we gather POLYMOD age groups into three classes: Y oung (00 \u2212 19), M iddle (20 \u2212 69) and Elderly (70+) (see Tab 3 ). Such an aggregation puts together the most \"contactful\" classes (00 \u2212 19), the classes Tab. 2). Lower panels: sketch of an Async(hronous) exit strategy (i.e. each region lifts the lockdown following its own policy) respect to a Sync(hronous) exit strategy (i.e. the lockdown lift follows the same policy, but applied to a nation wide scale). In particular, t Sync corresponds to lifting the lockdown in all the region after the peak has fallen by 30% , while t Async i corresponds to lifting the lockdown in the i th region after the peak of such region has fallen by 30%. with the highest mortality risk (70+) [21] , and a good approximation of the active population (20 \u2212 69). Fig. 4 shows how the percentage of people with visible symptoms (O) varies once the age class heterogeneity is considered in the model. Differently from fig.  2 , fully lifting the lockdown results in a conspicuous rebound of the epidemics, that reaches values even more severe than the pre-exit peak. Thus, models, which do not explicitly consider this source of heterogeneity could severely misforecast the post-exit dynamics. On the other hand, the introduction of the age structure in the model allows to orient the design of exit strategies based on age-targeted policies, as a way to dampen a possible upturn of contagion. Specifically, social/physical distance measures applied to the elderly may contribute to contain the impact of a renewed upward phase, while relaxing restrictions to the working age class (20-69) would not impair the smoothing of contagion propagation in the post-lockdown phase. Again, a disclaimer, it is important to emphasize that we are referring to simple mock-up strategies, which correspond to worst-case scenarios: in real life, community measures and physical distancing, infection prevention and control, personal hygiene habits, face mask usage, etc. will be decisive in contributing to the dampening of the epidemics [22] .",

            "text": "In this paper we propose and test a general framework to study the Covid-19 contagion through a compartmental model, with a focus on geographical groups and age classes. Our framework shows that the promptness of lockdown measures has a main effect on the timing of the contagion. Strict social distancing policies reduce the severity of the epidemics during the lockdown period, but full recover of the contagion can occur once such measures are relaxed. As a consequence, a mix of specific mitigation strategies must be prepared during the lockdown and implemented thereafter. In order to understand the relative potential impact of different broad strategies, we focus on two broad decomposition criteria within the model, that is geographical mobility and social interactions between age classs. Our results are driven by the sparsity of the underlying contact matrices, which we measure. First, we show how local dynamics at regional level can be hidden when observing the aggregate national system. Regional heterogeneity tends to lower and widen the curve of the contagion, contributing to a shift forward in time for the peak at the aggregate level. Moreover, our analysis of mobility data shows that, due to the sparsity of interconnections across regions, contagion develops independently within each region once the epidemic has started. This, in turn, contributes to account for the delays observed in the alignment of the contagion curves across different geographical areas. The independence of regional dynamics is important, since it can justify the adoption of a mix between general mitigation strategies and solutions which are specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Interestingly enough, the generality of our model makes this result relevant also to frame the relative impact of cross country mobility flows. Finally, we investigate the structure of social contacts across different settings and we quantify the relative importance of interactions between age classes in the spreading of contagion. We show that the young (0-19) and the old (70+) are the most intensively interacting classes. As a consequence, mitigation strategies specific to these two classs can produce a significant impact on diffusion rates in the post-lockdown phase. In fact, our results show the importance of designing physical distancing measures specific to the elderly and, in addition, they can orient decisions on limitations to social contacts for the young. Overall, our results provide guidance on how to relax some of the restrictions to mobility for the active population (20-69), while smoothing and lessening the propagation of contagion in the post-lockdown phase.",

In particular, we show how the timeline of post-lockdown measures should take into account some fundamental compartmental aspects, such as geographical factors and interactions between different age classes. This feature is general, and it can orient the analysis towards fine grained simulations on the impact of specific precautionary interventions, which enforce social distancing while containing the overall burden on the economy and on society.",

Therefore, if the epidemic dynamics of A and B are still well approximated by exponential distributions at times < max{t, t }, then t \u2212 t \u221d \u2212(t A \u2212 t B ), i.e, the country that has started the lockdown before will experience the same epidemic of the other country, just delayed in time. In Fig. 6 . In the initial stage, most of the quantities experience an exponential growth with the same exponent; hence, it would be possibly to \"successfully\" fit the wrong variables. Figure shows the pre-lockdown growth of the number of I(nfected), O(bserved), R(emoved) individuals in our model (2) . Full circles represent the experimental counts of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Italy; X is the cumulative variable we use to fit the experimental data. particular, for identical initial conditions, we have that:",

Indeed, calibrating on one own normalized growth curve the time of the lockdown and its strength would give an idea of how long one can delay the full start of the epidemic dynamics. Finally, we notice that to each lockdown strength \u03b1 corresponds an effective reproduction number R eff 0 = \u03b1R 0 ; hence, for \u03b1 \u223c \u03b1 crit = 1/R 0 , the epidemics is expected to stay in a quiescent state where it does not either grow or decay sensibly. On the other hand, for \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit the epidemics decreases; nevertheless, since this happens before a sufficient number of recovered individuals has built up herd-immunization, the height of the peaks after the lockdown lifting are almost unchanged if compared with the no lockdown scenario. Again, a \"too behavior of the model for lockdown strengths \u03b1 < \u03b1 crit = 1/R 0 . Notice that the height of the peaks after the lockdown is released is almost unchanged if compared with the no lockdown scenario.
