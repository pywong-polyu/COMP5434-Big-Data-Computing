[11] In the current analysis, the risk of severe illness in MAFLD patients with co-existing obesity was more than 6-fold greater after adjustment for confounders. These findings are distinct, suggesting that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is significantly greater in those with MAFLD. However, the virological and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship we observed is not clarified by the present data. Systemic inflammatory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 response syndrome, a common complication in severe COVID-19, [12] is promoted by the activation of CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes producing a larger amount of interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. This suggests IL-6 is a key proinflammatory factor that triggers the inflammatory \"storm\" in patients. [13] In MAFLD patients, particularly those with obesity, increased inflammatory activity in the liver and visceral fat is independently correlated with increased levels of IL-6, [14] which might have an additive/synergistic role in promoting greater severity of COVID-19. It is conceivable that the secretion of hepatokines for example, reduced adiponectin or the altered secretion of inflammatory lipid mediators in obese patients with MAFLD, [15] may also contribute to the current observations. While this is the first multi-center study to investigate obesity as a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness in patients with MAFLD, some limitations should be recognized. Patients included in our study did not undergo liver biopsy, thus COVID-19 severity in relation to liver histology could not be assessed. Waist circumference, a risk factor for MAFLD, was not measured in our patients, which precluded adjustment of this confounder. In addition, patients were of Asian ethnicity and thus the applicability of the results to other ethnic groups is uncertain. Additional studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the underlying mechanisms for why the association with obesity is greater in those with ", "cite_spans": [{"start":
