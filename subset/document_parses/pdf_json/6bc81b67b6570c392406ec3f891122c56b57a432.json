Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, and with the first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia in March 2019, more strict measures, such as international travel restriction, and suspension or cancellation of major events, social gatherings, prayers at mosques, and sports competitions, were employed. These non-pharmaceutical interventions aim to reduce the extent of the epidemic due to the implications of international travel and mass gatherings on the increase in the number of new cases locally and globally. Since this ongoing outbreak is the first of its kind in the modern world, the impact of suspending mass gatherings on the outbreak is unknown and difficult to measure. We use a stratified SEIR epidemic model to evaluate the impact of Umrah, a global Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during the month of Ramadan, the peak of the Umrah season. The analyses shown in the paper provide insights into the effects of global mass gatherings such as Hajj and Umrah on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic locally and globally.",

Since then, many countries enforced travel restrictions to and from China to prevent the spread of the virus across the world (Sohrabi et al. 2020) . However, by March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic (World Health Organization 2020b). In the early stages of the pandemic, affected countries responded to the increasing number of COVID-19 confirmed cases by implementing several preventive measures to control the spread of the disease. These measures have included travel restrictions, isolation of infected populations, quarantine of suspected cases, cancellation of major events, school closure, and public lockdown (Anderson et al. 2020; Bedford et al. 2020; McCloskey et al. 2020) .",

Both religious pilgrimages associated with the arrival of millions of Muslims from all over the world. According to GASTAT, the Saudi General Authority for Statistics (General Authority for Statistics 2020), almost 2.5 million pilgrims completed Hajj with international participants making up for more than 70% of the attendance, and about 19 million pilgrims performed Umrah throughout the year with 7.5 million pilgrims arriving from outside of Saudi Arabia in 2019. Such mass gatherings can pose a significant threat to controlling the extent of the epidemic in Saudi Arabia and in the home countries of the returning participants (Atique and Itumalla 2020; . Due to the increasing health risks associated with MGs, the WHO is working directly with host countries and organizers of these events for effective preparedness and response planning during the COVID-19 pandemic (World Health Organization 2020c). Canceling or postponing global mass gatherings remains to be the recommended countermeasure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic due to the absence of an approved vaccine for the disease (Ahmed and Memish 2020; Ebrahim and Memish 2020). However, canceling or postponing international pre-planned mass gatherings, such as Olympics games or World Cup events may lead to huge economic losses while negatively affecting the livelihoods of people whose incomes are directly dependent on these events. Host nations spend billions of dollars of money for planning and preparing for these events, and a decision of cancellation or postponing can cost add to these costs considerably. Furthermore, due to their ancient histories and followers' beliefs, religious pilgrimages, such as Hajj cannot be canceled, postponed, or relocated as the rituals of these pilgrimages must be completed on specific dates at specific sites. Therefore, it is important to find effective ways to organize these events with the necessary safety measures.",

Additionally, these global events have the potential of spreading the disease to even more countries and even more rapidly. But the impact of canceling these events or allowing restricted entries, or hosting with no restrictions on the scale of the pandemic has not been measured yet. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of Saudi Arabia's decision to suspend the Umrah pilgrimage on the trajectory of COVID-19 at local and global levels. We propose homogeneous and stratified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) mathematical models to simulate the transmission of COVID-19 during the Umrah pilgrimage among the different groups of pilgrims and the residents in Mecca. For a more realistic simulation of the epidemic and to incorporate the stochastic nature of the disease transmission, we used the discretetime stochastic version of the homogeneous and stratified SEIR models. Several epidemic scenarios were executed during the holy month of Ramadan on a daily basis. Safety and precautionary measures such as wearing masks, social distancing, sanitizing surfaces may directly reduce the infectious disease parameters, contact rates of individuals, and the transmission probability of the infection (Lindsley et al. 2020; World Health Organization 2009) . We simulate the levels of the employed safety measures implicitly by varying these parameters. The model was calibrated using the expected numbers of international and domestic pilgrims arriving at Mecca and the daily reported number of COVID-19 cases at the same time interval. The objective of the study is to analyze various scenarios for better understand the importance of global mass gatherings suspension as a control measure during pandemics.",

However, sometimes these preventative measures and control strategies are not effective. For instance, screening at entry points is not capable of detecting asymptomatic participants upon their arrival at a mass gathering. The risk of infectious disease outbreaks at MGs presents an opportunity for researchers to develop epidemic models to simulate the spread of diseases in these settings. Epidemic models can be used in the planning process of MGs to estimate the potential risk of disease outbreaks during and after these events. Also, modeling infectious diseases provides a way to measure the sensitivity of the outbreak to various epidemic parameters, such as the initial number of cases, contact rate and patterns in the population, and the duration of the latent and infectious periods of the disease. Epidemic modeling can assist the decision making of epidemic response planning and the assessment of possible control measures.",

Also, the removed compartment can include, in addition to recovered individuals, isolated infected individuals (either self-isolated or by public health officials). The SEIR model is the most commonly used model to study the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak. Variations of the basic SEIR model were presented in several studies to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures (Gosc\u00e9 et al. 2020; Prem et al. 2020) , simulate the spread of COVID-19 in specific settings , or to predict the potential magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak at local, regional, and global level (Hamzah et al. 2020 ).",

The rituals of Hajj last for a few days during the last month of the Islamic calendar and are completed at multiple holy sites in Mecca including the great mosque (in Arabic called Al-Masjid Al-Haram). Umrah is considered to be a limited version of Hajj in terms of rituals and can be performed multiple times at any time of the year. The rituals of Umrah are limited to the great mosque in Mecca and can be performed in less than two hours. International and domestic pilgrims stay in Mecca during their visit to complete Umrah for a period that ranges between one day to three weeks. However, during the Hajj season international pilgrims can stay up to one month before the starting date of Hajj and one month after they complete Hajj. In both events, international pilgrims are allowed to visit the holy city of Madinah.",

We also assumed that recovered individuals acquire permanent immunity to COVID-19, even though there are conflicting reports about recurrent COVID-19 infection after recovery.

We used data of confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia prior to the start date of Ramadan (see Fig. 4 ) to initiate infections among domestic pilgrims, and the reported cases in Mecca (see Fig. 5 ) to initialize the number of infected from the residents of Mecca.

Figure 7 shows the epidemic curves for each sub-population under the different values of . As shown in the figure, the three sub-populations showed similar trends in their epidemic curves, which can be due to the similar distribution of contact rates between sub-populations. While we introduced the heterogeneity between the different sub-populations, we maintained homogeneous mixing within the same sub-population. Results shown in Fig. 7 illustrate the effect of interactions among the different sub-populations of domestic pilgrims, international pilgrims, and residents on the disease spread among residents of Mecca.

The stratified SEIR epidemic model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 between the population of pilgrims and the residents of Mecca when reducing the allowed number of international and domestic pilgrims by 25%, 50%, and 75%. We assumed that the reduction in the number of pilgrims is issued before the first day of Ramadan to maintain a static population throughout the simulation.

The total number of exposed and infectious cases in pilgrims is reduced approximately by the same reduction rate in the pilgrims' population compared with allowing all expected pilgrims to perform Umrah (0% size reduction). We try to measure the effect of the population size reduction along with the variation in the transmission probability (changes in R 0 ). Interventions such as use of masks, hand sanitizers and social distancing would ultimately help in reducing the transmission probability. Since the exact impact of these interventions is not known we use a range of values for R 0 between the lowest ( R 0 = 2.3 ) and the highest reported values ( R 0 = 2.3 ). We see that the reduction is attendees has a linear impact on the number of infected individuals. However, reducing the transmission probability in combination with the population size restriction can reduce the number of infected and exposed individuals to less than 25,000 individuals from about 3.5 million if no measures are taken, which points towards a possible controlled organization of the event. The number of infected and exposed international pilgrims is less than 2000 if 75% of the arriving population is restricted and the transmission probability is the lowest (best-case scenario). These individuals can be mandated to quarantine before their departures at this scale.

Modeling the COVID-19 epidemic during Umrah, a global religious gathering in Saudi Arabia reveals important insights into the effectiveness of the suspension of mass gatherings during the spread of highly contagious diseases. The results of both homogeneous and stratified SEIR epidemic models suggested that the suspension of Umrah prevented an increase in the number of international and local COVID-19 cases compared to performing Umrah without isolation of infected pilgrims, or any restrictions in terms of the size of the pilgrims' population. The obtained results of the COVID-19 spread simulation when applying size reduction to the local and international pilgrims showed the significant impact of restricting the allowed numbers of attendees on the overall size of the epidemic. While the whole Umrah population was assumed to have similar features and same mixing patterns in the homogeneous SEIR model, the stratified SEIR model utilized more information stratifying the population into three sub-populations. Results of the predicted number of infected cases illustrated the effect of incorporating the interactions between these sub-populations in the stratified SEIR model. Tables 1 and 2 list the total number of predicted cases by the end of Ramadan in both homogeneous and stratified SEIR models. As shown in both scenarios, the best-case scenario (when R 0 = 2.3 ) and the worst-case scenario (when R 0 = 8.05 ), the total number of infected cases using the stratified SEIR model was greater than those using the homogeneous SEIR model.
