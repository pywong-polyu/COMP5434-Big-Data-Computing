Information regarding virus-laden aerosol concentrations is still scarce in community indoors and what are the risks for general public and the efficiency of restriction policies. This work investigates, for the first time in Italy, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples collected in different community indoors (one train station, two food markets, one canteen, one shopping centre, one hair salon, and one pharmacy) in three Italian cities: metropolitan city of Venice (NE of Italy), Bologna (central Italy), and Lecce (SE of Italy). Air samples were collected during the maximum spread of the second wave of pandemic in Italy (November and December 2020). All collected samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, using both real-time RT-PCR and ddPCR, and no significant differences were observed comparing samples taken with and without customers. Modelling average concentrations, using influx of customers' data and local epidemiological information, indicated low values (i.e. < 0.8 copies m \u22123 when cotton facemasks are used and even lower for surgical facemasks). The results, even if with some limitations, suggest that the restrictive policies enforced could effectively reduce the risk of airborne transmissions in the community indoor investigated, providing that physical distance is respected.",

By 31 December 2020, infected cases reached 82,401,782 individuals and 1,801,239 deaths worldwide (https://covid19.who. int/); 2,541,783 individuals were infected at the same date in Italy (about 4.3% of population) with 88,279 deaths. In most countries, a second wave of pandemic was observed in autumn 2020. In Italy, the second wave started roughly at the beginning of October 2020 and hit all regions contrarily to what happened during the first wave (winter 2020) in which northern Italian regions were severely hit compared to southern regions. This convinced the government to enforce mitigation strategies both at national and regional levels according to the estimated risks in the different regions.",

Airborne transmission could be due to virus-laden particles emitted by infected individuals. Large droplets settle faster than they evaporate; in contrast, small droplets leave droplet nuclei (i.e. dry residuals after total or partial evaporation) (Asadi et al. 2020; Borouiba 2020) . Droplet nuclei, containing virus aggregates, are aerosols that could stay suspended in air for long time, potentially contributing to airborne transmission (Allen and Marr 2020; Martano 2020; Morawska and Cao 2020; Tang et al. 2021) .",

However, there is a limited number of studies that investigate this aspect in real outdoor and indoor conditions, so that modelling is often applied (Buonanno et al. 2020; Feng et al. 2020; Lelieveld et al. 2020; Belosi et al. 2021) . In residential outdoor conditions, with the exclusion of crowded areas or location near important sources like hospitals or quarantine areas, there is a number of evidences that air samples tested negative (i.e. concentrations under detection limits) or showed low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in atmospheric particles of different sizes Hu et al. 2020; Chirizzi et al. 2021; Dunker et al. 2021; Passos et al. 2021; Pivato et al. 2021) . This suggests that the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 in outdoors is limited if physical distancing form relevant sources is maintained and crowds avoided. The same conclusion was obtained by the modelling results of outdoors concentration of virus-laden particles in Lombardy (northern Italy) during the first wave of pandemic (Belosi et al. 2021) .",

This underlines that there are difficulties in comparison of results obtained in different studies for several reasons: (i) the strength of the source (number of infected individuals); (ii) the absence of a standard measurement protocol (Borges et al. 2021; Pan et al. 2019; Robotto et al. 2021 ); (iii) the influence of specific mitigation strategies; (iv) the role of mechanical ventilation in the different indoors environments and the size of the rooms. For efficient reduction of the spread rate of COVID-19, it is important to assess risks of airborne transmission in community indoor environments, such as department stores, shopping centres, food supermarkets, public transport vehicles, restaurants, pharmacies, hair salons, schools and universities, and cinemas and theatres. In addition, it is relevant to understand if the COVID-19 contrasting measures applied in the different indoor environments (such as ventilation, filtration, use of facemasks, and limitations to the number of simultaneous customers) could effectively reduce these risks in different countries and different cities of the same country. These aspects are essential to plan future strategies or to correct ongoing strategies. Measurements of viral particle concentrations in real world conditions in these environments are very sparse so that, often, risks are evaluated with modelling approaches (Buonanno et al. 2020; Lelieveld et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2021) . Recently, Xu et al. (2021) investigated the airborne infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 in 111,485 US public and private schools, evaluating the impacts of different mitigation strategies. Results indicated that, among the considered strategies, air filtration was the most effective, with average infection risk over 30% less than the risk levels estimated with the use of increased ventilation and hybrid learning strategies.",

A recent study on a bus, during normal operations in Chieti (Central Italy), collected samples in the first wave of pandemic when restrictions policies were enforced and reported that all samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (Di Carlo et al. 2020) . The authors interpreted these negative results as a consequence of the restrictions on the maximum number of passengers, and the use of open windows during bus operation to increase ventilation that effectively reduced airborne transmission risks. In Moreno et al. (2021) , six PM 2.5 (i.e. particles with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm) samples were collected in subway trains in June 2020. One sample was found positive for one of the three genetic targets of SARS-CoV-2 searched with RT-PCR and one sample for two genetic targets. Maximum estimated concentration was 23.4 copies m \u22123 . In the same period (i.e. June 2020), also six air samples were collected in buses during normal operation, and one sample was found positive for one of the three genetic targets with a concentration of 1.4 copies m \u22123 . This would suggest that airborne transmission in public transport could be an issue mainly in underground services. Hadei et al. (2021) investigated community indoor environments in Iran collecting 28 air samples, in different indoor sites that were found to be positive to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 64% of the cases, but no details on viral particle concentrations were reported. Correlation of positivity rates with the use of masks and the number of people were not statistically significant even if it was observed a slight increase with the number of people suggesting that limitations of customers allowed in indoors could reduce risk of airborne transmission.",

These environments have been chosen because they were open also during lockdown or when restrictive measures applied (even if with some limitations) and were usually frequented by the public for everyday needs. A summary of the samples collected at the different sites, for the determination of the SARS-COV-2 genetic (RNA) material, is reported in Table 1 . At all sites analysed some restrictions were enforced to limit COVID-19 spread. Specifically, it was compulsory to maintain the physical distancing, there were limits to the maximum number of people simultaneously present indoor, and access was allowed only with body temperature < 37.5\u00b0C. It was compulsory to wear masks in all sites, with the exclusion of the canteen (site S4) in which masks were used to enter the premise and whenever a customer leaves the table, but masks were not used during lunches. Samples were collected using active sampling on quartz filters. This choice was done because it allowed using the methodology already developed for outdoor sites in a previous study (Chirizzi et al. 2021 ). In addition, sampling on filters is used in several studies that found both samples positive to SARS-CoV-2 (Kayalar et al. 2021; Setti et al. 2020 ) and samples negative (Chirizzi et al. 2021; Linillos-Pradillo et al. 2021; Passos et al. 2021; Pivato et al. 2021 .",

The site S1 was the internal gallery of the Venice-Mestre train station (Fig. S1 , supplementary material) in which samples were collected for about 12 h during the day (roughly between 7am and 7pm) and during the night (between 7pm and 7am) to compare periods with different numbers of travellers. During the prepandemic period, the train station was populated by about 80,000 people per day, and considering the decrease in the number of people (about 90%, data provided by Grandi Stazioni Rail), we can estimate a flow of 8000 people per day. The site S2 (Fig. S2 , supplementary material) was the supermarket Interspar, in the city centre of Mestre-Venice, in which PM 10 samples were collected during diurnal opening hours (roughly between 8am and 8pm). The volume of the supermarket was 18,861 m 3 and the influx was about 2300 customers per day, with a total influx, during the sampling period, of 13,600 customers. The supermarket management estimated a decrease of the number of customers of about 25% compared to the pre-pandemic period, mainly due to lack of tourists. The site S3 was the supermarket Punta Gialla (A&O), located at Cavallino-Treporti, in the metropolitan city of Venice (Fig. S3 ), in which diurnal PM 10 samples were taken during opening hours, roughly between 8am and 8pm. The influx was about 1500 of customers per day (total influx S5a Shopping centre 17-24 November 22.9 14 PM 10 filters (7 diurnal and 7 nocturnal) and 1 blank filter S5b Shopping centre 14-21 December 22.9 13 PM 10 samples (6 diurnal and 7 nocturnal) and 2 blank filters S6 Hair salon 28 Nov.-04 Dec. 6.2 4 TSP diurnal samples and 1 blank filter S7 Pharmacy 9-14 December 6.5 5 TSP diurnal samples and 1 blank filter during the sampling period of about 6000 customers), and no significant reduction of customers was noticed by the supermarket management. The volume of the supermarket is 3520 m 3 (1100 m 2 of surface area for a height of 3.2 m), and it is equipped with a mechanical ventilation system. In Emilia-Romagna, total suspended particle (TSP) samples were taken using quartz fibre filters (47 mm in diameter) with a low-volume (61.7 L min \u22121 ) sampler (Zambelli Explorer pump). Mass and particle number concentrations were obtained by means of an optical particle counter (Grimm, mod. 11-A). Measurements were taken in the canteen of the National Research Council (CNR), an environment ( Fig. S4 ) of about 1700 m 3 (500 m 2 of surface area for a height of 3.4 m) equipped with a ventilation system with an airflow of 6250 m 3 /h able to perform about 3.7 air exchange per hour (AER). The average number of customers in the sampling period was 159 per day (range 144-172 per day). Access is allowed to a maximum of 28 people every 15 min. Each sample was taken for 2.5 h during distribution of lunches between 12am and 2:30pm, in addition, two background samples were taken between 9am and 12am (duration 2.5 h like the others) when the canteen was open, but before distribution of lunches.",

The site S5a and S5b are the same indoor environment (commercial centre of Cavallino in Lecce) in which PM 10 samples were collected with a low-volume (38.3 L min \u22121 ) sequential sampler (Zambelli Explorer Plus) in two different periods. The two measurement periods correspond to two different restrictive policies for containment of COVID-19 spread (see the \"Epidemiological information and restriction policies during the measurements\" section). In this site, samples were taken during diurnal opening hours (roughly between 9am and 9pm) and during nocturnal closure hours (between 9pm and 9am). The shopping centre includes 25 shops, 2 eating places, and 1 supermarket for a total volume of 14,448 m 3 . Mechanical ventilation insured a flow rate of 72,000 m 3 h \u22121 with about 5 exchange of air per hour. The sampler was located in the gallery in front of the main entrance/exit of the supermarket (Fig. S5) where most of the customers are passing through. The shopping centre had a total influx of about 30,000 customers during the sampling period S5a that raised to about 80,000 in the sampling period S5b. The maximum number of people simultaneously inside was of about 1400 customers. The site S6 (Fig. S6 ) was a hair salon (Lounge Parrucchieri Philosophy) in Lecce with a volume of 280 m 3 relying on natural ventilation (also maintaining the doors open during pandemic) and with a maximum number of three customers simultaneously allowed inside. During the measurement period, it had an average of 4 customers per day with an estimated reduction of 30% compared to the pre-pandemic period. In this site, samples were collected with an in-house built manual TSP sampler operating at low-volume (13.4 L min \u22121 ) during opening hours roughly between 9:30am and 5pm. The site S7 was a pharmacy (Fig. S7) in Lecce (Moschettini) with a volume of 410 m 3 and a maximum number of six customers simultaneously allowed inside. Mechanical ventilation insured 920 m 3 h \u22121 for about 2.2 air exchanges per hour. In site S7, samples were taken during opening hours, roughly between 9:30am and 5:30pm. The average number of daily customers during the measurements was 280 (range 252-305) with no significant changes compared to the same period of the year 2019.",

In the present study, real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was carried out on a CFX96 TM Real-Time system (Bio-Rad, Italy) using GeneFinder TM COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit (OSANG Healthcare, Korea). The GeneFinder TM COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit is a One-Step real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) multiplex assay based on fluorescent-labelled probe used to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by amplification of RdRp, N, and E genes. The kit provides all the reagents required for the analysis, PCR positive and PCR negative controls included. Five microliters of extracted RNA was added to 15 \u03bcL of master mix for each sample and analysed according to kit instructions. Undiluted and 1:10 diluted samples were tested. In each run, two negative controls (molecular grade water) and a positive control were added. The interpretation of the sample results was done according to kit instructions. In detail, a sample was considered positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 when the Ct for at least one or both of the RdRp or N genes was \u2264 40. The limit of detection (LOD) of the GeneFinder TM COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit was declared by the manufacturer in 10 copies/reaction, equal to 2 copies/\u03bcl for all genes.",

The method consists in a duplex targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 and the housekeeping gene RNAse P, as reported by CDC, into a single assay multiplex to enable a one-well reaction. The reaction mixtures were separated into approximately 20,000 droplets using a QX200 Droplet Generator TM (Bio-Rad, Italy) with random dispersal of target nucleic acids into the droplets. The PCR assays were performed in a C1000 Touch TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Italy). After amplification, the droplets were individually assayed using the QX200 TM Droplet Reader TM . The fluorescence data were then analysed by the QuantaSoft v1.7 Software (Bio-Rad, Italy) to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen.

Results indicate a recovery of 69% (\u00b1 8% standard error) for the first set of filters immediately extracted after spiking (with no effects of sample conservation). The recovery of the second set of filters, those conserved at \u221225\u00b0C , gave a recovery of 62% (\u00b1 14% standard error), thereby comparable with the first set. This means that conservation at \u221225\u00b0C did not significantly change the recovery. The third set gave a slightly lower recovery, equal to 54% (\u00b1 13% standard error), suggesting that the use of filters inside the sampler reduces the recovery. This value is in agreement with that observed in a previous study (Chirizzi et al. 2021 ). Our recovery is lower than the recovery (almost 100%) claimed in Passos et al. (2021) after a test on different sampling substrates that behaved similarly (cellulose nitrate filters, PTFE filters, and quartz filters). On the other hand, it is larger than the recovery (about 20%) observed in Hadei et al. (2021) with sampling on PTFE filters. It must be said that the relatively large standard errors in our data indicate a variability likely due to a matrix effect, for example residual fibres of the filters extracted during the procedure. Another aspect is that conservation at room temperature seems to significantly decrease the recovery, even if systematic tests are not available. Therefore, in order to improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and to make more comparable results obtained in different studies, it would be necessary to test recovery in different conditions and over different substrates developing an opportune protocol for sampling and conservation of samples. The necessity of a standardised protocol for sampling, conservation of samples, and analysis, is also mentioned by Yun et al. (2020) , Borges et al. (2021) , and by Robotto et al. (2021) .",

It spread all over Italy even if with different intensity in the different regions. This leads to the introduction of restrictive policies at national and regional levels in different periods (Fig. 1) in addition to the social distancing and no crowd measures already enforced since winter 2020. Specifically, on 13 October, at national level, the use of facemasks in outdoor and indoor environments, the closure of gyms and pools, the closure of congresses and limitations for parties and religious ceremonies, and the closure of discos were enforced. Limitation for restaurants and pub were enforced favouring delivery and take away. In addition, limitation to schools and university activities with use of distance learning was enforced. On 3rd November, regional restrictions were enforced on the basis of three \"colours\" (i.e. yellow, orange, and red) that correspond to different risk of the spread of contagion. In red regions (i.e. maximum risk), movements of people were not allowed (with exception for work, health, and emergency reasons); shops were closed with the exclusion of necessary shops (such as food markets); and restaurants were closed being allowed only delivery of take away until 10pm. In orange regions (i.e. intermediate risk), movements of people were allowed in the same municipality between 5am and 10pm, and shops were opened with the exclusion of restaurants (could operate only with delivery or take away) and commercial centres that are closed during weekends (and holydays). In yellow regions (i.e. low risk), the movements of peoples were allowed between 5am and 10pm, shops were opened including restaurants and bars (but limited to 6pm, afterwards only delivery or take away), and commercial centres closed during weekends and holydays with the exclusion of food markets. Figure 1 reports the daily number of new contagions (source, Italian Ministry of Health) in the three regions (bars) and in the three metropolitan areas (lines) in which samples were taken. The colour of the bars indicates the restrictions that were active during the different periods. Measurements in Venice (for sites S1, S2, and S3) were done in yellow periods; the site S4 in Bologna was studied in orange period; samples in site S5 in Lecce were taken in both orange period (S5a) and yellow period (S5b) for comparison. Site S6 was studied in orange period and site S7 in yellow period.",

The LOD (genome copies \u03bcL \u22121 ) was transformed in detection thresholds for atmospheric concentrations of viral particles (expressed in copies m \u22123 ) estimating the threshold of viral particles contained in a single filter (i.e. RNA copies per filter). This was done considering the total volume of extraction solutions. Results were successively normalised by the average sampled volume in each condition to obtain the thresholds. In sites S1, S2, and S3, located in Venice area, the estimated concentrations of virus-laden particles in PM 10 were < 1.3 copies m \u22123 . In site S4 in Bologna area, the estimated concentrations of virus-laden particles in TSP were < 4 copies m \u22123 .

The differences in the thresholds of the various sites (summarised in Table 2 ) are due to the different sampling times and flow rates being the LOD constant.

An average E of 7000 copies h \u22121 is evaluated assuming Cv=10 9 copies mL \u22121 (Buonanno et al. 2020) ; and assuming the size distribution of respiration droplets, divided in four size ranges (Morawska et al. 2009 ) and averaged between unmodulated vocalization and voiced counting; the inhalation rate for light exercise, averaged between male and female, equal to 1.38 m 3 h \u22121 (Adams 1993) . The emission rate used in these simulations is an average value already used in several other studies; there could be a high variability of the viral load and a strong dependency on the day of detection compared to the onset of COVID-19. In addition, there could be super-spreaders which have much higher emission rate that can create more critical situation sin indoor environments. The results of Eqs. (1) and (2) are linearly dependent on the emission rates so that the calculated concentrations will linearly increase with average emission rate. This emission rate is reduced by the use of facemasks. The filtration efficiency, for removal of particles, of every-day masks depends on eventual leakages, on the type of mask, and on the size of particles. We consider two types of masks, widely used by the public in everyday life: surgical masks and cotton masks. For surgical masks, the efficiency (Balachandar et al. 2020) for the four size ranges of respiratory particles considered here (i.e. the same range from 0.9 (at diameter of 0.8 \u03bcm) to 0.99 (at diameter of 5.5 \u03bcm); for cotton masks the efficiency ranges from 0.1 to 0.7 in the same size ranges (Balachandar et al. 2020) . The reduction on emitted viral load depends also on content of virus-laden aerosol in each one of the four size range that could be evaluated with the mentioned mass balance approach (Buonanno et al. 2020) .",

This regional data has been preferred in comparison to metropolitan value, for this site, because the canteen is used by CNR employees and a relevant fraction of them live in different towns and provinces of Emilia-Romagna region. Considering the average number of customers (159 per day), it is reasonable to expect, on average, 2 infected customers per day. Taking into account an average permanence time of 30 min, it is possible to think at two scenarios: the first is with two infected customers present in the same shift; the second is with one infected customer in two successive shifts. Using previous equations in the first scenario, the average concentrations in the sampling period will be 0.6 copies m \u22123 (the maximum will be 1.9 copies m \u22123 ); in this case, concentrations are obtained without use of facemasks. The maximum concentration is evaluated at the end of the concentration growing period (Eq. 1) equal to 30 min (i.e. the permanence time in scenario 1). The second scenario has a similar average but a lower maximum (1.1 copies m \u22123 after 60 min). In both cases, the average concentrations are quite low and compatible with the negative results obtained in collected samples.

In the worst conditions at the commercial centre studied in Lecce (S5a and S5b), 1400 customers were counted simultaneously present inside with an average permanence time variable between 30 and 60 min. This time is significantly larger than the time constant of the structure (about 12 min) so that it is reasonable to assume that an equilibrium concentration will be reached in these conditions. This will be 0.01 copies m \u22123 when surgical masks are considered, about 0.16 copies m \u22123 when cotton masks are considered, and 0.4 copies m \u22123 when facemasks are not used. These are very low concentrations, even if evaluated in the worst conditions, compatible with the negative tests found on PM 10 collected samples. The number of daily customers for the hair salon (site S6) is small; the probability to have an infected person during the sampling period is about 4%; thereby, it is reasonable to think that the negative results could also be due to the absence of infected people inside during the measurement period. It has also to be mentioned that customers are usually received with an agreed scheduling so that the probability to have two people inside simultaneously is essentially negligible.

In addition, it should be mentioned that samples were collected in a limited number of indoor environments and in specific periods so that they do not exclude that there could be other indoors, for example small and poorly ventilated, or other periods more critical regarding airborne concentrations of SARS-CoV-2.",

During the sampling periods at the different sites, national and regional measures to contrast COVID-19 spreads were enforced. In the different sites, 59 air samples were collected during diurnal hours when customers were present in the different indoor environments, and 23 background samples were taken in absence of customers. All collected air samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and no significant differences were observed comparing samples taken with and without customers in the different indoor environments studied, meaning that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were lower than the detection limits of the protocols used ( Table 2) . Modelling of expected average concentrations in the different environments, done using influx of customers data and local epidemiological information, indicated low values (i.e. < 0.04 copies m \u22123 when surgical masks are used and < 0.8 copies m \u22123 when cotton masks are used) for the different sites with the exclusion of the canteen in which no facemasks are used during the lunch and average concentration of 0.6 copies m \u22123 could be estimated. These values are compatible with the negative results obtained in collected samples.",
