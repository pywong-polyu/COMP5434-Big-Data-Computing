The T2 sessions were spaced within a week (patients: DBS on vs. off in counterbalanced order with at least 24h wash-out; controls: sessions two and three). N=7 patients completed all three testing sessions. Two additional patients completed T1 but only one of the T2 sessions (total n=9 for pre vs. post DBS analyses). Eight additional patients were only tested at T2 (in total n=15 for on vs. off DBS analyses). N=28 controls participated, with one control missing the final testing session (yielding n=27 for the corresponding analysis). Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, ten of the controls completed testing at T2 online. On each testing day, participants completed a temporal discounting task involving 140 choices between smaller-immediate (20 \u20ac) and largerbut-later rewards (individualized amounts ranging between 20.5 -80\u20ac, see methods). One trial per session was selected at random and paid out in cash or via timed bank transfer. Figure 1 .

A permutation-based group comparison using 10k randomly shuffled group labels revealed a significant increase in patients (permutation test: p = 0.01, Figure 3a , b).

This suggests that in addition to shortterm plasticity processes 22 , long-term ALIC/NAcc DBS 23 can interfere with the expression of inter-temporal preferences that are thought to rely on the this same circuitry 4,5,7,13 . While earlier reports noted effects of acute stimulation on risk-taking and impulsivity 24,25 (albeit with acute block-wise stimulation protocols), our longitudinal analysis revealed changes only following prolonged stimulation. Our data do not suggest a specific direction of change, nor do they reflect an association with a change in OCD symptoms. Rather, the data suggests a fundamental role of the nucleus accumbens region in maintaining preference stability over time. The exact cellular mechanisms underlying the DBS effects remain speculative 17,26 -potential effects range from DBS acting as an informational lesion, to changes in inter-regional functional connectivity 17 and a general modulation of oscillatory activity and in consequence pathological circuitry 26 .",

Here, c is the inflection point of the sigmoid (corresponding to the indifference point, i.e. the point of subjective equivalence between the delayed reward and the immediate reward at the respective delay D), and b is the slope.For delays with only larger-later choices, the indifference point was set to the midpoint between the immediate reward (20\u20ac) and the smallest available LL reward.
