As a result, prisons have become hotspots for recent COVID-19 outbreaks [2] . There has been a 21.4% increase in COVID-19 cases in prisons from July 13, 2020, to July 26, 2020, such that persons incarcerated are infected at nearly 4 times the rate of the general public, and prison staff is infected at two and half times the rate of the general public [3] . Despite the surge in COVID-19 cases, little is currently known about what factors are responsible for increased rates of prison-level cases and deaths. A better understanding would provide prison administrators, researchers, and healthcare professionals with valuable information for public health policy and planning as it relates to COVID-19 infections in state prisons.",

Secondary outcomes included prison-level predictors of latent profile membership (population, capacity, age of the prison, and staff levels 1 ). We excluded three prison facilities because they were identified as holding facilities for individuals that had recently violated parole and did not report COVID-19 data.

This suggests that there are COVID-19 prison hotspots, which may be connected to the overcrowding issue, understaffing, or other common characteristics that facilities share, such as resident demographics. For example, two prisons in the \"high-death\" profile are geriatric facilities (e.g., Duncan and Pack).

As well, the impact of person-level variables such as sex and preexisting health conditions warrants further evaluation. Second, the current study only examines Texas prison facilities and may not be generalizable to other state prison systems. However, we feel that because hundreds of thousands of lives may be at stake in prison systems across the world, these findings should not only inform policy on the prison system in Texas but globally. Third, data is updated daily; therefore, the number of tests, cases, and deaths of incarcerated individuals and staff will change as time progresses, and our results only capture data up to July 24, 2020.",
