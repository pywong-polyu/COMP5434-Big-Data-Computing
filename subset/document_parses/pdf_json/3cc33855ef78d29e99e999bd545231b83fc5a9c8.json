Detection of the viral RNA through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal or throat sample is the preferred method of diagnosis. Recent evidence has suggested that COVID-19 patients can shed the SARS-CoV-2 for several weeks. Herein, we report six cases of COVID-19 who had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 on repeat RT-PCR testing reaching up to 9 weeks. The spectrum of cases described ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A full understanding of the virus's transmission dynamics needs further research. Prolonged viral shedding currently has unclear implications on the management and isolation decisions-the role of the cycle threshold (Ct) value in guiding therapeutic decisions is yet to be clarified. More data on the relationship between Ct values and viral cultivation are needed, especially in patients with prolonged viral shedding, to understand the virus's viability and infectivity.",

Older age and increasing comorbidities are risks for higher mortality. 1, 2 Currently, many diagnostic tests are available for COVID-19 with variable sensitivities. 3 Nonetheless, viral RNA detection by reverse transcription-PCR remains the preferred method to establish the diagnosis. Serological detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using ELISA is also used for screening purposes and to identify past infection or immunity. However, its diagnostic value and accuracy are being evaluated. 3 Recent studies showed that patients could asymptomatically shed SARS-CoV-2 for weeks. 4, 5 Herein, we report six cases of COVID-19 who showed persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 on repeated RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab testing for varying durations, reaching 9 weeks after the initial diagnosis.",

His baseline blood investigation was remarkable for high inflammatory markers and mild transaminitis. Chest X-ray revealed left mid-zone consolidation with a cavitary lesion. He was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Given the cavitary lesion, tuberculosis (TB) was suspected, and sputum smear acid-fast bacilli confirmed the presence of mycobacterial infection. Thus, the patient was treated as a case of COVID-19 pneumonia and active pulmonary TB. TB culture showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive for first-line anti-TB drugs. He later developed a rise in liver enzymes suspected to be either secondary to TB drugs versus COVID-19-related hepatitis. Subsequently, he was shifted temporarily to second-line antituberculosis therapy until improvement in his liver enzymes. Re-swabbing was performed as per the protocol, and the patient tested persistently positive for a total of 62 days. Case 6. This is a 65-year-old man known to have chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on dasatinib. He presented with a short history of fever, productive cough, and dyspnea. The examination revealed low-grade fever, tachycardia, and bilateral rhonchi on chest examination. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lower lobe consolidation with effusion. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive, and he was subsequently diagnosed as a severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia and received antibiotics and antiviral drugs. His condition deteriorated further during his stay, requiring noninvasive ventilation and ICU admission for 7 days. He eventually improved and was stepped down to the general medical wards for post-ICU care. He continued to have positive PCR for 54 days from the initial positive test.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have structural proteins, including envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) proteins. Their replication and transcription are expressed from an open reading frame called ORF1ab, and RNA dependent on the RNA polymerase gene (RdRp). The ORF1ab, E, RdRp, N, and S genes are the targets used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 6 SARS-CoV-2 may be detected via an upper respiratory tract PCR sample a few days before symptom onset. Viral shedding persists for varying periods after symptoms' onset, with a study reporting a median duration of 11 days. 7 Newer evidence suggested the long-term shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the urine and stool of infected patients even when their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. 8, 9 Factors independently associated with prolonged respiratory viral shedding include fever (> 38.5\u00b0C), severe disease, old age (> 60), male gender, concomitant HTN, steroid use, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, and lack of antiviral drugs. 7, [10] [11] [12] [13] Although some investigators observed a longer duration of viral shedding in symptomatic patients, 14 our patients ranged from having an asymptomatic infection (case 1) to severe COVID-19 pneumonia (case 6). All had prolonged viral shedding ranging between 6 and 9 weeks, as depicted by PCR (Figure 1 ). The periods reported in our series are an underrepresentation of the exact shedding window. The shedding likely exceeded these periods as we calculated only from the first positive test till the last positive test; this excludes shedding before diagnosis and between the last positive and first negative tests. Interestingly, cases 5 and 6 had the most extended shedding window, which may be attributed to their immunosuppressed status (active pulmonary tuberculosis and CML on active chemotherapy, respectively). Two recently reported leukemia and lymphoma cases shed the virus for 70 and 60 days, respectively. 15, 16 The mechanism by which immunosuppressed status affects SARS-CoV-2 shedding is not well elucidated. 16 Nonetheless, derangement of T-cell immune function, which has a strong role in COVID-19 pathophysiology, is likely involved. 17 Similarly, impaired immunity and the accompanying increased viral load might have delayed resolution in diabetic patients in cases 1 and 4. 18 Bullard et al. 19 tried to describe the infectiousness through viral cultures and found that viable SARS-CoV-2 was cultured when the RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value was < 24 and within less than 8 days from symptoms onset. Singanayagam et al. 20 also found a strong correlation between the Ct value and viral load with a probability of retrieving viable virus, declining to 8% in samples with Ct > 35, and 6% 10 days after symptoms onset. In line with these findings, multiple Ct value cutoffs were used by different guidelines generating bodies to define the infectivity and guide isolation decisions, which has led to differences in reported COVID-19 prevalence. Nonetheless, RT-PCR positivity is a surrogate that does not necessarily indicate that an individual is infectious or is shedding live viruses. Moreover, the optimal Ct value cutoff is unknown. The CDC and the WHO do not recommend using a test-based strategy guided by the Ct value to ascertain infectivity, at least at this stage. 21, 22 At the time of this series, our local protocol initially mandated two negative PCR results, and it was revised later in the mid of our patient's observation to a single negative test. The adopted Ct value cutoff was 33 to guide isolation discontinuation decisions in hospitalized patients. Time lines of the nasopharyngeal PCR Ct value in our cases showed FIGURE 1. Schematic presentation of SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. This figure appears in color at www.ajtmh.org. that multiple gene loci fall under the infectious range (Supplemental Table 1 ). Median Ct values at 2 weeks and even above 6 weeks showed a CT value of less than 33, possibly suggesting high viral load. Most patients had persistent shedding despite symptoms' resolution; this could imply a carrier state and prolonged infectivity possibly exceeding 6 weeks. To review the possibility of reinfection or relapse in case 4, we analyzed his Ct values chronologically and assessed his Ct values using different genes. When this patient was discharged at 28 days, he had two negative results with the Thermo Fisher kit showing a Ct value > 40 on all gene locus (N, Orf, and S). After 18 days, he presented to the hospital again with clinical and radiological worsening with a Ct value of 32 in Roche E-gene. It is not clear whether this represents a relapse with the same virus with prolonged viral shedding or reinfection with a new virus from the community.",

More data on the relationship between viral and Ct values are needed, especially in patients with prolonged viral shedding, to assess the virus's viability and infectivity.",
