In the absence of clear organizational imperatives or institutional supports, what provides the broad contours of a workable imaginary? Using interview data from small business owners in Argentina, I show that the form and content of generational memories of crisis influence the uptake of entrepreneurial discourse and apprehensions of economic risk. Older business owners draw upon their collective memory of the 2001-2002 economic crisis to engage in a process of adversarial personification that posits the macroeconomy as a cunning enemy and positions them as strategic actors. Conversely, younger small business owners-who did not live through these economic shocks as small business owners-draw upon the entrepreneurial ethos that they collectively cultivate through generational communities of practice to engage in a process of empowered distancing that minimizes the severity of economic crisis. Using Kenneth Burke's theoretical schema to identify grammars of motive and action, I show how older business owners deploy a generationally shared narrative to develop a conceptualization of economic agency that does not derive from the entrepreneurial ethos. By arguing that collective memory generates economic subject positions, this article demonstrates that the \"use value\" of collective memory lies not only in its uptake by politicians, journalists, and activists engaged in political projects, but also in the everyday ways that economic actors use narratives about the past to develop strategies of risk management in the present.",

These structural shifts have prompted the emergence of a distinct 'entrepreneurial ethos' consisting of discourses and techniques of self-fashioning animated by ideas of personal responsibility (Kelly, 2016; Rose, 1992) . Indeed, the individualization of the risk burden-understood as known threats that individuals orient themselves towards and interact with--is a defining feature of contemporary social, and in particular, economic life (Beck, 1992; Garland, 2003) . While the social sciences have shown how the individualization of the risk burden manifests in distinct instantiations of the entrepreneurial ethos within specific workplaces (Ho, 2009; Neff, 2012; Smith, 2001; Snyder, 2016) and institutional forums (Elyachar, 2005; Fridman, 2016; Lane, 2011; Sharone, 2013) , we have only begun to explore how risk orientations in the sphere of work are shaped in the absence of proximate structuring institutions that strongly incentivize the uptake of the entrepreneurial ethos. What structures the strategies and plans of economic actors who are largely dis-embedded from such forms of institutional support?",

Actors must imagine their desired future and develop plans of action based on that imaginary. Yet, beyond the effect of mediating institutions, what provides the broad contours of a workable imaginary? I find that economic actors rely on collective memories and the generational communities that crystalize around them as they develop strategies of action in the face of uncertainty. Using data from interviews conducted in 2016 and 2017 with independent small business owners in a peripheral region of Argentina, I argue that the form and content of generational memories of crisis influence the uptake-or lack thereof-of entrepreneurial discourse and apprehensions of economic risk. I suggest that by conceptualizing the subject positions created by collective memory as economic subject positions, we can better understand how patterned interpretations of risk emerge in the absence of structuring institutions.",

Conducting interviews amidst multiple sharp devaluations of the Argentine peso, I hypothesized that how my interlocutors-a mix of merchants (comerciantes), service providers (intermediarios), and craftsmen (artesanos)-made sense of risk would vary on the basis of their position vis-\u00e0-vis supply chains and consumers and how this exposed or insulated them from the ravages of inflation. Rather than different positions in the market, I found that respondents diverged by age in the narratives of risk they articulated. Respondents above the age of thirty-five engaged in a narrative process that I term adversarial personalization wherein they defined risks by personifying the macroeconomy as a cunning enemy whose next attempt to undermine them they must anticipate before it happens. For the older generation, the collective memory of experiencing the 2001-2002 crisis as small business owners forms an overwhelming directing perception toward the macroeconomy that evokes the specific set of embodied competencies and dispositions they cultivated in the face of the unique challenges their businesses confronted. Given the strength of their adversary, to protect their businesses from going under they draw on these competencies and dispositions that they developed in the face of previous crises.",

Consequently, they engaged in a narrative process of empowered distancing wherein they minimize the severity of the risks inflation and recession pose to their business by arguing that there is no use in paying close attention to the fluctuations of an macroeconomy that has always been volatile and unpredictable. By establishing this discursive boundary between themselves and the risks posed by the macroeconomy, they focused their narratives on their dedication to honing the unique skills required to produce superior goods or services, thereby portraying themselves as engaged in an empowering process of entrepreneurial selfrealization that they believe will ultimately yield financial success.",

Conceptualizing the subject positions created by collective memory as economic subject positions reveals how generational dynamics influence the processes through which distinct economic actors and risk perceptions are co-constructed in an unstable, crisis prone economy. This article therefore further develops our understanding of the cultural micro-foundations of economic action. While the concept of imaginaries demonstrates how agency gets deployed in the face of risk and uncertainty, we need to further explore how particular imaginaries emerge, stabilize, and change in concrete settings. By employing dramatism as an analytical strategy to detect subtle differences in how small business owners articulate economic agency, this article develops the concept of economic imaginaries by anchoring it in its social, temporal, and cultural roots.",

In this view, work is transformed into a core vehicle for self-actualization as it provides continuous opportunities to self-manage and cut ties of dependency (Kelly, 2016; Rose, 1992) . Enterprise culture has therefore reconfigured the traditional view of entrepreneurship-as a form of self-employment that involves assuming total responsibility for managing the risks incurred by working-by pushing workers of all types to transform work into an entrepreneurial endeavor by actively pursuing risky work opportunities (Freeman, 2014) . Even if taking a particular risk does not yield the desired outcome, entrepreneurial subjects are urged to view failure as necessary part of the struggle to achieve personal fulfillment since happiness can only be achieved by engaging in conscious acts of choice (Fridman, 2016) . Identifying and reacting to the risks relevant to a particular work situation, however, involves complex interpretive work.",

The contemporary view of risk has its roots in Knight's ([1921] 1965) distinction between risk and uncertainty: economic actors seeking to make a profit must anticipate the future by distinguishing between potential future outcomes whose odds of occurring are known (risks) and potential future outcomes whose odds of occurring are unknown (uncertainties). Scholars employing Knight's distinction as a point of departure have argued that the type of tool being used to calculate future probabilities determines whether risk calculations are objective or subjective: while experts use statistical instruments to objectively calculate risk by systematically analyzing information about past events, non-experts rely on feeling and intuition to make predictions about the future (Callon et al., 2001:19) . Viewing the distinction between objective and subjective risks as a binary one has been problematized on several fronts. Detailed qualitative analyses of the assumptions embedded in economists' statistical models reveal the inherently subjective nature of statistical calculations (Beckert, 1996) , while Beck (1992) points out that delegating the task of identifying and measuring risks to experts has resulted in a proliferation of expert frameworks that makes it difficult for economic actors to adjudicate between the validity of competing expert claims.",

As studies of financial workers have demonstrated, work environments place economic actors in situations where they are responding to these known threats in concert with others whose actions influence the probability of whether or not those threats occur (see e.g. Mackenzie and Milo, 2003) . These situations intensify the inherently reactive dimension of risk and make it strategically necessary for actors to rely more heavily on their personal observations and the observations made by members of their immediate environment in order to engage in the mutually reinforcing tasks of risk identification, calculation, and management (Garland, 2003) . Before economic actors can even adjudicate between the potentially conflicting perceptions of how to best respond to the risks they encounter, they must rely upon the social arrangements in their workplace and their industry more broadly to identify the risks relevant to their immediate situation by prioritizing certain risks and minimizing others (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982) .",

Studies ranging from knowledge workers in tech and finance (Ho, 2009; Neff, 2012; Snyder, 2016) to timber supply workers at a wood processing plant (Smith, 2001) reveal that across these diverse industries the organizational infrastructures of particular workplaces guide economic actors in how to actualize the entrepreneurial ethic in the context of their particular market position. Meanwhile, NGO initiatives (Elyachar, 2005) , financial and career self-help seminars (Fridman, 2016; Vallas & Christin, 2018) , and job-search groups (Lane, 2011; Sharone, 2013; Snyder, 2016) work to improve the employment outcomes of their participants by giving them the discursive building-blocks for developing an entrepreneurial orientation toward risk. Once actors identify a particular set of risks in their working environment as chances they are willing to take (Smith, 2001) , they no longer experience themselves as victims of uncertainties they have no control over. When economic actors identify particular risks as sources of threat whose potential consequences they are prepared to confront, they feel empowered by the knowledge that they are making active choices (Neff, 2012) . Deciding to willingly subject oneself to risk therefore represents a core mechanism through which the entrepreneurial ethic gets mobilized and subsequently expressed at work. As was the case with Wall Street investment bankers who pushed their clients to engage in risky mergers so that they could receive exorbitant end of year bonuses as a reward (Ho, 2009) , associating risks with opportunities justifies the decision to move from an attitude of risk aversion towards risk embrace (Smith, 2001) .",

These narratives both facilitate the development of the calculative capacities and concrete skills that actors believe they require to convert risks into opportunities and enable them to do emotional work upon themselves in order to sever ties of dependency and become less risk averse (Fridman, 2016) . Narratives of agency therefore codify the strategies and skills that actors cultivate in the face of the particular risks they confront in the sphere of work, yet, beyond their strategic dimension these narratives also possess a performative dimension (Alexander, 2011) . By telling heroic stories about themselves confronting difficult workplace challenges by exerting almost superhuman levels of energy and skill (Snyder, 2016) \"actors engage in performances that project meanings\" for themselves and others in the hopes of bolstering their efficacy in the face of difficult challenges (Alexander, 2011:484) . By imagining themselves as capable of otherworldly feats of strength, actors draw upon the realm of myth and symbols in the hopes of increasing their chances of successfully converting risks into opportunities (Wherry, 2014) . Thus, different types of agents take shape via the stories that economic actors tell about themselves. The entrepreneurial ethic facilitates the co-construction of risk and economic subjects via narrative.",

Given this, they develop imaginaries of a desired future state that serves as a placeholder for a future that uncertainty renders opaque (Beckert, 2013) . Then, they create a story that guides their action by outlining the series of causally linked steps they will need to take to realize their desired future. Though these narratives are necessarily fictional, they must seem plausible to effectively motivate action and thus draw heavily on the economic theories, models, plans, instruments, and forecasts that are available in any particular institutional macrostructure. Therefore, though actors endeavor to transform reality by harnessing the power of symbol and metaphor, the scope of this transformation is limited by the reliance of their narratives upon the economic descriptors these tools provide.",

First, these scholars assume the global convergence of structural and ideological factors has been so total that economic actors across diverse sectors of society have developed an entrepreneurial ethic that obligates them to deploy their agency in similar ways. Actors are portrayed as being averse to attending closely to the macroeconomic trends that have the potential to undermine their ability to realize their goals. Instead, they aim to cultivate the agential qualities that will allow them to succeed regardless of what happens in the macroeconomy by transforming their work into a project of selfrealization. However, in order to make this claim, these scholars examine market positions associated with strong organizational imperatives, characterized by both employing organizations or particular industries more broadly. Similarly, scholars of unemployment acknowledge that economic actors increasingly find themselves in the position of negotiating risk in the absence of clear organizational imperatives, yet by focusing on how the precariously employed seek to fill this gap by exposing themselves to the organizational discourses of self-help forums, they cannot demonstrate how these discourses translate into actual risk orientations employed in the sphere of work (see e.g. Sharone, 2013; Fridman, 2016; Vallas & Christin, 2018) .",

Ethnographers interrogating the experience of small business owners outside of the US have challenged the view that the entrepreneurial ethos represents a commonsense narrative that actors have readily at hand (Elyachar, 2005; Freeman, 2014; Vargas, 2014) . Rather than portraying small business owners' orientations toward work as local manifestations of the hegemonic global discourse of entrepreneurship, they describe how design entrepreneurs in Buenos Aires and a small business owners embedded in multiple sectors of the economy in Barbados (Freeman, 2014; Vargas, 2014 ) draw on pre-existing national, cultural discourses that celebrate resilience and creative improvisation to make sense of what it means to embody the entrepreneurial ethos in their particular national context. Whereas these cases identify an elective affinity between national cultural discourses of resilience and the discourse of entrepreneurship, established small business owners in Cairo, Egypt who view their expertise as the product of embodied practices that have sedimented overtime and painstakingly cultivated local networks are therefore skeptical of the value of the knowledge they would gain by participating in an entrepreneurial education program in exchange for receiving a sizable loan from a global NGO (Elyachar, 2005) . Importantly, these studies call attention to the role that national cultural discourses and individual experiences accumulated over time play in structuring the orientation toward work of the self-employed.",

The interactive process through which collectively remembered narratives are constructed and consolidated demonstrates how an individual's recollection of a past event becomes increasingly difficult to disaggregate from these collective narratives as time passes. Even though individuals employ their personal experience of the event as a core frame of reference when remembering, they \"do not know the past singly; they know it with and against other individuals situated in different groups and through the knowledge and symbols that predecessors and contemporaries transmit to them\" (Schwartz, 2008:11; cited in Corning & Schuman, 2015) . Historically salient events also incite the work of \"moral entrepreneurs\" who codify their interpretation of the event in a generic cultural form: a speech, a polemical newspaper article, a comic book, a ceremony, a building, or a memorial (Shils, 1965: 201; cited in Wagner Pacifici, 1996) . Often, it is the content of these generic forms-the distinctive vocabularies, tropes, images and grammatical forms that \"moral entrepreneurs\" employ-that provide the building blocks of the narratives that individuals tell about their past experiences (Olick, 1999) . Though all collectively remembered narratives must be viewed as a product of the \"range and timbre of voices that effect the translation of event into collective memory through forms,\" the narratives that generational communities develop in the wake of having experienced a historically significant event foreground the role that personal experience plays in the development of collective memory (Wagner Pacifici, 1996: 307) .",

            "text": "The 2001-2002 crisis in Argentina exemplifies the propensity of an event to produce \"lifetime effects\" through its multiple stages the and the scope of the social, political, and economic devastation it left in its wake. Prior to the 2001-2002 crisis, Argentinian citizens confronted three prior outbreaks of economic crisis in 1975, 1977-1982, and 1989-1990 that all involved sharp devaluations of the local currency followed by inflationary crisis and political collapse (Fridman, 2016) . Even though these cyclical crises had forced the population to develop strategies to defend their purchasing power and protect their investments (Fridman, 2010; Neiburg, 2006 Neiburg, , 2010 , nobody was prepared to deal with the unprecedented scope of the 2001-2002 crisis. The crisis erupted towards the end of 2001 after three consecutive years of recession created a liquidity crisis that prompted the national government to mandate that bank account holders could not remove more than $250 USD from their accounts (Blustein, 2006) . With significantly less cash circulating in the economy, the recession worsened, and marginalized populations responded by looting supermarkets throughout the country (Auyero, 2007) . In an effort to quell escalating popular discontent, then President Fernando de la Ru\u00e1 resigned in December and four different presidents succeeded him in the span of only two weeks. In early 2002, all bank depositors who held savings in dollars were given the option to either convert their savings a significantly reduced amount of pesos or to accept a government bond of nominal value. In response, social unrest further intensified as depositors gathered in front of banks demanding that their money be returned to them (Fridman, 2016) . By May of 2002 unemployment reached 21.5% and the estimated rate of poverty in urban areas was 53% (Fiszbein et al., 2003) .",

Investors who had lost a significant portion of their savings perceived the crisis as proof that Argentina had permanently lost its place in the world as a modern, progressive nation: the four consecutive outbreaks of crisis that had occurred approximately every ten years for the last forty years confirmed that the only guarantee was that another severe crisis could be expected in the future (Visacovsky, 2010) . 1 Ordinary citizens also interpreted statistics that were widely circulated in the wake of the crisis about how Argentina had become one of the riskiest countries in the world to invest in as evidence of the decisive disruption of the nation's linear, upward trajectory (De Santos, 2009; Zerubavel, 2003) . This narrative of cyclical crisis justified their decision to convert all of their savings held in pesos to dollars that they either hoarded at home or invested in real estate since home purchases were transacted exclusively in dollars (D'Avella, 2014; Visacovsky, 2010; Zaiat, 2012) . When analyzing the investment practice of dollar hoarding, D'Avella (2014) has argued that its link to narratives about crisis is so fundamental that, in Argentina, stories about the past must be seen as good investments in and of themselves, for Argentines believe that remembering the nation's chaotic economic past can provide a crucial source of economic security in the present. These financial practices therefore involve \"forms of habitual skilled remembering\" that retain \"a past in mind that, without ever adverting to its historical origin, nevertheless reenacts the past in our present conduct. In habitual memory the past is, as it were, sedimented in the body\" (Connerton, 1989: 72) .",

            "text": "When seeking to demonstrate usability of collective memories in the present (Maines et al., 1983; Zelizer, 1995) , scholars of collective memory have focused largely on how different groups struggle to develop and consolidate particular interpretations of the past in order to advance political projects (see e. g. Jansen, 2007; Schudson, 1992; Polletta, 1998) . These struggles reveal how politicians and public figures seek to establish the upper hand in these debates by drawing on the specific vocabularies, tropes, and grammatical forms developed by \"moral entrepreneurs\" in the context of previous events in order to convince the public to support their prescribed course of action in the present (Olick, 1999) . The narratives that politicians tell about past events seek to articulate the values associated with their movement and equip their supporters with the \"cognitive, affective, and moral orientation\" required to realize them in the context of current struggles (Schwartz, 1996: 910) . The 2001-2002 crisis provides an opportunity to expand the insights developed in these examinations of the \"use value\" (Jansen, 2007) of collective memory by moving beyond the political sphere and exploring how small business owners in rural Argentina draw the narrative of cyclical crisis to orient themselves in the sphere of work. Given that generations who experience a \"lifetime events\" during their formative years will interpret the event differently than the generational cohorts that come of age in the wake of the lifetime event (Corning & Schuman, 2015; Schuman & Scott, 1989) , interrogating this question demonstrates how the \"use value\" of collective memories has the potential to differ across generations.",

Small business owners across all sectors of the Argentine economy share forms of structural vulnerability that include low access to credit loans, lack of integration into chains of supply and demand that go beyond their regional economy, and lack of access to information about technology and relevant economic trends (Kulfas, 2011) . Since they are more vulnerable to exogenous shocks than larger businesses, their operations were the first to experience growth when the economy began to recover after the 2001-2002 crisis, and they also registered the first significant profit losses when the national economy began to stagnate during the global crisis of 2008 (Pont, 2009) . The sitting president of ABBRA-a National Bank initiative that partnered with private banks to offer government backed loans to small businesses-told me that increasing the availability of affordable loans was the best way the government could buffer these businesses against vulnerability, yet acknowledged that ABBRA has not yet succeeded in making affordable loans readily available outside of Buenos Aires. Juxtaposing the official portrayal of small businesses as a core engine of economic development in Argentina (Ministerio de Producci\u00f3n y Trabajo, 2019), ABBRA's president went on to echo what I was told by a member of former president Cristina Kirchner's economic advisory team: that self-employment often represents a response to decreasing formal employment opportunities since historically rates of self-employment spike during economic crises. 2 During the period when I conducted my interviews, economic conditions increasingly resembled those of the 2001-2002 crisis. When I conducted my first set of interviews in early 2016, a 40% devaluation of the peso (from 9 ARS/USD to 14 ARS/USD) implemented in December 2015 had just catalyzed a spike in national inflation (Reuters, 2015) . Inflation worsened progressively throughout 2016, resulting in an annual inflation rate of 40% (CEPALSTAT, 2020). That same year, the Macri administration removed energy subsidies, causing the price of electricity to increase between 200 and 300% (Smink, 2016) . In 2017, as I conducted my second round of interviews, prices increased at a rate of 25%, driven in part by another devaluation of the peso (from 14 ARS/USD to 17 ARS/USD) (CEPALSTAT, 2020). These interrelated sources of economic volatility decreased the purchasing power of potential customers, while a significant reduction in import restrictions flooded the market with cheap imported goods and made buying nationally produced products even more cost prohibitive. The removal of energy subsidies translated into significantly higher transportation costs and utility bills for small business owners, and rising interest rates meant that taking out a loan would not do much to defray increased expenses (Carrillo, 2019) .",

Citing the high rate of business turnover as evidence, he argued that the depressed purchasing power of local residents and the presence of national chain stores that could offer cheaper products made it difficult for small business owners to survive. 3 Municipal authorities tasked with monitoring commercial activity told me that the municipality's engagement with small businesses was limited to ensuring that all businesses operating out of a storefront visible from the street had registered their operation and were therefore paying taxes at the municipal, provincial, and national levels.",

The sample consisted of ten merchants, thirteen service providers, and seventeen craftsmen. 4 I designed this sample in order to trace how vulnerability to the risks generated by inflation and recession varied by market position. Craftsmen described being highly vulnerable to inflation since devaluations increased the costs of the raw materials required to manufacture their products. Unlike craftsman, merchants could profit off inflation if they purchased a large stock of items at a pre-inflated price and then subsequently sold it several months later at the inflated price; however, if recession also significantly worsened during this period of time then they risked not having the money to pay their providers for these goods when payment came due. Finally, service providers described how their low degree of reliance on primary materials made them less vulnerable to inflation, yet since the majority of them produced non-essential services they suffered during severe recessions when potential clients opted to limit all forms of unnecessary consumption.",

Most interviews took place after-hours in the respondents' workplace in order to evoke respondents' lived experience of risk by asking them to describe their practices of risk management in the spaces where they implemented them (Kusenbach, 2003) . Respondents were asked to describe how their ability to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers had changed during the last 6 months (cooperation problem), how the dynamics of their relationships with competitors had changed and whether their competitors had experienced the impacts of inflation and recession differently than they had (competition problem), and the factors that they took into account when deciding when and how to adjust their prices to reflect inflation and contraction in client demand (value problem) (Beckert, 2009) . When asking respondents how they had changed their daily practices and business strategies in an attempt to resolve these coordination problems, I probed for specific examples of the events that catalyzed these changes and attempted to get at the \"how\" of reconfiguring business strategies in the face of macroeconomic developments (Weiss, 1995) . To trace how their practices had evolved over time, I asked business owners to describe the history of their business: what the scale and scope of their businesses was like in the beginning and how the work they did then differed from the work they did now. Notably, the questions included no references to previous economic crises, and all connections between current economic conditions and previous episodes of crisis were made by the respondents themselves.",

In response to interview questions about multiple potential risks, respondents tended to focus on describing how they related to the risks that they believed they had the agential capacity to confront effectively. Though the uniquely performative dynamics of the interview encounter make it impossible to know if business owners were able to implement their risk management strategies as effectively as they claimed to, I interpreted their decision to minimize the severity of certain risks by focusing on discussing others as indicative of the role that acts of narrative sense-making play in organizational contexts more broadly. Members of any organization \"need to sense how their action unfolds and alters the field in subtle and overt ways\" (Cunliffe & Coupland, 2012: 82) . They engage in acts of self-narration not only to describe and reinforce who they already are as agents, but also endeavor to more fully bring into being an idealized vision of the self that they associate with a particular subject position (Kerby, 1991) . Inevitably, these acts of narrative sense-making involve adjudicating between a plurality of narratives that describe how agents can modify the field in the context of their organization, a challenge that becomes even more central for small business owners operating in the absence of clear organizational imperatives or institutional supports (Cunliffe et al., 2004) .",

Dramatism posits that when we assign meaning to social situations, we rely on a basic grammar of motives. This grammar of motives encompasses the patterned ways we approach situations we seek to master by \"[naming] their structure and outstanding ingredients and [naming] them in a way that contains an attitude towards them\" (Burke, [1941] 1974: 1). We name these ingredients by offering some kind of answer to these five questions: \"what was done (act), when or where it was done (scene), who did it (agent), how he did it (agency), and why (purpose)\" (Burke, [1945 (Burke, [ ]1969 . Following Burke's lead, I therefore trace how respondents' sense of agency and purpose varies across generations by viewing them as agents who describe their business practices as acts that occur in the context of the scene evoked by my interview questions: an unstable macroeconomy generated by chronic inflation and recession. Once identified, I then analyze these agents, acts, and scenes relationally as binary ratios. By focusing on the scene-agent ratio and the scene-act ratio I reveal that an agent's ability to describe what agency entails in a particular context depends on whether they identify the motivational origin of their act as deriving from the properties that they themselves possess as agents or from the properties of the scene-or situation-in which they find themselves.",

In the majority of cases, respondent age correlated with work experience: most business owners over thirty-five began their business prior to or during the 2001-2002 economic crisis. This category includes 24 This segment of the sample includes 16 individuals (5 service providers, 9 craftsmen, and 2 merchants) with a median age of 28 and median time in business of two years. In defining these respective generational communities, I employ the 2001-2002 crisis as the critical event that serves as the repository of common experiences and the basis of narratives upon which actors can engage in personification and distancing (Mannheim [1928 (Mannheim [ ]1952 Corning & Schuman, 2015) . Rather than conceptualizing generational cohorts broadly across the entire population, previous work on the sociology of generations (Jennings, 1987; Schuman & Scott, 1989) suggests that generational narratives most effectively mediate the relationship between culture, history, and individual experience when cohorts are members of a localized community whose experience of the critical event possess similar dimensions. Given that the differential effects of the crisis based on class position have been well documented (Svampa, 2005) , I included in the sample only smaller businesses with access to similar types of economic resources, meaning that all members of these respective generational communities identified as members of either the middle or lower middle class and were therefore similarly vulnerable to the devastating impact of the crisis. Members of the 2001-2002 crisis generation all experienced the crisis as small businesses and argue that their position in production played a primary role in mediating their experience of the critical event. Conversely, members of the post crisis generation experienced the crisis and its after effects as the perpetual backdrop of their childhood and associate closely attending to the fluctuations of the macroeconomy with the antiquated perspective of their parents. Consequently, their level of removal from the immediate after effects of the crisis informs their stance of empowered distancing.",

Every 10 years there is a big crisis that knocks people down.\" As in the case of respondents interviewed in the wake of the 2001-2002 crisis (see D 'Avella, 2014; De Santos, 2009; Visacovsky, 2010) , Pedro and Martin view their current experience of inflation and recession as representative of a pattern of cyclical economic crisis. By recognizing this cyclical trajectory as inevitable, they can then acknowledge the necessity of anticipating the next crisis before it happens.",

Jorge, 64, does this when he describes the 2001-2002 economic crisis as a watershed event. Jorge arrived in Argentina from Uruguay in 1983 and worked under another optician manufacturing glass and assembling eyeglasses for over 10 years. When the owner of the optometry died in 1995, Jorge inherited the shop from him. He invested all of his assets into buying the blocks of crystal required to manufacture glass. However, when the crisis happened in 2001 his earnings dropped so low that he had to sell all of his existing stock to fill the few customer orders that were coming in. Since then, he has never managed to bring his profits up to a level that would allow him to begin manufacturing glass again. He survives by fixing broken eyeglasses, and only earns enough to pay expenses: \"I know that what happened to me also happened to hundreds of thousands of small business owners. I couldn't do anything, because what happens is that more than anything you feel the effects of the blow mentally, in your head. When your dreams get destroyed, when your dreams are liquidated, you find yourself without strength, without the desire to continue.\"",

He worked for years to expand to the level of his current operation: a large warehouse that stocks enough candy and snacks to employ multiple vendors, and a storefront where he sells his merchandise directly to the public. Despite his success, when a significant devaluation of the peso occurred in 2014, he had the \"worst ever\" year for his business. He could no longer depend on the loyalty of a well-established group of clients who only bought from him. Instead, these clients would only buy from the vendor who offered the lowest price. \"So, what do you have to do, you have to be willing to pull down your pants a little bit [accept that you are going to get fucked over]. You have to start offering discounts so you can make a sale.\" Despite some differences, both Ignacio and Jorge personify inflation and recession as opponents who have beaten and violated them when they describe past experiences of economic hardship. Personification occurs regardless of whether these blows have been dealt in one's more immediate or remote past. Consequently, the macro-economy intervenes in their grammars of motive as an adversarial counteragent they are wrestling with in their immediate proximity (Burke, [1945 (Burke, [ ]1969 .

Personifying inflation and recession therefore enable them to recognize the current risks generated by the macroeconomy as blows dealt by an adversary who has caused them major financial setbacks in the past.",

Ra\u00fal, who has owned and operated an artisan bakery since 2000, describes implementing an anticipatory practice when he noticed that his profits began to drop markedly earlier in 2015 during the months leading up to the December devaluation of the peso. He made plans to draw the attention of new customers by beginning to offer pizza and empanadas in addition to the artisan breads and pastas he already sells. He just completed the installation of the pizza oven in January 2016. He decides to do this now, before his profits dropped to alarming levels because, \"you cannot wait until the water rises so high that you drown. And you cannot start crying because the emotional dimension has to be put to the side when you are running a business\u2026the empanadas and the pizzas are some-thing that I did before. It's a card that I have hidden up my sleeve, and I am going to play it.\" Since business has been slow, Ra\u00fal also describes reducing the amount of hours his employees work to cut back on his fixed costs. Most older small business describe taking on responsibilities they previously delegated to their employees, evidencing how they endeavor to minimize the risk of unsustainable financial loss in a moment when business is slow by submitting their own bodies to more stress and hard work. Taken in sum, these were the most common practices employed to cope with inflation and recession. As Ra\u00fal suggests when he describes the pizzas and empanadas as a card hidden up his sleeve that he plans to play, since he imagines coming episodes of inflation and recession as encounters with a formidable opponent in a card game, the implementation of these practices enable him to move toward the future confident that he has the resources required to win the card game. Winning the game, however, requires, that one identify the appropriate moment to skillfully implement their protective practices. As Ra\u00fal acknowledges, if they don't pay as much attention to how and when they implement these practices as the substance of the practices themselves they risk allowing the water to rise so high that they drown.",

For Roberto, relying on back stock as source of economic security generates risk. As a small business owner, Roberto has: \"zero margin of error. I cannot make a bad investment. If I do it would be impossible for me to recover from the loss. So, I have to be very smart. I'll give you an example. With almost all of the products I sell, I average a 20% profit margin. Two weeks before Macri was elected, one of my providers told me his prices were about to increase by 20%. In anticipation of this, I doubled my usual order, to make sure I had enough stock to last me for the next two months. So, when the increase happened, I could make a 40% profit on all that stock because even though I paid the pre-inflated price for it, I marked it up based on the inflated price. But, I can only make that 40% profit if I sell all that stock. So, I have to invent business opportunities. I am constantly looking for opportunities to make a new sale. With this economy, I would be finished if I just sat in my office waiting for my business to come to me. So, I spend a lot of my day calling my clients and telling them about new products, making sure all their animals' needs are covered.

Sergio became a full partner in a graphic design business in 2016. He and his partner design custom advertising campaigns for local businesses that take three primary forms: sign manufacturing and installation, custom t-shirt and brochure design, and custom designs and logo painting services for cars. Originally from Concordia, he spent 10 years working as a laboratory assistant in the research division of a big pharmaceutical company in Buenos Aires. He decided to return home and seek out new business opportunities when he realized that working as a dependent employee would always mean having a \"ceiling\" beyond which he could not progress. Since he is not a graphic designer, he focuses on sign construction and installation.",

I know that I am very far from, from understanding the issue\u2026I don't want to say the exact issue, because it pretty rare this thing, I mean, I don't have the answer but it's very difficult from our, from our position to know with precision, if what we are doing is helping or hurting us. Yes, yes, our actions will have positive and negative consequences. Whether the good consequences, or even the bad ones, depend on the country doing well [economically], even if things are not going well for me, because sometimes things can be going well economically, but things can be going badly for me, I have to be aware of that as well.\" Sergio therefore maintains that his decision to not develop business strategies in response to the dynamics of the macroeconomy is not driven by willful self-denial or a na\u00efve belief in his own invulnerability. Similar to the sense of impotence that civic volunteers in the US professed when asked what they felt they could do to prevent nuclear war (Eliasoph, 1997) , Sergio believes that focusing his attention outward on inflation and recession is a waste of energy since only experts can grasp their operating laws. Therefore, just as many civic volunteers opt to volunteer time for local causes where they can have a discernable impact, Sergio endeavors to focus his attention on the work itself by reminding himself that at times businesses fail when the economy is thriving (Eliasoph, 1997) .",

Though they did not downplay the severity of the crisis, they argued that focusing so obsessively on the macroeconomy in its wake had only served to psychologically exhaust their parents and make them excessively risk averse. One respondent explicitly made the point that he had constructed his definition of self in opposition to the attitude of his parents (Shils, 1981) by stating, \"I just don't see the point of obsessing about the economy.

Hern\u00e1n opened the first traditional barbershop in Concordia in 2012. Unlike the other stylists with whom he attended local beauty school, he spent some time in the U.S. during high school where he had the opportunity to visit barbershops. He described them as spaces where getting a haircut felt like a cultural experience and told me how he still follows several of these barbershops on Instagram, viewing himself as a virtual member of a community of practice whose aesthetic and approach to haircutting he endeavors to replicate in Concordia (Wenger et al., 2002) . When I asked him about the difficulties he encountered during the process of establishing the barbershop, he responded: \"I knew that if I failed it would be my fault, and that if it went well it would also be my fault. So, I decided that things were going to go well for me\u2026Like for example, now that I have reached this level [of success], I just keep pushing myself to grow. I try to grow, grow, grow, all the time. Be better, better, better, better. Have the best equipment, the best scissors, the best everything, because, well, I want to get to that point. I want to become what I always dreamed about becoming, what I always say, that was something incredible\u2026.Yes, that's my philosophy, let's say, of work.\" Like Adriana, in Hern\u00e1n's narrative he will be successful if he focuses on what motivates him intrinsically, downplaying the impact of external economic forces. He therefore imagines a future in which his hard work will enable him to become the type of barber that he \"always dreamed about becoming.\" Focusing exclusively on developing his own qualities and capacities as an agent also provided him with the ability to explain negative business outcomes: failure, like success, is the product of how he conducts himself in the sphere of work itself. Like Adriana and Sergio, he framed this assumption of total responsibility as an opportunity to engage in a project of self-realization therefore \"[blurring] the boundaries between enterprise as business and the self as enterprise\" (Freeman, 2014: 208) . Sergio and Adriana describe their dependent employment experiences as constraining them, always obligating them to come in contact with a ceiling arbitrarily put in place by their employers. Conversely, all three of them viewed their businesses as opportunities to push themselves to face a challenge that will allow them to grow as people. Given this, the refusal to embrace this challenge in the face of difficult circumstances also posed a risk to their project of self-development for they will have failed to realize a core tenet of the entrepreneurial ethic: \"in response to an insecure market-take charge of your life, embrace challenge and reinvent yourself. Don't look outward but reflect inward and examine yourself\" (Freeman, 2014: 191-192) .",

Rather than reaffirming the inevitability of the entrepreneurial drawing inward and focusing on the self in the face of macroeconomic risk (Fridman, 2016; Neff, 2012; Sharone, 2013; Snyder, 2016) , this study finds that shared generational experiences of a critical event play a role in determining whether small business owners are prone to entrepreneurial patterns of thought and action. Both older and younger small business owners experienced the 2001-2002 crisis as a critical event that generated lifetime effects by fundamentally disturbing the functioning of their daily lives (Corning & Schuman, 2015) ; however, while the 2001-2002 crisis generation experienced these lifetime effects more directly, the post-crisis generation primarily bore witness to their parents' experience of these effects. Consequently, the use value of these collective memories differs across generations by serving as the repository of common experiences and the basis of narratives upon which the former engages in adversarial personification and the latter engages in empowered distancing. These divergent stances are conceptualized as grammars of motive that provide agents with two primary modes of conceptualizing agency in relation to their external environment: empowered distancing-which establishes a scene-agent ratio by stipulating that business strategies reflect the unique qualities of the agent executing them-and adversarial personification-which establishes a scene-act ratio by stipulating that business strategies should be developed as responses to and reflections of the economic environment the agent operates within (Burke, [1945 (Burke, [ ]1969 . Conceptualizing the risk orientations of the self-employed as grammars of motive reveals that divergent generational experiences-and the narratives associated with them-help explain both how small business owners relate to the distinct cultural discourses associated with their formative generational experiences and how they translate them into usable symbolic resources and risk management practices (see Table 2 ).",

Even though their particular experiences of the crisis varied, older business owners organize their orientation towards risk by engaging in a process of adversarial personification that relied on similar terms and tropes to characterize the macroeconomy (Olick, 1999; Schudson, 1992; Wagner-Pacifici, 1996) . They employ personification to turn a personal and collective experience of adversity into an adversary, taking an active stance that reinforces the necessity of paying close attention to current and pending macro-economic fluctuations. Drawing on the metaphor of the game, they argue that their practices will only serve their protective function if they are skillfully executed (Sharone, 2013) . Skillful execution involves imagining themselves playing a game that demands they employ a form of culturally specific common sense to guide them intuitively as they engage in strategic acts of hustling, wheeling, and dealing.",

            "text": "Respondents under thirty-five create discursive distance between themselves and the warnings implicit in the discourse of cyclical crisis by arguing that an unstable macroeconomy has been a perpetual backdrop of their lives. Since their entrance into the world of work coincided with the rise to prominence of political figures who celebrate entrepreneurship as the path to economic success (Natanson, 2016; Vommaro et al., 2015) and a subsequent popular interest in developing the subject position associated with this discourse (Fridman, 2016) , they employ the entrepreneurial discourse as an interpretive resource to justify their stance of empowered distancing. By relying on their virtual and immediate generational community of practice to inform how they orient toward the discourse of entrepreneurship, they endeavor to focus their energy on achievable goals they believe they have some degree of control over (Eliasoph, 1997) . Given the flexibility with which it can repackage a broad array of work experiences-or lack thereof-into a coherent subject position, the discourse of entrepreneurship therefore enables younger small business owners to justify assuming what their own lived experience of the crisis as children demonstrates to be an onerous risk burden by asserting that all forms of adversity and hardship should be embraced as opportunities to develop marketable skillsets and engage in personal growth (Elyachar, 2005; Smith, 2001) . Burke's ([1945] 1969) distinction between scene-agent and scene-act ratios therefore provides a concrete methodological tool for analyzing variations in how these respective generational communities articulate and deploy their agency in the face of uncertainty. Focusing on how these respective dimensions of the pentad relate to each other discursively builds upon the work of Mohr et al. (2013) who import the tools from Burke's literary theory to analyze the underlying structures of rhetorical logic of a series of United States National Security documents. Though their analysis focuses on demonstrating who the relevant actors, acts, and scenes are in these documents, the authors observe that identifying the relevant elements of the pentad is only the first step in any Burkean analysis. Burke argued that grasping the worldview of an actor's grammar of motives required taking the subsequent analytical step of tracing the relationships between these elements. Thus \"the real power of the pentad is the logic of binary opposition between the terms that Burke describes as ratios\" (Mohr et al., 2013: 697) . While these literary theoretical tools might seem abstract, juxtaposing how the 2001 crisis generation employs a scene-act ratio to engage in adversarial personification to how the post-crisis generation deploys the scene-agent ratio to engage in empowered distancing reveals that, although they are operating in the same macroclimate, they do not have a univocal interpretation of the risk burden they are assuming. Consequently, unlike workers in the United States (Lane, 2011; Smith, 2001; Snyder, 2016) and Israel (Sharone, 2013) who employ the entrepreneurial discourse to make sense of the professional challenges they are facing regardless of how old they are, the case of small business owners in Argentina suggests that divergent generational experiences of a critical event can contribute to the development of two distinct risk cultures.",

For Beckert, the desire to arrive at an imagined future destination motivates the economic actor to meticulously chart the series of causal steps required to bring that economic reality into being. The imaginaries that the small business owners develop suggests, however, that actors are motivated as much by the desire to become someone as they are by the desire to get somewhere. Consequently, the task of developing an orientation towards risk necessitates the adoption of a particular type of subject position, which these small business owners develop through the relationship they establish with their economic environment (Fridman, 2016) . In order transform themselves into the type of economic subjects they believe can succeed, they tell narratives rife with metaphoric and symbolic language in effort to evoke the specific properties of their desired future selves and actively cultivate them through specific business practices (Neff, 2012; Wherry, 2014) . Whereas the performative power of the entrepreneurial narrative manifests when members of the younger generation strive to focus their agentic power inward to fuel their personal development, the agentic narratives of older small business owners exert their performative power by continuously orienting their attention outward and externalizing the locus of their agency so that they can craft protected selves that are shielded from economic volatility (Alexander, 2011; Kerby, 1991) .",

Future empirical investigations into how risk orientations get developed at work should therefore attend as closely to the variations in generational narratives as they do to variation across national cultures (Freeman, 2014; Sharone, 2013; Vargas, 2014) and market position (Ho, 2009; Neff, 2012; Smith, 2001) . When conducting fieldwork with unemployed job-seekers, scholars (Lane, 2011; Sharone, 2013; Snyder, 2016 ) acknowledge that age matters in terms of hiring outcomes (i.e., it's easier for someone who's 30 to find a new job that someone who's 50), but, they do not attend to how generational differences shape job seekers' active orientation towards the job search or how they imagine the dramatics of the problem situation of finding a job. Future work could also consider how the collective memory of economic crisis shapes market actors' orientations toward financial practices conducted outside of the sphere of work. For example, we could expect to see generational differences in how the collective memory of the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. shapes orientations towards the risks involved in buying a home, with the primary axis of differentiation being whether or not potential homebuyers experienced the subprime crisis as a critical event during their formative years. Focusing attention on how localized generational communities are forged in the context of critical events like the subprime mortgage crisis and now the Covid-19 pandemic provides us with the analytical tools to identify how generational narratives facilitate the co-construction of risk perceptions and economic subjects.",
