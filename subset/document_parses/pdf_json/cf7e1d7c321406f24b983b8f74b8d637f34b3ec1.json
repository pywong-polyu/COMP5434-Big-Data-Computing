As such, for the first vaccination we have V 1 + V 2 = 10 6 for all vaccination strategies but the proportion between the two groups are different. Similarly, the total number of vaccinated individuals equals 2 \u00b7 10 6 after the second vaccination, and so on. Thus, we consider the same total number of vaccinated individuals at each vaccination stage with different proportions between the classes in different vaccination strategies. The curve with black dots in the left panel of Fig. 3 corresponds to a random choice of vaccinated individuals. Since for k = 0.2 we have S 2 /S 1 = (1 \u2212 k)/k = 4, then setting V 2 = 4V 1 we obtain the same proportion of vaccinated individuals in each class as the proportion between the classes of susceptible individuals. We neglect here the change of S 2 /S 1 during the epidemic progression. Though this vaccination strategy is quite natural, it is less efficient compared to the other strategies where more individuals from S 1 are vaccinated. A total number 5 \u00b7 10 6 of individuals are vaccinated in five times with 10 6 vaccines each one. The first vaccination is effectuated at the beginning of the (t = 0) and the remaining vaccinations after every five time units. For various vaccination strategies shown inFig. 3(left), the corresponding functions I(t) = I 1 (t) + I 2 (t) are shown inFig. 3 (right). We can characterize the vaccination strategies by the functions V 2 (t) = f i (V 1 (t)), i = 1, 2, 3, 4. We conclude that for any two vaccination strategies f 1 and f 2 such that f 1 (V 1 ) < f 2 (V 1 ), the corresponding functions (sum of infected individuals in both classes) satisfy the inequality I 1 (t) < I 2 (t) for all t > 0. A similar relation holds for the total number of infected individuals at the end of epidemic.Thus, vaccination of the first class of susceptible individuals is more efficient from the point of view of minimizing the number of infected individuals. This conclusion can be expected because the rate of disease transmission by this group is faster. However, this conclusion may not hold true if we minimize the number of deaths taking into account different mortality rates in the two groups. Let us consider an example with two groups:",
