            "text": "Thromboembolic disease is a common cardio-cerebral vascular disease that threatens human life and health. Thrombin not only affects the exogenous coagulation pathway, but also the endogenous pathway. Thus, it becomes one of the most important targets of anticoagulant drugs. RGD-hirudin is an anticoagulant drug targeting thrombin, but it can only be administered intravenously. We designed a low molecular weight peptide based on RGD-hirudin that could prevent blood clots. We first used NMR to identify the key amino acid residues of RGD-hirudin that interacted with thrombin. Then, we designed a novel direct thrombin inhibitor peptide (DTIP) based on the structure and function of RGD-hirudin using homology modeling. Molecular docking showed that the targeting and binding of DTIP with thrombin were similar to those of RGD-hirudin, suggesting DTIP interacted directly with thrombin. The active amino acids of DTIP were identified by alanine scanning, and mutants were successfully constructed. In blood clotting time tests in vitro, we found that aPTT, PT, and TT in the rat plasma added with DTIP were greatly prolonged than in that added with the mutants. Subcutaneous injection of DTIP in rats also could significantly prolong the clotting time. Thrombelastography analysis revealed that DTIP significantly delayed blood coagulation. Bio-layer interferometry study showed that there were no significant differences between DTIP and the mutants in thrombin affinity constants, suggesting that it might bind to other sites of thrombin rather than to its active center. Our results demonstrate that DTIP with low molecular weight can prevent thrombosis via subcutaneous injection.",

Thrombin has procoagulant and anticoagulant activities and has three functional domains: (1) the active site, which cleaves the appropriate peptide bonds in its substrates (e.g., fibrinogen, protein C) by the catalytic triad (serine, histidine, and aspartic acid); (2) exosite I, which identifies fibrinogen and other substrates, such as thrombomodulin; and (3) exosite II, which recognizes and binds to glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin and heparan sulfate [9, 11, 12] .

One study suggested that there were two binding sites between the bivalent direct thrombin inhibitor hirudin and thrombin: the C-terminal tail of hirudin with exosite I and the N-terminus with a portion of the active site [13] . Our previous work showed that RGD-hirudin binds to thrombin [14] and effectively inhibits the activity of thrombin [15] . However, RGD-hirudin is a protein drug and is administered via intravenous injection, which limits its clinical application [16] . To develop a novel DTI with a low molecular weight, we proposed the following hypothesis. If a number of amino acids, except the C-terminus tail and N-terminus part of RGD-hirudin, are deleted, the remaining molecule will still possess anticoagulative and antithrombotic properties.",

Thrombin was titrated to 15 N, 13 C-labeled RGDhirudin up to a molar ratio of 1:1.2. Upon binding to thrombin, the amide proton cross-peaks of RGD-hirudin showed a significant change in the chemical shift, indicating that thrombin binds to RGD-hirudin (Fig. 1a) . Based on the chemical shift perturbation data of the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra, we determined the key amino acids of RGD-hirudin involved in binding to thrombin. The NMR resonance assignment of 1 H-15 N HSQC cross-peaks of RGD-hirudin showed that the chemical shifts of cross-peaks from the C-and N-termini in RGDhirudin were largely changed upon binding to thrombin (Fig. 1b) . In particular, residues 53-66 from the C-terminus showed a substantial change in their chemical shifts, and cross-peaks from the Asn 37 , Asn 52 , Asp 55 , Phe 56 , Glu 57 , Ile 59 , and Glu 61 residues disappeared. In addition, chemical shift perturbations from the N-terminus were also found for Val 1 , Val 2 , Tyr 3 , Thr 7 , and Gln 11 residues. These results indicate that the C-and N-termini of RGDhirudin are primarily involved in the interaction with thrombin. Therefore, we hypothesized that modification of RGD-hirudin, such that it only contains the C-and N-termini, would still allow RGDhirudin to interact with thrombin and exert its inhibitory effect.",

Then, the sequence alignment to the templates was completed successfully (Fig. 2b) . The same amino acid residues are shown in dark blue, while similar amino acid residues are shown in light blue (Fig. 2b) . Homology models were built based on the templates' structures. Three disulfide bonds (depicted in yellow) were contained within RGD-hirudin, which are illustrated as a tube (Fig. 2c) . In Fig. 2d , the structure of RGD-hirudin is displayed as a line ribbon. Almost all the residues were in the allowed areas, just as the Ramachandran plot manifested (90.2% residues in the allowed region, 7.8% in the marginal region, 2.0% in the disallowed region) (Fig. 2e) . The Ramachandran plot is a useful tool for protein structure assessment. Its main application is to detect the quality of the homology modeling. To create a short protein peptide, the fragment from Leu 15 to Thr 45 , which is denoted in yellow, was removed (Fig. 2f) , and the remaining peptide was called the direct thrombin inhibitor peptide (DTIP).

In Fig. 3c , a disulfide bond (yellow) was displayed explicitly in a tube format. Homology modeling of DTIP, based on these four templates, can be observed in a line ribbon format (Fig. 3d) .

            "text": "Thrombin docked with RGD-hirudin and DTIP The structure of DTIP is similar to RGD-hirudin. Nevertheless, the interaction of DTIP with thrombin required verification. Molecular docking was performed to explore the binding of DTIP and thrombin. The best docking complex was selected based on the dock score (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 4a-c) . Docking results (Fig. 4d) revealed that the N-terminus of DTIP or RGD-hirudin bound to the active site of thrombin (in blue) and suggested that DTIP could therefore inhibit thrombin activity. In addition, we identified a binding site between the C-terminus of DTIP or RGD-hirudin and exosite I of thrombin (in atrovirens). To further validate this interaction, intermolecular hydrogen bonds were analyzed. Some hydrogen bonds between RGD-hirudin and thrombin were found; Val 1 in the N-terminus of RGD-hirudin with Trp 215 of thrombin, Asp 5 with Arg 221 and Gln 49 in the C-terminus of RGD-hirudin with Trp 60 , Asn 52 with Lys 60 and Leu 41 , Gly 54 with Leu 40 , Glu 57 with Gln 38 , and Asp 65 with Lys 36 (Fig. 4e) . Interestingly, many hydrogen bonds were formed between DTIP and thrombin; Val 1 in the N-terminus of DTIP with His 57 of thrombin, Ser 195 , Ser 214 , and Gly 216 of thrombin, Tyr 3 with Gly 216 , Gly 219 , and Glu 217 , Asp 5 with Arg 221 , Gln 18 with Trp 60 , Asp 24 in the N-terminus of DTIP with Arg 73 of thrombin, Asp 34 with Ser 36 , and Glu 35 with Lys 36 (Fig. 4f) . The molecular docking results and intermolecular hydrogen-bond interactions led us to hypothesize that DTIP could identify and bind to thrombin. The distribution of the RGD-hirudin residues (green ring) are shown in colors: allowed region (within light blue), marginal region (beyond light blue and within pink) and disallowed region (beyond pink). The percent of residues in allowed the region was 90.2%, in the marginal region 7.8%, in the disallowed region 2.0%. Phi is represented by a peptide alpha carbon left C-N bond rotation angle, and psi is shown as a peptide alpha carbon on the right side of the C-C bond rotation angle. f Homology modeling of RGD-hirudin in a flat ribbon format (blue) and the fragment from Leu15 to Thr45 (yellow).",

Plasmids carrying DTIP and its mutants were constructed successfully (Fig. 6) , and a sufficient protein yield was obtained through the process of fermentation, concentration, and purification. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), a sensitive and commonly used screening test for endogenous coagulation, was extended to 250 s at a lower concentration of DTIP and a higher concentration of the mutants (Fig. 7a) . Prothrombin time (PT) is not only a screening test for the exogenous coagulation system but also an important monitoring index for clinical anticoagulation therapy. The concentration of DTIP at the PT peak (250 s) was also lower than that of the E35A, D24A, C6A-C14A, and Y3A mutants (Fig. 7b) . Thrombin time (TT) can be used to reflect the speed of the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the coagulation pathway. Relative to the mutant, the plasma with the lowest concentration of DTIP reached the TT peak (250 s) (Fig. 7c) . At the same concentration, the aPTT, PT, and TT of DTIP and those of bivalirudin were on the same order of magnitude (Fig. 7d-f) . These experiments showed that at a low concentration, DTIP can delay plasma coagulation through the exogenous, endogenous, or common coagulation system pathway.",

Therefore, we determined that DTIP may interact not only with the active center of thrombin but also with exosite I. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI), a rapid marker detection technology, is based on the optical interference signal of biological molecular dynamics analysis. This technology was applied in the interaction analysis of biological molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and sugars. The affinity constant (K D ) between biotin-labeled target proteins and thrombin is shown following BLI ( Fig. 9 and Table 2 ). The K D between DTIP and thrombin was 1.64 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol/L (Fig. 9a) . Interestingly, there was no distinct diversity among DTIP and the mutant peptides. Enoxaparin sodium, a low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), prevented the formation of blood clots by binding to antithrombin and potentiating its action [29] . There is no direct interaction between thrombin and enoxaparin sodium (Fig. 9f) . The above experiments, such as TEG, demonstrate that the activity of DTIP and the mutants varied. Hence, we speculated that DTIP functions as an anticoagulant on account of the interaction between its Nterminus and the thrombin active site, and the constant K D showed the interaction between the C-terminus and exosite I.",

An estimated 17.3 million people died from CVD in 2008, and almost 23.6 million will die by 2030, mainly due to heart disease and stroke (http://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/ about_cvd/en/) [30] . Thrombosis is the primary cause of major cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism. There is an urgent need to develop antithrombotic drugs. Thrombin, produced from prothrombin, is a multifunctional serine protease and a key regulator in the hemostatic processes [31] . In the process of coagulation, thrombin contributes to converting soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin and to platelet activation [10] . As a key enzyme in blood coagulation, thrombin has been a target for developing anticoagulant drugs [32] . DTIs can inhibit thrombin directly and do not require antithrombin as a cofactor. Therefore, DTIs have a high-anticoagulant effect. There are many kinds of direct thrombin inhibitors on the market, such as argatroban, dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, lepirudin, desirudin, and bivalirudin [33] . Argatroban can be applied to coronary artery bypass grafts at an elevated dosage and used for deep vein thrombosis treatment or prophylaxis at a lower dosage [34] . As a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran blocks the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin [35] . Lepirudin and desirudin are two derivatives of hirudin [33] . There is little doubt they have good anticoagulant effects. However, they have various disadvantages, such as the risk of bleeding. This fact has accelerated the search for new anticoagulant drugs.",

            "text": "In the NMR experiments, we found that the C-and N-termini of RGD-hirudin played important roles in the interaction with thrombin. Therefore, a novel peptide (DTIP) was designed with these two termini. To investigate whether DTIP can interact with thrombin, molecular simulations and docking experiments were performed. Homology modeling is a method to simulate the three-dimensional structure of a target protein based on known structures. We simulated the structures of RGD-hirudin and DTIP using known structures from the PDB database; these structures included recombinant hirudin (PDB ID: 3HTC), sulfo-hirudin (PDB ID: 2PW8), and recombinant RGD-hirudin (PDB ID: 2JOO). There were great similarities between their amino acid sequences; theoretically, their high-level structures may be similar to a large extent. Molecular docking results showed that DTIP bound to thrombin in a manner similar to that of RGD-hirudin. In addition, hydrogen bonds formed between DTIP and thrombin, which led us to believe it can inhibit thrombin. Fig. 7 DTIP can significantly prolong blood clotting time whether in vitro or vivo. SD rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/ kg) and blood was taken from the abdominal aorta (3.8% sodium citrate in a ratio of 1 to 9 with blood). Coagulation time was measured with the kits. The time was recorded 250 s if there was no coagulation in the plasma after 250 s. a-c The concentration of DTIP (red) to peak was obviously lower than that of E35A (green), D24A (blue), C6A-C14A (purple), and Y3A (pink) whether testing aPTT, PT, or TT. d-f aPTT, PT, and TT of DTIP (blue) and bivalirudin (orange). g-i After SD rats were anesthetized, carotid cannulation was performed. DTIP and mutant proteins were administered subcutaneously (1 mg/kg). Anticoagulant effects were monitored at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h after administration. The result showed that DTIP can prolong blood clotting time, and mutants can inhibit blood coagulation to varying degrees. Fig. 8 DTIP delayed the clotting in human whole blood. Blood from healthy volunteers was acquired using vacuum blood collection tube. The mutant proteins and DTIP were added to the blood respectively at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL. DTIP (red) prolonged the coagulation time of whole blood significantly. In addition to the homology simulations, a series of experiments were performed to verify the function of DTIP. First, we examined the effects of DTIP on plasma coagulation. Whether examining the aPTT, PT, or TT of plasma, the coagulation was longer with DTIP than with any of the mutants. The DTIP concentration was the lowest when the coagulation time reached its peak (250 s). In addition, DTIP achieved a clotting time similar to that of bivalirudin. These data indicate that DTIP may prevent thrombosis in the coagulation system. Next, the anticoagulant effect on human blood was confirmed. The same effect on whole blood was shown in the TEG experiment. Whole blood with 0.01 mg/mL DTIP had the longest anticoagulant time. In BLI, DTIP had the same affinity constant as the mutants, which reminded us that there was an interaction between the DTIP C-terminus and exosite I of thrombin. RGD-hirudin (0.14 \u03bcmol/L) could inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and this effect on platelet aggregation had a dose-response [23, 36] . However, ADP-induced platelet aggregation was not affected when the final concentration of 5 \u03bcmol/L DTIP was added (data not shown).",
