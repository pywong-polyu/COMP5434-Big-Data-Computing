Comparative analyses of consumed sugar, ethanol yield, and productivity (in tons per hectare) increased along with the concentration of cells in the inoculum. Additionally, to verify the aromatic quality of a potential sweet potato distilled spirit, volatile organic compounds were analyzed. The results showed a yield of over 90% ethanol. It was observed that the sugar consumption and ethanol production rates can be increased with a higher initial concentration of cells. This resulted in higher concentrations of ethanol in shorter times. From 100 g of the sweet potato variety BRS Cuia, the highest concentration of ethanol obtained was 25.74 g L \u22121 using the LPB1-93 strain. The estimated bioethanol production is about 10,000 L ha \u22121 , with two sweet potatoes crops in a year. The ethanol production from the sweet potato variety BRS Cuia is viable, representing a sustainable alternative to fuel bioethanol, as well as an alcoholic beverage due to the volatile organic compounds present in the distilled fraction.",

            "text": "Despite the low interest in sweet potatoes, Ipomoea potatoes (L.), because it is a subsistence crop, it presents a high potential for ethanol production due to the production cost and good productivity [1] . The Brazilian annual production of sweet potato is about 110 thousand tons [2] . Sweet potatoes have great resistance and excellent agricultural performance, in tropical conditions [3] . However, the offer is still very centered, about 64% of global production in China, such as shown in Fig. 1 [1] . In these regions, besides being used for human food due to its good nutritional content, sweet potatoes are of great importance for the industrial production of flour, starch, and ethanol [4] and as raw material to obtain industrialized products with higher added value as dehydrated chips, cereals, jams, jellies, flour, and pasta [5] Ethanol is a substance with many applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry being part of distilled and fermented beverages and, more recently, it has been widely used as a hand sanitizer in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis [6] . The bioethanol production, to be used as biofuel, is an important option environmentally friendlier than fossil fuels [7] . In addition, the raw materials used to produce bioethanol, such as sugarcane juice and corn starch, are cheaper than the fossil products [8] . Due to the depletion of energy resources, the search for alternative energy sources to meet the current demand is pivotal for environmental research. Thus, biorefineries play an important role for the generation of renewable energy source, together with products of great industrial value, which can be converted through physical, chemical, and/ or biological treatments [9] . There is a growing interest in finding other alternative sources of ethanol production, such sweet potato, promoting possibilities where corn and sugarcane are not viable, bringing economic benefits to the fuel market [10] .",

Another competitive advantage of the sweet potato is its short life cycle, varying from 5 to 6 months, which allows two harvests per year. The global ethanol productivity depends on the fermentation yield, the concentration of fermentable sugars in the broth, and productivity of the raw materials (t ha \u22121 ). Brazil has been developing a large number of sweet potato varieties with high yields (t ha \u22121 ), with values close to the ethanol production from sugarcane and even higher in some cases. Therefore, the aim of this research was to study the potential of sweet potatoes for bioethanol production from the sweet potato variety BRS Cuia.",

The solid material (yeast cells and sweet potato solids) was removed from the fermented broth by filtration. After separation of the solid material, the liquid part (fermentation broth) was distilled, in batches. The distillation was done to recover ethanol to be used as biofuel and as distillate spirit. A traditional distillation system consisted of a heating mantle (Fisatom class 300, model 202), a 2000-mL round-bottom flask, a Liebig-type. The volatile compounds were collected at the condenser outlet. The samples were separated by temperature, the first (head) with a temperature up to 78 \u00b0C; the second (heart) with a temperature of 78.3 to 79 \u00b0C; and the third (tail) above 79 \u00b0C.

The present study used the average productivity value of 50 tons ha \u22121 , indicating that are required 7.46 tons of sweet potato variety Cuia to produce 1 ton of ethanol and 0.15 hectares of this variety to produce 1 ton of ethanol. The raw material is responsible for half the cost of ethanol production. If less raw material were consumed, the ethanol production cost will decrease.

Figure 3 shows the overall mass balance of the tested strategy. Based on the data, 100 g dried sweet potato, 38 g glucose, 13.4 g fructose, and 12.3 g maltose were released in the hydrolysate after the pretreatment with dilute hydrochloric acid. After that, the hydrolysate was fermented using the yeast S. cerevisiae LPB1-93, CA-11 and ATCC-26602 and produced 25.74, 21.2, and 21.9 g L \u22121 of ethanol, respectively. There is an increase in the concentration of fermentable sugars after dilute acid pretreatment, which initially were arranged as starch. The mass balance, shown in Fig. 3 , indicates that the largest ethanol production (25.74 g of ethanol per 100 g of sweet potato variety Cuia) was obtained using the LPB1-93 strain. Studies conducted with sweet potatoes to produce ethanol [27] , and Lareo et al. [28] obtained 0.96, 1.72, and 3.87 g per 100 g of sweet potato. However, although the fermentation proposed by Lareo et al. [28] shows better results of conversion to ethanol, its estimated yield per hectare was 4790 L ha \u22121 , while the Cuia variety was, due to the two harvests per year, can reach 10,000 L ha \u22121 year \u22121 . The choice of different feedstocks results in different economic outcomes and risk assessment of the corresponding biomass fuel project. Thus, even if the same feedstock is used in different regions, it is unlikely to obtain the same results because most of the economic conditions such as feedstock price, plant yield, capital investment, and labor costs, vary from one region to another [29] .",
