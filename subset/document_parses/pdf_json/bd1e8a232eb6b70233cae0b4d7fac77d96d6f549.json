Data is usually too diverse to be even manipulated effectively. Sdfconf is data manipulation and analysis software to address this problem in a logical and robust manner. Other software commonly used for such tasks are either not designed with molecular and/or conformational data in mind or provide only a narrow set of tasks to be accomplished. Furthermore, many tools are only available within commercial software packages. Sdfconf is a flexible, robust, and free-of-charge tool for linking data from various sources for meaningful and efficient manipulation and analysis of molecule data sets. Sdfconf packages molecular structures and metadata into a complete ensemble, from which one can access both the whole data set and individual molecules and/or conformations. In this software note, we offer some practical examples of the utilization of sdfconf.",

Sdfconf utilizes an extended notation of SDfile property data item, which is called metadata or meta for short in the context of sdfconf. The extended notation is compatible with the standard but will often be interpreted as text. Different structures and data types for metadata raise the need to use this data effectively. One of the most important features of sdfconf is its diverse way of referring to wanted metadata. With a metastatement, we can assign information not only for the whole molecule but its atoms too. Sdfconf also has a mechanism for distinguishing molecules as a set of groups, e.g., multiple molecules with the same name, each having multiple conformations.

It uses mainly SDfiles with V2000 specified molfiles 1 (Figure 2 ), and many of its properties are implemented in such a way that data can be easily stored in them. Sdfconf uses the relatively free format of data items to store all data that cannot be stored elsewhere in an SDfile. Sdfconf also has some tools for usage with mol2-files. SDfile format specifies properties for molecules. Properties are, in general singular piece of data that has a name, like \"mol_weight\" and value like \"174.05\". Usually, an SDfile includes a certain set of properties for all molecules in the file. In sdfconf, properties are called metadata. The extended notation in sdfconf uses three types of data structure: single, list, and dictionary. Single and list are selfexplanatory, but the dictionary includes a list of key and value pairs. For example, a key could be an atom number and the corresponding value distance between the specified atom and some point-of-interest (like a point inside the binding site of a protein).",

First, information about the original compound name (correspondingNames.csv) and the Plants docking score (ranking.csv) from csv-files are merged to SDfile (1). Sdfconf can import new metadata into an SDfile from another SDfile Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling pubs.acs.org/jcim Application Note (combine) or from a comma-or tab-separated value file (csv) (import). In both cases, only data with the same names in both files will be imported. Names may also include conformation numbers. If conformation numbers are not provided, data will be applied to molecules with the same name. In contrast, if the conformation numbers are provided, data will be added to molecules with the same name and conformation number. In essence, one may import both molecular and conformational data at the same time by providing conformation numbers for conformational data and only molecule names for molecular data. Note that sdfconf does not understand the context of one molecule by structure but by the name of the molecule. Metadata may also be exported from SDfile to a csv-file:",

This information was imported to an SDfile in the previous example (1).

This was done by measuring distances between chosen atoms. 16, 18 Rauhamaki et al. used sdfconf to generate a simple pharmacophore filter to refine docked conformations. Sdfconf was used to select only conformations without hydrophobic groups in proximity of a certain side chain atom. 19 In addition, sdfconf has been utilized to search sites of metabolism prediction (unpublished data).
