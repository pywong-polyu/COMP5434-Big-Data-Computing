This study aimed to assess antibody response after vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine and examine possible factors affecting this response in a geriatric population. Methods: individuals who have been on at least the 28th day after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were included. Comprehensive geriatric assessment tools and the Clinical Frailty Scale were performed. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibodies were detected and, levels \u22651 U/ml were defined as seropositive, <1 U/ml were defined as seronegative. Results: a total of 497 patients were included and divided into three groups according to the days past after the second dose of the vaccine (Group 1: 28-59 days, Group 2: 60-89 days and Group 3: 90 days and more). Groups included 188, 148 and 171 patients, respectively. Seropositivity rate in each group was 80.9,73.2 and 57.3%, respectively. In Groups 1 and 2, Charlson Comorbidity Index score was higher in the seronegative group (P = 0.023 and P = 0.011, respectively). In Group 3, the prevalence of frailty was significantly higher in the seronegative group (P = 0.002). Conclusion: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the antibody response after vaccination with Sars-CoV 2 inactivated vaccine in the Turkish geriatric population. Moreover, this is the first study revealing the relationship between antibody response and frailty. Larger studies are needed to confirm the antibody response duration and the association between frailty and COVID-19 vaccine response.",

Most vaccine studies (prepared by either new or conventional methods; mRNA, adenovirus vector, adjuvant protein or inactivated virus), have not included older patients, especially the frail groups. Therefore, the immune response to vaccines in this special group is not well known [2, 3] .",

The patient's functional status was evaluated using the Katz ADL test, evaluating over 6 points by questioning how independently the patient performed basic care and activities related to daily life and the score increased as independence increased [7] . The Lawton Brody scale was performed to evaluate patients' IADLs [8] . The cognitive status of the participants was screened by MMSE. The patients' orientation, memory, attention, calculation, recall, language, motor function and perception skills were assessed with the MMSE. The maximum score of the test is 30 points, and the scores 24 and below were assessed as cognitive impairment [9] . Nutritional screening via MNA-SF was performed and, scores > 11 points were defined as normal, 8-11 points were defined as the risk of malnutrition and \u22647 points were defined as malnutrition [10] .

Therefore, evaluating the vaccine response in older adults, who are mostly affected by the pandemic and may have many confounding factors like frailty and multiple chronic comorbidities, is essential. In the light of the CGA, including frailty assessment, this study aimed to evaluate the antibody response and factors that may affect it in this particular group. Our findings suggest that antibody response after two doses of the inactivated vaccine decreases, especially after 90 days. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first revealing comorbidity burden and frailty as important factors for COVID-19 vaccine seroconversion in the geriatric population.",

In addition, Sinopharm's inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, which has similar technology with Sinovac's Coronavac, also showed decreased antibody production, vaccine effectiveness and mortality reduction, in older adults [19, 20] . Similar to the previous studies, we observed a significant decline in the seroconversion rate over time, particularly if it has been longer than three months after the second dose. These findings may support the concerns about the possible shortlasting humoral immunity response after the two-dose vaccination schedule, and starting with the older population, booster doses may be needed to help to pursue seropositivity.",

            "text": "The BAU/ml is the conversion factor determined using the World Health Organization international standard code to standardise interlaboratory variability due to different reagents. However, few studies evaluating the antibody response of the Sinovac vaccine have used BAU/ml. Therefore, our study aimed to make qualitative and quantitative Based on a hospital serological study, young healthcare professionals (mean age: 34.4) who received two doses of CoronaVac, tested after 60 days, had significantly lower sCOVG serum levels compared to those who were tested within 60 days of receiving CoronaVac (111.1 \u00b1 62.63 vs. 237.4 \u00b1 160.4 BAU/ml; P < 0.001) [21] . In another study conducted on participants who received two doses of CoronaVac with a mean age of 42.3, the median sCOVG serum level collected after 21-49 days after the second dose of vaccine was found to be 128 BAU/ml [22] . In our study, sCOVG serum level median (IQR) BAU/ml for each group was 79.1 (31.6-166.0), 41.2 (19.8-103.5) and 27.0 (10.9-62.3), respectively. Compared to the few studies conducted in young patients, the lower mean BAU values obtained in a geriatric population may be explained via the factors, particularly immunosenescence, that reduce ageing related antibody response. Since this study's primary aim was not to compare the age groups, more randomised controlled studies comparing older and younger adults are needed to prove this hypothesis. Vaccine response in the older population is not an entirely well-understood area due to confounders such as immunosenescence (qualitative and quantitative deterioration in immune response due to ageing), frailty and multiple comorbidities [4, 23] . The change of immune organs in older adults is most obvious in thymus; the activity of thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells are reduced, the immune response substances are reduced and therefore immune function is decreased [24] . In addition, the generation of activated B cells and immunoglobulin functionality are important issues [4] . Therefore, immunosenescence may cause alterations in vaccine response in older adults. Frailty is a relatively new concept, providing us an integrative understanding than comorbidities alone of susceptibility to adverse outcomes [25] . Furthermore, recent studies show that immunosenescence is not only a consequence of biological ageing but also a contributor to the variability in vulnerability seen with frailty [24, 25] . Current studies have revealed the impact of frailty on other vaccine responses. In a study evaluating pneumococcal vaccine response in older adults, frailty has appeared to be a better predictor of immune response than age alone [26] . Moreover, many studies assessing the impact of frailty on influenza vaccine responses disclosed that frailty was strongly associated with antibody response as a measure of vaccine efficacy [24] . Although there is a growing body of evidence showing the relationship between frailty and vaccine response [15, 26] , most of the vaccination studies have not included frail older adults as a major limitation. In the first report of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CoronaVac, tested in older adults (aged \u2265 60 years), used a phase 1/2 study design to assess the safety of two different doses (3 \u03bcg and 6 \u03bcg) and found similar neutralising antibody responses among adults aged 18-59 years received same doses [27] . However, the most important limitation of this study was evaluating the seroconversion rate solely at days 28 and 56 and having no data on patients' comorbidities or compressive geriatric assessments, including frailty. In another Phase 2 vaccine study conducted on chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford University, people aged 60 and older were included, and similar seropositivity on the 28th day was reported in all age groups. Since, this study is not providing a follow up after 28 days and excludes older participants with severe comorbidities and a CFS score of 4 and above, the antibody response in frail older adults has been unknown [28] . In our study, all patients were evaluated in terms of frailty via CFS, a frailty scale most often used for cumulative deficit frailty. Although we observed no relationship between seroconversion and frailty in Groups 1 and 2 after the second dose of vaccine, in Group 3, frailty prevalence with CFS was significantly higher in the seronegative group (P = 0.002). Even though most studies in the field of vaccination emphasise that there might be an age-related decrease in antibody response, our study showed no difference between seropositive and negative groups in terms of age, however, frailty seems to be associated with antibody response. Therefore, frailty might be playing a key role in possible short-lasting humoral immunity response after the two-dose vaccination, clarified after 90 days.",

Although we observed higher scores of CCI in the seronegative subjects of Groups 1 and 2, no relationship was found between seroconversion and CCI in Group 3. In accordance with our findings, in a study with a small group of haemodialysis patients conducted by Torreggiani et al., at the time of the second dose mRNA vaccine (i.e. 3 weeks after the first dose), low neutralising antibody titers were observed in the high CCI scored group [30] . In conclusion, it can be hypothesised that the seroconversion rate, especially in the early period, may be affected by the burden of comorbidity.",

Another issue that can be considered as a limitation is that the prevaccine antibody status of the patients is not known. Although N-protein IgG measurement is one of the methods that can objectively evaluate whether patients have had COVID-19 before, it was not available to make this measurement for this crosssectional study. In order to avoid this situation becoming a limitation, patients were evaluated with all suspicious clinical symptoms, contacts with people infected with COVID-19 and rt-PCR and thorax computer tomography results were obtained from the national database since the onset of the pandemic. Patients were excluded from the study in the presence of a suspicious/positive history, symptom or result. In addition, the lack of recurrent antibody measurements of the same patients also causes limitations in the objective evaluation of the real-life course of the antibody response. Furthermore, a follow-up of the patients in terms of COVID-19 infection could provide essential data on the vaccine's effectiveness. Finally, considering that humoral immune response may not be the sole factor affected by immunosenescence, further studies evaluating the effect of cellular immunity on vaccine response may also be needed.",

These findings may support the necessity of a third dose vaccination after two doses of inactive vaccination, especially in the frail older population. Larger sampled randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the association between frailty and COVID-19 vaccine response.",
