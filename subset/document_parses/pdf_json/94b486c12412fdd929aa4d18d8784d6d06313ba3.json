Few studies have been conducted into the function of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp5.

Sequencing and sequential comparison was performed to analyze the mutation trend of the polymerase nsp5 gene during the epidemic process using a nucleotide-nucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLASTN) and a protein-protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTP).

A novel identified virus named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been established as the etiological agent [1] . There are three groups of coronaviruses: groups I and II contain mammalian viruses, while group III contains only avian viruses [2] . On the basis of unrooted phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV was proposed to represent a novel virus and was defined as a fourth group of coronaviruses [3, 4] . But later, Snijder et al. suggested that the SARS-CoV lineage was an early split-off from the group II branch by rooted phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus replicase genes [5] . The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV is now available from GenBank. With the interpretation of the whole SARS-CoV gene sequence, the genes associated with SARS-CoV's function and etiology have become more and more familiar to us [3, 4] . The SARS-CoV genome is a positive strand RNA of approximately 29,700 nucleotides and has a 5' cap structure and 3' poly(A) tail [4] [5] [6] . It is composed of at least 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) that encode three classes of proteins: structural proteins (the S, M, E and N proteins), 16 non-structural proteins (the nsp or replicase proteins) involved in viral RNA synthesis, and proteins that are thought to be non-essential for replication in tissue culture but clearly provide a selective advantage in vivo (accessory proteins) [3, 4, 6, 7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 270, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 555, "end": 558, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 559, "end": 561, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 737, "end": 740, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 976, "end": 979, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 980, "end": 982, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1116, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1120, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1124, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1534, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1537, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1540, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1543, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The coronavirus replicases are encoded by two large 5'-proximal ORFs, which comprise approximately two-third of the genome polyproteins. ORF1a and ORF1b are connected by a ribosomal frame shift site, and the ribosomal frame shift results in the translation of an ORF1a protein and a carboxyl-extended ORF1ab frame shift protein, which are also known as replicase polyproteins PP1a and PP1ab [4] . The ORF1a and ORF1ab translation products are polyprotein precursors, which are cleaved by viral proteinases, resulting in a minimum of 13 nonstructural proteins, including a 3C-like proteinase (nsp5), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12, RdRp), a papain-like proteinase activity (PL2 pro , nsp3), and a superfamily 1-like helicase activity (HEL1, nsp13) [6] (following the nomenclature used by Snijder et al. [5] ), and other function-unknown non-structural proteins. These replicase polyproteins play important roles in controlling the replication of viral genome RNA, the transcription of the sgmRNA, and the synthesis and translation of the mRNA of structural proteins (S, M, E, N) [4, 8] . Structural proteins have been selected as candidates for anti-SARS drugs, but there is a chance of mutation at these proteins, leading to the inefficacy of anti-SARS drugs. The replicase proteins are relatively conserved and can be effective targets for anti-SARS drugs. In order to search for the targets of anti-SARS drugs and study the biological function of SARS-CoV nsp5, we carried out the following research. We compared the nsp5 of the SARS-CoV GD strain (isolated from Guangdong patient) with that of other SARS-CoV strains using a nucleotidenucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLASTN) to find out the variance tendency. In the same way we compared the amino acid sequence with that of other coronaviruses using a protein-protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTP) to find the homologous protein. We know that the biological function of the gene is achieved by protein encoding, but the functions of the protein are closely related to its structure. In the process of biological evolution a protein's structure is more conserved than its sequence, so it is more useful for the study of the functions and mechanisms of a protein to master the protein structure information. To extract more information, we constructed the secondary structure and 3-D models of the nsp5 protein. To further study the function of nsp5, we cloned the nsp5 gene of SARS-CoV, isolated by molecular biological methods from a SARS patient in Guangdong. We constructed the eukaryotic expression plasmid and successfully expressed the nsp5 proteins. At present, few studies focused on the polymerase nsp5, hardly enough to elucidate its biological function. To deal with a possible recurrence of SARS, the determination of targets in the SARS-CoV is impor-tant [7, 8] . It provides the foundation for further exploration of the biological functions of this protein during transmission, and assists in the search for anti-SARS-CoV drugs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 810, "end": 813, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1089, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1092, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2856, "end": 2859, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2860, "end": 2862, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The SARS-CoV GD strain was derived from a 47-yearold female who had returned from Hong Kong infected with SARS-CoV on 1 April, 2003.

This method determines the possible fold type of a particular protein using the folds of a different protein, whose structure is already known to us, as a template. This model is generated directly from the alignment, with no subsequent refinement. The results revealed the three proteins with the highest PSSM E-value: 1LKJ (PDB code), which is a chain of calmodulin from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with an E-value of 4.8; 1ABV, which is the delta subunit of the F 1 F o -ATP synthase, with an E-value of 7.44; 1J1EC, which is troponin, with an E-value of 7.51. The 3-D structure of 1LKJ is also shown in Fig. 4 . The results demonstrated that 1LKJ is mostly composed of 8 alpha helices. The secondary structure of GD nsp5 also demonstrated that it is mostly made up of alpha helices, which indicated that it was reasonable to construct the 3-D model of the SARS-CoV nsp5 protein using 1LKJ as the template. Calmodulin is a ubiquitous Ca 2+ -binding regulatory protein that mediates the action of Ca 2+ in a diverse array of biological events, including cell division, microtubular depolymerization and cyclic nucleotide metabolism, Ca 2+ transport, and protein phosphorylation [17] .
