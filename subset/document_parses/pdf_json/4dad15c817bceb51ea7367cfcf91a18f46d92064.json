Grade of urgency of electroencephalography (EEG) may vary according to the clinical indication, setting, and status of infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. \"Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology\" (SINC), \"Italian League Against Epilepsy\" (LICE), and the \"Italian Association of Neurophysiology Technologists\" (AITN) aimed to provide clinical and technical recommendation for EEG indications and recording standards in this pandemic era. Methods Presidents of SINC, LICE, and AITN endorsed three members per each society to formulate recommendations: classification of the degree of urgency of EEG clinical indications, management and behavior of physicians and neurophysiology technologists, hygiene and personal protection standards, and use of technical equipment. Results Scientific societies endorsed a paper conveying the recommendation for EEG execution in accordance with clinical urgency, setting (inpatients/outpatients), status of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (positive, negative and uncertain), and phase of governmental restrictions (phase 1 and 2). Briefly, in phase 1, EEG was recommended only for those acute/subacute neurological symptoms where EEG is necessary for diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy. Outpatient examinations should be avoided in phase 1, while they should be recommended in urgent cases in phase 2 when they could prevent an emergency room access. Reduction of staff contacts must be encouraged through rescheduling job shifts. The use of disposable electrodes and dedicated EEG devices for COVID-19-positive patients are recommended. Conclusions During the different phases of COVID-19 pandemic, the EEG should be reserved for patients really benefiting from its execution in terms of diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and avoidance of emergency room access.",

Since the beginning of the emergency period, international [1, 2] and Italian governmental agencies [3, 4] recommended the suspension of all elective and \"non-urgent\" procedures, including surgical procedures radiologic and neurophysiological tests. Therefore, routine outpatient visits were suspended and individual attempts of remote assistance (by telephone, e-mail or video-audio-conferencing consultations) tried to limit the harmful consequences for patients [5, 6] . However, the definition of \"elective\" or \"non-urgent\" is largely variable in relation to the type of specialty of the diagnostic procedures and clinical setting; therefore, classification of the clinical request is frequently left to the individual medical judgment.",

However, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its related risks, urgent care should be provided in a timely and safe manner to avoid delays in diagnoses and treatments. Clinical decisions on the priorities of examinations are not always easy to balance. In acute life-threatening conditions, there is no doubt about acting. In other situations, as in the case of neurophysiological procedures such as electroencephalogram (EEG), the choice can be questionable. EEG is a commonly used neurophysiological diagnostic procedure and is particularly useful for neurological conditions with acute/subacute onset. In such circumstances, EEG cannot be indefinitely postponed. In this scenario, there is an urgent need to carefully identify clinical indications for EEG according to criteria of appropriateness and priority [7] .",

The patient's referring physician is therefore an excellent resource to evaluate the urgency of the EEG's request in a timely manner.
