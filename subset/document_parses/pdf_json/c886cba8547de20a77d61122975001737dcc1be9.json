However, although it provides good circulatory assistance, VA-ECLS has anti-physiological hemodynamic consequences, mainly, bypass of pulmonary circulation and backflow into the aorta. Indeed, VA-ECLS diverts venous return from the right atrium, reducing right ventricle pre-load, and returns blood into the aorta, increasing left ventricle (LV) afterload. It results in a proportional reduction of the pulmonary blood flow generated by the right and left ventricles (so-called, native cardiac output, NCO). Many adverse hemodynamic effects of VA-ECLS are related to these antiphysiological effects such as LV distension, pulmonary edema, and blood stasis in the pulmonary artery, cardiac chambers, or aortic root with high risk of thrombosis [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, low NCO during ECLS can induce significant pulmonary lesions and may be prevented by maintaining 25% of the systemic cardiac output through the pulmonary artery [7] .",

            "text": "To overcome these drawbacks, current practices consist in tracking pulmonary edema, LV distension with spontaneous echo contrast (SEC), and aortic valve opening, mainly with repeated echocardiography exams [8] . Patients may then benefit from LV venting techniques to avoid the most serious complications [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The primary aim of venting techniques is LV discharge and prevention of pulmonary edema. Various techniques are proposed, with small differences in efficacy [14] . They differ in their ability to maintain or regulate NCO, but comparative data are not currently available. Therefore, monitoring NCO during VA-ECLS seems desirable to prevent the related complications. NCO is usually assessed by pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) with thermodilution measurement of right ventricle output, assuming the coupling of right and left ventricles results in the same output for both sides, and provided there is no left/right shunt. However, the technique is invasive and less reliable when cardiac output is low [15, 16] . Echocardiography is the alternative technique, either by directly measuring pulmonary artery flow (but this needs direct access to the pulmonary valve which is better viewed by trans-esophageal echocardiography) or by evaluating LV outflow by Doppler through the aortic valve (which can be obtained by transthoracic echocardiography). Nevertheless, whatever the echography technique, it cannot be considered as a monitoring technique. Often, the pulse pressure (PP) measured from the arterial line is used as a surrogate to assess NCO, but no study has yet addressed the issue of how much PP is sufficient. Similarly, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2 ) follows changes in cardiac output, provided CO 2 production and removal are stable [17, 18] . In this respect, we recently observed a good correlation between EtCO 2 and NCO in patients on VA-ECLS submitted to gradual increases of left-sided Impella assistance. The EtCO 2 increase correlated quite well with the increased NCO assessed by echocardiography Doppler [19] .",

The study was not designed to explore these complications, but several publications have already reported risk of blood stasis, stroke incidence, or intra-cardiac or aortic root thrombosis [5, 6, 24, 25] .

PAC is mandatory for measuring PAP, but it is an invasive monitoring method with a limited duration of utilization due to septic risk [26] . High PAP may also reflect left ventricular overload, through an elevation of PAWP, a major concern during VA-ECLS. Moreover, in our series, even when NCO exceeded 1 L/ min, mean PAP was lower than 30 mmHg, which indeed seems like a rather difficult objective to achieve when patients are very VA-ECLS dependent. Incidentally, PAC with continuous thermodilution measurement of cardiac output cannot measure flows < 1 L/min and becomes less reliable when cardiac output falls below 2 L/min, which makes PAC less useful in the condition of high level of ECLS assistance [15, 16] . The PAC limitation on cardiac output measurement in low flow states could be overcome with adaptation of the thermodilution technique, mainly with resetting catheter constant at various flow ranges [27] . Although attractive, the technique is currently not available in clinical practice.",

The loss of pulsatility is associated with blood stasis and a high incidence of stroke (41%) [6] . However, analysis of PP may go beyond the qualitative evaluation of the presence or absence of pulsatility. In physiology, PP is linearly related to the stroke volume and inversely related to arterial compliance [28] . In the nonphysiological condition of the VA-ECLS, PP was still strongly related to stroke volume, especially for lower stroke volume values. The NCO relationship with pulse pressure followed that of stroke volume, in agreement with a heart rate that remained constant. The weaker relationship with upper values might be explained by a reduction of VA-ECLS backflow pressure. VA-ECLS outflow was reduced proportionally to the improvement of NCO, therefore decreasing LV afterload, which is equivalent to an increase in arterial compliance [28] . Anyway, the good relation between low NCO levels and PP was exemplified by the ROC curve analysis, with excellent accuracy for predicting Th-NCO. However, PP monitoring may be limited by any venting technique involving the left ventricle, by aortic valve leaks, or by the presence of an intra-aortic balloon.",

            "text": "Conversely, EtCO 2 appears as a very pertinent parameter, even when PP is not reliable. EtCO 2 monitoring is a routine and non-invasive measure in ventilated patients. Recent studies have found a correlation between NCO and EtCO 2 in patients requiring LV venting during VA-ECLS [19, 29] . In the present study, we demonstrate that EtCO 2 correlated strongly with NCO when < 2 L/ min, and even that EtCO 2 tended to have a better ability than PP to predict Th-NCO. This result corroborates Bachman and coworkers' study, which showed in an experimental model of VA-ECLS that the variation of CO 2 elimination from the lungs correlated strongly with the variation of pulmonary blood flow [30] . Moreover, in our study, PaCO 2 was measured as a control of effective CO 2 removal by both lungs and ECLS. Owing to the facts that PaCO 2 was in normal range and that sweep gas-to-blood flow ratio at ECLS as well as ventilator settings were unchanged, the EtCO 2 changes followed the NCO quite well at low NCO levels. Indeed, in physiological conditions, when CO 2 production is stable, the venous return allows CO 2 transport to the lung where CO 2 is removed from the blood through the regulation of pulmonary gas exchanges. EtCO 2 is closely related to PaCO 2 , and the PaCO 2 -EtCO 2 gradient is low (3-5 mmHg) [31] . An EtCO 2 decrease, with parallel increase of PaCO 2 -EtCO 2 gradient, while CO 2 production or gas exchanges are unchanged, reflects quite directly a decrease in venous return and pulmonary artery flow, generating alveolar dead space [17, 18, 31, 32] . In the condition of VA-ECLS, a large amount of venous return is diverted to the membrane oxygenator by the ECLS circuit, but NCO keeps a fraction of the venous return for flow into the pulmonary artery towards the alveolar capillaries. Therefore, CO 2 removal depends on ventilator and ECLS settings, but even with very low volume ventilation, EtCO 2 variation parallels the changes in alveolar dead space related to low pulmonary artery blood flow. In our series, minute ventilation was low (median 3.6 L/min, which is roughly half the physiological value), but median PaCO 2 -EtCO 2 gradient was 30 mmHg, i.e., 6-fold the normal range, when NCO was < 1 L/min. The EtCO 2 kept going up when NCO increased above 1 L/min but the relation between EtCO 2 and NCO curved down significantly when NCO exceeded 2 L/min (Fig. 2c) , demonstrating that EtCO 2 became independent on the NCO level when pulmonary vascular recruitment was completed. The limitation of EtCO 2 monitoring is related to the access to exhaled CO 2 that, in order to be trustable, needs the patient to be intubated.",

The ventilator and ECLS settings were fixed according to guidelines, which are routinely used in most ECLS centers. A quarter of the measures were made with concomitant left VAD support that induced missing data for PP. However, the association of transient or durable VAD with VA-ECLS is frequent and source of low NCO events. NCO monitoring is crucial in these patients and PP is not reliable. Based on previous observations [19] , we thought that VAD do not impede interpretation of EtCO2/NCO relationship, which is why we chose to include patients with VAD. PAC monitoring was considered as the gold standard for cardiac output measurement but its accuracy in cases of low cardiac output and in the setting of VA-ECLS is disputed [27] . Although echocardiography was used for NCO < 1 L/min (failure of PAC assessment), cross measurements for comparison of the 2 techniques above 1 L/min would have been interesting. Finally, cardiac thrombosis and stroke incidences were not documented in this study, but recommended actions to prevent them (including LV venting) were applied when appropriate. The study was based on a physiological approach, and the small number of patients included would not allow any significant clinical assumption.",
