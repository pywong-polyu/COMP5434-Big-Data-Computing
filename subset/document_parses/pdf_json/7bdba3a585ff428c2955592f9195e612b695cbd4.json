Later, the study of \"the window of susceptibility\" to nutritional programming in fetal life has highlighted fetal plasticity during embryogenic life and the possible negative impact of adverse conditions on organ and system development. The lifelong risk of NCDs is therefore influenced by a critical period, the first 1000 days of life from conception to early childhood, [4] during which most of the biological development is completed [3] . Thus, we refer to \"early life\" as the first stages of life for the fetus and the newborn, up until early childhood [6] .",

Secondly, studies found an association between rapid weight gain in infancy and an increased risk of later obesity and adverse outcome. Lastly, children experiencing a mismatch between sub-perinatal and obesogenic childhood environments are at risk of obesity and related comorbidities [1, 4] .",

Without replacing the clinical interaction between parents and pediatricians, Nutripedia could be a supportive tool for health-care professionals work by providing nutritional advice and real-time support for parents.
