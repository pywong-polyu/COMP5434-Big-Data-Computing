This lentiviral vector efficiently transduces major dendritic cell subsets in vivo. With a mycobacterial immunogen, we observed distinct functional signatures and memory phenotype in lentiviral vector-or Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-immunized mice, despite comparable antigen-specific CD8 + T cell magnitudes. Compared to Ad5, lentiviral vector immunization resulted in higher multifunctional and IL-2-producing CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, lentiviral vector immunization primed CD8 + T cells towards central memory phenotype, while Ad5 immunization favored effector memory phenotype. Studies using HIV antigens in outbred rats demonstrated additional clear-cut evidence for an immunogenic advantage of lentiviral vector over Ad5. Additionally, lentiviral vector provided enhance therapeutic anti-tumor protection than Ad5. In conclusion, coupling lentiviral vector with \u03b22-microglobulin promoter represents a promising approach to produce long-lasting, high-quality cellular immunity for vaccinal purposes.",

Thus, the development of T-cell vaccines has become a major axis of research. So far, T-cell vaccines can induce substantial T-cell frequencies but still fail to achieve long-term efficacy against many chronic diseases 5 . Immunization strategies aiming at T-cell induction face two remarkable challenges: (i) identification of protective T-cell targets and (ii) maintenance of T-cell functionality and protective capacity in a durable manner. To date, immunization with viral vectors remains the most efficient strategy to induce CD8 + T-cell responses, having the edge over other molecular (e.g., DNA, RNA, and peptide) or cellular (e.g., dendritic cell-based, attenuated microorganism) vaccines 6 . Compared to other vaccine strategies, viral vectors efficiently deliver the transgene intracellularly, resulting in a sustained antigen expression. This favors the effective presentation through the major histocompatibility complex-I presentation machinery, initiating CD8 + T-cell responses. Furthermore, viral vector immunization induces local innate immune responses like a natural viral infection, promoting adaptive immune responses, thereby avoiding the need for additional adjuvant.",

Poxviruses were the first engineered antigen-encoding viral vectors to be tested in clinical trials. These include canarypox virus ALVAC, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), and New York attenuated vaccinia virus (NYVAC) 9 . However, the usage of poxvirus-derived vectors was impeded by (i) high prevalence of anti-vector immunity in the community 10 and (ii) weak capacity to induce memory T-cell responses 6 . Alphavirus-based vectors are self-limiting, as they provide a high transgene expression level at the cost of detrimental cell toxicity that interferes with antigen expression 11 . The widely adopted adenoviral vectors provide a more potent T-cell immunity compared to poxvirus-derived vectors 6 , giving them an advantage over the latter for clinical applications. However, similar to poxvirus-derived vectors, adenoviral vectors also suffer a dampened effectiveness in T-cell immunity due to pre-existing vectorspecific immunity in the population 12 . Even though pre-existing immunity against adenoviral vectors can be circumvented by employing serotype variants, the weak immunogenicity induced by these variants prevents them from being the top pick for vaccine vectors 13, 14 .",

Lentiviral vectors are majorly pseudo-typed with heterologous vesicular stomatitis virus envelop glycoprotein (VSV-G), to which human populations have negligible exposure. Therefore, lentiviral vectors do not suffer a decreased immunogenicity from the pre-existing vector-specific immunity. Lentiviral vectors are also capable of transducing dividing and non-dividing cells, notably dendritic cells 21, 22 , the most potent antigenpresenting cells (APCs) with a unique ability to activate na\u00efve T cells. The ability of lentiviral vectors to transduce APCs ensures prolonged endogenous antigen presentation due to the expression of antigen-encoding genes in the APCs throughout their lifespan. Considering the above-mentioned traits of lentiviral vectors, they offer an attractive option for further vaccine development suited for clinical applications. However, lentiviral-induced T-cell responses lack comprehensive documentation and systematic comparison with T-cell responses induced by other clinically adopted viral vectors.",

We showed that intramuscular (i.m.) immunization with lentiviral vector employing the \u03b22m promoter led to highly efficient in vivo dendritic cell transduction and in vivo transgene expression that lasted for at least 7 days post-immunization (dpi). We then investigated the magnitude, phenotype, functions, and memory features of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, induced by lentiviral vector immunization in mouse and rat models, in a head-to-head comparison with Ad5. We notably showed that, at similar frequencies of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, lentiviral vectors triggered a higher proportion of polyfunctional CD8 + T-cell effectors and induced a larger population of CD8 + T cells with central memory phenotype compared to Ad5. Further extension of our comparative immunogenicity study to the preclinical rat model demonstrated a large immunogenic advantage of lentiviral vector over Ad5. In an immune-therapeutic setting, immunization with lentiviral vector harboring \u03b22m promoter provided enhanced protection and survival in tumor-bearing mice compared to Ad5 immunization. Together with the advantage of quasi-absence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity against lentiviral vectors, these insights highlight the strengths of lentiviral vectors in a vaccination setting to achieve robust and durable CD8 + T-cell immunity. These results show that this lentiviral vector system has a potential critical avenue for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against a broad range of infectious diseases or malignancies.",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is commonly used as a viral internal promoter, owing to its high basal activity in a wide range of cell types. However, the presence of enhancer elements in CMV promoters could potentially cause hazardous insertional mutagenesis 23 . Towards better safety and immune response efficiency of lentiviral vector, we investigated the human \u03b22m promoter, which comprises minimal proximal APC-specific enhancer elements and is widely active in immune cells, notably dendritic cells. This promoter consists of highly conserved cis-regulatory elements, designated as interferonstimulated response elements (ISREs) and SXY modules (Fig. 1a) . The ISREs are the binding sites for the interferon regulatory factor family, while the SXY modules are cooperatively bound by a multiprotein complex. Together, these mediators drive the transactivation of the promoter 24 . The mediators of these regulatory elements are tightly coordinated by immune effectors such as cytokines, assuring a high transcriptional activity of this promoter, mainly in immune cells 25 . To assess the efficacy of \u03b22m promoter in dendritic cells, we transduced murine Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with an integrative lentiviral vector coding for the reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, under the regulation of CMV (LV-CMV-GFP) or \u03b22m (LV-\u03b22m-GFP) promoter. In parallel, we also transduced the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, a cell line that is efficiently transduced by a lentiviral vector as a positive control. Flow cytometric analysis at day 3 post-transduction of dendritic cells showed that LV-\u03b22m-GFP transduction led to similar percentages of GFP + cells and mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) when compared to LV-CMV-GFP (Fig. 1b) . In HEK 293T cells, the CMV promoter clearly showed better efficiency than the \u03b22m promoter (Fig. 1b) . These results demonstrated that the lentiviral vector harboring the \u03b22m promoter-with minimal APC-specific enhancer sequences-leads to high activity in dendritic cells, equivalent to the powerful CMV promoter which contains hazardous enhancer elements.",

To further understand the transgene persistence in vivo, we applied quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to spleen, pLNs, and muscle of lentiviral vector-immunized mice. We detected traces of nLuc transgene in pLNs and muscles until 30 dpi, but not in the spleen. At 90 dpi, nLuc transgene was no longer detectable in these organs, despite the integrative nature of the lentiviral vector used ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Therefore, after lentiviral vector immunization, a rapid burst of antigen expression occurs until 6 dpi, after which the transgene persistence until 30 dpi may still allow minute expression of antigen. Altogether, the expression of the antigen encoded by lentiviral vector is no longer detectable from 7 dpi, as determined by the very sensitive imaging technology using nLuc. Subsequently, there is complete clearance of the lentiviral vector from 30 dpi, as determined by qPCR.",

To identify the immune cell subsets transduced in vivo by lentiviral vector harboring the \u03b22m promoter, C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) were immunized i.m. with 5 \u00d7 10 7 TU of LV-\u03b22m-GFP or LV-\u03b22m-OVA as a negative control, and pLNs were collected at 5 dpi.

Various proportions of all these subsets were transduced by the lentiviral vector, with higher percentages of GFP + cells, i.e., 2-5%, detected in macrophages, conventional dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, versus only 0.47% and 0.76% detected in T and B cell subsets, respectively (Fig. 3b) . Such ability of lentiviral vector to transduce a large range of immune cell types was expected because of their pseudo-typing with VSV-G envelop glycoprotein, which can interact with a broad spectrum of cell types through low-density lipid receptor (LDLR) 26 . The lower infectibility of quiescent B and T cells by the lentiviral vector may result from their weak LDLR expression 27 .",

The distribution of the various functional subsets was globally similar in mice immunized with Ad5-CMV-EsxH or LV-\u03b22m-EsxH, both at early and late time points, with a predominant presence of IFN\u03b3 + TNF\u03b1 \u2212 IL-2 \u2212 , IFN\u03b3 + TNF\u03b1 + IL-2 \u2212 or IFN\u03b3 + TNF\u03b1 + IL-2 + cells. However, LV-\u03b22m-EsxH induced a significantly higher percentage of triple positive CD8 + T cells than Ad5-CMV-EsxH, at 28 and 90 dpi ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Altogether, these results show that compared to Ad5, the lentiviral vector triggers CD8 + T-cell responses with higher degrees of polyfunctionality, both at the early and late time points post-immunization.",

At 90 dpi, both LV-\u03b22m-EsxH and Ad5-CMV-EsxH groups experienced a decrease in T EM and an increase in T CM frequencies (Fig. 5b) . Further cell subsets analysis showed that the T EM induced by LV-\u03b22m-EsxH were distributed evenly among the SLECs, MPECs, and CD127 + KLRG1 + cells, but T EM induced by Ad5-CMV-EsxH were composed of up to 50% of terminally differentiated SLECs (Fig. 5c) . Therefore, at 28 dpi, Ad5-CMV-EsxH induced significantly more SLECs, but significantly fewer MPECs than the lentiviral vector ( Fig. 5d) . At 90 dpi, the percentages of MPECs in Ad5-immunized mice reached those induced earlier and maintained in lentiviral vector-immunized mice (Fig. 5d) . We observed no difference in the percentages of EECs or CD127 + KLRG1 + cells at any time point between the two groups. We further reinforced these conclusions by extending the observation to CD8 + T cells specific to OVA antigen, in mice immunized with Ad5-CMV-OVA or LV-\u03b22m-OVA (Fig. 5e ). Based on the higher percentages of T CM and MPECs in lentiviral vector-immunized mice at 28 dpi, antigen-specific CD8 + T cells elicited by lentiviral vector immunization displayed faster memory phenotype acquisition than those elicited by Ad5 immunization.",

Hence, we first evaluated the transduction efficiency of Ad5 or lentiviral vector in both outbred Sprague-Dawley rat and C57BL/6 mouse bone marrowderived dendritic cells We showed high dendritic cells transduction efficiency with LV-\u03b22m-GFP at MOI of 100 in both rat dendritic cells (34%) and mouse dendritic cells (44%) (Fig. 6a) .

The ability of lentiviral vectors to transduce non-dividing cells including dendritic cells is a considerable advantage when it comes to generating excellent antigen-specific immune responses, making it a promising viral vector platform for T-cell induction vaccines. However, the currently adopted combination of broad tropism envelope VSV-G and CMV promoter in many lentiviral vectors frequently results in nontargeted transgene expression in all cell types. The pan-cell type enhancer activity of the CMV promoter has shortcomings for translation into clinical usage due to the high risk of insertional mutagenesis 23 . For this reason, we established a targeted transgene expression using the human \u03b22m promoter. The \u03b22m promoter allows for an optimal expression of antigen in restricted subpopulations of APCs with rapid turnover rate and therefore, a short lifespan in the vaccinated host 34 , contributing to the safety of the vector.",

More importantly, LV-\u03b22m has demonstrated strong immunogenicity in a recent phase I HIV clinical trial (NCT02054286), establishing its practicality and the absence of adverse effects in humans. Despite our long experience in the field of lentiviral vector-based vaccines in various animal species, we have never observed any safety concern or adverse effect in vaccinated animals, no matter the promoter used, the dose or the route of administration. Such effects have not been reported by any other expert groups either. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the safety of LV-\u03b22m and LV-CMV experimentally in the context of the present work. However, vaccine safety is crucial and the current development of COVID-19 vaccines illustrated further how much any possible adverse effects must be anticipated. Hence, our strategy aiming at limiting the transgene expression to immune cells including APCs by using the \u03b22m promoter instead of the strong ubiquitous CMV enhancer-promoter, with its high probability of insertional mutagenesis 32 , can further improve the safety of lentiviral vector.",

We observed that the transgene expression was majorly limited to the site of injection, in this case, the muscle, with detectable bioluminescence signal up to 7 dpi. The duration of transgene expression is dependent on its immunogenicity, such that highly immunogenic antigens could result in shorter-expression due to the elimination of antigenexpressing cells by the immune response. In this case, the minimally immunogenic GFP 36 and luciferase 37 could result in longer transgene expression than the strong M. tuberculosis or HIVderived immunogens. Using a highly sensitive qPCR-based approach, we detected the presence of transgene at least until 30 dpi, but not at 90 dpi. This observation contrasts with previous reports describing the long persistence of the transgene up to 90; dpi 38, 39 . The discrepancy in the duration of the transgene persistence between these previous works and the present study could arise from differences in doses and routes of lentiviral vector immunization.",

In contrast, the Ad5-induced CD8 + T cells were majorly IFN\u03b3 + TNF\u03b1 + IL-2 \u2212 . IL-2 is required for optimal effector cell expansion 40 and is especially important in the settings of diminished CD4 + T cells to maintain CD8 + T-cell proliferative potential via an autocrine loop 41 . In terms of memory maintenance, endogenous IL-2 is critical for CD8 + T-cell memory homeostasis 42 , and administration of exogenous IL-2 can emphasize the memory CD8 + T-cell pool 43, 44 . The weak ability of Ad5 to induce IL-2-producing CD8 + T cells can also be indicative of partial CD8 + T-cell exhaustion, as described by Wherry et al. 45 . Numerous human or animal studies on HIV/SIV, tuberculosis, and leishmania indicate that multifunctional T cells are the best effectors in controlling pathogen loads [46] [47] [48] [49] . In fact, we also demonstrated that better protective efficacy was obtained by LV-\u03b22m compared to Ad5-CMV in a therapeutic immunization with the EG.7 tumor model, which could be also be linked to the high degree of multifunctionality of T cells induced via LV-\u03b22m immunization. The differences in cytokine profiles induced by the lentiviral vector and Ad5 may be explained by the distinct cell types targeted by the two viral vectors, associated with the respective downstream antigen presentation mechanisms and/or inflammatory pathways.",

After vaccination, several functionally distinct subsets of antigen-specific T cells can be defined as MPECs (CD127 + KLRG1 \u2212 ), SLECs (CD127 \u2212 KLRG1 + ) and T CM (CD62L + CD44 \u2212 ) 31,51 . Using two distinct antigens, we observed an earlier stabilization of T CM populations and a higher amount of MPECs after lentiviral vector immunization compared to Ad5. T CM cells reside in lymphoid tissues and have long-lived characteristics, while MPECs, though adopting effector-like phenotype, confer a high likelihood of contributing to memory populations 52 . Therefore, the higher percentage of T CM and MPECs found after lentiviral vector immunization indicates a better memory response induced by the lentiviral vector. In line with previous studies, our present investigation demonstrated that Ad5 immunization primed a predominately T EM response, and could be attributed to the long-term antigen persistence after Ad5 administration 53, 54 . Ad5 immunization provides sustained antigen stimulus resembling persistent infections such as those caused by HIV and CMV. These persisting infections often induce antigen-specific T cells with low CD127 expression and Fig. 4 More efficacious induction of polyfunctional T cells by lentiviral vector compared to Ad5 vector.

The pre-existing vector-specific immunity includes neutralizing antibodies, specific T cells, or type I IFNactivated NK cells, hampering the antigenicity of the vaccine vector by limiting its persistence and/or eliminating the targeted cells before an efficient initiation of specific antigen expression and thus induction of an immune response 61 . To overcome the setbacks of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, Adenoviral vectors from rare human serotypes or animal-derived serotypes with low seroprevalence across all geographical regions were engineered 62 . Although pre-existing Ad5 neutralizing antibodies do not heavily impede animal-derived serotypes 63, 64 , utilization of these serotypes should be taken with extra caution due to the uncertain impact of adenoviruses-specific T cells on vector efficacy 61 . Besides, there is also evidence suggesting that these animal-derived Ad serotypes are less immunogenic and protective than human-derived Ad5 serotypes in the absence of pre-existing immunity in animal models 13, 14 . Conversely, the VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vector immunization vector presents no risk of specific vector immunity in humans, as VSV is not a natural human pathogen 65 . If repeated administration of lentiviral vector is required in prime-boost vaccination regimens, the impact of anti-envelope immunity induced after prime can be circumvented by the use of heterologous VSV-G protein envelopes for boost, counteracting possible induction of anti-vector immunity 19, 66 .",

Sequential images were captured under the auto-exposure settings. To image individual organs and tissues, mice were dissected 10 min after administration of furimazine at 4 mg/kg and imaged within 3 min after dissection with an exposure time of 60 s. Images from each experimental set were analyzed using Living Image Software (Ver. 2.50.1 Xenogen). Measurements from regions of interest were selected and the luminescence values were evaluated as average radiance (p/s/cm 2 /sr). The baseline signals were obtained from mice immunized with the control LV-\u03b22m-GFP vector.",
