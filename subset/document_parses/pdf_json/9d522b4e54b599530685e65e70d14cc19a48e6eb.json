For the first time in history, nearly real-time data on cases, deaths, vaccination administration, etc. has become available from multiple sources to describe the most important pandemic in the last century 1-3 . While this information can help evaluate the dynamics of the pandemic, to better measure the impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, clinical and epidemiological information is required on patients suffering from COVID-19, as well as other aspects related to health systems and surveillance, human culture, behavior and mobility and social inequalities. More than ever, innovative data access processes and methods have become essential to understanding, managing and mitigating the effects of a pandemic in any region of the world 4 .",

This platform aims to provide a user-friendly interface, enabling researchers and policymakers to assess the impact of the spread of (emerging) infectious diseases in their respective areas of interest. To this end, the project has five main objectives: 1) Allow users to identify infectious disease threats; 2) Perform data collection that can provide users with the information needed to answer real-world questions; 3) Perform data curation and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processed; 4) Develop and apply data analysis and modelling scenarios; 5) Provide users with scientific information to communicate to stakeholders and the public in general (Figure 1 ). By integrating these five objectives, we can harness the power of health data analytics to respond to COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks or future pandemics, as well as address health challenges, including conducting research on prevention, transmission and control.",

PAMEpi's aims includes disease modeling, dissemination of scientific information on the COVID-19 pandemic at individual or aggregated levels and the promotion of multi-national cooperative studies, for which clean, harmonised and normalised data is a fundamental resource 15, 16 .

Data from the other sources may be updated daily, weekly or monthly depending on the respective source. Scripts in Python language were elaborated to create and update the data lake automatically 17 . Users can download and organize data locally, on an isolated partition or in an online repository, and can run these tasks manually or schedule them as system tasks. Due to the large volume of individualized information stored across several databases, an API available from the OpenData SUS portal can be used to update the information in the data lake. The next step involves data curation. For this, we 1) examine field names, variable types and categorical values (if applicable) and compare them to previous versions of the data at each moment of data updating; 2) perform semantic enrichment, data harmonization and cleaning to facilitate the use of information from multiple databases; 3) normalize data, to better structure the dataset by reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity; 4) generate metadata. The environment used to load and process these datasets was built using Python (PySpark tool) and all codes to perform these tasks are available from PAMEpi GitHub code repository 17 .",

In addition, tachypnea, hypoxemia, cyanosis, intercostal retraction, dehydration, and loss of appetite are relevant symptoms among children.

FSdb is organized according to each federal unit (i.e., state) of the Brazilian federation, while SARSdb files are organized annually (one per year). FSdb is available in .csv format, with a total of 30 variables and a size of around 15 GB in December 2021. In turn, SARSdb, also available in .csv format, contains 161 variables and a size of around 2 GB in December 2021. Variables provide spatial and temporal information on reported cases, as well as patient clinical (symptoms, comorbidities, etc.) and demographic (age, municipality of residence, etc.) data ( Figure 4) . Additionally, SARSdb also contains each patient's vaccination status against influenza or COVID-19 (vaccination cycle, type of vaccine, etc.) and hospitalization information (clinical ward or intensive care unit). FSdb and SARSdb are updated weekly with newly included case information. As of November 2021, more than 21% of the cases registered in FSdb were confirmed as COVID-19 (13,895,387 registries), with more than 67% resulting in cure and less than 1% in deaths ( Figure 5 ). By contrast, SARSdb contained reports of more than two million suspected severe-to-critical cases. Of these, 66.1% were confirmed to be COVID-19, with 32.4% being admitted to an ICU and a resulting death rate >50%. Among patients who were hospitalized but not admitted to ICU, 17.5% died from COVID-19, and more than 74% achieved cure ( Figure 5 ). Assigning a definitive classification to cases of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a challenge for Brazilian health authorities, as evidenced by high percentages of indeterminate cases in FSdb and SARSdb ( Figure 5 ). As is typical for other diseases in Brazil (such as arboviruses and leprosy) 19, 20 , many cases go undetected, and those reported in health databases are usually not updated with a final classification due to the huge number of registered patients and lack of laboratory facilities and testing. This limitation affects the estimation of true disease prevalence and the implementation of appropriate control measures. Under this scenario, mathematical, statistical and computational methodologies have been extensively employed to better understand the reality reflected by the information contained in Brazilian databases to address deficiencies, and provide more reliable estimates of true disease prevalence by inferring diagnosis status for cases not definitively classified in the database records 20-22 .",

The automatic retrieval was followed by manual human curation, when each decree was read, categorized, and multiple meta-data were systematically derived, including the geographic coverage of the measures and the validity period of the decree. Based on the type of measure processed, a metric was created, defined as the stringency index 25 , which combines the different enacted laws to summarize the level of governmental strictness over any given period of the pandemic. The contents of evaluated decrees (in Portuguese) and the resulting stringency index over time are freely available and regularly updated within the PAMepi platform at https://pamepi.rondonia.fiocruz.br/en/decree_en.html.",

However, as changes in disease status occur due to human interventions (e.g., changes in mobility patterns, non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine campaigns), the source databases may add or remove variables (or even include additional categories within variables). For example, this was observed in SARSdb and Vacdb when new variables were added to account for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were vaccinated, as well as to incorporate the administration of additional doses during the ongoing national vaccination campaign, respectively. Therefore, regular monitoring of data sources, which we perform, is necessary to update the automated script used to execute data lake updates.",

For SARSdb, we assessed the completeness of sex, age group, scholarity, residential area (urban or rural), date of hospitalisation, ICU admission, case evolution, final classification and symptoms (each is represented by a variable in SARSdb), such as fever, cough, throat pain, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, saturation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue.

We then evaluated the completeness of first dose, second dose, third dose/reinforce, single-dose and single-dose/reinforce variables across Brazil, and in each state by age and ethnicity. Table 2 details completeness information for FSdb, SARSdb and Vacdb at a national level. Age group, sex and symptoms presented the highest completeness in FSdb (>99%), while final classification and evolution were lower (47.14% and 33.34%, respectively). For SARSdb, 63.88% of the records contained indeterminate information on scholarity. The lowest percentage of completeness was found for the sex variable. Among symptoms, the variables dyspnea and cough showed higher completeness, while fatigue and abdominal pain were lower (Table 2) . Completeness for all vaccination dose types in Vacdb by age group reached over 99% (Table 2) . Sex by all vaccination dose types achieved almost 100% completeness.

We have provided a description of all routines employed to collect, store, organise, integrate and use data in real-time for potential use in exploratory analysis, modelling and visualisation at both individual and aggregated levels. Furthermore, this approach is not solely limited to COVID-19, as the health data ingested also contains reports on other respiratory diseases circulating in the country. Therefore, our efforts can be extended to other diseases (particularly respiratory diseases) to include additional important variables (e.g., biogeoclimatic parameters) and potentially aid in the response to future emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases.
