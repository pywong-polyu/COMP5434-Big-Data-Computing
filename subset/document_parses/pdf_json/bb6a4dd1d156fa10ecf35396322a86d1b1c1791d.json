These environmental stimulations have an impact on mental health, particularly in the case of children. Worldwide measures such as quarantine, social and physical distancing, and school closure can potentially take a toll on children's mental health, in both the short and long terms. Grief, adjustment disorder and acute stress disorder (ASD) are some of the mental health issues that children are prone to suffer during a pandemic, leading to mood disorder, psychosis and even suicidal tendency, if not addressed and treated timely. As the pandemic continues, it is crucial to monitor children's mental health status. Parents/ caregivers must receive continuous guidance on handling the situation appropriately. Both professionals and families/caregivers must tend to children's mental health needs to safeguard their overall well-being.",

This can lead to effective communication without underestimating or overestimating the children's understanding; for example, when talking to children aged 4-7 years old, parents/caretakers have to be careful of their children blaming themselves for causing the illness because of their previous bad behaviour (21) . Children at that age are influenced by imaginative thinking and hence believe that their wishes, thoughts or irrelevant actions can create external events (21) . For instance, they may believe that their friend is sick because they wished for it. For this reason, listening to children is as important as talking to them.",
