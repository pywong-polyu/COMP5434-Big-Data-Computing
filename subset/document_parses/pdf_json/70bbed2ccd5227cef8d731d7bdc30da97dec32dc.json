So, with the exception of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, no vaccine for any disease has been brought to clinical use so quickly. Therefore, even with strict management, it can still bring some special adverse effects. One of the most notable is the adverse cardiovascular reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. No case reports of individuals with irreversible arrhythmia complications following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been found in the available literature. We report the first case of a postoperative man with Marfan syndrome with atrial fibrillation after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

This patient had Bentall operation and mitral valve replacement and possibly had an acute arrhythmia or upper respiratory tract infection. However, an upper respiratory tract infection cannot cause atrial fibrillation. When the vaccine is just injected, the first consideration should be the side effects of the vaccine.Our patient could not be explained by COVID-19 infection developing arrhythmias because there is no clinical history supporting a prior COVID-19 infection. 9 In our case, we speculate that adverse reaction against the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was responsible for the development of atrial fibrillation due to its temporal relationship. The mechanism of atrial fibrillation after receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will require substantial evidences other than temporal aspects, such as careful measurement of biochemical and immunologic markers. Of course, it needs to be encouraged to report these adverse events by medical workers.",
