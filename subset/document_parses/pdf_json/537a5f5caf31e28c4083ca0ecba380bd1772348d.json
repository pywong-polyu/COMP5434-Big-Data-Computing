            "text": "Background: Anatomical and experimental data indicate that onabotulinimtoxin A could be more efficient and costeffective for treating chronic migraine with injections targeting the cranial sutures, where collaterals from the meninges penetrate the skull. Methods: A new injection paradigm (FollowTheSutures) was tested for safety, tolerability and feasibility in a Phase II, open-label, non-controlled, single-center pilot study. Ninety units of onabotulinimtoxin A (Botox V R ), were injected in 18 sites over the area of the cranial sutures. Adverse events and potential beneficial effects were recorded in a headache diary at least 4 weeks before, and for 12 weeks after the injections. A higher dilution than normal of onabotulinimtoxin A was used to get better diffusion. Results: Nineteen (of 20 included) women with chronic migraine received the injections and were evaluable. There was only one treatment-related adverse event (reduced power of chewing for some weeks). Otherwise, the procedure was overall well tolerated. Patients improved on most efficacy parameters after the injections. There was little or no effect on glabellar or forehead lines. Conclusions: The protocol was safe and well tolerated. Lower risk of unblinding due to the absence of cosmetic effects should make the injection procedure well suited for a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study. If efficacy is confirmed, it will be markedly less costly than the standard procedure. Trial registration: EUDRACT (2017-002516-13), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03543254).",

The effect in CM was shown in a pooled analysis of two large studies (PREEMPT 1 and 2) (1-3), including almost 1400 patients who had injections of five units of BoNT-A or placebo in 31 sites in the head and neck (PREEMPT injection paradigm), and in addition up to 40 units at different sites of maximal pain. The fact that many patients may experience cosmetic effects with loss of forehead and glabellar lines with the PREEMPT injection paradigm raises the question of unblinding. In addition, the most common adverse events were related to the muscles injected in the forehead and neck, including neck pain, muscular weakness, and eyelid ptosis. In general, the safety and tolerability of the procedure was good.",

Overall, the injection paradigm was well tolerated with the only treatment related adverse event occurring in one patient who noted partial reduction in chewing power without problems with eating. This was probably related to the injections in the temporalis muscles. Neck pain and paresis of neck muscles, which may be found with the PREEMPT procedure, is avoided. Weakness of frontalis and glabellar muscles with cosmetic changes and ptosis are also mostly avoided with this injection paradigm, although it is a limitation that ability to make forehead wrinkles was only based on patients' self-assessment at home and reported on the phone. The procedure was easy to perform, taking on average less than 6 min. There was a clear learning Table 2 . curve, so with experience, when it is no longer necessary to measure distances from the anatomical landmarks, this time can likely be substantially reduced. None of the patients found the procedure very painful (maximum degree 4 on a 0-10 scale). Hence, the procedure seems to be safe, effective, easy to perform, well tolerated, less burdensome (18 injections versus 31-39 injections), and possibly more cost-effective (90 units vs. 155-195 units) compared to the PREEMPT technique. Only two patients thought there might be a little reduction in ability to make forehead wrinkles one week after the injection. Hence, in a potential future controlled and blinded trial, effective blinding may be achieved.",

In this period, the change in mean headache days was \u00c042%, mean migraine days \u00c043% (including both definite and probable migraine), and mean moderate to severe headache days were \u00c043%. This is substantially higher than the comparable figures for the primary efficacy endpoints in the present study (\u00c024%, \u00c027% and \u00c09%). Comparing the percentage of 50% responders with regard to headache days, this were 48% in PREEMPT and 26% in the present study. However, there are many differences between the two studies that make a comparison difficult. Compared to the present study, patients in PREEMPT had more days with migraine (19.9 vs. 10.4) in the baseline period, and the efficacy data in PREEMPT occurred after two injections, whereas in this study we only evaluated outcomes after one injection. In the PREEMPT trials, the efficacy increases over time and after the second injection, as is seen in most migraine preventive trials. On the other hand, the placebo effect may be larger when there is no placebo arm. This, and the fact that a marked improvement was seen in the placebo arm of the PREEMPT study, make speculations about an effect, or lack of effect, in the present study futile.",
