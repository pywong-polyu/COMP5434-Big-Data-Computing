The objective of this study was to describe the initial symptoms and laboratory test values of patients who presented to the emergency department with dengue or COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was performed in a single center in Cali, Colombia. The inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of dengue or COVID-19 who were older than 14 years of age. All patients experienced fever or other symptoms for fewer than 10 days. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the differences in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and dengue, and was adjusted for sex and age group (# 31 and . 31 years). The sample size was calculated to test the hypothesis that the median NLR in COVID-19 patients is higher than that in dengue patients. A P value , 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. A total of 93 patients were included: 70 with dengue and 23 with COVID-19. Dengue patients were younger than COVID-19 patients. There were significant differences between dengue and COVID-19 patients regarding platelet count (P , 0.01), neutrophil count (P , 0.01), NLR (P , 0.01), and abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) (P 5 0.03). The NLR was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in dengue patients (P , 0.01). In conclusion, during the first week of symptoms, absolute neutrophil count, NLR, and platelet count could help guide the initial differential approach between dengue and COVID-19. These findings could be useful in geographical areas with a lack of resources.",

These issues are more common in tropical countries affected by other infectious diseases, such as dengue, that cause signs and symptoms similar to COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Major challenges in diagnosis often occur because of the limited access to specific diagnostic tests for each disease 9,10 and a misdiagnosis in the acute stage of these diseases can lead to an incorrect therapeutic approach and consequently to unfavorable clinical outcomes for patients.",

These results might be useful in dengue hyperendemic areas and tropical regions where the initial differentiation between COVID-19 and dengue in their early stages can be challenging in some cases. These results may also help in clinical decisionmaking and prevent the misdiagnosis of dengue and COVID-19. We found that dengue patients were younger than those with COVID-19. Dengue fever has been known to occur in both children and adults, but severe dengue occurs more commonly in older children. 28 However, severe dengue in older adult patients has also been reported in tropical countries, and the mortality is increased in this population [29] [30] [31] [32] despite being only a minority of patients. 9 In contrast, COVID-19 tends to affect adults and older adults, but the most severe cases affected are those over 60 years of age. 33 Older adults above age 80 have a case fatality rate of 14.8%. 34 Based on the symptoms at presentation, fever, rash, and intense abdominal pain were more frequent in dengue patients than in COVID-19 patients, who mostly had cough and dyspnea.

It is known that an elevated NLR is an independent prognostic biomarker that affects pneumonia progression in COVID-19 patients. The above can be explained by the increase in the neutrophil count and a lower limit of lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients, whereas dengue patients have leukopenia with neutropenia but present with lymphocytosis (Table  2) .

It is speculated that thrombocytopenia can occur by four mechanisms: cytokine storm, direct infection of hematopoietic and bone marrow stromal cells, increased antibodies and immune complexes, and lung injury. 41 Elevated aminotransferase levels were found in dengue patients. Aminotransferases are enzymes that catalyze transamination reactions and are markers of hepatocellular injury. 42 In dengue, marked elevation constitutes one of the signs of disease severity since the liver is one of the target organs of virus infection, 43 and these tests are routinely requested in patients hospitalized for dengue for clinical follow-up. In COVID-19, aminotransferases may be normal or slightly elevated; however, a marked elevation of these enzymes may constitute a marker of severity in the disease due to a systemic FIGURE 1. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive ability to classify between COVID-19 and dengue. inflammatory response mechanism. 44 Consequently, the dengue and SARS-CoV-2 viruses can affect the liver, and aminotransferase levels could be elevated in both diseases. Initially, they will be elevated mainly in dengue. Dengue diagnosis is performed in tropical regions through characteristic symptom identification, such as fever, and laboratory findings, such as thrombocytopenia and capillary leakage. 20 Currently, serological tests have been implemented and are used to confirm dengue virus infection. Nevertheless, the similarity in some of the symptoms between dengue and COVID-19, together with the potential crossreactions in serological tests, could lead to difficulty in diagnosis and is an important issue to be considered. Several studies have reported false-positive dengue serology results in COVID-19 patients. 45 In these patients, dengue virus infection is ruled out after controlled serological tests showing no evidence of seroconversion or persistence of positivity and the exclusion of the diagnosis of dengue by RT-PCR. Therefore, positive results in dengue serology should be carefully interpreted after the consideration of the possibility of COVID-19 patients. 46 Finally, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in dengue hyperendemic regions, we recommend the careful evaluation of CBC and aminotransferase values, especially in regards to white blood cell count, platelet count, and NLR, for the evaluation of differential diagnoses during patient work up in the ER, and these values could be helpful in areas with limited resources and laboratory technologies.",

Fourth, serological tests were used to diagnose dengue, which has a lower performance than the RT-PCR method, which increases the proportion of false negatives. However, dengue clinical practice guidelines (CPG) in Colombia recommend its use and implementation. 47 Fifth, two laboratory tests were used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the study because, in Colombia, the implementation of the diagnostic tests was initially the responsibility of the National Institutes of Health and later was the decision of the different hospitals and laboratories, according to the test availability. Finally, using serological tests for the diagnosis of dengue while using molecules for the diagnosis of COVID-19 reduced the diagnostic accuracy since a positive serological test does not always preclude acute infection.",
