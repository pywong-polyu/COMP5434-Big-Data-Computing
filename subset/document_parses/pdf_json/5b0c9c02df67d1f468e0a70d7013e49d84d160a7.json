Though it may be tempting to ration care based on age and life expectancy, we find this approach undefendable from an ethical viewpoint. The authors of this article are geriatric oncologists, with no special training in medical ethics. The article is meant as a starting point for the discussion of a problem likely to become more and more common with the aging of the population and the mounting costs of health care. For example, when cytotoxic chemotherapy was the main treatment of systemic cancer, it was relatively easy to recognize individuals for whom the treatment was contraindicated, due to short life expectancy and risks of complications [1] . With new form of biological therapy risk of toxicity may not be anymore a selection criteria and the number of patients requiring these treatments may overwhelm the resources of the health care system.",

Fig. 1 illustrates two different ethical constructs that are involved in this problem [2] . Deontological ethics is based on the second Kantian moral imperative, according to which every human life has the same value, or best said one cannot prioritize the saving of one human life over another. According to this principle, rationing is unacceptable under all circumstances. The pillars of deontological ethics include patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice as articulated by Beauchamp and Childress. In other words, a patient has the right to accept or refuse a life-saving medical intervention based on personal preferences. Though our patient was in agreement with the dispositions of the Italian government, nonetheless his autonomy was infringed upon as the ventilatory option was denied to him \"a priori.\" Also, the disposition of the Trentino government refuted the principle of justice, as it used residence or citizenship as a criterion to ration care. This criterion would deny access to life-saving treatment to the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in Europe and North America.",

In Fig. 1 we show that utilitarian and deontological ethics may converge when the evaluation of benefits includes individual values in each medical decision. For some patients the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy of cancer may be worth the additional cost and toxicity while for others it may not be worth it. According to the principle of autonomy, the patient is the final arbiter of what is worth his/her while. When the patient is incompetent the decision needs to be based on previous dispositions (living will) or on the judgement of a health care surrogate. One cannot emphasize enough the importance of a living will to provide treatment according to the principles of deontological ethics.",

According to this principle, the life of an industrial CEO should be saved preferentially over the life of a homeless person, as the latter is not economically productive, or simply would burden the society with the cost of a treatment he/she cannot pay for. As a matter of fact, in a capitalistic society, economic means do affect to some extent access to health care.

First because life expectancy is difficult to determine [5] , second because nobody has the right to decide how worthy is even a short life expectancy.

While the epidemic may be compared to a natural disaster or to a battlefield, the problem of rationing may become compelling even in non-emergent situations. The aging of the population by itself may overwhelm the capacity to provide care. We can draw three provisional conclusions: acceptable to consider an emergency as any situation in which the demand of life-saving care exceeds the availability. It is unacceptable, however, to limit life-saving care to the resident of a certain region or country, as this provision refutes the principle of justice. 2. Age and life-expectancy are not legitimate categories to assign lifesaving treatment. Salvageability is and so is the prioritization for certain groups of individuals such as active health professionals or members of the security forces. 3. This epidemic is an opportunity for everybody to revisit the issue of living wills. Given the fact that health care resources may become scarcer with the aging of the population, it is a civic duty to make one's preference known in advance and avoid in this way overburdening the sanitary system. As geriatric oncologists we have the duty to illustrate to our patient what is a realistic prognosis in each individual case and allow people to manage their end of life.",
