It has created unprecedented economic cost burdens for economies all over the world, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, i.e., BRICS countries. In addition to dire health consequences, the COVID-19 is creating worldwide uncertainty and enormous economic and social impacts. The BRICS represent the most advanced emerging countries during the last two decades (Chkili and Nguyen, 2014) , and are closely related with each other in trading, financial markets, local government cooperation etc. Chinese financial markets are the epicenter of the COVID-19 financial contagion (Corbet et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2017) . Thereby, it is necessary to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 on BRICS exchange rate markets, one of the largest financial markets, from the perspective of pairwise dependences.",

However, it has produced significant short-term effects on financial markets and the global economy. For example, Corbet et al. (2020) find that brand names containing \"corona\" suffered abnormal losses and trading volatilities after the announcement of the COVID-19. The evidence in Conlon and McGee (2020) and Corbet et al. (2020) indicates that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin act as amplifiers of contagion across financial markets during the pandemic period. The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 has caused environmental and economic impacts, e.g., improved the air quality (Atalan, 2020; Saadat et al., 2020) . Sharif et al. (2020) report effects of the COVID-19 on the geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty in the United States and argue that the pandemic can be viewed as an economic crisis. Goodell (2020) highlights possible effects of the COVID-19 on economic and social issues, including health, employment productivity, tourism, foreign direct investment, banking and insurance, government spending and spillovers across financial markets. Eichenbaum et al. (2020) incorporate the interaction mechanism between the pandemic and economic decisions of consumption and labor supply into a canonical epidemiology model. Janus (2021) highlights that the GDP dynamics and the sensitivity of bond yields to the Chicago Board Option Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) are the two most pronounced determinants of a country's vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Thereby, this paper attempts to address the effect of the COVID-19 on exchange rate dependences across BRICS countries. We adopt one of the most widely used GARCH model to describe marginal distributions of exchange rates (Zhou et al., 2019) . Then, we apply the copula approach, which captures bivariate dynamic correlations to measure pairwise dependences between Chinese yuan (CNY) and the currencies of other BRICS economies. Specifically, we apply the Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) mechanism to optimize parameters of copula models. The GAS framework uses the lagged score of the density function to force the updating of parameters, which provides the steepest ascent direction for improving the model fitting. Blasques et al. (2015) show that the GAS model improves the local Kullback-Liebler divergence between the true conditional density and the implied density generated by many alternative models. The results suggest robust negative effects of the COVID-19 on exchange rate dependences between CNY and other currencies of BRICS. The results provide additional information on the effects of the on-going spread of virus and the possible second round pandemic on international foreign exchange markets.",

The foreign exchange returns are calculated as r t = 100*ln(P t /P t \u2212 1 ), where P t is the daily closing exchange rate at time t. We organize the analysis along three periods according to the white paper released on June 7, 2020 by the State Council Information Office of China: Incubation (December 27, 2019 through January 19, 2020), Fever (January 20, 2020 through March 17, 2020), Moderation (March 18, 2020 to April 28, 2020), and Normalization (April 29, 2020 to April 26, 2021). Thereby, four dummy variables regarding the COVID-19 are introduced: . Meanwhile, about two months after the onset of the pandemic in China, Saudi authorities offered discounts in oil prices which caused the largest fall of 20% to 30% in crude oil price since the Gulf war. The oil price shocks exert distinct effects on exchange rates in BRICS (Lin and Su, 2020) . Meanwhile, the interest rate and uncertainties of macroeconomies affect exchanges rates (Wei et al., 2020) . Hence, we control the USDX returns, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil returns, the overnight LIBOR, and the logarithm of VIX in the empirical study to test whether the COVID-19 itself essentially affects foreign exchange dependences. We also interact the COVID-19 dummy variables with USDX returns, i.e., COVID i,t \u00d7 USDX t , because previous studies suggest changes in effects of USD returns on foreign exchange dependences in responses to great transitions (Dimitriou et al., 2017) .",

Table 3 summarizes the estimation results of copula models. The estimates of \u03d1 are significantly positive for four currencies, i.e., BRL, INR, RUB, and ZAR, showing that the dependences between these currencies with CNY are highly dynamic and persistent. Comparatively, INR shows less persistent dependences with CNY than the other currencies because of a smaller estimate of \u03d1. Fig. 1 displays dynamic dependences between the four currencies and CNY. In line with Table 3 , the dependence between INR and CNY is less persistent than the other three currency pairs. We observe changes after the breakout of the COVID-19. In the first and second stages of the pandemic, one can find decreased dependences for two currency pairs, i.e., BRL-CNY and RUB-CNY. The INR-CNY pair is different with relatively fluctuating dependences, whereas the ZAR-CNY pair is relatively stable in the first two stages. The dependences between CNY and the other currencies within the BRICS show no significant changes in the third stage when China achieved an initial victory in fighting against the COVID-19. In the fourth stage, when China stepped into the comparatively stable phase with decreasing confirmed cases and deaths, the dependences of CNY with BRL and ZAR increase for a while, whereas the dependence between CNY and RUB decreases for approximately two months. One possible reason is the breakout and fever of COVID-19 in the other countries. Table 4 presents the effects of the COVID-19 on foreign exchange dependences between CNY and the other currencies in BRICS via the estimation of Eq. (5). In line with observations of Fig. 1 , the COVID-19 has an overall negative effect on foreign exchange dependences. Specifically, in stage one, the pandemic exerts a significant negative effect on dependences of BRL-CNY pair. In the second stage, when confirmed cases and deaths in China increased dramatically, the dependences show the steepest descents in the INR-CNY pair. The risk aversion induced by fear sentiments and trading embargos with China are important reasons for decreased dependences with CNY. In stage two, when many countries revealed dramatic news of infections, they implemented international travel control measures and even locked down many cities. In this stage, we find decreased currency dependences. Nevertheless, the third stage shows no significant effect on all currency dependences. In stage four, the COVID-19 maintains a negative effect on the dependence of the RUB-CNY pair.",

The USD tends to appreciate during the crisis. A similar trend is observed for BRICS shortly after the breakout of the COVID-19. However, the results in Table 4 suggest that the USDX return has no significant effects on dependences between CNY and other BRICS currencies in stages one and four. Specifically, INR is positively impacted by USDX returns in stage two, whereas BRL and RUB are positively affected in stage three. The United States is an important export market for BRICS, particularly for India and China. Significant appreciations in the USD stimulate imports of the United States and thus improve co-movements between currencies of its main importing partners. This assumption is supported by the study on developed markets (Antonakakis, 2012) . Similarly, we find positive, albeit insignificantly, effects of the USDX returns on dependences between CNY and ZAR for stages two, three, and four. The rapid spread of the pandemic since March 2020 reduced exports of China and India to the United States and dramatic fluctuations in USDX. As expected, in stage 2, the USD appears to exert intensified positive effects on co-movements between currencies of its main importing partners. Alternatively, exchange rate contagion is more frequently observed within the same region, e.g., Asia (Cubillos-Rocha et al., 2019), contributing to the intensified effect of the USD on the INR-CNY dependence. The INR is a net receiver of currency volatility spillover (Wen and Wang, 2020) , thus significant fluctuations in the USD and CNY transfers to INR.",

However, the regression results indicate that the VIX exhibits no significant effect on currency dependences within the BRICS. Similarly, the interest rate measured by LIBOR shows no significant impact on the currency dependences except for the BRL-CNY pair. Such finding is in line with Hameed and Rose (2018) that small and negative interest rates appear to exert little impact on exchange rate behaviors. Overall, empirical evidence shows that the COVID-19 has produced significant effects on currency dependences across BRICS economies.",
