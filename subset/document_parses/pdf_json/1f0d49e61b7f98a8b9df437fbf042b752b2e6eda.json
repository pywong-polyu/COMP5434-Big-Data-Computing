            "text": "Benzoxonium chloride (N-benzyl-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dodecan-1-aminium chloride, BOC), known for over 30 years [1], manifests strong antimicrobial activity against certain bacterial strains, especially non-spore forming, yeasts and protozoa. In practice, BOC is widely used against buccopharyngeal pathogens as a mucous membrane disinfectant. It is commercially available in the form of gargle solutions, lozenges, and oral sprays, often in combination with lidocaine [2, 3] . Likewise in dentistry it is used against dental plaque and dental caries [4, 5] . Further applications include disinfection of medical instruments in hospitals, and of skin burns, seborrheic dermatitis, and cutaneous leishmaniosis [4, 6, 7] , as a veterinary fungicide and bactericide in the treatment of animal skin, in the food and beverage industry, and in the textile industry as a bactericide in textile pounds were fully characterized by NMR spectra and HRMS. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMR S500 (operating at 500 MHz for 1 H and 125 MHz for 13 C; Varian Co., Palo Alto, CA, USA). The chemical shifts (d) are given in ppm, relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Coupling constants (J) are reported in Hz. Splitting patterns are designated as s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; and m, multiplet. Mass spectra were recorded using a combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry: highresolution mass spectra (HRMS) and sample purities were obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV and mass spectrometric (MS) detection gradient method. The system used in this study was a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC: RS Pump, RS Column Compartment, RS Autosampler, Diode Array Detector, controlled by Chromeleon (version 7.2.9 build 11323) software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, Germany) with Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer with Thermo Xcalibur (version 3.1.66.10.) software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Detection was performed by mass spectrometer in positive mode. Settings of the heated electrospray source were: Spray voltage 3.5 kV, Capillary temperature: 262 \u2022 C, Sheath gas: 55 arbitrary units, Auxiliary gas: 15 arbitrary units, Spare gas: 3 arbitrary units, Probe heater temperature: 250 \u2022 C, Max spray current: 100 mA, S-lens RF Level: 50. C18 column (Kinetex EVO C18, 3 \u00d7 150 mm, 2.6 \u00b5m, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used in this study. Mobile phase A was ultrapure water of ASTM I type (resistivity 18.2 M\u2126.cm at 25 \u2022 C) prepared by Barnstead Smart2Pure 3 UV/UF apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (HPLC-MS grade, Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany); mobile phase B was acetonitrile (MS grade, Honeywell-Sigma Aldrich) with 0.1% (v/v) of formic acid. The flow was constant at 0.4 mL/min. The method started with 1 min of isocratic flow of 5% B, and then the gradient of B rose to 100% B in 3 min and remained constant at 100% B for 1 min. The composition then went back to 5% B and equilibrated for 5 min. Total runtime of the method was 10 min. The column was heated to 27 \u2022 C. Samples were dissolved in methanol (LC-MS grade, Fluka-Sigma Aldrich) at a concentration 1 mg/mL and sample injection was 1 \u00b5L. Purity was determined from UV spectra measured at wavelength 254 nm. HRMS was determined by total ion current spectra from the mass spectrometer collected at resolution of 140,000 in a range 105-1000 m/z. Clog P was calculated with the MarvinSketch (version 14.9.8.0) software.",

The dependence curve is linear until the unimers of the surfactants can balance the interactions between solution and micelle aggregation. This change is manifested as a breaking of the curve as shown in Figure 1 . According to Taube's rule [39] , obtained data confirm the dependency of CMC on the elongation of the alkyl chain ( Figure 2 ). The CMC values (Table 2 ) are the basic characteristics of surfactants needed for further chemical decontamination measurement. ",

Because the pesticide fenitrothion contains a 4-nitrophenol group detectable by UV/VIS spectrophotometry, it is a suitable candidate for micellar catalysis investigation as a representative of highly toxic organophosphorus compounds with chemical warfare potential [40] . Reaction of fenitrothion with a micellar catalyst provides 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol, which in alkaline medium creates the yellow-colored nitrophenoxide anion with absorption maximum at 400 nm [27] . This decomposition reaction is monitored by the spectrophotometer. Hydrolytic activity was evaluated in this way using the Guggenheim method for the whole series of synthesized compounds 5a-e as an assessment of chemical decontamination potential (Table 3) . This method is applicable in the case of first order or pseudo-first order reactions and enables processing of the data using linear regression [25] . Compound 5d is the most efficient micellar catalyst with half-life 2.3 min at 0.01M concentration, and half-life 2.4 min at 0.005M (pH 11 and 37 \u2022 C). In comparison with the spontaneous hydrolysis of fenitrothion (k = 14.00 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , T 1/2 = 808.4 min) under the same conditions, the novel compounds were 60-160 times more effective at pH 11. It is evident that increasing the pH by one unit causes a significant acceleration of the organophosphate degradation. Spontaneous hydrolysis of fenitrothion at pH 10 was so slow that it could not be determined by the given methodology. The compounds are sorted in descending effect as follows 5d > 5c > 5e > 5a > 5b. Spontaneous hydrolysis (SH) of fenitrothion at pH 11-T 1/2 = 808.4 min; at pH 10 it could not be determined by given methodology.",

            "text": "To evaluate the biological decontamination potential, in vitro antimicrobial activity of compounds 5a-e was evaluated by the broth microdilution method for four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacterial strains. Obtained results are presented as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) after 24 h and 48 h, and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) after 24 h (Figure 4 ). High antibacterial activity was found against the G+ bacteria S. aureus (STAU), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. epidermidis (STEP), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The observed higher susceptibility to the tested compounds of G+ bacteria compared to G-bacteria, as discussed previously, is in agreement with the literature [43, 44] . The lowest MIC and MBC values, i.e., the highest effectiveness, was observed for S. aureus. The relationship of alkyl chain length to antimicrobial activity showed that the compounds with C 14 (5c) and C 16 (5d) chains were the most efficient against G+ bacteria. In contrast, the G-bacteria E. coli (ESCO), K. pneumoniae (KLPN-), extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae (KLPN+), and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (PSAE MR) were most susceptible to compounds with shorter alkyl chains, C 12 (5b) and C 14 (5c), respectively. Unsurprisingly, the least efficient against all tested bacterial strains was the compound with the shortest alkyl chain C 10 (5a) [14, 29, 31] . Compared with the commercially used BAC series, the 5a-e series was comparable at a corresponding alkyl chain length. Individually, 5c and 5b have shown the best activity against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. According to the MICs and MBCs obtained for the traditional strains, the most efficient derivatives (5b, 5c, and 5d) underwent susceptibility testing against Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) by flow cytometry assay ( Figure 5 ). Although we used a F. tularensis LVS model strain that is attenuated in comparison to the virulent strain, the resistance of this strain is identical to that of the virulent strains. F. tularensis is a Gram-negative, intracellular bacterium which is an important medical challenge. F. tularensis is included in category A on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bioterrorism agent/disease list for the following reasons [45] : (a) it can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person; (b) it results in high mortality rates and has the potential for major public health impact; (c) it might cause public panic and social disruption; and (d) it requires special action for public health preparedness. In view of the above, any substance that can successfully kill F. tularensis is highly desirable. The time of exposure (5 min) and reference compounds (ethanol 70% and BAC 0.1%) were used to simulate more practical conditions. The obtained results showed high efficacy especially of 5b, at least comparable to all reference drugs ( Figure 6) . Notably, substance 5b at concentration 0.1% has an even better effect compared to ethanol, which is used as standard for disinfection and decontamination against pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, the effect of alkyl chain length on susceptibility to G-bacteria, represented by decreasing activity from 5b to 5d, corresponded to results obtained by microdilution assay. In addition, it is clear that the decontamination effect is proportionally dependent on the concentration (5c at concentration of 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.01% causes the elimination of 80.47 \u00b1 4.61%, 58.16 \u00b1 7.23% and 29.04 \u00b1 8.80% of bacteria, respectively) ( Figure 5 ).

In accordance with EN 14476 for disinfection with full virucidal activity, the substance should demonstrate a reduction in virus titer of at least 4 orders of magnitude, corresponding to 99.99% inactivation [33] . The morphological changes of one layer of cells were monitored to distinguish between the virus-induced cytopathic changes and the toxic effect caused by the test substance. The highest efficiency was shown by substance 5b, where the virus titer decreased by more than 5 orders of magnitude at a concentration of 0.01% (Table 4 ). The decrease could not be determined exactly for the compounds at a concentration of 0.1% (marked>), as the tested substances at this concentration already affected the cell culture which was used for growing the virus. Evaluation against SARS-CoV-2 showed that 5b and 5c showed only a modest effect at a concentration of 0.01%.

The values of IC 50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) confirmed the predicted trend of the correlation described earlier for the homolog group, i.e., elongation of the alkyl chain length increases the cytotoxic potential of the drugs (Table 5) [29, 31] . This effect is related to the increasing lipophilicity expressed as the Clog P (Table 5) , and most likely correlates with the easier ability to penetrate cells. Notably, considering the identical BAC homologs (BAC 12-16), we can conclude that the introduction of the hydroxyethyl groups into the structure increases the IC 50 value and therefore reduces the toxicity of the substances. Furthermore, the selectivity indexes were calculated as the ration of IC 50 /MIC (24 h) for all bacterial strains (Table 6 ). ",

Critical micellar concentration as a standard characteristic of surfactants has shown a suitable concentration for chemical decontamination and the efficacy in fenitrothion degradation surpassed that of all the reference compounds. Biocidal activity against various strains of bacteria including F. tularensis and S. aureus in biofilm form was also determined to discover biological decontamination potential. The homolog with a chain length of C 12 (5b) shows the highest biocidal activity. However, the best effect for chemical decontamination is observed for derivatives with a longer alkyl chain (i.e., compounds 5d, 5e). In addition, the compounds seem to be safe on mammalian cell lines as a basic safety parameter for potential use in practice. Finally, BOC-type compounds have been found to have a significant dual effect against both chemical and biological agents. It is thus possible to envisage their use, individually or in a mixture, as active components of multi-purpose decontamination products.",
