These individuals must prevent potential contamination and infection from spreading among workers and to consumers. The failure to meet legal requirements can result in the damage to institution or restaurant reputations, the loss of trust between the establishment and its workers and customers, and financial repercussions. All U.S. meat, poultry, and egg processing establishments are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and are required to have Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SSOPs). SSOPs are written procedures that the establishment develops and implements to prevent the direct contamination of food products. It is an establishment's responsibility to execute the procedures as written in the SSOPs. Each establishment must maintain a daily documentation of the application and monitoring of the SSOPs, as well as any necessary corrective action. It is critically important to maintain the required documents as evidence of SSOP compliance and keep these up to date.",

CSI-D can wirelessly communicate the inspection process, which allows remotely located personnel to immediately provide oversight and respond to inspection issues.

Specific technical innovations include the ability to capture fluorescence images under bright ambient light situations in food processing facilities, institutional kitchens, and dining facilities. Previous systems (described above) had difficulties with bright ambient light and, often, could only function in darker rooms or under shrouding. Other innovations related to the UVC germicidal LEDs include the integration of safety systems based on sensors and software (LIDAR, gyroscope, motion detector, etc.) that help protect the operator and other personnel from accidental UVC light exposure. These sensors are also used to monitor motion and distance during the image capture process to ensure images are free from motion artifacts, such as image blur, and provide software-based guidance for operators when they are moving the camera too quickly or are too far away or too close. Finally, the image database and records of contamination for each location at each facility, combined with the local hazards and disease prevalence, will enable the future delivery of intelligent dynamic risk assessment associated with each surface to guide cleaning and inspection processes.",

Two fluorescence images were captured under blue/violet excitation using a color camera with a dual bandpass filter that passed selected green and red wavebands. We also captured an ultraviolet B (UVB) fluorescence image under UVC excitation using a UV-sensitive monochrome camera with a single bandpass filter. The image capture sequence comprised continuous image capture and background subtraction. For each fluorescence acquisition, we captured two frames: one frame with the LED illumination \"ON\" and one frame with the LED illumination \"OFF.\" The LED \"ON\" frame contained fluorescence emissions as well as any background light that could leak through the bandpass filter. The LED \"OFF\" frame contained only the background light. We implemented real-time background subtraction software to reduce the contribution of the background light to the final fluorescence image. The contamination detection algorithm was then applied to the background-subtracted fluorescence image frames. The UV camera image sensor was 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels, and to increase the sensitivity and speed of the image capture, the pixels were binned to an image of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels. The RGB camera image sensor was 1280 \u00d7 960 pixels, but we selected a region of interest to read out that was 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels. At a distance of 20 cm, the field of view (FOV) of the RGB camera was 30 cm, and the FOV of the UV camera was 10.5 cm. To obtain reliable segmentation results for each image frame that are independent of fluorescence and background image intensity variations, due to the device movement during the inspection, the detection algorithm has to continuously adapt itself to changing fluorescence and background intensity levels. While imaging with a fixed-mount camera can allow simple conventional thresholding (e.g., Otsu's method), we constantly moved the camera across different scenes, and therefore we adopted adaptive thresholding to change the threshold dynamically over each frame. This more sophisticated version of thresholding can accommodate the varying background and fluorescence conditions in each frame. Whenever intensities between an object's fluorescence and the image background are significant, but their exact magnitude or location in the image is unknown, segmentation is possible by threshold optimization through the image intensity histogram. The image histogram represents the distribution and frequency of occurrence of the intensity for every pixel in the image. Because each image/frame varies in the frequency and distribution of these pixel intensities, the histogram can be normalized by the number of pixels for convenience of analysis.",

The ambient light is an important variable that needs to be considered in real-world applications of the device. We tried a wide range of ambient light from 0 to 90 foot-candle (FC) at intervals of 10 FCs, when capturing the images from each contamination on the different surfaces. We chose this range because the facilities we are targeting for CSI-D inspections can have ambient light up to 80 FCs.",

We then used a similarity measurement metric called \"dice similarity\" [26] and attempted to adjust the threshold level by minimizing the error between the manually segmented regions and the regions that resulted from the algorithm for the range of ambient light and surfaces. The method of thresholding we used was to create a histogram of a fluorescence image. We then normalized the histogram so that each bin was expressed as a percentage of the total number of pixels in the image. We then set a threshold: if the bin contained more than 0.2% of the pixels in the image, its pixel values were set to zero, and if the bin contained less than 0.2% of the pixels in the image but more than zero, its values were set to one. We selected 0.2% because it gave a good compromise between the detection of contaminant fluorescence and the detection of artifacts without applying additional spatial filters for size, etc. It also provided a good dice similarity (74.22 \u00b1 0.32) to the manually segmented images. This is an interim segmentation method that is \"good enough\" for our present purposes, but we are working on applying more advanced machine learningbased segmentation. Figure 2 shows how we applied our adaptive threshold segmentation method to the green channel fluorescence with excitation 405 nm and a green emission band filtered to 510-560 nm.

Since the UV camera is a monochrome camera, color separation is not necessary. Currently, each channel is segmented separately to identify areas of potential contamination. In future work, we will investigate fluorescence color ratio analysis and other more sophisticated and unsupervised analyses that will use all three fluorescence signals to distinguish between different types of contamination and provide a better segmentation and classification of contamination.",

Figure 8A shows the well plates that were exposed to UVC light at a distance of 12.7 cm from the device, and Figure 8B shows well plates exposed to UVC light at a distance of 20.3 cm. The untreated plate represents an exposure time of 0 s and serves as the control. Clear wells indicate cell death due to plaque formation caused by the virus at the various dilutions (10 \u22121 to 10 \u22125 ). Cell death and plaque formation result in the inability of the cell monolayer to take up the purple dye. In the no-virus control columns, MDCK cells were incubated with the infection medium only, and are representative of a cell monolayer with zero plaque formations due to the absence of the virus. Other panels show the deactivation of the virus treated with UVC light at various exposure times (2-5 s). Percent killing (deactivation) was calculated as described in the Methods Section above. Figure 8C ,D show bar graphs representing the percent killing of the virus after varying exposures of UVC light. A virus killing of 100% was observed after each exposure time as, in the UVC-treated plate wells, the virus failed to cause cell death, even at the lowest dilution (only purple wells are observed for all exposure times and all dilutions except for the controls).
