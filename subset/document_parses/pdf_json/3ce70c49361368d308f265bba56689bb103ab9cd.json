Core expertise in complex symptom management, decision making in uncertainty, advocacy and education, and ensuring a compassionate response are essential, and SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning. SPCS resource capacity is likely to be overwhelmed, and consideration needs to be given to empowering and supporting high-quality primary palliative care in all care locations. Our local SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources designed to enable the rapid upskilling of nonspecialist clinicians needing to provide palliative care. It may be a useful tool for our SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively.",

They work with an interdisciplinary approach, facilitate collaboration when there are differing points of view, and understand the need to balance humanity alongside the art and science of medicine. They are highly experienced in advocacy and education and are experts at managing the frail, multimorbid, chronically, or acutely critically unwell patient: the very cohort most at risk of severe COVID-19-related illness is the core SPCS patient population. There remains a mandate to provide quality health care to those following a palliative approach in the management of all other conditions, and SPCS are well positioned to provide guidance on how this might be achieved when access and models of care may need to rapidly change. There is an opportunity to present perspective, collective wisdom, and clinical skill in addressing the challenges faced to minimize suffering and support the wider health care teams less experienced in providing palliative care.",

Current focus in many health care systems relates to surge preparation and ensuring hospitals are adequately resourced for an influx of critically unwell patients with COVID-19-related illness. Triaging systems mean that in some cases only those with the greatest chance of recovery are eligible for life-sustaining treatment, and it is crucial that there is an equally robust plan for supportive management of those patients outside this cohort, as well as ensuring the needs of those outside the hospital system are still met. SPCS are experts in advocacy and balancing ethical considerations, experienced in decision making in the face of uncertainty, and should be central in planning. They also have a role in guiding other clinicians in decision making regarding individualized management, impeccable symptom control, and care of the dying and their loved ones.",
