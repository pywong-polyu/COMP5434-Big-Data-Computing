Several works study health misinformation detection, yet little attention has been given to the perceived severity of misinformation posts. In this work, we frame health misinformation as a risk assessment task. More specifically, we study the severity of each misinformation story and how readers perceive this severity, i.e., how harmful a message believed by the audience can be and what type of signals can be used to recognize potentially malicious fake news and detect refuted claims. To address our research questions, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, accompanied by detailed data analysis. We evaluate several traditional and state-of-the-art models and show there is a significant gap in performance when applying traditional misinformation classification models to this task. We conclude with open challenges and future directions.",

Fake news frequently emerges for certain phenomena and topics, e.g., public health issues, politics etc. (Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2019; Shin et al. 2018; Bode and Vraga 2018) . Unsurprisingly, the same applies to the current global pandemic, where inaccurate stories are amplifying hate speech, increasing stigmatization, undermining public health response and polarizing public debate on topics related to .

To this end, we aim to capture how social media users view the severity of misinformation circulating online. Although much work has been focused on identifying health-related misinformation, there has been little attention to further making a distinction between the perceived severity of misinformation (Fernandez and Alani 2018) . Severity varies greatly across each message: some might be jokes, some might be discussing the impact of fake news or refute the claim, others might be highly malicious, while others might be simply inaccurate information with limited effects. Overall, the severity of each message can vary depending on its content, e.g., urging users to eat garlic is less severe than urging users to drink bleach which has led to hundreds of deaths (Islam et al. 2020) .",

Specifically, we aim at understanding the impact of unreliable advice from inaccurate sources based on the perceived severity of misinformation. To this end, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset that contains social media posts annotated on a Likert scale, based on whether the content of the post is perceived to be: a) Real News/Claims, b) Refutes/Rebuts, c) Misinformation (Other), d) Misinformation (Possibly severe), and e) Misinformation (Highly severe). The distinction of different reader-perceived severity levels is judged based on their potential to impact a user's health, assuming the individual might be making decisions upon reading the advice and/or suggestions in the post. In other words, our goal is to produce a label that reflects the level of recognized risk factors in the presence of inaccurate claims and news, on a challenging cold-start content-based scenario where additional metadata information such as likes, retweets and user information is not available, and conditioned on the worst-case assumption that the user will follow the advice. We conduct the first empirical study of the effectiveness of representative machine learning methods for predicting the perceived severity of misinformation so as to establish baseline benchmark results for facilitating further research.",

Experimental results show a significant performance gap when compared to traditional misinformation detection settings. \u2022 We present a detailed data analysis that reveals several key insights about the most prominent unreliable news. Moreover, we present technical and modeling challenges that this new task poses. Our dataset captures how social media users perceive severe misinformation and can potentially be used to determine the user's understanding and recognition of the severity of misinformation.

While healthrelated misinformation is only a facet of misinformation research, there has been much work analysing misinformation in different medical domains, such as cancer (Bal et al. 2020; Loeb et al. 2019) , orthodontics (K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 and Sayar 2019) , sexually transmitted diseases and infections (Zimet et al. 2013; Lohmann et al. 2018; Joshi et al. 2018; Tomaszewski et al. 2021) , autism (Baumer and McGee 2019) , influenza (Culotta 2010; Signorini, Segre, and Polgreen 2011) , and more recently COVID-19 (Garrett 2020; Brennen et al. 2020; Cinelli et al. 2020; Cui and Lee 2020) . Social media data have also been used to monitor influenza prevalence and awareness (Smith et al. 2016; Ji, Chun, and Geller 2013; Huang et al. 2017 ). Systems such as Google Flu Trends use real-time signals, such as search queries, to detect influenza epidemics (Ginsberg et al. 2009; Preis and Moat 2014; Santillana et al. 2014; Kandula and Shaman 2019) . However, relying solely on search queries leads to an overestimation of influenza, namely because there is no distinction between general awareness about the flu and searches for treatment methods (Smith et al. 2016; Klembczyk et al. 2016 ). Our work focuses on social media, in particular health misinformation on microblogging sites, such as Twitter.",

Furthermore, it has the potential to be updated automatically with additional instances, enabling semi-supervised models as future work. To obtain annotations based on our defined severity categorization, all CoAID tweets labeled as misinformation are shuffled and distributed to two different annotators.

Each tweet is annotated jointly by the two annotators. To resolve conflicts on ambiguous instances, a final round of annotator discussions was introduced as an additional step, where an external validator provided an additional label after the discussion. To assess agreement levels, the external validator was asked to also annotate a random sample of the labeled tweets. Cohen's kappa coefficient between the annotators and the validator was 0.7037, which shows good agreement on the task (Hunt 1986).

We use pre-trained BERT embeddings (Devlin et al. 2018) to measure how close each tweet is by the centroid of its corresponding category. More specifically, we compute the centroid as the arithmetic mean of all tweet embeddings from a specific category. We hypothesize that compact categories are more likely to be well-formed and thus easier to classify. We compute the skewness and kurtosis for each distribution. Each distribution shows a positive skewness, and as we can see, they are right-tailed distributions. The \"Possibly severe\" category is the most skewed and the \"Highly severe\" category is the least. The negative kurtosis of both the \"Highly severe\" and \"Refutes/Rebuts\" categories shows that these categories have less of a peak and appear more uniform, which is also evident by the flatness of these curves. This may be due to the broad range of topics covered in both of these categories compared to the rest. In Figure 4 , we analyze the top-10 frequent hashtags per category. We remove common hashtags such as \"#covid_19\", \"#coronavirus\", etc. The length of each bar indicates how frequently the hashtag appears. We find that the \"Other\" category follows a similar pattern to Figure 2 , in that the top hashtags are pertaining more to rumors and conspiracies, such as the \"#pope\" tested positive for COVID-19, or that COVID-19 is a \"#bioweapon\". This may be attributed to the fact that those susceptible to misinformation are less likely to think critically about news sources and thus tend to believe more false claims (Pennycook et al. 2020) . Both severe categories focus on remedies, e.g., \"#vitaminc\" and vaccination. Interestingly, the \"Refutes/Rebuts\" top hashtags contain terms associated with computation such as \"#dataviz\", \"#tableau\", as well as hashtags to promote social distancing \"#stayhome\". These hashtags may be evidence of several infographics and data visualizations shared in social media, often used as arguments against misinformation. Finally, as per the aforementioned claim index (category claim for each tweet), we present the most common claims and news per category, and their corresponding frequency (Table 3) .",

For example, for the category \"Other\", which makes up the majority of the false negatives, test instances can be further categorized by the message topics, as shown in Table 5 . In particular, in the Misclassified column, we count the total number of messages that are incorrectly classified by all deep-learning models explored. Our error analysis shows that considering the different topics could potentially improve misinformation detection models on this task. We also qualitatively examine the false positives of the best performing model (i.e., BERT) and find only 11 false positives classified as misinformation, showing the classifier is conservative but precise in the classification. Future directions would include improving the recall, as the examples missed are usually controversial topics or messages which appear as misinformation but are actually opinions, such as the mean incubation period of the virus and the seriousness of the virus compared to the flu. There is a general trend of poor recall across the levels of severity, among all of the explored classifiers, which highlights the difficulty of predicting the severity of misinformation.",

We describe our data collection and conduct thorough data analysis and extensive experiments with baseline methods and state-ofthe-art models. Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges that computational models face in capturing the true latent semantics in our finer-grained health misinfor- mation dataset. We hope Covid-HeRA will significantly facilitate the research in modeling the perception of misinformation severity from the target audience and will spur the development of more advanced systems that can inform social media users on the respective dangers of following unreliable advice from inaccurate sources. There are several new directions and opportunities. Covid-HeRA aims at a deeper understanding of reader views on misinformation severity and can have immediate practical impact, as the potential data user group includes computational linguists, sociologists, psychologists, misinformation researchers, etc. Our dataset captures how social media users, the main consumers of misinformation, view and recognize (harmful) fake news and claims. Such new directions that target whether readers understand the impact of misinformation can help reduce misinformation spread.",

As the presence of severe misinformation tweets is rare, our dataset is ideal for bench-marking text-based anomaly/outlier detection model architectures in realistic scenarios (Ruff et al. 2019; Manolache, Brad, and Burceanu 2021) . Finally, the subtask of identifying rebuttal and refutation posts that present useful arguments against misinformation spread, is something we aim to further improve in the future, either by incorporating additional linguistic signals and auxiliary tasks, or by applying controversy detection algorithms (Lourentzou et al. 2015; Timmermans et al. 2017 ).",

Our labels are produced by readers rather than medical experts, and hence are not suitable for traditional health analytics and misinformation fact-checking algorithms. Moreover, the detection of misinformation spreaders, as well as additional aspects in which a post might be dangerous, including but not limited to political implications, bias/racism towards specific groups, distrust in science, technological impact, etc., go beyond our task but are certainly noteworthy for discussion and future research.

We note that this paper describes a work of research, thus, any definitions and methods described here do not reflect how Twitter classifies misleading information or enforces its misinformation policies. We also note that users can choose to make their posts private, delete their accounts or remove tweets. Hence, as for all Twitter-related research, exact reconstruction of the dataset in later years may not be possible. Misinformation spread on social media has been a long-standing problem with potential public health risks (Ghenai and Mejova 2018; Geeng, Yee, and Roesner 2020) .

This is a recurring challenge for misinformation tasks, as most tweets online are either irrelevant, opinions and discussions about health topics or news shared across the platform. Generally, there is an abundance of proposed methods in the literature that can handle class imbalance. The most common approaches involve either assigning weights to individual training examples, custom loss functions, re-sampling the data or generating synthetic examples to improve robustness (Chawla et al. 2002; Xie et al. 2019) . For a thorough review on class imbalance in machine learning, we refer the reader to literature reviews (Chawla 2009; He and Garcia 2009 ). Here, we explore some of the aforementioned methods. Nevertheless, our goal is not to exhaustively experiment with all possible options. In terms of data augmentation, we restrict our exploration to word-level augmentations, since, these methods produce good results for text classification tasks (Wei and Zou 2019; Xie et al. 2019) . In terms of custom loss functions, we experiment with a set of the most representative ones, including vanilla Cross-Entropy and weighted Cross-Entropy, in which examples are weighted disproportionately to the number of instances per class . We also experiment with the Dice and Tversky loss functions (Milletari, Navab, and Ahmadi 2016; Salehi, Erdogmus, and Gholipour 2017) and their variants such as the Soft Dice Loss (Milletari, Navab, and Ahmadi 2016), the Generalized Dice Loss (Crum, Camara, and Hill 2016; Sudre et al. 2017 ) and the Self-adjusting Dice Loss (Li et al. 2020) .",

Both data augmentation (BERT + DA) and Tversky loss (BERT + Tversky) improve the prediction for some classes, e.g., \"Other\" or \"Refutes/Rebuts\", however, some examples from the \"Possibly Severe\" and \"Highly Severe\" classes are misclassified as \"Real News/Claims\". This is possibly due to the broad range of similar topics, as described in our data analysis. Further research on handling such cases is required. We note that Tversky approximates our evaluation metric (F-measure) when \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1 (as in our case). The combination of data augmentation and Tversky did not produce better results.
