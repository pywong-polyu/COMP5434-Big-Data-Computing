Today we understand that people exposed to traumatic experiences versus those unexposed are at increased risk for PTSD, Acute Stress Disorder (See Table I) , depression, anxiety, and substance abuse problems. Those exposed also have higher rates of somatic symptoms and physical illnesses, in particular hypertension, asthma, and chronic pain conditions 2 . Evidence for mind (the psychological experience of trauma) to brain causality for PTSD and other mental health disorders 3 comes from spectacular discoveries in molecular biology and neuroscience, including data showing cross-generational environmental alterations of HPA-axis sensitivity and DNA methylation of glucocorticoid receptor genes in children whose parents survived the Holocaust 4 , and data linking childhood abuse to enhanced fear circuitry detected in MRI studies 5 . These discoveries have led to the broad acceptance of mental health conditions as a consequence of trauma. Moreover, because new research shows that the interactions between physical and mental health are protean and complex, impacting pathophysiology as well as social policy and health care systems, mental health is increasingly included as a health care topic on equal footing with other health care topics. We are beginning to accept that there is no health without mental health 6 .",

One multicenter study conducted in Sydney, Australia found IPV to be associated with an increased risk of perinatal depression, preterm birth, and/or non-exclusive or noninitiated breastfeeding at time of discharge 21 . The association between IPV and mental health is bidirectional, such that IPV is associated with the increased risk of psychiatric illness, which itself is a risk factor for IPV 22 ",

While the burden of infection control increases, there is additional pressure on providers to be vigilant, potentially leading to an increase in stress and anxiety. The necessity for interventions to address the mental health needs of frontline providers are highlighted in the literature, and emphasize the importance of prevention and education, clear communication, opportunities to debrief and promote resilience, and access to one-on-one or group counseling. It is critically important that institution and departmental leaders come together to make prevention measures, psychoeducation, and mental health interventions available and accessible to providers. Further, these leaders share a responsibility to address stigma that may arise from seeking mental health care services from one's place of employment, which may deter providers from getting the help they need.",

This approach, often used in post-crisis situations, emphasizes growth through pain, and encourages individuals to explore the strengths that may develop by using a mind, body, and spirit connection. In addition, Zhang et al.

According to the 2012 Survey on Drug Use and Health, and in order of frequency in use, 5.9% of pregnant women engage in illicit drug use, 8.5% consume alcohol, 15.9% smoke cigarettes with some studies citing polysubstance use as high as 50%23 .No data exist to date specifically on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in pregnancy and postpartum women; however, pre-pandemic population rates of depression and other mental health conditions are known, and emerging findings during the early stages of COVID-19, as well as the potential effects of significant new life stressors, indicate the impact on perinatal mental health will be dramatic. Accordingly, the incidence of perinatal psychiatric morbidity is expected to increase in the context of COVID-19 related stressors, including quarantine, rising unemployment rates, economic hardship, and IVP. This increase will most likely have graver mental health implications for minority and underserved communities and those who have experienced structural racism and other forms of adverse discrimination. There is evidence in the literature suggesting disasters have a disparate impact on maternal mental health with some studies suggesting an effect on birth outcomes, including neonatal birth weight and increased risk of preterm labor and births24,25 . A recent nationwide survey in China examining mental health sequelae of COVID-19 revealed that women compared to men were more likely to experience psychological distress, including increased incidence of symptoms of PTSD 7,26 . In 2016, high levels of stress, anxiety and depression were identified among women at risk for becoming infected with Zika virus in Brazil and Puerto Rico 12 . Clinical protocols targeting management of labor and delivery during COVID-19 are actively disseminated and updated 27-29 , yet the mental health impact of these changing policies, and ways to address their impact, have received less research and academic attention. In response to the critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing equipment, and rising incidence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in obstetric patients, some labor and delivery units restricted all visitors, including support persons and birthing partners. At some New York hospitals, the obstetrics and gynecology teams collaborated with reproductive mental health clinicians to promote psychological resilience as these changes were implemented 30 . Strategies to support women's psychosocial well-being included increased nursing staff, redeployment of patient-facing research staff to function as support persons in L&D and postpartum, and assistance in connecting patients virtually with family members and mental health services offering individual and group psychotherapy 30 . Policies and systems such as these have an essential role in mitigating the effect of policy changes affecting obstetric patients. Risk factors for negative psychological outcomes, even in times of crisis, remain malleable. Gravid patients may also be at particular risk during periods of medical crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as they still require ongoing prenatal care and follow-up while the world retreats into isolation. Routine prenatal care discussions, which typically center on fetal movements, ultrasounds, and weight management, are now overshadowed by questions surrounding the uncertain nature of vertical transmission. The frequent anxieties associated with birth increase in the face of the added stress and threat of COVID-19, including the virus' still unclear effects on the unborn child. The need to access perinatal care continues amidst the call for social distancing, anticipation of visitor and birth support person(s) restrictions, and potential separation of mother from baby in cases of severe infection--all of these factors can contribute to acute episodes of anxiety, depression, substance use, loneliness, hyperarousal, and, consequently, IPV 24 . Patients can become frustrated by the lack of clarity concerning the perinatal implications of COVID-19 and rapidly changing care protocols and policies. As such, prenatal and postpartum care, as well as treatment protocols for COVD-19 patients, should consider psychological assessment and the biopsychosocial needs of each patient to decrease the psychological burden of the threat of COVID-19 and prevent long-term negative mental health outcomes 31 (see more below).",

Within obstetrics and gynecology, clinicians who have previously worked in outpatient areas are joining their colleagues on the front lines in hospitals.

Simultaneously, administrators and others are working to create viable financial models to sustain their practices 15 .

COVID-19 support hotlines have been established nationwide to support individuals in crisis offering support, referrals for long-term care, and access to emergency psychiatric response. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has created a disaster distress hotline for individuals in the U.S. seeking support due to an acute stress response to COVID-1947 . The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has tailored their crisis services to include COVID-19 specific concerns and crisis 48 . The Crisis Text Line provides a texting platform with trained crisis counselors for individuals in the U.S., Canada, the UK and Ireland 49 . The New York State Office of Mental Health (https://omh.ny.gov/omhweb/covid-19-resources.html) has established an emotional support hotline for residents alongside a website with mental health resources and education. To reduce the risk of negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, the National Health Commission of China (NHC) has integrated a centralized approach to addressing the psychological ramifications of the outbreak into its overall medical response to COVID-19 50 . On 27th January, 2020, the central health authority in China launched 'Principles for Emergency Psychological Crisis Intervention for COVID-19 Pneumonia Epidemic', establishing guidelines for mental health professionals to implement throughout the country, including a mandate for mental health-related national associations and academic societies to adopt emergency psychological protocols, provide psychological counseling, and establish psychological assistance within the context of working groups to provide professional oversight and streamline coordination with health authorities 50 . Online educational articles, videos, and interventions for managing mental health symptoms have also been provided to the public using WeChat and other internet platforms along with strategies for addressing the varied psychological responses and vulnerabilities among specific populations, including pregnant women 50 . This streamlined approach was based on continuous epidemiological monitoring and mental health screening, with a pipeline for referrals to qualified mental health providers 7 . This coordinated effort demonstrates that mental health outcomes areat long laston equal footing with other health sequelae related to COVID-19. Institutionally there exists an opportunity to increase capacity for early detection of COVID-19 related mental health symptoms for obstetric patients through the training of nonclinical staff in providing supportive communication about changes in L&D policies and identifying early signs of depression and acute anxiety. This training could be particularly useful upon admission into labor and delivery units in light of restricted visitor policies. At WMH @Ob/Gyn, support staff, following training to assess early psychological effects of COVID-19 during the perinatal period, were redeployed into the postpartum and antepartum units to provide support to mothers in the absence of support persons due to hospital visitor restrictions.Although the global response has been swift in addressing the mental health sequelae of COVID-19 through increased access to behavioral education and tele-mental health support, there remains a need to address the mental health needs of the most psychologically vulnerable.These populations include victims of IPV, individuals with pre-existing chronic mental health illness, and women at risk of developing perinatal depression and related mood disorders. These vulnerable populations, which typically rely on and/or are in need of more direct care and supportive, safe services, may have difficulty accessing such care and support while stay-athome orders are in place.

These challenging decisions are especially relevant in OBGYN as OBGYN providers are faced with difficult decisions regarding ways to ensure safe labor and delivery when maternal-fetal health is at risk due to COVID-19, including restrictions on support persons during labor and delivery. Due to the nature of this work, OBGYN providers are at increased risk of secondary trauma and burnout. Mental health providers should encourage frontline providers to speak about feelings of guilt and shame if they arise providing a non-judgmental context to voice and the opportunity to reflect on these feelings. In addition, education around symptoms of burnout should be discussed 27 . A major Chinese medical center established a support program for frontline providers consisting of an online mental health self-assessment, PHQ-9, free text, and ways to request psychological support via psychotherapy. Unfortunately, only 69 frontline providers out of over 8,000 responded to the survey suggesting that there may be inhibitions related to stigma and/or receiving mental health treatment from their place of work.

In the absence of targeted treatment of, or a cure for, COVID-19, many nations have responded by implementing strict quarantine and isolation measures to slow transmission rates-these measures have contributed to the risk of mental health consequences. As the incidence of new infections continue to decline, a potential rise in mental health sequelae is anticipated signaling a need for responsive, accessible and efficient mental health relief systems, particularly for vulnerable populations and patients with pre-existing mental health conditions. To date, research findings emphasize the medical aspects of COVID-19. These studies do not adequately capture the looming global mental health crisis10 . Descriptions of psychological responses to previous pandemics provide a framework for understanding COVID-19's likely profound mental health effects. Reflecting on psychological responses to earlier infectious disease outbreaks further facilitates insight in to resilience and protective factors in times of acute stress. Typical rates of psychiatric morbidity of general populations are relatively wellestablished. For example, in the United States (U.S.), one in every five adults cope with mental illness 11 .

They suggest that primary prevention include briefings prior to deployment into the field and preparatory training with an aim of promoting strong connections between leaders and frontline staff; secondary prevention include peer support training with a goal of decreasing stigma and increasing access to help; and tertiary prevention include evidence-based treatments for trauma, including trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). This model suggests that interventions begin prior to the onset of mental health symptoms so that OBGYN and other frontline providers have access to training and education about potential mental health effects before deploying to the front lines.Women's Mental Health @Ob/Gyn: A Novel, New Service Meeting Patient & Provider Needs WMH @Ob/Gyn (https://www.columbiaobgyn.org/about-us/divisions/womens-mentalhealth-ob-gyn) is a new mental health service embedded within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
