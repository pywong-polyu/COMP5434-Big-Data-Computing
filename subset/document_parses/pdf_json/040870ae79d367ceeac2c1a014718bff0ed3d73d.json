The present discussion is to bring the focus on various social issues that emerge during outbreak and calls for equal attention as that of other health-care interventions. These issues are summarized in three categories: first, stigmatization due to lack of knowledge about the source of infection; second, speculations and their consequences around lack of knowledge about transmission; and finally, the concern regarding miscommunication during such a crisis. Most of these concerns emerge from press and social media coverage of the episode. The Ebola outbreak response is an example of how social scientists and anthropologists can work with other experts to solve questions of public health importance. Their approach toward the community with the objective to understand the sources, reasons, and circumstances of the infection will help to manage the current outbreak. In this context, we suggest collaboration of diverse scientific community to control and sensitize the people to tackle the misinformation in the affected and non-affected community during the outbreaks.",

Countries have addressed these outbreaks systematically with a team of clinicians, health professionals, researchers, and policy-makers. In the context of COVID-19, we do not have sufficient knowledge about the spread of the infection in humans. While the scientific community is geared to examine the transmission from the basic science and epidemiological point of view, it requires involvement of other cross-cutting disciplines given the gamut of issues involved.",

Stigmatization is referred to as full denial of social acceptance. 5 Several countries are reporting stigmatization, particularly toward the Asian population. Certain sections of the Asian population have been targeted based on their eating habits, which also includes consumption of wild animals. One has to look deeper to know the source of infection rather than just assuming the consumption of raw meat as the reason of contracting infection. For instance, we have been witnessing reports of \"discrimination\" in several public places toward Asian people across a few settings. 6 This discrimination is ultimate result of lack of knowledge among people about the infection and its modes of transmission (person to person, animal to person, or through air). Such schema generate false images about people and formulates wrong perceptions which then are converted to xenophobia. [7] [8] [9] Another issue that contributed to discrimination and stigmatization is in the context of migration. As a result of lockdown, migrants from poor communities did face discrimination due to their social status (for instance in the Indian context). 10 Along with the lockdown, another terminology that added confusion was that of recommendation to maintain \"social distancing.\" In practice, it was meant to denote \"physical distancing\" to prevent person-to-person transmission through cough or secretions. However, it sounded as if people should stop communicating with each other.",

However, the same idea of food consumption in the Western part is more of scientific in nature. 13, 14 The lack of hygiene maintained in Wuhan market was depicted in such a way that it that could cast aspersions about people's behavior without respecting their cultural heritage and practices.

In 1997, Hewlett and Hewlett deployed the first anthropological interventions in Gabon, a place in central Africa where the Ebola outbreak occurred as an unknown entity. They provide the intense account of socio-cultural and political contexts of disease, which show the importance of anthropology as a tool of investigation in public health emergencies. 18 In Ebola, even today, anthropological investigations help in identifying hitherto unknown modes of spread. For instance, nosocomial practices were documented to have led to reinfection in a hospital setting. 19 In fact, organizations like \"A group of Social Science and Humanitarian Action Platform\" (combined group of health professionals including medical anthropologist) and \"Ebola Response Anthropology Platform\" has systematically addressed the issues of recent Ebola outbreak. 17 We need more such collaborations, specifically in low and middle income countries (LMIC).",

Their approach toward the affected community/population in a humane manner with the objective to understand the ways and means of spread of infection and eventually to decipher the sources, reasons, and circumstances. This knowledge is essential to dispel misinformation during health crises. Hence, a first step in addressing the stigmatization is to generate appropriate knowledge about the COVID-19. This to be done on micro and macro level. To achieve this, collaboration among diverse scientific community is required to map out the preliminary strategies and to control ongoing outbreaks, and such preparation can help in a future crisis in such an outbreak. Second, there is a gap in which ideas about transmission is disseminated or assimilated from and among the public health experts to reach community as per their requirement. For example, in the United States, multiple media interviews by people suggest that their perception of coronavirus is just a flu. This will pose a challenge when people think their illness will not harm them as they relate it to the flu-like illness. Hence, it is important that the knowledge translation should be constructed in way that it will sensitize people and provide appropriate knowledge to tackle spread of rumors and misinformation in the affected and nonaffected communities.
