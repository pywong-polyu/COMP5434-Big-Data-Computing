Here, we report the results of a 4-week population-based controlled experiment that took place in La Gomera (Canary Islands, Spain) between June and July 2020, where we assessed the epidemiological impact of the Spanish DCT app Radar Covid. After a substantial communication campaign, we estimate that at least 33% of the population adopted the technology and further showed relatively high adherence and compliance as well as a quick turnaround time. The app detects about 6.3 close-contacts per primary simulated infection, a significant percentage being contacts with strangers, although the spontaneous follow-up rate of these notified cases is low. Overall, these results provide experimental evidence of the potential usefulness of DCT during an epidemic outbreak in a real population.",

While several countries, initially including Singapore or South Korea and more recently Switzerland, Italy, France or Germany to cite a few 10 have started to deploy different implementations of such technology, to date there is however a lack of empirical evidence of the effectiveness of such DCT 11, 12 . Indeed, putting the technical functionality of DCT apps aside, the effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven in real-world outbreak settings. Moreover, further concerns on the usefulness of DCT range from the possibility that the app detects avalanches of false close-contacts-what would subsequently overwhelm primary healthcare-to skepticism on the possible low adoption and adherence to the technology. Finally, privacy issues have also been flagged.",

Its population is~10,000, including residents and daily commuters and the municipality also hosts the main harbour of the island. Downloading of RadarCovid app was voluntary and all participants provided an informed consent. The first days were devoted to marketing and communication aspects, such as highlighting the app in TV and local media, distribution of promotional material, etc. By the 10th of July-date of the first simulated outbreak-we expected a large percentage of the adoption cohort had already downloaded the app, either directly from the Apple/Google servers or with the help of marketing promoters and other venues. In the following weeks, several outbreaks were simulated, such that roughly 10% of the cohort that adopted the technology was infected, and digitally mediated detection of close-contacts was subsequently monitored. Such attack rate is in the order of magnitude of those that have been documented in a Singapore call centre (8.5% 18 ) or in the Diamond Princess (18.8% 19 ). We simulated a total of four epidemic outbreaks (three downtown, one in the Navieras-boats connecting La Gomera to Tenerife island) to explore different parametrisations: different asymptomatic times, Bluetooth calibrations (see Supplementary notes 2 and 3 for details) and different mobility patterns (we made sure that, across different outbreaks, each infected individual was only flagging an alert at most once). In retrospect, the adequate Bluetooth attenuation range for a correct implementation of the 15 min-2 metre rule was incorporated after the 15th July recalibration.",

While to the best of our knowledge there is no direct estimate in the literature of the percentage of close-contacts that an individual has with strangers to compare to, as a proxy we can use Polymod social contact network data where contacts are categorised as taking place at home, work, school or 'other' 24,25 : we assume that most of the close-contacts that happen at 'other' locations typically happen among strangers (public transport, gym, library, restaurant, etc). Under this assumption, the percentage of hidden close-contacts would fluctuate across countries somewhat in the range 25-40%. Implications of privacy-by-design. Since Radar COVID embraced a privacy-by-design approach, the data that could be retrieved from the API to analyse the KPIs was limited, and indirect evidence had to be sought via extensive follow-ups and online surveys, which nonetheless were always anonymous and privacy-preserving (see Supplementary note 4 for details). For the same reason, the numerical estimates of some KPIs are only approximate and we cannot provide the standard dispersion metrics which would be otherwise available with a more intrusive app. For instance, the estimated number of digitally traced contacts per primary infection is an indirect average estimate, we could not sample the whole distribution and accordingly do not have dispersion statistics. To further assess the efficiency of the app, in this experiment we were also able to measure an aggregated and anonymous metric quantifying the total daily number of notified alerts. Note that such metric is made available during the controlled experiment for the purpose of validating the efficiency of the app, and collected for research purposes as part of the privacy policy.",

From the list of in-depth interviews (15 surveys) the question \"I will keep on using the app when it is officially launched\" reaches full marks.

Reaching such levels of detection is an indirect evidence that adoption density is high. Note that this is an average quantity and, again, the privacyfriendly design of the app makes it difficult to compute any dispersion estimate (e.g. standard deviation or interquartile range), because we cannot trace back the number of alerts to any particular infected individual: we only count how many daily alerts are triggered and how many codes are introduced. Accordingly, we cannot quantify the role or presence of superspreaders and the heterogeneity of the contact network. This uncertainty notwithstanding, our estimate after Bluetooth recalibration is almost twice as large as the median of manually detected contacts by professional contact tracers in Spain, which was about 3 23 during the time of the experiment (note also that in July, Spain was overall in a very low-incidence state and thus manual contact tracing was efficient, so we expect the improvement of DCT over manual tracing to be even higher during an epidemic outbreak, where if not enough manual tracers are hired, the average number of manually traced contacts per primary case can be severely reduced, see Supplementary note 9).

In particular, the fact that adoption is above threshold and that DCT not only seems able to detect more secondary cases than manual tracing but that a significant percentage of these could even contact with strangers is encouraging. Some additional comments and reflections on some challenges and limitations of such deployment are now in order.",

Accordingly, our results, while very promising, should be treated with caution. As we have seen in the experiment, a successful adoption of the technology is underpinned by a substantial communication campaign. Also, we should distinguish overall adoption (the total percentage of the population that downloaded the app) from adoption density (which could vary from region to region within a country). For the DCT to work in a certain region, reaching sufficient adoption density is a necessary condition. This fact emphasises the importance of deploying not only strong nationwide communication campaigns, but also regional campaigns which aim at increasing local adoption densities.",

In this controlled experiment we haven't observed such avalanches. While it is true that infections in this experiment were simulated-and thus should be further evaluated in real scenarios of disease transmission-the average number of matches per simulated primary case (6.3) was on the same order of magnitude than the average total number of contacts found in the BBC and Polymod data 24, 25, 28 . This suggests that in the context of this experiment the app is detecting about the correct amount of close-contacts and thus suggests large avalanches of false positives overwhelming primary healthcare would be unlikely.",

Similarly, the follow-up system which takes place once close-contacts are alerted is unique for each autonomic healthcare system as well. Such integration is a critical factor underpinning success and has not been validated in this experiment.",

Accordingly, further sociological studies should be carried out to investigate whether the fact that the close-contact is alerted by the app to have had a high-risk exposure at least helps to induce a modification on her behaviour (e.g. inducing spontaneous self-isolation), effectively reducing her contacts with others over some time window. What is however clear from our study is that if our estimation of the follow-up percentage is representative, then the ability of the app to detect tertiary or quaternary cases is seriously compromised, as no possibility of 'cascading' emerges.",

What is in any case clear is that the technology of Radar COVID works correctly and that if the results of the experiment are representative, then the nationwide deployment of the DCT app and its integration with the healthcare system of each autonomous community in Spain is justified and can contribute to the management and containment of the epidemic.
