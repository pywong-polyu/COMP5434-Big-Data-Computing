Results: Lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and ferritin levels were included in the risk score system and were assigned a score of 25, 15, 34, 20, and 24, respectively. The cutoff value for the total score was > 35, with a sensitivity of 100.00% and specificity of 81.20%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.925-0.989) and 0.437(P Value = 0.437).

            "text": "In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology first occurred inWuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide [1, 2] . Later studies confirmed that the disease was caused by a novel coronavirus referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3, 4] . Then, in February 2020, this emerging infectious disease was officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [5, 6] . Although most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms, 19% could develop severe or fatal symptoms and present with intractable conditions, particularly ARDS [7] . With respect to its definition, the pathogenesis of ARDS involves rapidly progressing respiratory failure from non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which may require mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia and difficulty in breathing [8] . Currently, the Berlin definition for ARDS is utilized, and it recommends the use of three categories to differentiate severity based on partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/ initial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) [9] . According to a recently published study, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 who present with ARDS is > 70% [10] . Moreover, the current guidelines for the treatment of ARDS focus on lung-protective ventilation and fluid conservative management, and early interventions were found to have a better therapeutic effect [11] . Thus, to facilitate the early identification of high-risk patients and prevent the development of or reduce the severity of ARDS, the predictors of this condition must be determined. Recent studies have identified several predictors for the unfavorable outcomes of COVID-19 [12] [13] [14] . However, only few predictors of the onset of ARDS were determined. Thus, the key indicators for the risk of ARDS should be immediately identified upon admission. Moreover, risk evaluation models that use a combination of risk factors are likely to increase the power of prediction. Some risk scoring systems have been developed for several clinical conditions, including coronary heart disease [15] , heart failure [16] , and stroke [17] , and these systems were found to have great practical value. Thus, a systemic evaluation tool involving risk scores, which can be practical for clinicians, is urgently needed. In this study, we obtained data from 220 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who died in or were discharged from the isolation ward of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at Wuhan Union Hospital between January 10, 2020, and March 5, 2020. The current study aimed to explore the risk factors associated with ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and develop a risk evaluation system for predicting ARDS.",

Meanwhile, data obtained from the remaining 30% of the patients (n = 66) were used as test dataset to validate the effect of the model. Using the training dataset, continuous and categorical variables were presented as median with interquartile range (IQR) and total number (n) with percentage (%), respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test, \u03c72 test, and Fisher's exact test were used accordingly to compare the differences between patients with and without ARDS. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to test the association between the risk factors and onset of ARDS. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to depict the predictive ability of the variables. The Youden index, which was calculated as the sum of the sensitivity and specificity minus 1, was used to determine the optimal cutoff value. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated with the ROC curves to determine the differentiating abilities of the corresponding risk factors. Variables with significant differences between patients with and without ARDS were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, and a stepwise selection method was used to identify the variables included in the predictive model. The assigned risk score for the corresponding variables was determined by multiplying the \u03b2 coefficients of significant variables by 10 and rounding off the value to the nearest integers, and the total risk score was calculated as the sum of those of the individual risk factors. In the verification dataset, the model was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and ROC curve. All data analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, the USA). Two-tailed P values < 0.05 for all tests were considered statistically significant. P values < 0.1 were used as the selection criteria for variables in the model.",

Although ferritin is considered a marker of tissue inflammation, PCT is more commonly considered as an indicator of bacterial infection [29, 30] . This result indicates that concomitant bacterial infection may play an important role in the progression of ARDS among patients with COVID-19, and this finding is in accordance with a previous hypothesis on the pathogenesis of the disease [31] [32] [33] . Thus, for high-risk patients with elevated PCT levels, treatment with antibiotics may be effective in preventing ARDS. Although we have not obtained precise etiological evidence, we found that the Procalcitonin in the ARDS group was higher and exceeded the normal range, accompanied by an increase in White blood cell count, C-Reactive protein, ESR, Ferritin and a decrease in lymphocyte count. This also suggests that it seems that patients in the ARDS group have worse immunity and a higher risk of bacterial/fungal co-infection.",

            "text": "Moreover, the importance of BUN in predicting ARDS has not received special attention. As severe infection and tissue damage can increase the rate of protein degradation [38] , patients with ARDS had elevated BUN levels. Moreover, the cutoff value for BUN levels in predicting ARDS is > 5.12 mmol/L, which is still within the normal range. BUN levels higher than the normal range can indicate > 50% loss of renal function, and this may emphasize the preservation of renal function in patients with COVID-19, which plays a decisive role in fluid control for treatment of patients with ARDS [27] . With respect to the specific scores assigned to the individual risk factors, these variables may divided into groups with high scores, including those of LDH, D-dimer, and ferritin levels, with scores of 25, 34, and 24, respectively, and groups with low scores, including those of BUN and PCT, with scores of 15 and 20, respectively. As the optimal cutoff value is > 35, a positive result for any single factor is not sufficient to identify high-risk patients, and any combination of the three factors is sufficient. However, when evaluation is based on two variables, one should be included in the high-score group. This study had several strengths. First, Wuhan Union Hospital is one of the first designated institutions for treating patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan. Thus, the participants constituted a representative sample of hospitalized patients. Moreover, this study had one of the largest populations with definite outcomes during hospitalization, thereby providing a strong evidence for depicting the risk factors of ARDS among patients with COVID-19. By contrast, after a systemic selection of possible risk factors, a panel of indices routinely tested in clinical settings were selected, and a risk evaluation score was designed with a relatively good predictive efficacy for practical use. However, this study also had several limitations. First, the interpretation of the results may be limited by the relatively small sample size. Second, studies involving external verification must be conducted to validate the efficacy of our model in predicting ARDS. Finally, Due to the heavy clinical work during the epidemic, some important indicators such as PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 have not been recorded in time, so these indicators cannot be included in our research.",

A rough stepwise selection method and a panel of risk factors, including LDH, BUN, D-dimer, PCT, and ferritin levels, were included in the prediction model, and a risk evaluation scoring system was established, with an optimal cutoff value > 35 and AUC of 0.967 (95% CI: 0.925-0.989). Moreover, the model had excellent discrimination and calibration during the internal validation, which is considered practical for clinicians. The novel risk scoring system may be a valuable tool for screening COVID-19 patients with a high risk of ARDS.",
