            "text": "Background: SARS-CoV-2 lacks sentience and can only be spread through human behaviour. Government instructions to the general public include: (a) limiting time spent outside the home, (b) staying more than 1 m away from people outside the household at all times, and (c) maintaining hand hygiene. Current evidence suggests high rates of adherence to such instructions, but interventions to sustain adherence to government instructions in the long term can only be developed if we know why people do or do not adhere to them. The aims were to assess levels of public adherence to government instructions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but more importantly to gauge why people were or were not adhering to instructions. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 2252 adults who were representative of the UK population. Data were analysed descriptively, and using one-sample t-tests, within-participants ANOVA and multiple linear regression. Results: The sample reported mostly adhering to UK government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with 5% or fewer people reporting active resistance to instructions. People generally reported high levels of capability, opportunity and motivation to follow the instructions, but perceived relatively few physical and social opportunities. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that better adherence was associated with older age, being a woman, having a white ethnic background, and with perceiving greater levels of capabilities, opportunities and motivations. Conclusions: Interventions targeted at people with black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, men and younger people that focus on increasing capabilities, providing greater opportunities and boosting motivations are needed to support continued adherence to government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further research is required to track changes in people's capabilities, opportunities, motivations and behaviours in response to the ongoing emergency, any changes in government instructions, and to adapt the present procedures to other emergency situations.",

            "text": "As of 18 January 2021, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused in excess of 2,000,000 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . Considerable resource has rightly been allocated to understanding the biological underpinnings to COVID-19 with a view to developing screening tools and interventions to tackle the pandemic [2] . However, the psychosocial underpinnings to COVID-19 are equally important because the public plays an important role in preventing the spread of the virus by: (a) limiting the time spent outside; (b) staying more than 1 m away from people outside the household at all times; and (c) maintaining hand hygiene [3] . The evidence suggests that, at present, public adherence to the instruction to stay at home is above 80% [4], but it is less clear whether instructions to distance physically and maintain hand hygiene are being followed. Moreover, as periods of lockdown extends and the likelihood is that some measures may remain in place for years [5] , it is important that adherence is sustained. The only way to ensure continued voluntary adherence is first to understand why people are, or are not, adhering to government COVID-19-related instructions to stay at home, keep physically distant and maintain hand hygiene to prevent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [3] . The broad aim of the present research was to gather data to inform behaviour change interventions designed to promote sustained adherence to government COVID-19-related instructions. The specific aims were to: assess levels of adherence to government COVID-19-related instructions to stay at home, keep physical distance and maintain hand hygiene among the general public; gauge people's perceptions of their capabilities, opportunities and motivations [6] ; and identify predictors of adherence.",

Thus, although adherence to UK government COVID-19-related instructions is high at a population level, it is plausible that adherence is more problematic for people already suffering inequalities. Understanding which groups to target with interventions will be important in developing strategies to ensure sustained adherence to government instructions. Evidence from the United States suggests that older people may be more likely to distance physically [8] ; in the Democratic Republic of the Congo non-adherence was associated with being unemployed and being a woman [9] , whereas women were more likely to adhere in Hong Kong [10] , meaning there may be cultural differences in patterns of adherence.",

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence endorses the model as a key theoretical framework for understanding and supporting behaviour change [15]. Keyworth et al.'s [14] measure comprises six items designed to tap physical capability, psychological capability, physical opportunity, social opportunity, reflective motivation, and automatic motivation, which are presented in Table 1 . The items are accompanied by brief definitions of each of the constructs (e.g., the reflective motivation item is accompanied with: \"What is motivation? Conscious planning and evaluation (beliefs about what is good and bad) (e.g., I have the desire to, I feel the need to) and are assess on 11-point scales (strongly disagree[0]-strongly agree [10] .",

The findings that men and people with black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were less likely to be adherent are consistent with higher mortality rates in these populations [7] . Preliminary UK data also suggest that younger people are less adherent [16] , which is consistent with the present findings. Globally, the evidence suggests that age and socioeconomic status may be more closely associated with adherence than in the UK [8, 9] , meaning there may be cultural differences in patterns of adherence that would need to accounted for in public health interventions. We also found further evidence for the predictive validity of the capabilities, opportunities and motivations model of behaviour change [6, 14] . As far as we are aware, the present study is only the second to have tested the predictive validity of the Keyworth et al. [14] measure. This is important because it provides the basis for interventions to sustain and improve adherence to government instructions. For example, people perceived relatively few social opportunities, so it would be possible to ",
