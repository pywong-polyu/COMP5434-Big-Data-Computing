Most practices and training programs have been encouraged to use teleproctoring as an alternative method to enhance physician's ability and assure training. We aimed to evaluate remote training program for endoscopy sleeve gastroplasty (ESG). Methods Ten consecutive patients underwent an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty procedure guided by a proctor expert using an online platform. A stepwise approach was created to assure skill acquisition. Results All cases were safely performed with no serious adverse events under teleproctoring. The average surgical and suturing times significantly decreased during the training model. From the first 5 cases to the last 5 ones, the endoscopic procedure time decreased from 120 to 93.4 min while suturing time from 92.8 to 68.4 min. The effect size was large in both cases, and the changes were meaningful according to the fitted learning curves. Conclusions The proposed teleproctoring program was effective to deliver advanced endoscopic skills such as endosuturing for ESG, despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

A trainee, who was familiar with basic endoscopic therapeutic procedures (intragastric balloon, hemostasis techniques, endoscopic mucosal resection, etc.), received theoretical classes, practices, and tests for handling the device. The proctor implemented the training by remotely mentoring and evaluating the process through broadband connectivity, action cameras, video capture cards, tripods, smartphones, and Bluetooth earbuds. Internet connection was tested before each procedure and meeting to be at a minimum of 10mbps (megabites per seconds). Both proctor and trainee used wired connections but had 4G connections as a backup in case of connectivity issues during livestreaming. A web conferencing platform (Zoom R ) was used for the training sessions and the cases as well. It allows users to directly interact via audio and video call. Along with 2 room webcams, the endoscopy tower video output was connected to a video capture card and from that to a computer linked to a Zoom meeting for broadcasting (Fig. 1) . The trainee carried out the training process and the endoscopic procedures at a private clinic in Ecuador from March to August 2020, while the telementor was an expert from Brazil. All patients agreed to participate in this educational program and signed a written informed consent to undergo the ESG under this teleproctoring program.

All procedures were performed in a private endoscopy clinic. For ESG, a double-channel gastroscope (Olympus CV160, Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and CO2 insufflation were employed. A specific esophageal overtube (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX, USA) facilitated the passage of suturing device and minimized deflation as it carries a balloon cuff at its distal end. The Apollo Overstich\u00ae is an endoscopic suturing system that allows full-thickness tissue apposition using a curved needle and polypropylene 2-0 threads. The first stitch was where the Incisura Angularis meets in the anterior wall and then following an imaginary straight line in the direction of the posterior passing through the greater curvature at an estimated distance of 2 cm from each stitch. Once the suture line reached the posterior wall, it should return to the anterior line in a similar fashion forming the \"U\" stitching pattern. On the following sutures, the same pattern was applied on the gastric body distal to proximal up to the proximal gastric fundus. The surgical procedure was performed according Galvao Neto et al.'s description [8] and clinical management according to the Brazilian Consensus on ESG [9] .",

Teleproctoring in surgery was first reported more than 20 years ago [5] . According to McCullough et al., it is a \"technology where audio and video interaction facilitate the virtual presence of a teacher to provide real-time instruction and technical assistance from a different geographic location.\" Similar to the traditional approach, this method allows the proctor to provide training to the surgery fellow amid clinical setting [6] . However, it mitigates logistic obstacles concerning distance, time constraints, and costs [11] . Teleproctoring was a success as an educational tool in different countries [6, 12, 13] .",
