Here, we report a strategy, based on DIgitAl plasMONic nanobubble Detection (DIAMOND), to address this need. Plasmonic nanobubbles are transient vapor bubbles generated by laser heating of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and allow single-NP detection. Using gold NPs as labels and an optofluidic setup, we demonstrate that DIAMOND achieves compartment-free digital counting and works on homogeneous immunoassays without separation and amplification steps. DIAMOND allows specific detection of respiratory syncytial virus spiked in nasal swab samples and achieves a detection limit of~100 PFU/mL (equivalent to 1 RNA copy/\u00b5L), which is competitive with digital isothermal amplification for virus detection. Therefore, DIAMOND has the advantages including one-step and single-NP detection, direct sensing of intact viruses at room temperature, and no complex liquid handling, and is a platform technology for rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostics.",

            "text": "T he ability to rapidly detect diseases with high precision is of paramount importance as evidenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic 1,2 . Digital immunoassays have been a remarkable conceptual advance over the past two decades due to their capabilities of single-molecule detection and absolute quantification [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . They partition the analytes into microwells or emulsion droplets as small compartments for independent signal amplification and digital counting, leading to the sensitivity enhancement by up to 10 3 -fold over the conventional immunoassays (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) 3, 7, 10 . Despite these advantages, digital immunoassays have complex assay protocols, such as multiple washing steps, sample partitioning, and signal amplification prior to the measurements, which have limited their widespread use. Such paradigms prompt further innovations to simplify the digital immunoassays. Nanoparticles (NPs) are thus employed as labels and provide an alternative to streamline the workflow. For example, interrogation of individual NPs through bright-field or dark-field imaging 11 , interferometric 12 or fluorescent imaging 13, 14 , surface-enhanced Raman scattering 15 , and surface plasmon resonance microscopy imaging 16 circumvents the signal amplification step, while tracking the Brownian motion of individual particles allows digitizing a homogeneous immunoassay without washings [17] [18] [19] . However, those techniques still rely on multistep operation, cumbersome chip preparation, tag labeling, and advanced imaging systems and are currently confined to laboratory settings.",

            "text": "Here, we report a strategy for a simplified digital immunoassay based on DIgitAl plasMONic nanobubble Detection (DIA-MOND, see Table S1 for comparison with other assays). Plasmonic nanobubbles (PNBs) refer to the vapor bubbles generated by short laser pulse excitation of plasmonic NPs (e.g., gold NPs or AuNPs) and amplify their intrinsic absorption for the detection by a secondary probe laser [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . PNBs have lifetimes that last nanoseconds and are sensitive to physical properties of NPs such as size, shape, concentration, and clustering state [20] [21] [22] . Taking advantage of these unique properties, we designed an optofluidic setup to flow the NP suspension in a micro-capillary, where two aligned laser beams synchronically activate the NPs and detect the PNBs (Figs. 1a and S1). Since the PNBs are transient events and have no crosstalk between laser pulses, DIAMOND creates microscale \"virtual detection zones\" of about 16 pL and counts the \"on\" and \"off\" signals in a compartment-free manner (Fig. 1b,  c) . Although its detection scheme is similar to flow cytometry, DIAMOND utilizes non-fluorescent labels for signal generation and detects analytes without flow focusing 25, 26 . Using AuNPs and silica (SiO 2 ) beads as models, we demonstrate that DIAMOND detects a single NP and can be implemented on a homogenous assay with a sub-femtomolar detection limit. When applied to detect the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), DIAMOND provides good detection specificity among closely related respiratory viruses and achieves a detection limit of~100 PFU/mL or 1 RNA copy/\u00b5L equivalent. With rapid readouts and ultrasensitive detection, DIAMOND opens possibilities to develop digital immunoassays without the need for separation, amplification, and physical compartments (such as droplets or microwells) at room temperature.",

It is evident that the probability of zero AuNP (k = 0) passing through the detection zone increases with decreasing \u03bb and thus leads to discrete PNB signals. In particular, in the case of \u03bb = 0.04, each PNB signal highlighted in Fig. 2a refers to a single AuNP being detected according to the Poisson distribution ( Fig. S4d ). This result confirms the capability of DIAMOND for single-NP detection. To correlate the PNB signals with AuNP concentration, we calculated the frequencies of positive PNB signals in each trace as \"on\" signals (f on ) and plotted it as a function of \u03bb (Fig. 2b) . A high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.998) indicates the accurate AuNP quantification via f on counting. Furthermore, we found a linear relationship (slope = 0.985, R 2 = 0.998, Fig. 2c ) between the theoretical probability (P) predicted by Poisson statistics and the experimental f on , suggesting that DIAMOND is a calibration-free technique and allows absolute quantification. Next, we used DIAMOND to detect AuNPs of different sizes. AuNP suspensions (15, 35, 50 , and 75 nm) at the same concentration (Figs. S2, S3, and Table S2 ) were prepared for the test. Figure 2d shows the representative PNB signal traces. Due to a large number of AuNPs per detection zone (\u03bb = 240), consistent PNB signals were observed in each laser pulse. Figure 2e shows representative PNB signals taken from each case and suggests that larger NP size leads to larger PNB signals. To quantify this relationship, we extracted the values of amplitude and area-under-the-curve (AUC) from each PNB signal (Fig. S5 ) and plotted their distribution profiles as a function of AuNP sizes (Fig. 2f ). They could be fitted with 1.98-and 3.51order dependences on the NPs' size, respectively. This seems to agree with the fact that the PNB generation is related to the amount of heat generation and absorption cross-section of AuNPs 27, 28 . The good fitting indicates the PNB is a sizedependent event, and its signal can indicate the NP size.",

The rationale is that the NP clusters or aggregates discussed later may act as bigger particles. We first tested detecting 75 nm AuNPs in the background of 15 nm NPs. Figure 3a shows the representative PNB signal traces taken from three sets of samples, including 15 and 75 nm AuNPs and a mixture of them. The large intensity variation of PNB signals observed in the mixture sample is due to the addition of 75 nm AuNPs. To sort those specific signals resulting from 75 nm AuNPs in the mixture, we developed a three-step analytical protocol. First, we extracted the amplitude and AUC values of each PNB signal as indices for quantification and plotted the corresponding results in bivariate (Fig. 3b) . Individual scatters represent independent PNB events measurements. Second, we fitted normal distributions to the amplitude and AUC of 15 nm AuNPs as a reference (Fig. 3b , case i) and calculated the threshold (T) using five times standard deviations (\u03c3) above the mean (\u03bc). As such, the two thresholds covered over 99.9% of the scatters. Last, we assigned the thresholds to the mixture sample for data sorting. The scatters above the thresholds refer to the positive or \"on\" PNB signals resulting from 75 nm AuNPs in the mixture (Fig. 3b , case ii). For direct comparison, we benchmarked it with f on from 75 nm AuNPs alone (thresholds = 0, Fig. 3b , case iii) and the Poisson probability (Fig. 3c) . The agreement between experimental results and theoretical prediction indicates that our method provides accurate and absolute quantification of large NPs from a strong background of small ones (i.e., 1 in 240). Importantly, the capability of DIAMOND to detect heterogeneity without an additional separation step may have potential implications as an analytical tool for NPs and requires further study.",

Homogeneous assays are simple, one-step sensing methods that require minimal liquid handling and are promising for rapid detection 29 . To validate our hypothesis in a model system, we used the AuNPs as probes to detect SiO 2 beads (Fig. 4a) . Figure 4b shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the asprepared product, where a core-satellites structure was formed with AuNPs fully covering the surface of SiO 2 beads. Figure 4c , d shows representative PNB signal traces and corresponding bivariate plot taken from serial assay solutions, respectively. Similarly, the thresholds (T = \u03bc + 5\u03c3) of amplitude and AUC were calculated from the control group (highlighted in dashed lines) and assigned for counting \"on\" signals. The f on was then plotted as a function of \u03bb or particle concentration of SiO 2 beads (Fig. 4e) . A linear relationship (R 2 = 0.99) in the range of 0.0016-0.16 was observed and the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.0028, equivalent to 1.75 \u00d7 10 5 mL \u22121 or 290 aM (inset of Fig. 4e ). Such detection limit is~570-fold lower than the colorimetric detection (Fig. S6 ). It should be pointed out that the detection range of DIAMOND only covers 2 logs due to the limited counting number (i.e., 3000 pulses). Alternatively, we can use an analog method to analyze PNB signals (e.g., averaged AUC versus analyte concentration), which should provide an additional detection range beyond 100% f on 12,30 . Furthermore, DIAMOND allows absolute quantification for homogeneous assays, as indicated by the linear correlation (slope = 1.007, R 2 = 0.999) between the background-subtracted frequency (f on \u2032) and the Poisson probability (Fig. 4f ).",

We chose Synagis (Palivizumab) as the detection antibody and conjugated it on the AuNPs through 3,3\u2032-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) as a cross-linker (Fig. S7 ). We used 15 nm AuNPs as labels because they can be prepared with uniform size and shape. The AuNP-Synagis probes specifically recognized the fusion proteins on the RSV surface at room temperature and were ready for detection (Fig. 5a ). Figure 5b shows the TEM images of AuNP probes targeting the RSV of different morphologies (highlighted in red). Figures S8 and 5c show the colorimetric detection of different respiratory viruses, including Parainfluenza viruses (PIV), Influenza viruses A (IVA), Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and purified RSV. The results suggest the good detection specificity using AuNP probes and a LOD of 3.6 \u00d7 10 4 PFU/mL for RSV in colorimetric detection. For a direct comparison, we benchmarked the immunoassay results against the commercially available lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) kit (BinaxNOW, Abbott), which has a LOD of 1.6 \u00d7 10 4 PFU/mL (Fig. S9) . We then carried out DIAMOND for RSV detection and provided representative detection results in Fig. S10 . Following the same protocol discussed above, we set the thresholds based on the control group (Fig. 5d) and assigned them for f on counting (Fig. 5e) . In particular, a linear relationship (R 2 = 0.995) in the range of 10 2 -10 4 PFU/mL was observed, and the LOD was calculated to be 108 PFU/mL (inset of Fig. 5e ).

It should be mentioned that when used for control virus detection (i.e., hMPV, PIV, and IVA, dispersed in borate buffer), the RSV-specific AuNP probes caused non-specific binding as suggested by the positive PNB signals (Figs. S11 and 6a, b). This phenomenon can be ascribed to that the control viruses were received in cell culture fluid that contains impurities like cell debris and thus leads to the non-specific aggregation. To address this issue, we used bovine serum albumin (BSA) to backfill the AuNP probes (inset of Figs. 6c and S12). The BSA has been frequently used in immunoassays as block reagent and can prevent the non-specific binding for improved detection specificity 32 . To evaluate the performance of BSA-backfilled AuNP probes, we incubated them with respiratory viruses spiked in nasal swab samples and subjected the complete assay solution to the DIAMOND test. The viral transport medium (VTM), hMPV, PIV, and IVA were used as negative controls, and all viral titers were kept the same as 10 5 PFU/mL. Figures S13 and 6c , d show the virus detection results using BSA-backfilled probes, where the positive PNB signals from the control viruses were n. s. significantly reduced, while the PNB signals from RSV can be easily distinguished from the control samples, yielding f on = 100% that matches well with the theoretical probability. In contrast, the non-backfilled probes still cause non-specific aggregation upon detection (Fig. S14 ). This result suggests that DIAMOND has a better detection specificity when utilizing BSA-backfilled probes. Similar to that of the purified viruses (Fig. 5) , these probes enable sensitive detection of spiked RSV in nasal swab samples with a detection limit of 102 PFU/mL (Figs. S15 and 6e, f). Taken together, these data demonstrated that implementing DIAMOND on a homogeneous immunoassay allows sensitive analysis of viral samples in the human specimen matrix and supports the potential clinical applications.",

To perform the dLAMP, we used a commercially available fluorescent LAMP kit and microwell chips to detect genomic RNA from RSV (A2 strain). A set of primers (Table S3) were used according to a previous publication 37 . Figure S16a -e shows the fluorescence images of the dLAMP results after incubating at 65\u00b0C for 30 min, where the fraction of positive wells (brighter) reduces as the concentration of target RNA decreases. A calibration curve (R 2 = 0.9998, Fig. S16f ) was established as a function of the RNA inputs. The LOD was estimated to be 2 copies/\u00b5L using synthetic RNA (inset of Fig. S16f) . We then used this method to detect RSV from the spiked samples. The RSV extracts were collected using a commercially available RNA extraction buffer and purification kit. Figure S17a -d shows the dLAMP detection results for RSV extracts at different concentrations. Specifically, dLAMP has a LOD of~200 PFU/mL (Fig. S17e) , similar to that of DIAMOND. Furthermore, referring to the calibration curve in Fig. S16f , we estimated that 100 PFU/mL is equivalent to 1 copy/\u00b5L RNA with our protocols. In other words, DIAMOND has a LOD of singlemolecule detection, which is competitive with nucleic acid amplification methods. ",

On the other hand, DIAMOND does not require chip preparation or on-chip reaction and can be performed with less assay time than the digital homogeneous assays [17] [18] [19] .

            "text": "In the present study, we focused on developing and validating a versatile digital immunoassay. We envision several further improvements to this technology in order to bring it to a broad range of labs and practical applications. First, it is possible to design a small benchtop device for the plasmonic nanobubble (PNB) measurements that can be distributed to other labs 38 . By replacing the research-grade picosecond pulse laser with a smaller nanosecond (ns) laser (e.g., Wedge-HB-532, RPMC), all components can be integrated into a benchtop device (15 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 6 inches, Fig. S18 ). Evaluation of PNB generation and detection by this ns laser shows robust results across a range of AuNP concentrations (Fig. S19 ). More importantly, the ns laser provides a repetition rate up to 2000 Hz for a much faster readout and thereby more efficient event counting. Second, further optimization of the optofluidic system can increase the sampling efficiency for the PNB measurements. In the present system, we used the readily available micro-capillary although the laser probes only a small portion of the sample (20-40% along and 5-10% orthogonal to the flow direction, respectively, Fig. S20) . A low sampling efficiency leads to fewer events counted for a given sample volume and thus limits the dynamic range and sensitivity for the detection 5 . A microfluidic flow-focusing system can readily solve this problem by creating a narrower flow path 39 . Taking advantage of the high-throughput ns laser and focusing flow, we expect to increase the event counting (e.g., 1 million readings within 10 min, similar to flow cytometer). This will improve the detection range and sensitivity of DIAMOND ( Fig. S21 and Table S4 ) because the digital counting performance essentially relies on the number of counted events 40 . Last, it is worth exploring different modes of DIAMOND operation. Since the PNB generation is dependent on the laser fluence, we can perform the DIAMOND test in two modes by modulating the laser fluence above and below the PNB generation threshold 20 , referred to as above-and below-threshold modes. Currently, we used the above-threshold mode with a high laser fluence at P PNB = 100% (blue arrow of Fig. S22) , resulting in the generation of PNB signals from both the small NPs and larger clusters. Alternatively, we may adopt the below-threshold mode at a lower laser fluence (P PNB = 0%, red arrow of Fig. S22 ) to only activate large clusters for PNB generation.",

This, together with multiplexed detection, is important yet challenging for in vitro diagnosis 10, 18, 41 . Due to the small size and limited binding sites of proteins, they can only absorb a few NPs on the surface. As a result, it may be challenging to reliably differentiate protein-specific PNB signals from background signals. Therefore, we can set up a diluted setting with a low NP number per detection zone (e.g., \u03bb = 0.1) so that the signals from zero, single, and multiple NPs passing through are unique 10 . In this case, it is crucial to ask whether DIAMOND can recognize PNB signals from events when single and multiple NPs pass through together. As a first step, we have tested and validated a threshold-based gating method 42 to determine the PNB signals generated from a specific number (k = 0, 1, 2\u2026) of AuNPs (Fig. S23 ) using the case of \u03bb = 0.4 shown in Fig. 2a as a model.

Importantly, DIAMOND can specifically detect RSV among different respiratory viruses and achieve a detection limit of 100 PFU/mL (or 1 RNA copy/\u00b5L). Compared with other digital assays, DIAMOND counts events in a compartment-free manner and utilizes a one-pot protocol for sample handling at room temperature. Our study provides a digital counting platform for rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostics of intact viruses at their early representation.",
