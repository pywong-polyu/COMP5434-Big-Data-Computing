B cell, CTL and HTL were determined based on antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity that were non-allergenic, non-toxic, and antigenic and were selected for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine structure. Then, in order to increase the safety of Hbd-3 and Hbd-2 as adjuvants, they were connected to the N and C terminals of the vaccine construct, respectively, with a linker. The three-dimensional structure of the structure was predicted and optimized, and its quality was evaluated. The vaccine construct was ligated to MHCI. Finally, after optimizing the codon to increase expression in E. coli K12, the vaccine construct was cloned into pET28a (+) vector.",

            "text": "nucleoprotein (N), membrane (M), surface glycoprotein (S) and envelop protein (E) [4] . Most coronaviruses require structural protein to produce a complete viral particle [6] . Each of these proteins is not only involved in the structure of the virus but also in various aspects, involved in virus replication [7] . Surface glycoprotein (S) is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor [8] , which has two basic components (S1) and globular (S2). S1 is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor, and S2 contains fusion peptide [9] . For SARS-COV, full-length and the active immunization part of S protein [10] , S protein peptides [11] and chimeric versions of S protein have been identified [12] . DNA structures encoding the S protein have also produced virus-neutralizing antibodies [13] . S protein as a major antigenic component is an important target for vaccine development [14] . Nucleoprotein (N) is a phosphoprotein and nucleocapsid protein that binds to genomic RNA and M protein and is the main stimulus of the host immune system during viral infection [15] . N protein in its entirety is highly immunogenic and antigenic [16] . In addition, N protein is an early diagnostic marker for SARS-COV because it can be detected in clinical specimens one day after the onset of symptoms [17] and it is stable due to very small mutations [18] . Although ritonavir and lopinavir are used as protease-inhibiting drugs for the treatment of SARS-COV-2, it has been reported in a clinical trial that its usefulness for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 is questionable [19] . In case of emergency, Remdesivir is used against SARS-COV-2 or recovered patients' plasma is used as a side-effect-free treatment [20] . However, there is no specific and approved drug for SARS-COV-2 infection, and the treatment approach is more supportive, and the use of these therapies is said to reduce the resulting mortality rate. Therefore, the development of effective drugs and vaccines against the control of emerging diseases is a priority of research and immunoinformatic is currently considered as a new method to find an effective way to control diseases [21] . Immunoinformatics methods could be used to explore antigens of viruses, prediction of their epitopes and evaluation of its immunogenicity [22] . In different studies, medical procedures against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika virus and Ebola virus were performed by utilizing immunoinformatics techniques [23, 24] . The use of epitope vaccines using immunogenic epitopes specific to CD8+ and CD4+ cells and stimulating the immune system against these epitopes simultaneously and completely specifically are among the methods that have been considered in this regard. Conventional methods for producing vaccines are time-consuming and expensive [25] . The immune system can respond to any viral or microbial contamination, by detecting foreign intruders through their artificial peptide epitopes. By having a total map of virus epitopes and their immunogenicity, it is vital to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19 virus disease [26] . Moreover, multi-epitope vaccine significantly stimulates humoral and cellular immune responses, concurrently due to T cell as well as B cell epitopes [27, 28] . Multi-epitope vaccine is made of adjuvants, so they are expected to create long-standing immune reactions and high immunogenicity [28] .",

Also, GC sequence content (51.93%) was in the desired range (30-70%). These results may indicate high expression of the vaccine construct in the bacterial system.

            "text": "Today, as coronaviruses appear periodically and unpredictably and they are spreading rapidly, they are causing serious infectious diseases; they have become a constant threat to human health. This is especially true when there is no vaccine or approved drug to treat coronavirus infection [1] . Many studies are underway to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Some studies have suggested that the S protein is a promising candidate for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine because it is involved in the binding, fusion and entry of the virus into the host cell [53] . There are also reports showing that antibodies against S protein prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells, so it strengthens the use of S protein as a suitable candidate for the production of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine [54] . Also, N protein, due to its protected protein sequence, growing knowledge of its genetic biochemistry and very high immunogenicity, can be considered as a suitable candidate for the production of vaccine against COVID-19 disease [55] . Today, the ease of manufacturing industrial peptides as well as their engineering ability has made such vaccines suitable candidates for vaccination. The use of epitope vaccines based on peptide synthesis is one of the new strategies in vaccine research that focuses the immune response on important and valuable epitopes. The use of epitope peptides for vaccination against various organisms such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HBV (hepatitis B virus) and various models of cancer, etc., has been considered [56] . During the present study, epitopes derived from S and N proteins SARS-CoV-2 were studied for the design and development of a multi-epitope vaccine using immunoinformatic methods. Identification of antigenic epitopes by the immune system is a key step in the immune response to the pathogen, identifying either epitopes that stimulate T cells or epitopes that are trapped by B cells and soluble antibodies [57] . In this study, CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes were selected based on antigenetic, allergenicity and toxicity. A restriction of these published studies is the failure to consider the effect of glycosylation, which could shield some of the selected epitopes. The vital role of glycosylation is defined in antigenicity, fusogenic and immunomodulatory activities of the spike protein [58] . About 17 N-glycosylation sites associated with two O-glycosylation sites were found occupied in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [59] . Meanwhile, glycans could impede the recognition of antigens by shielding the residues [60] , and protein glycosylation would impact on the efficiency of antigen finding [61] . We circumnavigated most [61] . Many studies have revealed the influence of glycosylation on the augmentation of antigens immunogenicity [62] . Owing to increase expression, folding and stability, linkers act as an essential element in the development of epitope vaccines [63] . In this study, CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes were connected to design vaccine structure by AAY, GPGPG and KK linkers, respectively. Defensins increase the acquired immune response by chemically absorbing activity for monocytes, T cells and dendritic cells, and the activity of inducing cytokine production by monocytes and epithelial cells [64] . Accordingly, human beta-defensin 3 and 2 were added as adjuvants to the N and C ends of the designed structure by the EAAAK linker, respectively. EAAAK linker, due to its salt bridge related to glutamic acid and lysine, can prevent protein which domains from converging by creating a stable helix structure [65] . The molecular weight of the designed vaccine was 59,038.88 daltons (approximately 59 kDa), which makes it an acceptable vaccine. Because proteins with a molecular weight of less than 110 kDa are considered as more suitable targets for vaccine production [66] . The isoelectric point of the vaccine structure was determined to be 10/06, which indicates the playful nature of the designed vaccine structure. Also, the instability index of the structure is 38.96 according to ProtParam program, which is classified as a stable protein. Because the range of this index for stable proteins is less than 40 results, the alpha index, which indicates the stability of the protein over a wide temperature range, was reported to be 57.24 for this designed vaccine construct. Its GRAVY value is \u2212 0.7, which is a negative value of this index, indicating the nature of the hydrophilic structure of the vaccine, and therefore can interact strongly with water molecules. The total number of negatively charged (Asp + Glu) and positive (Arg + Lys) amino acids in this vaccine structure is 39 and 104, respectively. The half-life of this vaccine construct was predicted to be 30 h in mammals, more than 20 h in yeast and more than 10 h in E. coli. Based on the results, the structure of the designed vaccine solution was predicted to ensure easy access to the host. Also, according to the predicted results, the structure of the designed vaccine is antigen, non-toxic and non-allergenic. The quality of the three-dimensional structure of the designed vaccine structure increased dramatically after optimization, so that all amino acids in the desired and allowed areas (100%), according to Ramachandran map, reported that it shows the appropriate quality of the three-dimensional structure of the designed vaccine structure. Various tools were used to determine possible errors and the quality of the three-dimensional structure of the designed vaccine structure. Z-score (\u2212 9.22) and ERRAT quality factor (92,000) showed that the structure of the designed vaccine is appropriate. Using ClusPro2.0 server, connection was made between the vaccine structure designed with HLA-A02:01-1158.9 of HLA-A02:01 was the lowest amount of energy in the total of the vaccine structure. Furthermore, the iMODS server was applied to evaluate the constructional steadiness and atomiclevel motions of docked complex (designed vaccine construct-HLA-A02:01). It showed that docked proteins have minor deformation for each residue and with establishing our estimation of eigenvalues for 3.23e \u221208 , which display the validity of our in silico predicted vaccine. Because all codons that are synonymous in a codon family do not use the same rate of expression of heterogeneous proteins in Escherichia coli, codon optimization in production of eukaryotic proteins is necessary in prokaryotic hosts [67] ; therefore, codon optimization was performed to achieve a high level of protein expression in E. coli K12, and according to the results, both codon compatibility index (1.0) and GC percentage (51.93%) were calculated; this reveals a high probability of protein expression in bacteria. In addition, the immune simulation of the designed vaccine structure showed hopeful results regarding both humoral and cellular immune reaction. The results of bioinformatics evaluation of the designed vaccine construct indicated that this vaccine candidate may be highly potent against SARS-CoV-2, but in vitro and in vivo studies are needed for clinical confirmation.",

In this study, using bioinformatics analyses, suitable epitopes of S and N proteins were selected and analyzed. Finally, a different multi-epitope vaccine with a span of 543aa against the 2019-nCov will be created. It consists of two adjuvants, with 14 B cell epitopes, 9 CTL epitopes and 5 HTL epitopes. It displays good antigenic features, immunological qualities and satisfactory physiochemical characteristics, non-allergenicity and non-toxicity. It is expected that the epitopes predicted in this study would be an efficient vaccine formation against COVID-19. However, the confirmation of the epitopes which were selected in this study as a vaccine candidate should be considered as laboratory studies.",
