            "text": "During the spring of 2020, it was suspected that gambling patterns in the population might change due to mental distress and changes in everyday habits, both as a consequence of the pandemic and related virus-preventing restrictions (H\u00e5kansson et al., 2020) . In Sweden, a general population survey demonstrated that a small minority of respondents, four percent, reported increased gambling during the COVID-19 period, and that this group was characterized by a high degree of problem gambling (H\u00e5kansson, 2020a) . A repeated study in Sweden, in November, 2020, displayed very similar results, with a somewhat larger group (six percent) self-reporting an increase in gambling, and with high rates of problem gambling in this group (H\u00e5kansson and Widinghoff, 2021) . In the same setting, overall gambling data from the population indicated some shift in the gambling types used during the first months of the pandemic (H\u00e5kansson, 2020b) . In Ontario, Canada, land-based casino gamblers shifted towards online gambling mainly if they had some degree of online gambling before (Price, 2020) . In contrast, in Australia, a shift in gambling patterns during COVID-19 was not seen (Gainsbury et al., 2020) . Despite the fear of possible increases in gambling, being a problem gambler during the pandemic may paradoxically even be relieving, if one's preferred gambling types are locked down (Donati et al., 2021) . Altogether, trends in gambling during COVID-19 may be bidirectional; on one hand, home confinement and lock-down in land-based gambling venues may turn gamblers towards online chance-based games, whereas in contrast, the lock-down of sports and land-based venues may instead decrease gambling in many individuals who primarily prefer those gambling types (H\u00e5kansson et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Only a few countries world-wide have assessed gambling during COVID-19. Clearly, different countries have seen very diverse strategies against virus transmission. One example of two neighbor countries with markedly diverse strategies have been Denmark and Sweden, two countries with otherwise similar welfare systems. Denmark is among the countries addressing the pandemic with different phases of lock-down strategies, in contrast to Sweden, where formal lock-down procedures were never used (Yarmol-Matusiak et al., 2021) . For example, in contrast to Denmark, Swedish restaurants, stores and shopping malls remained open throughout 2020 (Mens et al., 2021) . In Denmark, after a first detected case in late February (Rohde et al., 2020) , COVID-19 disease during the spring of 2020 reached a top impact in Denmark in early April (Clotworthy et al., 2020) . The impact of COVID-19 again increased substantially during the autumn of 2020 and winter 2020/2021, with a new peak of virus transmission in mid-December, 2020. Likewise, the daily number of COVID-19-related deaths reached one peak in early April, 2020, and one new peak in mid-January, 2021 (Statens Serum Institut), with a death tool around twice the peak level of April. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, formal lock-down in Denmark was announced on March 11, 2020 (Rohde et al., 2020) . Early effects on mental distress in the general population was reported during lock-down measures, with more pronounced effects in women than in men (S\u20ac onderskov et al., 2020a) . After partial re-opening of society in mid-April (including school openings from April 15), mental distress was reported to decrease again (S\u20ac onderskov et al., 2020b) . Overall, only modest effects on mental health were reported during the spring phase of COVID-19 in Denmark, with effects mainly in the elderly, and on worry about the health of loved ones (Clotworthy et al., 2020) . Due to an increase in virus transmission, new lockdown procedures were decided in specific regions from early December, 2020, and thereafter intensified in broader areas of the country during December, 2020, to at least February, 2021. Lockdown procedures in the country have involved the closing of stores other than for food and medications and similar, home schooling, travel restrictions, and bans against larger private gatherings.",

The questionnaire was distributed electronically by Userneeds to its web panel members, and the answers provided were sent to the companies Patient Information Broker AB and I-Mind Consulting AB, both located in Sweden, which collected study data without knowledge of the identity of respondents. A similar study of gambling data from the Danish population has been reported previously (H\u00e5kansson et al., 2019) .

Behavioral changes during COVID-19. A question was asked about whether the respondent's gambling had increased, decreased or remained unchanged during COVID-19 (or whether the individual did not gamble at all, neither before nor during the pandemic, here referred to as 'non-gamblers'). In addition, the corresponding changes in alcohol consumption, and time spent at home, were asked. In addition, past-year participation in each type of gambling was reported. Mental distress was measured with a six-item scale, the Kessler-6, assessing anxiety and depression symptoms over the past six months. Items are scored 0-4, and from a total score of 0-24, scoring five or above is classified as moderate mental distress (Kessler-6, Furukawa et al., 2003) . Missing values for any of the six items were seen in 71 participants. Among them, 30 could still be included, as their scores from available items reached above cut-off for mental distress (n \u00bc 27), or because they had one missing item and a total score of zero from the remaining five items (n \u00bc 3). Remaining 41 individuals were excluded from analyses involving mental distress. From the analysis of gender, the two individuals who answered 'other/do not wish to answer' were excluded in analyses involving gender. Treatment needs for addictive behaviors. Dichotomous questions were asked about whether the respondent had ever perceived a need to seek treatment for alcohol problems, drug problems, or problem gambling, respectively. Socio-demographic data included gender (male, female, 'other/prefer not to answer'), occupation (working, studying, unemployed, temporarily unemployed due to COVID-19, retired, sick-leave, or other), living conditions (alone and/or with partner, with or without children, or with one's parents), and monthly income levels (in 5,000 DKK intervals, referring to the Danish currency (1 DKK corresponding to around 0.16 USD). Also, age was reported, and in order to facilitate statistical analyses and to fully maintain confidentiality, age was reported in discrete categories, starting from the legal gambling age of 18 (18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60 \u00fe years) . In order to facilitate interpretation of analyses, and in order to avoid smaller response categories in the regression analyses, for data describing occupation, this was categorized into those in active occupation (working and studying) in comparison to all others, and living conditions were categorized into living alone (without partner or children) vs all others.",

Denmark, similar to other Scandinavian nations, has relatively pronounced regulation of gambling, including a strong role of the Danish state-owned gambling operator (Sp\u00e5ngberg and Svensson, 2020) . In an international comparison, although prevalence data have been measured with diverse methods, problem gambling in Denmark has demonstrated figures in the lower range. Also, in Denmark, figures have typically been lower than in corresponding surveys from Sweden, where a total of around two percent problem gamblers has traditionally been reported (Calado and Griffiths, 2016) , even though rates of problem gambling in Sweden may have decreased slightly in recent years (Abbott et al., 2018) .",

The main findings are that a limited minority of respondents reported increased gambling during the pandemic, comparable to the proportion reporting a decrease. People reporting increased gambling hade a more severe gambling pattern, and were more likely to report being more at home during the pandemic, and had a higher degree of mental distress. Importantly, although few individuals reported initiating new gambling types during the pandemic, these individuals were particularly likely to have a more severe gambling pattern. Rates of gambling problems were high in the minority reporting initiating new gambling types during the pandemic. A secondary aim, given the similarity in research design with a study from the neighbor country Sweden, was to compare the changes in gambling patterns in these countries. Here, the main finding was that although Danish respondents were somewhat more likely to be men, a known risk factor of problem gambling, Swedish respondents reported higher rates of moderate-risk/ problem gambling, and higher prevalence of increased gambling during COVID-19. In the sub-sample of gamblers specifically, a significant difference in the reporting of increased gambling was no longer seen between the countries.",

However, as in the previous similar studies carried out in Sweden (H\u00e5kansson, 2020a; H\u00e5kansson and Widinghoff, 2021) , the group reporting increased gambling during the pandemic had a very high rate of moderate-risk or problem gambling. While this proportion was not quite as high in Denmark as in the previous Swedish study, it was still demonstrated that almost half of respondents endorsing the item of gambling increase were at least moderate-risk gamblers. Also, for example, in a sample of US land-based casino gamblers, although only a minority increased their online gambling when land-based casinos closed, but the group who moved their gambling to online sources were reported to be a more vulnerable group (Xuereb et al., 2021) . The present study, again, confirms the picture that although the vast majority of the population do not changeand particularly do not increasetheir gambling, the group which does report an increase present a very high degree of vulnerability.",

The present study corroborates this perspective, although gambling severity was higher in 'increasers' than in 'decreasers', further pointing out that individuals reporting increased gambling during COVID-19 should be assessed for problem gambling and may need to receive attention from treatment providers and preventive initiatives. Thus, any health care facility or social support facility should react to a client who self-reports a perceived increase in gambling during the pandemic. Given the very high rates of people meeting structured screening tool criteria of problem gambling in this group, a further assessment and diagnostic interview may be warranted in these individuals, and referral to structured gambling-oriented addiction treatment should be considered.",

In the present study, time at home remained a significant correlate of increased gambling in the adjusted analyses, and alcohol consumption did not, whereas the opposite was seen in the Swedish study from April/May, 2020 (H\u00e5kansson, 2020a) . The second Swedish study, carried out in November, 2020, demonstrated the same associations of increased gambling as the present study, with both problem gambling, mental distress and increased alcohol consumption (although not with time spent at home, H\u00e5kansson and Widinghoff, 2021) . It is difficult to conclude that these differences are due to other factors than the statistical model and which variables were included there. Thus, in both settings, it appears that people reporting increased gambling during COVID-19 also have a degree of spending more time at home and influence on alcohol consumption. Again, the present study confirms that life-style changes are likely associated with the subgroup reporting to have changed their gambling behavior during the pandemic.",

However, within the sample of gamblers (all respondents who did not endorse being a non-gamblers both now and prior to the pandemic), women were significantly more likely to report an increase, and this association only marginally lost its statistical significance in the regression analysis. It has been shown previously that while men are typically over-represented among problem gamblers, female problem gamblers may display a higher degree of severity, and higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity, than male problem gamblers (H\u00e5kansson and Widinghoff, 2020a) . In a Scandinavian setting, in recent years, it has been shown that in highly online-based gambling markets, women's risk of endorsing problem gambling criteria may be comparable to that of men, in some contrast to what has been seen traditionally (H\u00e5kansson and Widinghoff, 2020b) . However, while female gender was associated with increased gambling in the present study, in the sub-sample of gamblers, the same was not seen in the corresponding Swedish study used for comparison (H\u00e5kansson and Widinghoff, 2021) . Thus, it cannot be excluded that women may present a higher risk of increasing their gambling habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this clearly requires further study and cannot be concluded from the documentation from the two countries discussed here.",

In contrast to Denmark, Sweden never applied formal lockdown procedures during COVID-19. Denmark applied lockdown procedures during the spring months of 2020, and thereby during a substantial part of the period of time studied here. Thereafter, new formal lockdown procedures were introduced approximately at the time of the present study, and thereby should not significantly impact the results of the study. However, although the COVID-19 restrictions to society have been more extensive in Denmark than in Sweden (Yarmol-Matusiak et al., 2021) , no large differences were seen in the rates of respondents reporting increased or decreased gambling. The percentage of respondents increasing their gambling was somewhat lower in the present Danish study, compared to the later Swedish study, but the difference reached statistical significance only in the full analysis, and not in the sub-sample of gamblers. Likewise, the percentage of respondents reporting decreased gambling was comparable to the corresponding figure in the second Swedish study. Altogether, despite different COVID-19 approach with respect to formal lockdown, substantial differences in self-reported gambling changes could not be seen. In both settings, high rates of online gambling are reported, and the Swedish data included a somewhat larger number of gamblers and a larger number of individuals with at least moderate-risk gambling. Although gambling opportunities were reduced during the early months of the pandemic, even for sports bettors online (due to the lockdown of sports worldwide), online gamblers generally have not seen their gambling opportunities substantially altered during the pandemic. The large role of online gambling in these settings may explain the relatively limited changes in gambling patterns seen during the pandemic.",

This may seem to be in some contrast to differences in COVID-19 restrictions, including the absence of formal lock-down procedures in Sweden (Yarmol-Matusiak et al., 2021) . These differences were seen both in the full sample and in the sub-sample of gamblers. Both these findings are difficult to fully explain from the present type of data. However, a Danish two-wave study demonstrated that from March to April, 2020, a decreasing viral transmission and a certain relief of restrictions were associated with a significant improvement in mental health in the Danish population (S\u20ac onderskov et al., 2020b) . As the present study, and the contrasting study from Sweden, were carried out in the late part of 2020, it is at least theoretically possible that the continued trends in virus transmission and high mortality may have affected mental health in the Swedish population. In Sweden, mortality rates remained substantially higher than in Denmark through 2020 (Yarmol-Matusiak et al., 2021) , which may potentially have an impact on perceived mental health. It also cannot be excluded that the perceptions of this prolonged crisis may have affected the high perceived impression of time spent at home in Sweden, although no data are available to confirm this.",

It shall be borne in mind that this finding does not imply a causal relationship between these factors. However, this finding may have the implication that treatment services and prevention and screening efforts should address potentially increasing gambling patterns among the health hazards potentially seen in patients with poor mental health, particularly during the pandemic. Likewise, the link between spending more time at home, and self-reported increase in gambling, needs to be addressed further. Social isolation, stay-at-home orders, home schooling and advice to work at home, are altogether factors which may increase gambling opportunities.

Also, the study is based on a web survey inviting people involved in a web panel of a market survey company, and therefore, it may reach individuals with a higher degree of online use and a higher degree of interest in online gambling than in the rest of the population. Thus, given the online collection of data, study findings cannot be generalized to any country in the world, such as countries with a more land-based gambling market. However, the study of associations within the study sample, as well as the comparison to one different country and with the same study methodology, can still provide important insights for the present type of gambling market. In addition, due to the need to keep an online survey brief, detailed data about gambling patterns, such as gambling frequency or money spent gambling, were not included in the study. Further, the study did not use any longitudinal measure of gambling, and should be repeated in the future, particularly in later phases of the pandemic.",
