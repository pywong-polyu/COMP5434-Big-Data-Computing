This has had an unprecedented impact on the delivery of cancer therapy across the globe, warranting all health care providers to reassess their services and management protocols, with CAR T-cell therapy being no exception [2] . Given the complexity of delivery of CAR T-cell therapy for haematological malignancies, including products being manufactured on a per-patient basis; treatment centres also providing cell procurement services; the need for transportation of leucapheresate and CAR-engineered product to and from manufacturing sites often across national borders; requirement for fixed manufacturing intervals; requirement for in-patient and/or ICU beds, we sought to define the impact of the pandemic on delivery of CAR T-cell therapies in Europe.",

This reporting interval effectively captures the impact of the first wave of the pandemic in Europe. For the purposes of the survey, partial lockdown was defined as restrictions allowing local/regional travel, phased re-opening of shops/restaurants/services and the complete lockdown was defined as leaving home only to attend essential jobs, buy food/medicine or attend hospital. In this survey, it was not our intention to determine the patient-related impact of COVID-19 infection, as this is the subject of investigation of the EBMT COVID-19 taskforce.",

The majority of centres (60%) were dealing with industry-sponsored studies whilst 33% were engaged in academic CAR T-cell studies. To assess CAR T therapy activity per centre as a baseline prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, centres reported the number of CAR T infusions delivered in 2019. The median number of CAR T-cell infusions carried out in these centres during 2019 was 8 (range 0-68), with the majority of centres (59%) carrying out 0-10 infusions.",

A histogram of the number of delayed patients in centres arranged by their pre-COVID-19 CAR T activity is shown in Fig. 1a . The expected number of CAR T patients treated during the pandemic by the time of survey reporting was calculated based on the pre-COVID-19 CAR T activity. From this, a normalised value for the delayed patients by expected 2020 centre activity was calculated (ratio of delayed to expected patients). This ratio is depicted alongside countryspecific total COVID-19 cases at the time the centre returned the survey (Fig. 1b) as well as by new COVID-19 cases per million ( Supplementary Fig. 3) .",

In 15/22 (68%) cases, the delay resulted in a need for additional therapy prior to CAR T-cell therapy and in 12/22 (55%) cases, was associated with disease progression (more than one outcome could be reported per patient, 22 patients with the reported impact of delay).

The number of patients expected to have been treated in 2020 up to the point of survey submission was calculated based on reported CAR T activity in 2019. For each centre, a ratio of delayed to the expected number of treated patients was calculated.
