Here, we report the development of a filter overcoming the major technical challenges of respiratory protective devices. Large-pore membranes, offering high breathability but low bacteria capture, were functionalized to have a uniform salt layer on the fibers. The salt-functionalized membranes achieved high filtration efficiency as opposed to the bare membrane, with differences of up to 48%, while maintaining high breathability (> 60% increase compared to commercial surgical masks even for the thickest salt filters tested). The salt-functionalized filters quickly killed Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria aerosols in vitro, with CFU reductions observed as early as within 5 min, and in vivo by causing structural damage due to salt recrystallization. The salt coatings retained the pathogen inactivation capability at harsh environmental conditions (37 \u00b0C and a relative humidity of 70%, 80% and 90%). Combination of these properties in one filter will lead to the production of an effective device, comprehensibly mitigating infection transmission globally.",

Due to long travelling distance and respirability of aerosols, airborne transmission can occur very easily 2 . As such, respiratory protection measures are essential first lines of defense in health care settings, congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities, military barracks, homeless shelters, refugee camps, dormitories, and nursing homes), households (including family members and caregivers), and in the event of pandemic or epidemic outbreaks. As the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific community highlight the urgency in stopping infectious diseases and preparing for the next disease outbreaks 3 , and new pandemic strains such as COVID-19 emerge, development of effective, readily available infection control measures is recognized as a primary challenge in health care.",

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), also transmissible through the air 11 , constitutes another major pathogen in nosocomial infections, causing 20% to above 80% of S. aureus nosocomial infections worldwide 10 . The most commonly used respiratory protective device in health care is the N95 respirator, which is designed to capture aerosols. Surgical masks, commonly used to block large droplets during surgeries, were historically utilized against bioaerosols. Surgical masks have seen a continued use for this purpose in the general public during more recent outbreaks, in spite of the improper application [12] [13] [14] [15] . This is due to their high availability, affordability and comfort. Although respirators and masks play a critical role in the protection against bioaerosols, they are limited by four major technical issues of the filters: (i) cross-infection, (ii) filtration efficiency, (iii) breathability, and (iv) recyclability 16 . When respirators/masks capture bioaerosols, they become contaminated, since pathogens survive on the surface of the filters. This presents a threat to the wearer and people they come in contact with. As the devices can easily become a source of infection, commercial respirators/masks are limited to a single use. Additionally, in the traditional technologies, it is well-known that increasing the filtration efficiency leads to filters that cause higher pressure drop across the masks, with consequent difficulty in breathing. Some efforts have been directed towards production of filters that can overcome the burden of decreased breathability 17, 18 . However, these methods cannot address the risks arising from the survival of pathogens captured on the filters.",

The mechanism we developed consists of functionalizing the polypropylene (PP) fibers of large-pore (~ 60 \u03bcm) membranes with salt. Large-pore membranes have high breathability compared to commercial respirators/masks, but no pathogen filtration activity. We hypothesized that the salt coating would: (i) increase the filtration efficiency of the breathable membranes, turning them into an active filtration unit, and (ii) inactivate bacteria. Our previous report showed that coating the filters of surgical masks with sodium chloride (NaCl) salt kills multiple strains of influenza virus; additionally, a significant increase in the filtration efficiency of viral aerosols on the NaCl-coated filters compared to the bare surgical mask filters was observed 19 . In this work, non-functional large-pore membranes were coated with three types of salt [NaCl, potassium sulfate (K 2 SO 4 ) and potassium chloride (KCl)]. We demonstrate that salt functionalization greatly increases the filtration efficiency of large-pore membranes, while at the same time exhibiting no significant increase in pressure drop. The proposed filtration mechanism is non-mechanical in nature, which is evidenced by the insensitivity of filtration efficiency with respect to increasing layer numbers and the high filtration efficiency of the top layer (the first layer interacting with aerosols) of salt-functionalized filters even with presence of large-pore fiber mesh. Additionally, the salt recrystallization upon exposure of the salt-functionalized filters to infectious aerosols caused the physical damage of the bacteria independent of strain (K. pneumoniae, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, S. pyogenes and E. coli), leading to their inactivation. As such, we report a diverse respiratory protection system that is manufactured without extensive engineering efforts, and achieves quick universal pathogen inactivation, high filtration efficiency, high breathability, and safe recyclability, all in one platform.",

Thus, when designing the salt-functionalized filters, fine-tuning of the properties of the pathogen-inactivating mask to satisfy different temperature/humidity conditions during use and storage was considered. To this end, safe and inexpensive salt types with different critical relative humidity (RH) were selected. At a given temperature, if a salt is exposed to an RH above its critical RH, it will take up water from the atmosphere. NaCl, KCl and K 2 SO 4 have critical RH of 74.7%, 81.2% and 95.7% at 40 \u00b0C, respectively 20 , and were investigated in this study. The salt coatings were applied onto the PP microfibers of large-pore membranes, which were not designed to provide protection against bacteria aerosols. The membranes (bare membranes) were dried in different volumes of coating solution (V salt ; NaCl, K 2 SO 4 or KCl), to produce filters coated with different amounts of salts per unit area (W salt ). The linear relationship between W salt and V salt for each salt type at different thicknesses can be found in Supplementary Fig. S1a -c (Pearson test, P values on graphs).",

The QF of NaCl, K 2 SO 4 and KCl filters increased by 107%, 26% and 103%, respectively, compared with bare membranes at 1-layer thickness, 16%, 23% and 57% for 3 layers and 23%, 66% and 51% for 5 layers. The increase in QF of the salt-functionalized filters compared to bare membranes indicates an overall enhancement in performance. It is also important to note that, in theory, the QF is independent of the filter thickness. However, NaCl and KCl filters show differences in QF at different thicknesses. This is related to the fact that the top layer constitutes the main capture medium responsible for increased filtration efficiency of the salt-coated filters compared to bare membranes, as mentioned. Overall, these performance test results indicate that functionalizing large-pore membranes with salts leads to a substantial increase of the amount of captured bacteria, without increasing the resistance to air flow, yielding improved filter quality.",

The pathogen inactivation on NaCl, K 2 SO 4 and KCl filters was investigated by exposing them to K. pneumoniae bacterial aerosols. Time-dependent inactivation of bacteria incubated on filters coated with all salt types was observed (General Linear Model, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2a) . In particular, the KCl-coated filters exhibited significant colony forming units (CFU) reduction compared to bare membranes even within 5 min from aerosol exposure (two-way ANOVA, P \u2264 0.0001). As shown in Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. S2a , in contrast to intact bacteria in the control and on bare membranes, bacteria recovered from the salt-coated filters were found to be severely damaged due to the salt growth during the evaporation process. This explains the destabilization of the bacteria measured by CFU. Furthermore, the effect of different amounts of NaCl coated on the filters on the stability of K. pneumoniae aerosols was investigated. NaCl-coated filters showed rapid time-dependent bacteria inactivation (General Linear Model, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2c) . Notably, NaCl \u00d7 3 1200 caused a 4 log CFU reduction within 30 min from aerosol exposure. The TEM analysis revealed the rapture, structural damage and morphological changes incurred by the bacteria due to the salt recrystallization ( Supplementary Fig. S2b ). Similarly, when K. pneumoniae aerosols were exposed to the K 2 SO 4 and KCl filters prepared to contain a lower amount of salt (K 2 SO 4 \u00d7 3 0 and KCl \u00d7 3 0 ), quick time-dependent CFU reduction was still measured (General Linear Model, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. S3a,b) . The bacteria inactivation on K 2 SO 4 \u00d7 3 0 and KCl \u00d7 3 0 was also confirmed in the TEM analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S3c ). In general, it is worth noting that the actual infectious aerosols will have significantly lower levels of bacterial concentration than the exposure aerosols used in the tests; as such, it is expected that further pathogen inactivation will be observed in real-life scenarios. Overall, the bacteria stability results indicate that the NaCl, K 2 SO 4 and KCl coatings rapidly neutralize bacteria by physical damage induced during the salt recrystallization process.",

Additionally, the in vivo response to K. pneumoniae was investigated after incubation on the NaCl \u00d7 3 0 and K 2 SO 4 \u00d7 3 0 for 5, 15 and 30 min. At day 2 post-infection, the salt filter groups exhibited a significantly lower body weight loss than the bacteria aerosol control group (two-way ANOVA, P \u2264 0.05), unlike the bare membrane group (Fig. 2h-j) . The lung OD 600 measurements further supported these results by showing significantly lower levels in NaCl \u00d7 3 0 and K 2 SO 4 \u00d7 3 0 mice groups than bare membrane groups (one-way ANOVA, P \u2264 0.0001) (Fig. 2k) . In general, a decrease in lung OD 600 was also observed with the increase in incubation time on the filters (General Linear Model, P < 0.001). Thus, these studies support the in vitro results, indicating that protection of the mice was obtained by the NaCl, K 2 SO 4 and KCl salt coatings due to inactivation of the aerosolized bacteria.",

The filters were stored at 37 \u00b0C and 70%, 80% and 90% RH for 5 days. The SEM analysis showed that all salt types remained coated on the surface of the filter fibers (Fig. 3e) . Additionally, the salt coatings showed morphological changes and increased roughness due to recrystallization at the conditions above the respective critical RH (i.e., at 80% and 90% RH for NaCl, and at 90% RH for KCl). The salt-functionalized filters retained their ability to inactivate K. pneumoniae (Fig. 3f) . Interestingly, the saltcoated filters showed a significant increase in inactivation properties after exposure to the humid environment, and no bacteria were detected from the filters after storage at 90% RH (t test, P values on graph). This phenomenon is due to the morphological change of the salt coatings after storage, leading to increased surface roughness which affects viability of bacteria 21 . Additionally, bare membranes showed the opposite trend, where the bacteria recovered from filters stored at higher RH levels yielded significantly higher CFU counts as compared to the ambient condition (t test, P values on graph). This is due to remaining humidity trapped in the membranes, protecting the bacteria. Altogether, these findings indicate that prolonged exposure of the salt-coated filters to harsh environmental conditions does not compromise the stability of the coating, while inducing further antimicrobial activity. Notably, two important conclusions come from these findings: (i) the salt-based coatings can be safely used at different environmental conditions of use and storage, and (ii) the salt-coated filters will remain highly effective against pathogens after exposure to the humidity levels generated while breathing, ensuring reusability of the filters.",

            "text": "In summary, we developed an antimicrobial respiratory protective system with high filtering performance and improved breathability levels compared to regular masks, based on the salt functionalization technology of largepore membranes. The filters coated with different salt types are able to capture more pathogens than the bare membranes, converting a non-functional system into an active respiratory protection unit. Since the infectious aerosols tested in this work have a small particle size (2.5-4 \u00b5m), high filtration efficiency can also be expected against bigger particles responsible for disease transmission through large droplets. Additionally, commercial mask filters are produced by melt-blowing; by converting the more inexpensive spunbond large-pore PP membranes into functional filters by salt coating and controlling the final mask design, the production cost of masks will be reduced. Simultaneously, the enhancement in filtration efficiency does not cause any decrease in the breathability of the large-pore membranes, which is not achievable by traditional technologies. Due to the natural salt recrystallization process physically neutralizing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria within a short time, the salt-coated filters offer broad-spectrum protection. This results in no risk of cross infection, safe reusability of the device without further processing, reduced amounts of biohazardous waste and no risk of shortage of respirators during outbreaks. Additionally, the salt coatings remained stable on the filters following prolonged exposure to high temperature and humidity. This offers complete protection at varying environmental conditions of use or storage as well as ensures the recyclability of the filters. Overall, the results indicate that our technology can be used to fabricate respiratory protective devices with high filtration and breathability performance, which achieve strain-nonspecific protective efficacy. Notably, the simple and cost-effective functionalization process with salt addresses all major technical challenges of respiratory protection devices in a single system and could be readily applied to other devices that are already in use, such as filters in buildings and hospitals. This comprehensive technology could lead to an enhanced and timely response to epidemics and pandemics, such as the case of COVID-19, and provides a safe and effective solution to prevent diseases globally.",

As the innermost mask membrane has higher porosity than the middle filter, it was selected for the study; by stacking different numbers of layers, the performance of the salt filter samples was controlled by varying the thickness. Circular samples (3-cm radius) of the mask innermost large-pore membrane were cut (bare membranes, labelled Bare \u00d7 # where # is the number of stacked layers). The membranes were coated with different salt types to obtain the salt-functionalized filters: sodium chloride (NaCl; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), potassium sulfate (K 2 SO 4 ; Sigma Aldrich), and potassium chloride (KCl; Sigma Aldrich). To prepare the coating solutions, the salts were dissolved in filtered (0.22 \u00b5m pore size; Corning, Tewksbury, MA, USA) DI water under stirring at 400 rpm and 90 \u00b0C for NaCl, and 400 rpm and room temperature (RT) for K 2 SO 4 and KCl (final salt concentrations: 29.03 w/v%, 9.72 w/v% and 26.31 w/v% for NaCl, K 2 SO 4 and KCl, respectively). Surfactant (Tween 20, Fisher Scientific) was added at 1 v/v%. The salt filters were prepared by completely pre-wetting the membrane samples with ~ 350 \u03bcL of a given coating solution (pre-wet membranes). The amount of coated salt was controlled by varying the volume of coating solution (0, 300, 600, or 1,200 \u00b5L) in which the pre-wet membranes were deposited in 60 \u00d7 15 mm petri dishes; more layers of pre-wet membrane samples were added on top based on the desired total number of layers (1, 3 or 5), and any air bubbles were carefully removed. The salt filter samples were dried overnight in an incubator (Thermolyne 42000; Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA, USA) at 45 \u00b0C. 24 . The detailed operation of the filtration efficiency test apparatus is in the Supplementary Methods. Briefly, the filter samples (4.9 cm 2 exposed area) were exposed to 60 \u00b5L of aerosolized (diameter = 2.5-4 \u03bcm) K. pneumoniae DI water suspension (OD 600 = 10), under an air flow rate of 0 or 15 Lpm. The bacteria were reconstituted from the filter samples as follows. The filter samples were incubated in PBS for 30 s-1 min. After vortexing, the filters were centrifuged (6,000 rpm, RT, 1 min) in a new tube to collect any remaining bacteria. The recovered bacteria were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 \u00b0C) to discard any salt/ surfactant dissolved from the filters, and then resuspended in 1.2 mL of fresh PBS, eliminating any interference with assays.",

The pore size of bare membranes and salt filters was determined from SEM images. TEM analysis (200 kV, JEOL JEM 2100; JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA) was performed on K. pneumoniae reconstituted after incubation on the bare membranes and salt-functionalized filters, as described above. The bacteria were deposited on copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and negatively stained with tungsten using a solution of 1.5 w/v% phosphotungstic acid hydrate (pH = 7.0) (Sigma Aldrich).",
