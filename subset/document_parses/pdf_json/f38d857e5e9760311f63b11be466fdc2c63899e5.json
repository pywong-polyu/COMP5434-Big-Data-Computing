The questionnaire package included the Hungarian version of the Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale, the Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire, as well as the Dissociation Questionnaire. 717 participants were recruited online, 106 of whom were problematic daydreamers. The results revealed that certain types of childhood trauma occurred significantly more frequently in the group of maladaptive daydreamers. Furthermore, maladaptive daydreamers possessed a significantly higher level of dissociative propensity compared to normal daydreamers. The estimated SEM models showed that dissociative experiences -more precisely Identity confusion and fragmentation and Lack of controlmediated the relationship between certain childhood traumatic experiences and maladaptive daydreaming. The results suggest that we should consider childhood traumatization and increased dissociative propensity as potentially significant factors in the etiology of maladaptive daydreaming.",

Maladaptive daydreaming is a proposed mental disorder characterised by intense yearning for being absorbed in vivid, detailed and eventful fantasiesoften triggered or maintained by kinaesthetic activities and music (Soffer-Dudek et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Despite the severe negative consequences, the mental activity of maladaptive daydreaming can also play some subjectively rewarding roles in the daydreamers' life and can function as self-entertainment, distraction from boredom and painful experiences and as a compensatory or wish fulfilment strategy (Somer, 2002; Somer et al., 2020b) . Although there are some seemingly beneficial characteristics, maladaptive daydreaming cannot be considered an effective emotion regulation strategy (S\u00e1ndor et al., 2021; Somer et al., 2020b; . Previous studies explored that poorer emotion regulation ability was related to a higher degree of maladaptive daydreaming symptoms (Greene et al., 2020) , and maladaptive and immersive components of the phenomenon were associated with poorer emotion regulation. These findings revealed that none of the forms of immersive daydreaming functions as an effective emotion regulation strategy . Further results showed that probable maladaptive daydreamers seemed to be less aware of their emotions, negative emotions might be overwhelming for them, and they also had difficulties with coping with these emotions and controlling their impulses (S\u00e1ndor et al., 2021) . Furthermore, individuals with probable maladaptive daydreaming, in response to self-isolation and quarantine (due to the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions), experienced more intensified and vivid fantasies, a stronger need to daydream and a higher level of psychological distress related to the pandemic: compared to the period before lockdown, these individuals reported more concentration problems, more worries about the future, boredom, loneliness, depression, social anxiety, more obsessions and compulsions, lower satisfaction with life, and decreased self-worth (Somer et al., 2020b) . The conclusion of the study was that although maladaptive daydreaming originally could be a normal mental activity with entertaining and coping functions, the presence of major stressors might impair the psychosocial functionality (Somer et al., 2020b) . Somer et al. (2016a) developed the model of maladaptive daydreaming by describing the possible antecedents, features and maintaining factors, and the consequences of this excessive mental activity. According to the model, maladaptive daydreamers possess an innate capacity for vivid fantasy, and they tend to discover the rewarding characteristics of daydreaming in the early years of life. For many maladaptive daydreamers, the inner fantasy world functions as a source of security, calm and joy. These daydreamers often experience loneliness, lack of attention, friendlessness, and rejection in their childhood, which is in line with the results of the pioneering study of Somer (2002) . The innate capacity for vivid fantasy, however, cannot lead to maladaptive daydreaming in itself, but other circumstances are required. The normal form of daydreaming develops into maladaptive when the inner absorption becomes irresistible and time consuming, the individual loses control over this mental behaviour, and therefore experiences severe distress and functional impairment (Somer, 2002; Somer et al., 2016a) . Maladaptive daydreamers in the study (Somer et al., 2016a) describe the intense yearning for daydreaming as an addiction. It should be noted that the inborn capacity for daydreaming and the yearning for the rewarding experience of fantasizing further distance the individual from real life interactions resulting in a complex and circular interaction between the capacity for daydreaming and social isolation. The tendency to build a compensatory inner world and to avoid the painful reality seems to be even more significant among those individuals who were exposed to childhood abuse and/or neglect, or who were living in a dysfunctional family. For these individuals, daydreaming compensates for real life deficits and reduces stress and anxiety (Somer et al., 2016a) . This result highlights the two main functions of maladaptive daydreaming previously described by Somer (2002, p.197) , i.e. disengagement from stress and pain by mood enhancement and wish fulfillment fantasies, and companionship, intimacy, and soothing. For maladaptive daydreamers without a history of trauma, excessive fantasy activity provides pleasure and functions as a source of creativity (Somer et al., 2016a) , which is consistent with Bigelsen and Schupak (2011) findings. Other factors which might be relevant in the maintenance of maladaptive daydreaming are the following: intense fear of being discovered; shame of being misunderstood; refusal to talk about daydreaming in therapy (Somer et al., 2016a) , which results confirm the previous findings of Somer (2002) . The tendency to hide their secretive behaviour from relatives and friends deprives maladaptive daydreamers from social support, and further increases the level of loneliness and distress. Moreover, when maladaptive daydreamers attempt to seek for professional help, they do not receive effective treatment due to the unfamiliarity of mental health professionals with the phenomenon and to the therapeutic approaches based on misdiagnosis (Somer, 2002; Somer et al., 2016a) .",

            "text": "International studies have revealed controversial findings regarding the relationship between childhood trauma and maladaptive daydreaming Bigelsen & Schupak, 2011; Bigelsen et al., 2016; S\u00e1ndor et al., 2020; Somer, 2002; Somer et al., 2020a; Somer et al., 2019a; Somer & Herscu, 2017; Somer et al., 2016a) . In his seminal paper, Somer (2002) described six patients with trauma history. In these participants' cases, daydreaming started during childhood and functioned as a form of coping with trauma by distancing the individuals from adverse experiences. In a subsequent study, Somer and his colleagues (Somer et al., 2016a) confirmed that vivid fantasy activity might facilitate coping with adverse family circumstances in childhood. Participants in the study reported a stronger need to escape to the fantasy world if they had experienced traumatic childhood events or feelings of loneliness and isolation. In their model, authors described the hypothesis of a trauma origin for maladaptive daydreaming; however, they also concluded that pathological daydreaming could develop without the individual having struggled with childhood trauma (Somer et al., 2016a) . In 2016, using a large sample (N = 447) Bigelsen and her colleagues found no significant difference between the groups of maladaptive daydreamers and controls regarding childhood traumatization. However, the authors did not exclude the possibility that severe traumatization could increase survivors' motivation to escape into their inner world. Somer and Herscu (2017) concluded that childhood trauma was one of the potential pathways to maladaptive daydreaming, but absorption and fantasy addiction were essential conditions for the connection between childhood traumatization and pathological daydreaming. In a recent study, Somer et al. (2019a) explored the idea that patients who recovered from substance use disorder were more likely to report a history of childhood trauma, particularly emotional neglect, as well as dissociative experiences and pathological daydreaming, compared to controls. Their findings showed that the propensity for extreme daydreaming partially mediated the relationship between childhood neglect and later dissociative mechanisms. Recent research (Abu-Rayya et al., 2020) on maladaptive daydreaming examined women who were exposed to sexual abuse in their childhood; these women showed a significantly higher level of maladaptive daydreaming compared to the control group. This study confirmed the original hypothesis (Somer, 2002) that childhood traumatization might increase the risk of abnormal daydreaming, which may function as a coping strategy to deal with inescapable adverse circumstances.",

            "text": "Regarding the relationship between dissociative mechanisms and maladaptive daydreaming, seven international papers have been published (Bigelsen et al., 2016; Ferrante et al., 2020; Soffer-Dudek & Somer, 2018; Somer & Herscu, 2017; Somer et al., 2016c; Somer et al., 2017a; Somer et al., 2019b) , and to the best of our knowledge, no scientific study has investigated this connection in Hungary. Previous studies found a significant connection between maladaptive daydreaming and specific dissociative phenomena. The statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the scores of the 14-item Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale (MDS-14; Somer et al., 2016c) and the overall score of Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES, Bernstein & Putnam, 1986 cited in Somer et al., 2016c , as well as the Depersonalization, Amnesia and Absorption subscales. However, the strongest relationship was found with the Absorption subscale: excessive daydreamers were characterised by an intensive absorptive propensity to immerse themselves in their external and internal experiences (Bigelsen et al., 2016; Somer et al., 2016c) . Somer and Herscu (2017) confirmed the above-mentioned findings, disclosing a significant relationship between maladaptive daydreaming and absorption measured by the Tellegen Absorption Scale (Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974) . The authors suggested that absorption in fantasy, as well as fantasy addiction (fantasy dependence) mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and pathological daydreaming. Another study investigating the comorbidity between maladaptive daydreaming and other disorders, revealed that 12.8% of maladaptive daydreamers (n = 39) met the criteria for a dissociative disorder (Somer et al., 2017a) . In terms of prevalence data, a research (Waller & Ross, 1997 ) estimated a prevalence of 3.3% of pathological dissociation in the general population of North America. European research (Spitzer et al., 2006) reported frequency rates of pathological dissociation between 0.3% and 1.8% in non-clinical samples, 5.4% in psychiatric inpatients, 4.8% in eating disordered patients, and 2.2% in psychosomatic outpatients. Based on the review article of Sar (2011) , the prevalence of dissociative disorders in inpatient units varies between 4.3% and 40.8%, while in outpatient units this percentage varies between 12% and 29% (see Table 1 on p.2 in Sar, 2011) . In nonclinical settings, the prevalence of dissociative disorders is between 1.7% and 18.3% (see Table 2 on p. 3 in Sar, 2011) . The large variance is influenced by the fact that the findings involved in the review were obtained in diverse countries with applying samples of varying sizes, and with the use of different diagnostic or screening instruments. The author suggests that the lifetime prevalence of dissociative disorders seems to be around 10% in the community and in clinical populations (Sar, 2011) .",

One possible categorization of maladaptive daydreaming suggested that it might be a disorder of dissociative absorption. According to Somer, maladaptive daydreaming has dissociative properties, mainly characterized by a propensity for absorption. Maladaptive daydreaming is characterized by \"compulsive detrimental absorption in fanciful fantasy\" (Somer et al., 2019a, p.207) . However, the characteristics of maladaptive daydreaming also showed similarities with behavioural addiction and compulsive disorders; in some cases, this problematic daydreaming activity evolves into dependence which can be described as a compulsion to daydream causing significant time loss and severe distress (Somer et al., 2019a) . This fantasy activity is so rewarding that it causes a yearning for daydreaming, a loss of control over fantasizing, and a significant wasting of time, and also interferes with interpersonal, academic and professional functioning, as well as leading to significant distress, social withdrawal, and shame (Bigelsen & Schupak, 2011; Pietkiewicz et al., 2018; Somer, 2002; Somer, 2018) . According to a study (Somer et al., 2017a) , 53.9% of maladaptive daydreamers (N = 39) met the criteria for an obsessive-compulsive or related disorder, but this rate was not as high as the rate of comorbidity for other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 76.9%), anxiety disorder (71.8%) or depressive disorder (66.7%). In a recent study, Salomon-Small and her colleagues (Salomon-Small et al., 2021) explored the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming and obsessive-compulsive spectrum symptoms (OCSS) and the potential factors mediating the relationship between these constructs. The results revealed that maladaptive daydreaming and OCSS were significantly correlated and the association between maladaptive daydreaming and OCSS was mediated by dissociation and impaired sense of control. According to their findings maladaptive daydreaming was moderately related to obsessions and compulsions (but showed stronger relations to obsessions). These results suggested that impaired control and intrusiveness of thoughts and mental experiences might underly the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming and OCSS.",

The researchers suggested that, based on the respondents' description, the inattention of maladaptive daydreamers was caused by their highly absorptive fantasy activity -distracting the individuals from the external world interactions and tasks -, rather than by attention disorder (Somer et al., 2017a) . The authors concluded that maladaptive daydreaming can be differentiated from normal daydreaming (in terms of content, quantity, subjective experience, degree of control over daydreaming, and interference with functioning), showing high levels of comorbidity, but cannot be explained by other existing disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (Somer et al., 2019a; Somer et al., 2017a) .",

To the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming, adverse childhood experiences and dissociation in Hungary. Based on the literature of maladaptive daydreaming the aim of the present study was threefold. The first objective was to clarify the connection between maladaptive daydreaming and childhood trauma: to explore the potential role of childhood trauma in the etiology of pathological daydreaming, and to reveal which type of trauma could function as a risk factor for excessive daydreaming. The present study explored childhood traumatic experiences in two developmental periods: 0-6 years and 7-12 years. As the impact of traumatic experiences on the individual's psychiatric vulnerability and the brain development are influenced by the age when the trauma has been experienced, it seems necessary to explore, apart from the severity of trauma, the age when the traumatic event occurred (Park et al., 2020) . Research on maladaptive daydreaming explored that maladaptive daydreamers have an innate capacity for vivid fantasy which might become an addictive mental activity in response to the exposure to childhood neglect, abuse, household dysfunctions or social isolation (Somer et al., 2016a) . Later study revealed that childhood trauma is one of the potential pathways leading to the phenomenon (Somer & Herscu, 2017) . It seems necessary to understand in which developmental period the trauma has affected the child in a way to develop a maladaptive daydreaming activity.",

The next step of the analysis aimed to reveal the direct and indirect relationships between the variables (childhood trauma, dissociation, and maladaptive daydreaming) with Structural Equation Modeling. The Structural Equation Model (SEM) requires the multivariate normality of indicators. As the indicators of the present study violated the assumption of univariate normality, and altogether violated the multivariate normality assumption as well, the SEM was built applying the Asymptotically Distribution-Free (ADF) estimation method. This approach does not require univariate and multivariate normality and is often used as an alternative when data are non-normal (Ory & Mokhtarian, 2010) . If latent variables are not normally distributed, ADF might produce more efficient estimates than ML (Maximum Likelihood) or QML (Quasimaximum Likelihood) (STATA, 2017). We relied on the following fit indices to justify the acceptability of the model: CFI scores and TLI scores above 0.9 indicate acceptable fit (Marsh et al., 2004) , RMSEA values below 0.08 and SRMR scores below 0.10 indicate acceptable fit (Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003) .",

A remarkable finding of the study is that the majority of maladaptive daydreamers (55.66%) seemed to have single relationship status compared to the normal daydreamer group, where this rate was 34.21%. Another interesting result is that among maladaptive daydreamers the secondary education level was dominant (63.21%), whereas normal daydreamers seemed to have similar proportions of secondary (51.97%) and tertiary education (48.03%).

The median, Interquartile range (IQR) and p value of the study groups for each dissociative subscale are shown in Table 4 . ",

Our research provides evidence supporting previous findings suggesting the importance of traumatic experiences in the etiology of problematic daydreaming Somer, 2002; Somer et al., 2019a; Somer & Herscu, Somer et al., 2016a) . The results of the Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire indicated that, as regards the first developmental period (0-6 years), seven of the eight trauma types were significantly more prevalent among maladaptive daydreamers compared to normal daydreamers (except for Alcohol and drugs). A significant difference was found on the Neglect subscale suggesting that maladaptive daydreamers experienced more frequent and/or more severe neglect (such as lack of care; negligence; neglect because of familial problems). A significant difference on the subscale of Separation indicates that maladaptive daydreamers reported significantly more severe and/or more frequent separation experiences: separation from or divorce of parents; living with different people at different times; death or hospitalization of a significant person. A strong significant difference on the Emotional abuse subscale suggests that maladaptive daydreamers, compared to normal daydreamers, suffered from more intense emotional adversities, uncomfortable experiences, insults, inconsistent family rules and unfair punishments during early childhood. Study groups differed significantly regarding Physical abuse, as problematic daydreamers reported more frequent and/or more severe violent experiences (such as attacks, punches, or potential danger of physical injury or death). Maladaptive daydreamers also reported more frequent and/or more severe experiences of Sexual abuse during their early childhood, as they experienced more severe sexual harassments or sexual intercourse against their will, compared to normal daydreamers. The findings regarding the Witnessing subscale showed that maladaptive daydreamers, during their first six years, were more likely to witness physical violence, parental fights and out of control behaviours, events 1 Path diagram presenting the significant associations between childhood trauma (0-6 years), dissociative experiences, and maladaptive daydreaming or scenes of a sexual nature, or even dead bodies. Maladaptive daydreamers scored significantly higher on the subscale of Other traumas; they were more likely to experience early childhood experiences such as hospitalization, a serious accident, a natural disaster or something terrible which remained a mystery to them. In the second developmental phase (7-12 years) maladaptive daydreamers continued to experience significantly more frequent and/or more severe traumas, again except for Alcohol and Drugs in the family. Our findings suggest that maladaptive daydreamers, during their school years, experienced more frequent and/or more severe neglect; furthermore, compared to normal daydreamers, maladaptive daydreamers tended to suffer to a greater degree from severe separation, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and to be more likely to be witnesses, or to experience other types of trauma. The findings related to the second developmental period revealed the same tendency as in the first period.",

These findings were supported by the significant results on every 2 Path diagram presenting the significant associations between childhood trauma (7-12 years), dissociative experiences, and maladaptive daydreaming subscale of the Hungarian version of the Dissociation Questionnaire. The present study highlighted that the dissociative propensity is typical of maladaptive daydreamers, as maladaptive daydreamers reported a significantly higher overall DISQ-H score (median: 2.4) than normal fantasizers (median: 1.57). Maladaptive daydreamers scored significantly higher on each subscale of dissociative experiences compared to normal daydreamers. The findings related to the subscale of Identity confusion and fragmentation suggest that excessive daydreamers are more prone to experience depersonalization, derealization, and alternation of dissociated alter personalities without conscious control. Moreover, our results explored the idea that in our sample problematic daydreamers seemed to be less able to control their behaviours, emotions and thoughts, suggesting that their self-agency might be impaired. Individuals who score significantly higher on the scale of Loss of control also seem to be more prone to impulsivity (Vanderlinden et al., 1993) . Maladaptive daydreamers, based on our results, also struggle with Amnesia, indicating that they have a lower level of ability to recall past events, and their past acts. Although the difference between the two groups on the subscale of Absorption was significant, the degree of significance was lower compared to the other three subscales. This finding suggests that maladaptive daydreamers experience increased awareness of their acts (such as eating, walking), a selfmonitoring tendency, as well as a vivid evocation of the past as if it were the present. These results confirmed previous research findings (Bigelsen et al., 2016; Somer & Herscu, 2017) , as maladaptive daydreamers in our sample were also more prone to absorption, i.e. to total attentional involvement.",

Our findings showed that, regarding the first developmental period, Emotional abuse significantly influenced dissociative experiences, i.e. Identity confusion and fragmentation and Loss of control, which significantly affected the phenomenon of maladaptive daydreaming. This result confirmed the findings of Somer and Herscu (2017) , who provided evidence for the role of mediators (absorption and fantasy addiction) between trauma and problematic daydreaming. The results of the present study support the findings of Ferrante and her colleagues (2020), who revealed the mediating role of dissociation and shame between emotional trauma and maladaptive daydreaming. However, in our SEM model, only Identity confusion and fragmentation, and Loss of control exerted a direct effect on maladaptive daydreaming. Identity confusion and fragmentation was significantly influenced by emotional abuse. This suggests that emotional adversities, insults, inconsistent family rules, unfair treatment of the child, unachievable parental expectations and the consequential constant sense of failure might lead to depersonalization, derealization, and also to the presence of dissociated alter-personalities, which might turn the attention away from the external world towards the internal fantasy world, strengthening the tendency for excessive daydreaming. Loss of control seemed to be an influential factor in problematic daydreaming, also determined by the effect of emotional abuse. Our findings showed that the self-agency of the child, and the sense of control over behaviour, emotions and thoughts might be impaired by the intense emotional adversity of the child, and by the uncertainty and unpredictability of the childhood environment. Maladaptive daydreamers might find their sense of control in their internal world.",

During school years, apart from emotional abuse, traumatic experiences such as neglect, and other forms of trauma also might function as risk factors for dissociative experiences, which might directly influence the development of maladaptive daydreaming. Childhood maltreatment causes severe public health problems and a serious social-welfare problem in high-income countries, as every year 4-16% of children are physically abused and up to one in ten is neglected or psychologically abused. Five to 10 % of girls and up to 5% of boys experience contact sexual abuse during their childhood and the number who are exposed to some type of sexual abuse is up to three times higher (Gilbert et al., 2009) . The early years of life are particularly important for the development of cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical abilities. Children show increased vulnerability to traumatic events, as substantial proportion of trauma experienced in childhood affects children under the age of 7 years: in the United States in 2008, more than 50% of children who were victims of abuse or neglect were between the ages of 0 and 7 years. As infants are not able to express their emotions verbally, the traumatic experience tends to affect the child's behaviour: agitation, eating and sleeping disturbances may occur as a consequence. Preschoolers already have more tools to express their feelings, however, as they are characterized by egocentric thinking, they often attribute the cause of the events to themselves (Perlman & Doyle, 2012) .",

More specifically, child maltreatment is one of the causes of child morbidity and mortality, and has long-lasting consequences such as mental and physical health issues, alcohol and drug misuse, obesity, chronic diseases and health-risk behaviours (Gilbert et al., 2009) . The academic literature indicates that emotional abuse has severe negative effects on children's mental health (Norman et al., 2012) . Norman et al.

            "text": "It can be presumed that individuals screened as maladaptive daydreamers were exposed to a significantly higher level of emotional abuse and other severely traumatic experiences during childhood compared to normal fantasizers. These early experiences might affect the developmental process of a coherent identity and the sense of control and self-agency. Those individuals who have an intense capacity for immersive daydreaming might use the fantasy world in a way to cope with the external and internal insecurities (Somer & Herscu, 2017) . Previous studies explored that the coping strategy of finding shelter in the internal world initiates in childhood (Ferrante et al., 2020; Somer et al., 2016a) . Ferrante and her colleagues (2020) also revealed that emotional trauma, although is not an essential condition for the development of maladaptive daydreaming, plays an important role in the severity of the phenomenon. Childhood emotional abuse and neglect form one of the potential pathways leading to maladaptive daydreaming, as \"the child might excessively recur to dissociation\" to cope with the adverse experiences, which might promote the absorption activity and impair the integration of mental experiences (Ferrante et al., 2020, p.9) . Childhood trauma seems to be a potential predictor of maladaptive daydreaming if other risk factors are also present (such as dissociation, shame) (Ferrante et al., 2020) . However, it also has to be mentioned that different developmental pathways might lead to maladaptive daydreaming. A substantial proportion of maladaptive daydreamers report no childhood traumatic experiences, but use their inborn capacity for daydreaming as a source of joy and creativity (Bigelsen & Schupak, 2011; Somer et al., 2016a) . The pleasure found in the inner world itself -which has a rewarding and reinforcing impact -cannot fully explain the development and maintenance of problematic daydreaming. Researchers suggest that the addictive and compulsive nature of maladaptive daydreaming, the intense yearning for this mental activity and the impaired control over daydreaming might be key factors in understanding the phenomenon (Somer et al., 2016a) . In clinical practice it might be important to explore the specific factors that preceed and maintain the phenomenon of maladaptive daydreaming (Ferrante et al., 2020) . Results of the present study highlight the importance of exploring potential childhood traumatic experiences, especially the role of emotional abuse during the first 12 years of life, and the potential mediating role of dissociation in the etiology and maintenance of maladaptive daydreaming.",

A recent study (Soffer-Dudek et al., 2020) explored that those items of the MDS-16, which assess the urge to daydream and the extent to which this fantasy activity may be comforting, might have different meanings in different cultures. This finding might be explained by the fact that there are individual and cultural differences regarding the attitude toward daydreaming: in some cultures, this mental activity can be considered as a leisure activity, while in another culture daydreaming can be treated as a shameful aspect of life which should be hidden from other people. However, other aspects of maladaptive daydreaming (i.e. Impairment, Kinesthesia and Music) seemed to be invariant on a metric level, thus, these constructs are comprehended in the same way by the individuals across different cultures. To estimate the prevalence of maladaptive daydreaming and its cross-cultural invariance, representative studies in different countries should be carried out (Soffer-Dudek et al., 2020) .",

The findings on the Dissociation Scale showed unequivocally that problematic daydreamers experienced significantly more dissociative experiences, involving the experience of identity alteration, loss of control over behaviours, emotions and thoughts, amnesiac symptoms and intense absorptive experiences. The present study also provided evidence that during early and later childhood suffering from trauma, particularly emotional abuse, might cause severe dissociative symptoms, which may directly lead to the development of maladaptive daydreaming.",
