Methods: We searched PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1994 and July 2020. We included RCTs with greater than 90% of participants free of CVD. Two reviewers independently screened the articles using the Covidence software, assessed the methodological quality using the risk of bias 2 tool, and analyzed the data using the RevMan 5.4 software. Results: Eleven trials were included. Statin therapy was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (RR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.67), major cerebrovascular events (RR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.96), major coronary events (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.80), composite cardiovascular outcome (RR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.82), revascularizations (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.74), angina (RR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92) and hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (RR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.86). There was no benefit associated with statin therapy for cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart disease mortality. All-cause mortality benefit with statin therapy was seen in the population with diabetes and increased risk of CVD. Statin therapy was associated with no significant increased risk of myalgia, creatine kinase elevation, rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, incidence of any cancer, incidence of diabetes, withdrawal of the drug due to adverse events, serious adverse events, fatal cancer, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Conclusion: Statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and procedures without increased risk of harm in populations with mean LDL-C nearoptimal to the borderline high range without prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. : medRxiv preprint statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, even though the population has mean LDL-C in the near-optimal to borderline high range.",

Of these, the average cholesterol level of a particular population is a very important factor that determines the ASCVD risk of that population [1] . Previous prospective observational studies revealed that the relationship between serum cholesterol and CHD is a continuously graded one rather than just a threshold one and the risk gradient to be continuous over the whole range of cholesterol concentrations [3] . A study done in Shanghai, China suggested that cholesterol is still an important cause of CHD, where the mean baseline serum cholesterol concentration is considered a normal or low concentration by Western Standards [4] . A study conducted in India revealed that low serum cholesterol has a strong positive relationship with coronary artery disease. It did not show any evidence of a threshold. It concluded that there might be a benefit if serum cholesterol is decreased below the range of what is considered desired in developed nations [5] . Hence, it is essential to study the effect of cholesterol-lowering on cardiovascular prevention in populations with low mean cholesterol.",

LDL-C is responsible for the development and progression of atheroma and plaque, which upon rupture results in catastrophic cardiovascular events (CVEs) [1] . Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce LDL-C concentration by decreasing its synthesis in the liver and increasing its removal from the circulation [6] . There is clear cut evidence of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular events (CVEs) or mortality in those who had prior CVD and those with high cholesterol but without prior CVD. In these populations, the benefits could be well explained by the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins as well as a group of \"cholesterol-independent\" or \"pleiotropic \"effects, which includes improvement in the functioning of endothelial cells, increased stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation [7] . However, there is limited evidence of the role of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the population with average cholesterol in the near-optimal (LDL-C: 100 to 129 mg/dl) to borderline high (LDL-C: 130 to 159 mg/dl) range.",

Statistical analysis was done using the RevMan 5.4 software. We used the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method to measure the effect size. We used the fixed/random-effects model for the pooling of studies as per the heterogeneity. We assessed the heterogeneity using the I-squared (I 2 ) test and used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for interpretation of I-squared (I 2 ) test as follows: \"0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.\" When significant heterogeneity was present, we explored the reasons by analyzing the clinical characteristics of participants, study design, and interventions of the included RCTs. We also tried to explain the heterogeneity in the outcomes by performing sensitivity analysis wherever possible. We did an additional sensitivity analysis to determine the influence on the effect size of the outcomes based on the following criteria: (i) repeating the analysis separately for the population with mean LDL-C in the near-optimal and borderline high range; (ii) repeating the analysis separately for trials with participants > 3000 and < 3000; (iii) repeating the analysis separately for trials with adequate and inadequate randomization; (iv) repeating the analysis separately for trials with blinded and unblinded participants; (v) repeating the analysis separately for trials with average follow-up > 3.5 years and < 3.5 years. We checked for publication bias by drawing a funnel plot for the outcomes that included ten or more RCTs. We visually examined any asymmetry of the funnel plot.",

We used the Covidence software for title, abstract, and full-text screening. The values of proportionate agreement for the title, abstract, and full-text screening were 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. We obtained the full text of 916 articles and checked their eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the protocol. We excluded 905 articles that could not fit in our eligibility criteria, and finally, 11 RCTs were included for both qualitative and quantitative analyzes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

We included acute coronary events in the composite outcome for CARDS [13] , as the trial reported a subgroup analysis based on age for this outcome. Eleven trials [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] with 58504 participants reported a composite cardiovascular outcome. Significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 55%) was seen in this outcome, so sensitivity analysis was done for this outcome.

Meta-analyses of statin trials have shown benefits for mortality, cardiovascular diseases, and procedures [22, 23] . Existing guidelines adapted to the evidence from the included trials and recommended statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, not limiting statins as a lipid-lowering agent [24] . Primary prevention trials and meta-analyses provide evidence in favor of statins [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, existing meta-analyses included trials where greater than 10% of the population had cardiovascular disease or subclinical atherosclerosis or had a baseline mean LDL-C from near-optimal to high levels [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . A meta-analysis that included both primary and secondary prevention trials showed that total and cardiovascular mortality benefit in baseline LDL-C greater than 100 mg/dl [22] . A knowledge gap exists on the primary preventive role of statins in populations with baseline average LDL-C in near-optimal to borderline high range. We included a new trial [16] to find up-to-date evidence; analyzed trials where near all populations are free from prior cardiovascular diseases; and with a mean of baseline LDL-C less than 160, among which, two trials and a subgroup of a trial included all participants with LDL-C less than/equal to 160 mg/dl.",

Our findings are consistent with other meta-analyses, except for Chen et al. [25] , who did not find statin therapy to reduce coronary revascularizations. Statin therapy did not reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and CHD mortality. Only the JUPITER trial [18] found a significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality. Other meta-analyses had inconsistent evidence regarding all-cause mortality; Chou et al. [26] , Brugts et al. [30] , and Taylor et al. [28] reported in favor of statin therapy, whereas Chen et al. [25] , Thavendiranathan et al. [29] , and Li et al. [27] reported no significant effect. Chou et al. [26] and Thavendiranathan et al. [29] found statins reduced cardiovascular mortality, but Li et al. [27] found inconsistent evidence, where the significant reduction seen in the fixed-effect analysis was lost in random-effects analysis. We suggest no benefit of statin therapy on reducing cardiovascular mortality in a population with baseline average LDL-C in near-optimal to borderline high range, which is consistent with nine trials that reported the outcome. Statins did not reduce CHD mortality, which is supported by six trials that reported the outcome and meta-analysis by Thavendiranathan et al. [29] and Li et al. [27] .",

            "text": "In the sensitivity analysis, statin therapy remained consistent in reducing composite cardiovascular outcomes and myocardial infarction irrespective of participant's number, quality of trials (randomization or blinding), baseline mean LDL-C, and duration of statin therapy. However, no. of participants was determining for few outcomes like major cerebrovascular events, revascularizations, and angina, where trials with less than 3000 participants did not show any benefit, which remained consistent in pooled estimates of those trials. Quality of trials was important for few outcomes because trials with moderate quality (unclear randomization and unblinding) could not demonstrate a reduction in major cerebrovascular events, major coronary events, and angina, but our pooled estimate showed clear benefit. Shorter trials (less than 3.5 years) failed to demonstrate the benefit of statins in major cerebrovascular events, major coronary events, and angina, but our pooled estimate showed a clear benefit. However, the benefits evident in reducing all-cause mortality in larger trials (> 3000 participants) and good quality (blinding) questions our pooled estimate that did not find a benefit. The JUPITER [18] , a successful primary prevention trial, and meta-analyses by Chou et al. [26] , Brugts et al. [30] , and Taylor et al. [28] also oppose our findings and provide evidence of all-cause mortality reduction. Thus, the benefit of statins in reducing all-cause mortality remains inconsistent and warrants larger (> 3000) and high-quality trials to find better evidence. CHD mortality reduction was shown in the ALLHAT-LLT trial [15] and MEGA trial [17] , but both trials were unblinded, so the benefit is still questionable because our meta-analysis did not find it to be true.",

Thus, all-cause mortality reduction is evident with statin therapy in the diabetic population. As opposed to our findings, the benefit of composite cardiovascular outcome was not seen in the diabetic population, but significant heterogeneity was present, making the finding questionable. The lack of benefit of revascularizations and angina in the diabetic population could be due to only CARDS [13], contributing to the finding, which lacked power because of only 2838 participants with 58 and 16 events in revascularizations and angina, respectively; our pooled estimate of trials with participants below 3000 also could not find significance in revascularization and angina reduction. The benefit of statin therapy in reducing MI evident in our meta-analysis is consistent in the diabetic population, which is considered a clear ASCVD risk factor by current guidelines (3). The benefit of reducing CHD mortality in the diabetic population opposed our findings and showed that statin has a benefit in CHD mortality in the diabetic population.",

An additional benefit of all-cause mortality is present in this population as opposed to our findings of the overall analysis. The loss of angina benefit is probably due to the CARDS trial [13] having less than 3000 population and JUPITER trial [18] having < 3.5-year follow-up, which is consistent with our analysis of angina being affected by participant number in trials (below 3000) and study duration (less than 3.5 years). People of south Asian ancestry is already acknowledged as an ASCVD risk enhancer, and we found the benefit of statin therapy in participants with baseline LDL-C \u2264 160 mg/dl. The current guidelines recommend statin therapy after assessment of 10-year ASCVD risk in the south Asian ethnic group with LDL-C \u2265 70 mg/dl and < 190 mg/dl. The recommendation needs consideration for this ethnic group because the population in South-Asian regions has mean cholesterol lower than western standards [5], so they might be deprived of the benefits of statins, considering the evidence of the cardiovascular benefit of statins in the LDL-C range 100 to 159 mg/dl in our meta-analysis.",

Hence, CTT Collaboration 2010 meta-analysis established LDL-C to be an important risk factor for major vascular events [23] . The 2019 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline has lipid-based criteria to initiate statin therapy if LDL-C \u2265 190 mg/dl [24] . Still, our meta-analysis found evidence of benefit with no increase in the risk of harm in the population with LDL-C lower than 190 mg/dl and some cardiovascular risk factors. Population with average LDL-C from near-optimal to borderline high is not getting the benefit of statin therapy according to the guidelines when 10-year ASCVD risk criteria are not met, which might be important in the south Asian population who is already accepted to have enhanced ASCVD risk and a population whose average LDL-C is low compared to western standards [5] . In our metaanalysis, we found overall cardiovascular benefit in treating the population with baseline average LDL-C in near-optimal to borderline high range, and more benefit appears in those having traditional risk factors of CVD. Hence, further research seems necessary to analyze costeffectiveness and risk-benefit ratio to consider starting statin therapy in a population with mean baseline LDL-C in near-optimal to borderline high range and low ASCVD risk according to current guidelines [24] . Also, the 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines have set the criteria to initiate statin therapy in the age group 20-39 year if a family history of premature ASCVD and LDL-C \u2265 160 mg/dl are both present [24] .

Patient-level data would have enabled us to include participants free of prior cardiovascular disease because few trials included participants with prior cardiovascular diseases. This study included trials with a baseline average LDL-C in the study population less than 160 mg/dl, so participants with even higher baseline LDL-C might have contributed to the findings, but we did sensitivity analysis of trials and subgroups of trials with all participants having LDL-C \u2264 160 mg/dl. This study included participants with heterogeneous cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, elevated hs-CRP), which might have contributed to the heterogeneous effect size, but significant heterogeneity was seen in outcomes: composite cardiovascular outcomes, myalgia, liver enzyme abnormality, withdrawal due to adverse events, and fatal cancer. We did a sensitivity analysis based on participants and study characteristics to check for uniformity in the effect size in different participant cohorts and quality of studies. Statin therapy in the trials varied in statin type, dosage, or mode of therapy (fixed or titrated dose) with two trials with high-intensity statin [16, 18] , six with moderate intensity stain [11] [12] [13] 15, 19, 20] , and two with low [10,17] and one with a low and moderate-intensity statin [14] . Trials in the study included the population with age greater than 18, and the mean age of included participants in all trials was above 40, so this study is limited in finding the benefit in a younger population less than 40 years of age. We included published data in the English language only, which could have resulted in the loss of trials published in other languages.
