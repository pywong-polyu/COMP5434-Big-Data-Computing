Saliva droplets containing SARS-COV-2 are a major vector for COVID-19 infection, making saliva a promising alternative for COVID-19 testing using nasopharyngeal swab samples. To diagnose COVID-19 patients in the field, a point-of-care test (POCT) using saliva was conceptualized. We have developed a simple method for extracting RNA from saliva samples using semi-alkaline proteinase, a sputum homogenizer typically used for preparing samples for tuberculosis testing, and a subsequent simple heating step with no need for centrifugation or RNA extraction. Further, we newly developed a triplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification approach (RT-LAMP) which utilizes colorimetric readout using a heat block, with results evaluated with the unaided eye. In 44 clinical patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection, the test took 45 min, and resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.6% (19/23) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (21/21), compared to the reference standard. The limit of detection was 250 copies/ reaction (25,000 copies/mL). Our newly developed POCT approach achieved simple RNA extraction and constant RT-LAMP detection. This POCT has the potential to be used for simple inspection stations in a field setting, helping reduce the risk of infection by simplifying and accelerating testing for COVID-19.",

Of note, colorimetric readout is more unambiguous than turbidimetric readout with the unaided eye, and more practical in the field than fluorescent LAMP analysis without color change dye.

Regarding the 3 samples showing low copy numbers of 170-230 copies/reaction (15,000-20,000 copies/mL of saliva) on RT-qPCR, 1 was ultimately positive at 23 min 32 s of amplification, while the other 2 were false negatives on POCT. This discrepant result is not surprising. This is because, as shown in Table 1 , the LOD determined by 20 repetitions was 250 copies/reaction (25,000 copies/ mL), but the frequency was 70% (14/20) positive at 125 copies/reaction (12,500 copies/mL). Samples with copy numbers in this range are on the LOD borderline between positive and negative, so we speculate that the results were unstable. Therefore, these findings were interpreted to indicate borderline samples near the LOD of POCT. Two other samples showing low copy numbers of 13-86 copies/reaction (1,100\u2212 7,400 copies/mL of saliva) were also false negatives, likely due to their low ",

There is a high need for POCT using saliva, due to a low risk of contamination and easiness of sample collection, but the immunochromatography is not a realistic option because of the high inhibitory effects in saliva [4] .
