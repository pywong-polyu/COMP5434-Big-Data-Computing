This purpose of study is to describe the clinical course of COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO. Methods: A multicentered study of critical patients with COVID-19 treated at six hospitals in Daegu was conducted between January and April 2020. Results: Among the 80 patients receiving mechanical ventilation support, 19 (24%) were treated with ECMO included (median age 63.0 years). Eight of the 19 patients (42%) were weaned off ECMO (9.8 days, IQR 7.0-13.7). Among them, four patients were also weaned off mechanical ventilation (33.4 days, IQR 29.3 -35.7), three were still receiving mechanical ventilation (50.9 days), and one expired after ECMO weaning. According to the univariate analysis, the factor that was associated with successful ECMO weaning was vitamin B12 treatment (p = 0.028). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 epidemic, ECMO weaning and mortality rates were 42% and 58%, respectively.",

In Korea, over 10,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and Daegu was the first epicenter of the outbreak. The spectrum of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is broad, ranging from mild disease to critical disease. In the largest case series reported by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, 5% of patients were critical, presenting with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. 1 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 15% to 30% of patients with COVID-19 and is a significant contributor to mortality. 2, 3 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support device that serves as a modified form of cardiopulmonary bypass, and ECMO use has shown mortality benefit in ARDS patients. 4 ECMO was regarded as a rescue therapy in previous H1N1 influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. 5\u00c07 Based on the interim guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO), ECMO is now applied in some critically ill COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia despite mechanical ventilation (MV). 8 However, few reports were found on the experience of ECMO use in COVID-19 patients. To date, two Chinese studies have been reported; however, those were singlecenter studies with small numbers of ECMO-treated patients and a lack detailed clinical information. 9, 10 With multicenter data from six hospitals in Daegu, Korea, we aimed to describe the clinical course of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO.

Moreover, our study involving 19 patients in six hospitals found that the mortality rate was as high as 58% in ECMO-treated patients at the time of reporting. Compared to the mortality rate of 21%-24% found in ECMO-treated patients with the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, 6,7 the mortality rate seems to be higher in COVID-19 patients but similar to the 65% observed in patients with MERS. 5\u00c07 There are few data of the patients who have done mechanical ventilator weaning after ECMO wean off, the rate is from 33.3% to 62.7%. 20\u00c022 In this study, we found that even if the patients were weaned off of ECMO, recovery of lung function took longer than we expected, and a substantial number of patients may need mechanical ventilation after weaning off of ECMO because 38% of the ECMOweaned patients were treated with mechanical ventilation. This delayed lung recovery time may be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality because a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilator management is related to secondary infection, exacerbation of comorbid disease, and progression of multiorgan failure and septic shock. Thus, new strategies are needed for improved management in view of the high transmission rate of this novel virus. Among the strategies, refinement of indication for ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and risk stratification for patients treated with ECMO is essential because ECMO is related to a high demand for health care resources, including various medical ECMO professionals. 23 In this rapid communication, we reported on the initial experience of ECMO in patients with COVID-19, which may be the foundation for future effective strategies.",

As a conservative management approach, nutrient support with vitamin C and vitamin B12 may be helpful in ECMO-treated patients. Our result may be in line with previous reports indicating that antioxidant supplementation was associated with rapid resolution of lung injury in patients with enterovirus/rhinovirus-induced ARDS. 24\u00c026 There has been supporting evidence that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the early phases of critical illness. Tissue injury is mediated by oxidative metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been detected in the expired breath of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and by NF-kB, which has been related to systemic inflammation based on experimental evidence. 27\u00c029 Thus, although further studies are warranted due to no beneficial effect, 27 the present study suggests the potential effects of antioxidants in preventing pulmonary morbidity and other organ failure when used as therapeutic interventions in in critically ill COVID-19 surgical patients, 30\u00c032 this approach has minimal expense and a lack of adverse effects.",
