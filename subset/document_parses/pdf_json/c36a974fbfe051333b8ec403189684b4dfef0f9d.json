As a result of this diverse digital environment, users relatively get distracted, primarily when they receive and share information on social media [2] . The behavioral factor of human attention has long been a key factor in science and research that focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The study conducted by [3] states that the attention factor's role is essential when users share information on social media. In line with that, recent studies conducted by Gabielkov et al. [4] stated that about 59% of users in Twitter share information without even reading the content first (in other words, in a hurry and without attentive behavior to share the information they have just received).",

This study has also stated that visual techniques have a more optimal role in influencing user behavior and decisions on a task. For this reason, we recommend that this visual technique could be the preference when building a technology related to user behavior in sharing information on social media. Several techniques or designs in building attention-based interfaces need further exploration and adaptation. The stimulant technique using sound or video media and the multiscreen technique might be preferred in future research. This study only carried out VSAS interactions in the distribution of 10 (ten) information contexts and social influence narratives within the scope of \"individual chats.\" In future research, we suggest that the process of sending ten contexts of information and social influence narratives can be carried out within the scope of a \"group chat.\" The point is to determine how different user responses are between in/out-group with the same interests or beliefs. In designing and building VSAS applications, we have limitations in obtaining secondary data in the form of datasets from social media platforms.
