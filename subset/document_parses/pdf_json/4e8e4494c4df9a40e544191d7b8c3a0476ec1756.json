The decision to transition from in-person visits to telehealth was supported financially by the CARES Act, but the implementation was both rapid and uncertain, and the flow of care processes to maintain patient contact changed daily. Center administrators and staff had to take into consideration multiple factors to best determine what methods of telecommunication patients would be comfortable using, as well as the potential for patient access to a device and internet connection. Clinic providers cycled through 3 telehealth platforms in 4 weeks, ultimately settling on Doximity Dialer Video as the primary visit platform (https://www.doximity.com/dialer). Alternative platforms such as InTouch were too complex for patients and providers to master quickly. Doximity Dialer accommodates multiple participants to be easily merged to participate in a telephone call or videoconference by the person who initiated the call to the patient. The application's software allows health care providers to predesignate a business number for display as the caller ID. This feature protects the caller's personal cell phone number identity, as well as alerting the patient that this is a call they are expecting from their clinic provider.",

For example, questions to patients need to be more specific and sensitive to elicit focused answers while still demonstrating empathy, and patient responses required careful active listening skills without visual communication cues from a patient. The implementation of telehealth primary care visits enabled patients to have individual one-on-one visits with their established primary care provider. This allowed NPs to support patients who expressed feelings of abandonment, isolation, and hopelessness as a result of the mandated shelter-in-place order during the initial phase of the coronavirus pandemic in Chicago. Telehealth also allowed the provider to screen patients for COVID-19 symptoms, using audio or video evaluation of shortness of breath and cough, which was particularly valuable for those living alone.

Breathlessness on exertion could be assessed by observing patients walking in their home. Some patients own a home oximeter, an inexpensive way to monitor oxygen saturation (cost is approximately $20). This is a helpful assessment tool for remote assessment of pulmonary patients. However, oximeters are not routinely covered by insurers and may be cost-prohibitive for some patients.",

They also complete routine assessment tools, such as the Asthma Control Test or COPD Assessment Test. Next, the NP and students connect by telephone or videoconference to review the patient information collected by the students before the patient visit. At the scheduled time, the NP connects with the patient for the telephone or videoconference visit, and (if the patient grants permission) the student is easily merged into the visit by telephone or videoconference via the Doximity Dialer application. When visits are completed for the day, the NP and students meet again virtually to discuss and review the rationale for each patient's management plan and formulate a plan for follow-up. This wrap-up has been done by telephone or videoconference, but because some telehealth visits are now conducted from the clinic, the NP and students may be in person together on site. Additionally, the NP incorporates education for the student regarding selecting the appropriate CPT and billing code for the telehealth visit and entering appropriate visit documentation.",

Students are always included in this communication to role-model effective interprofessional teamwork essential to preparing practice-ready clinicians.
