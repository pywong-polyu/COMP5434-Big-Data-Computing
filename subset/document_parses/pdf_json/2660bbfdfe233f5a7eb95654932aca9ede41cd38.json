We applaud the residency programs have already developed a system to allow medical students from other programs to give virtual grand rounds. While this is an important aspect of the visiting subinternship, it cannot replace the experience of working directly with residents and faculty in the operating rooms, wards, and clinics. While the SAU and individual programs are researching more holistic virtual subinternships, it is unclear the exact role they will play in the 2020-2021 match cycle. We propose that medical students be allowed to spend multiple months rotating at their home programs to allow them to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, personality, and growth over time and at least secure meaningful letters of recommendation.

This period could be deemed a \"second-look window\" and be the only period of time in which postinterview contact and visitation are allowed. This would eliminate the primary perceived advantage to second looks, an increased chance of matching at a program, and remove any incentive for applicants to visit other than to inform their own preferences, should they deem the risk of travel acceptable.
