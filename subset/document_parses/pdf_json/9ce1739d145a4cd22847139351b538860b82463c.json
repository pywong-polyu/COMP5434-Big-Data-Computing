Imaging studies, however, are subject to selection bias, and prospective studies are challenging to scale. Here, we evaluated whether serum neurofilament light chain (NFL), a neuroaxonal injury marker, could predict the extent of neuronal damage in a cohort of 142 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. NFL was elevated in the serum of patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, including those without overt neurological manifestations. Higher NFL serum concentrations were associated with worse clinical outcomes. In 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir, a trend toward lower NFL serum concentrations was observed. These data suggest that patients with COVID-19 may experience neuroaxonal injury and may be at risk for long-term neurological sequelae. Neuroaxonal injury should be considered as an outcome in acute pharmacotherapeutic trials for COVID-19.",

Although common symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 include fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath, the manifestations of COVID-19 can vary widely. For example, some patients can develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial injury, arrhythmias, and/or multiorgan failure (2) , and it is increasingly recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurologic signs (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Clinical studies observed neuropsychiatric manifestations in up to 70% of patients with COVID-19, including young adults and patients in whom respiratory symptoms have long resolved (10) (11) (12) . Brain imaging studies detected diverse lesions including perfusion abnormalities with or without acute infarctions, cerebral venous thrombosis, macro-and microhemorrhages, multifocal white matter and basal ganglia lesions, meningeal enhancement, central pontine myelinolysis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and neuritis (13) (14) (15) (16) . Moreover, brain autopsy studies found SARS-CoV-2 RNA or proteins in various neuroanatomical regions of patients with COVID-19, with astrogliosis, activation of microglia, and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes noted in many cases (17, 18) .",

On the basis of these findings and others (20) establishing NFL as a marker of axonal injury, we investigated whether serum NFL was elevated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and whether it correlated with clinical outcomes and disease severity.",

A summary of patient demographics, treatments, and clinical outcomes is shown in Table 1 . Characteristics of control individuals are presented in table S1. The median age in patients with COVID-19 was 62 years (range, 22 to 99 years), and 57.7% were male (82 patients). In control individuals, the median age was 62 years (range, 32 to 84 years) and 50.9% were male (28 patients (median, 10.9 pg/ml; range, 3.2 to 43.2 pg/ml; P < 0.001; Fig. 1A ). This finding was consistent after correcting for age and sex and when examining the first, last, minimum, or maximum NFL measurement per patient (Table 2 ). To assess how many patients with COVID-19 had elevated NFL according to a prespecified cutoff, we determined the number of patients with an NFL concentration of at least 3 SDs above the group mean NFL concentration of control individuals. For this analysis, we focused on maximum NFL measurements given that NFL concentrations fluctuate between time points, as demonstrated for 35 of the patients with longitudinal NFL data (Fig. 1B) , such that using mean NFL concentrations could mask our ability to discern elevated NFL concentrations at one or more time points. About 34% of patients with COVID-19 (48 individuals) had NFL concentrations higher than the cutoff. We additionally determined the number of patients with an NFL concentration of at least 2 SDs above the mean control concentration and found that 53% of patients (76 individuals) met this criterion.",

Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between NFL and time from admission to final blood draw (Spearman's r: 0.50, P < 0.001); thus, we also performed similar analyses adjusting for time from admission to final blood draw (table S2) and observed results consistent with findings reported in Table 3 .",

We show that serum NFL is elevated in patients with COVID-19 and that ~34% of patients have mean NFL concentrations of at least 3 SDs above the group mean of control individuals. In addition, elevated serum NFL correlates with worse clinical outcomes, such as the need for mechanical ventilation (intubation), ICU admission, longer lengths of hospitalization, and worse functional outcomes. We further observed a tendency of lower serum NFL in patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir.

Nevertheless, the great majority of patients with COVID-19 (86.7%) show no intracranial abnormalities by imaging (13) . It also bears mentioning that retrospective studies using brain imaging approaches in patients with COVID-19 suffer from selection bias, in particular omitting patients with mild or no obvious neurological symptoms and patients too unstable or having contraindications to undergo magnetic resonance imaging. This selection bias, combined with the uncertainty of the sensitivity of brain imaging to neuroaxonal injury (12) , suggests that neuronal injury or neurodegeneration in patients with COVID-19 may be underappreciated based on imaging studies alone. Given findings from the present study, we believe that measuring serum NFL in patients with COVID-19 will facilitate the detection of neuronal injury that may otherwise be overlooked.",

For example, one study observed elevated serum NFL in 28 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (23), whereas another found that, among 47 patients with COVID-19, plasma NFL was higher in the 18 patients with severe disease (24) . Yet, another reported serum NFL to be elevated in 29 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and to positively associate with an unfavorable outcome (25) . Last, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NFL was elevated in two of six hospitalized patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 (26) . Our data are also congruent with the growing consensus that SARS-CoV-2 causes potentially damaging neurological problems. However, how this occurs remains unclear. Similarly to other respiratory viruses that have neuroinvasive capacities (27, 28) , SARS-CoV-2 can spread to the central nervous system (17, 18) . Postulated pathways by which this occurs include its retrograde axonal transport along the sensory and olfactory nerves in the cribriform plate, its invasion of endothelial cells by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and its ability to alter tight junction proteins formed by endothelial cells (29) . Nevertheless, despite the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the brain, the neurological signs and symptoms it causes are believed to more likely result from systemic reactions such as hypoxemia, hypercoagulability, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure (18, 26, 30) .",

The small sample sizes together with differences in timing of treatment in relation to symptom onset, in severity of symptoms once treatment was initiated, and in duration of treatment from its initiation to blood draw for NFL measurements may have hampered our efforts to detect associations of interest. To rigorously address this question would require a randomized trial in which NFL concentrations are longitudinally measured in patients before and after treatment.",

Associations between serum NFL and outcomes in patients with COVID-19. For descriptive summaries of NFL concentration and for ease of presentation, LOS was categorized using the sample median, whereas mRS at discharge was categorized using a predefined cutoff of interest. Associations of intubation, ICU admission, LOS, and mRS at discharge (all as independent variables) with NFL concentration (as the dependent variable) were evaluated using linear regression models (for the continuous mean NFL per patient, minimum NFL per patient, and maximum NFL per patient variables) and logistic regression models (for the binary occurrence of an NFL value >25th percentile and occurrence of an NFL value >75th percentile variables). Regression coefficients are interpreted as the change in the mean NFL outcome measure (on the natural logarithmic scale) corresponding to the presence of the given characteristic (intubation and ICU admission), to each doubling of LOS, and to each 1-unit increase in mRS at discharge. CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease. P values <0.0025 were considered as statistically significant after applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. outcomes. These data further cement the field's recognition of the neurological manifestations caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, our understanding of the long-term implications is limited. It has been shown that patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 display a wide array of neurological symptoms months after discharge (10, 12, 37) , but few studies have systematically followed patients over time, likely because of the inherent difficulties in doing so. However, on the basis of our present data, we posit that longitudinal measurements of serum NFL would provide an efficient means to identify and quantify neurological injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Serum NFL may also be useful for monitoring end-stage organ disease progression and recovery, aiding in the identification of risk factors and clinical features that contribute to COVID-19-associated neurological signs, and indicating neuroaxonal injury in COVID-19 drug trials.",

Briefly, samples were thawed and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min, transferred to 96-well plates, and run in duplicate using a 4\u00d7 instrument dilution. Four samples were included in each run to monitor potential variability among assays, along with appropriate calibrators and controls provided by the manufacturer. NFL concentrations were interpolated from the calibration curve using a 1/y2 weighted four-parameter logistic curve fit. Samples with NFL concentrations that exceeded the range of the assay were retested using an appropriate at-bench dilution in addition to the 4\u00d7 instrument dilution. Samples with coefficients of variation above 20% were also retested. For all 55 control subjects, NFL concentrations were measured in serum collected at a single time point. For patients with COVID-19, In patients alone, we also assessed the strength of association between the length of time from admission to blood draw and NFL concentrations by estimating Spearman's correlation coefficient and by obtaining a P value from a mixed effects linear regression model that included a random effect for patients. NFL was examined on the natural logarithmic scale in this and all subsequently described analyses owing to its skewed distribution. When assessing associations of NFL concentrations with outcomes (need for mechanical ventilation/intubation, ICU admission, LOS, and mRS at discharge), we considered the five following patient-specific NFL variables: (i) mean NFL concentration per patient, (ii) minimum NFL concentration per patient, (iii) maximum NFL concentration per patient, (iv) occurrence of an NFL concentration >25th percentile, and (v) occurrence of an NFL concentration >75th percentile.

Therefore, to assess whether NFL associates with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19, we assessed associations between outcomes (intubation, ICU admission, LOS, and mRS at discharge) and each of the five aforementioned NFL variables using linear regression models (mean, minimum, and maximum NFL per patient) and logistic regression models (NFL >25th percentile and NFL >75th percentile), where the NFL variables were examined as the dependent variables in the regression models and NFL values were included regardless of temporal relationship to time of start of mechanical ventilation (intubation) or time of ICU admission. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from linear regression models, whereas odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated from logistic regression models. Unadjusted models were first examined, and these were followed by multivariable models that were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and CKD. The latter was included given that blood NFL concentrations are affected by renal function (40) . Length of time from admission to blood draw was not initially taken into account in multivariable models because this variable can, to some extent, also be thought of as an outcome measure (because a longer time from admission to blood draw indicates a patient with a longer hospitalization and likely worse outcomes) and therefore may be on the causal pathway between NFL and outcomes (41) . However, in a secondary analysis, we did examine the sensitivity of our results to additional multivariable adjustment for length of time from admission to final blood draw.",

The Mayo Clinic Neurological, Vascular and Neurovascular Events With SARS-CoV-2 Study [MC NEWS; Institutional Review Board (IRB) #20-003457] was queried to identify a cohort of individuals with COVID-19. MC NEWS included patients across the three major campuses of Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Clinic Health System, with hospitals in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Fifty-five healthy controls without COVID-19 and no neurological condition were additionally included. This group was composed of 22 healthy individuals from the general population, 19 healthy spouses or caregivers of patients with ataxia (N = 15) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; N = 4), and 14 unaffected relatives of patients with ataxia (N = 4) or ALS (N = 10) and who lacked disease-associated gene mutations. Serum samples were obtained under IRB approval through the following protocols: \"Investigating biomarkers, disease mechanisms and treatments for spinocerebellar ataxia and nucleotide repeat diseases,\" IRB#17-006033; \"Investigating the Genetic and Phenotypic Presentation of Spinocerebellar Ataxia and Nucleotide Repeat Diseases,\" IRB#16-009414; \"Biospecimen Biorepository for the Study of ALS, ALS-FTD and Similar Neurodegenerative Disorders,\" IRB#13-004314; \"Pilot Evaluation of Neurofilament Heavy Form (NF-H) as a Potential Biomarker of Axonal Loss in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),\" IRB#10-003592; \"Clinical & Genetic Studies in ALS, Suspected ALS, and Other Neurodegenerative Motor Neuron Disorders,\" IRB#07-005711; \"Biospecimen Collection to Investigate the Causes of ALS,\" IRB#15-001187; \"The DIALS (Dominant Inherited ALS) Network,\" IRB#2017P000485;",
