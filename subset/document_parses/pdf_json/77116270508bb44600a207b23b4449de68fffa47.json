            "text": "To report a COVID-19 outbreak among workers and inpatients at a medical ward for especially vulnerable patients. Methods: Descriptive study of a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak registered in March-April 2020 at medical ward of onco-hematological patients in an Spanish hospital. Confirmed cases were hospitalized patients, healthcare and non-healthcare workers who tested positive by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: Twenty-two COVID-19 cases (12 workers and 10 inpatients) were laboratory-confirmed. Initial cases were a healthcare provider and a visitor who tested positive. The median patients age was 73 years (range 62-88). The main reason of admission was haematological in 8 patients and oncologic in 2. All patients followed an immunosuppressive treatment, 5/10 with high-flow oxygen nebulizations. Five patients presented a moderate/serious evolution, and 5 patients died. The mean workers age was 42.1\u00b110.9. One healthworker required Intensive Care Unit admission, and all of them recovered completely. Conclusions: In the hospital setting, close patients surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is essential, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Replacing nebulizations or high-flow oxygen therapies, when other equivalent options were available, to reduce dispersion, and controlling ventilation ducts, together with hygiene measures and an active follow-up on inpatients, visitors and workers appear to be important in preventing nosocomial outbreaks.",

For example, doors that open, teams and beds moving around, people going up and down constantly, although we have not seen that the evolution of the outbreak followed the direction of the airflows of the Unit. Joshua L. Santarpia et al. [29] present 13 individuals with COVID-19 in the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

In another study carried [30] , high concentrations of the virus were found in poorly ventilated areas and in the absence of negative pressure. In the ICUs, with adequate ventilation and negative pressure, the load was lower.

In the presence of a confirmed case in a hospitalization ward, whether of health personnel, non-health personnel or a patient, all patients and workers of the ward are screened with PCR. Positives cases are isolated and the PCR screening is repeated after 5-7 days to all the personnel and patients. This is done successively until no positive is identified. At the present time, the rooms are more ventilated, no aerosols are generated, replacing them with cameras, and only one companion per patient wearing a mask is allowed. It should be noted the existence of greater PCR tests availability and higher traceability capacity at the present time.",
