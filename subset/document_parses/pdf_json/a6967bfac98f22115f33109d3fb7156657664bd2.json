The way of splitting and processing the mixture of materials was studied as well as the final properties such as chemical, thermal and mechanical characteristics. The resulting recycled material is a blend of polymers with such mechanical and thermal properties that could be used as an alternative to recycled PP (polypropylene). Avoidance of previous sorting process gives the face mask recycling a new and simplified way of preventing this material to be disposed in environment and an opportunity of second life for the polymers they are made of. With this work we lay the basis to reduce the plastic pollution related with the recommended use of face masks during Covid-19 pandemic.",

Without sorting process and applying steps of mechanical recycling, a recycled material based of a mixing of three polymers is obtained. Four steps are needed: thermo chemical disinfection treatment, elimination of metal and ear strap, grinding, extrusion and injection. The mechanical properties of this material make it useful to obtain different products where recycled PP is being currently used, such as flower pots, storage bins or shipping pallets where technical specifications are not critical. With this methodology it would be possible to reduce the waste and contamination that those days of Covid-19 are generating.",

These FFP2 face masks are able of filtering at least 94% of the air particles. Face masks effectiveness is related to the filter that stops respiratory droplets from getting through or around the device, and also related with the level of sealing, once it is adjusted to the face. Generally, FFP2 face mask has a structure of five layers of nonwoven material, where PP (polypropylene) and PE (polyethylene) are the basic materials for the filters layers and PA (polyamide) is used for the ear strap, while the nose wire is made of steel. Usually middle layers are embedded with an electrostatic charge that enhances the mechanical filtering efficiency [9] . There are variations in the product, depending on the manufacturer and also related to their final properties of filtration [10] .",

Making estimations and knowing that a mask weight is approximately 4gr, in one year and taken into consideration that one quarter of the Spanish population could use one FFP2 mask per day; approximately 1.000 ton of plastic waste will be accumulated. Being aware of that situation will not be permanent, and thinking about the likelihood of using face mask will last one or two years, the number of plastic waste that will be generated in every country is more than significant. Furthermore, in hospitals and probably in other community centers, the use of this kind of protection will last.",

What it is clear is that Covid-19 has generated a number of different plastic residues that must be treated. Specific policies have to be developed in order to diminish this new way of contamination.

See Table 5 for final process conditions of the material. The recycled polypropylene as reference is also included. Differences in process conditions are related with the mixtures of materials. As an example, the presence of PET increases the melt temperature needed for mould injection in comparison with the one needed for rPP. The melting process conditions were selected taking into account the differences between individual fusion temperatures of the materials of the face mask. These values are in agreement with the ones used by Zang [34] studying the properties of recycled PET and PP at several conditions using the 240 \u00b0C among the temperature profile of the extruder and also the ones used by Mishra [35] who prepared blends of PET and PP. In our case we must consider that not only PP and PET are in the blend but also PE, therefore we chose 240 \u00b0C as a compromise for the melt mixing, avoiding to reach higher temperatures for avoiding PE and PP degradation. Figure 5 shows samples obtained with the material from FFP2 face mask for mechanical characterization. Slightly color differences can be observed in samples pUmask obtained from the used face masks, that are darker, related probably with the mixtures of materials and possible contaminations due to the use of the face masks or degradation of polymers after the thermal process.

Comparing the results with the ones obtained by Battegazzore and coauthors [21] , who studied the surgical face masks material, it can be noted that the overall mechanical properties of the recycled material from FFP2 masks are higher than the ones from the material from surgical masks. This can be explained taking into account the influence of the three materials present at FFP2 masks, and the amount of PET in the blending material could be the reason of the higher maximum stress and modulus.",
