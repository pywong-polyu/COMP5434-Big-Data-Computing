            "text": "What is the role of emotion in susceptibility to believing fake news? Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N = 409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study was predictive of greater belief in fake (but not real) news posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N = 3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.",

For example, within the 3 months prior to the US election, estimates indicate that fake news stories favoring Trump were shared approximately 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared approximately 8 million times (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017) . Furthermore, a recent analysis suggests that, among news stories fact-checked by independent fact-checking organizations, false stories spread farther, faster, and more broadly on Twitter than true stories, with false political stories reaching more people in a shorter period of time than all other types of false stories (Vosoughi et al. 2018 ). These fake news stories are not only spread, but are also often believed to be true (Silverman and Singer-Vine 2016) . And, in fact, merely being exposed to a fake news headline increases later belief in that headline (Pennycook et al. 2018) .",

However, while similar findings have supported the conclusion that fake news websites make up a small proportion of media diets overall, these studies Martel et al. Cogn. Research (2020) 5:47 have also shown that fake news is disproportionately visited by specific groups of people (e.g., supporters of Donald Trump; Guess et al. 2020 ; social media users over the age of 65; Guess et al. 2019) . Thus, regardless of the impact of fake news on the average Americans' overall media consumption, fake news may still impact the belief in and spread of news in key political and demographic communities.",

One popular perspective on belief in misinformation, which we will call the motivated cognition account, argues that analytic thinking-rather than emotional responses-are primarily to blame (Kahan 2017) . By this account, people reason like lawyers rather than scientists, using their reasoning abilities to protect their identities and ideological commitments rather than to uncover the truth (Kahan 2013) . Thus, our reasoning abilities are hijacked by partisanship, and therefore those who rely more on reasoning are better able to convince themselves of the truth of false stories that align with their ideology. This account is supported by evidence that people who engage in more analytic thinking show more political polarization regarding climate change (Kahan et al. 2012 ; see also Drummond and Fischhoff 2017) , gun control ; see also Ballarini and Sloman 2017; , and selective exposure to political information (Knobloch-Westerwick et al. 2017 ).",

            "text": "An alternative perspective, which we will call the classical reasoning account, argues that reasoning and analytic thinking do typically help uncover the truth of news content (Pennycook and Rand 2019a) . By this account, individuals engaging in reasoning and reflection are less likely to mistake fake news as accurate. And, by extension, misinformation often succeeds when individuals fail to utilize reason and analytic thinking. The classical reasoning account fits within the tradition of dual-process theories of judgment, in which analytic thinking (rather than relying on \"gut feelings\") is thought to often (but not always) support sound judgment (Evans 2003; Stanovich 2005) . Recent research supports this account as it relates to fake news by linking the propensity to engage in analytic thinking with skepticism about epistemically suspect beliefs (Pennycook et al. 2015a, b;  however, this association may be specific to Western individuals and moderated as a function of culture; see Majima et al. 2020 ; also see Bah\u00e7ekap\u0131l\u0131 and Yilmaz 2017) , such as paranormal and superstitious beliefs (Pennycook et al. 2012) , conspiracy beliefs (Swami et al. 2014) , delusions (Bronstein et al. 2019) , and pseudo-profound bullshit (Pennycook et al. 2015a, b) . Of most direct relevance, people who were more willing to think analytically when given a set of reasoning problems were less likely to erroneously believe fake news articles regardless of their partisan alignment (Pennycook and Rand 2019a) , and experimental manipulations of deliberation yield similar results (Bag\u00f2 et al. 2020) . Moreover, analytic thinking is associated with lower trust in fake news sources (Pennycook and Rand 2019b) and less sharing of links to low quality sources on Twitter (Mosleh et al. 2020) . Belief in fake news has also been associated with dogmatism, religious fundamentalism, and reflexive (rather than active/reflective) open-minded thinking (Bronstein et al. 2019; Pennycook and Rand 2019c) . A recent experiment has even shown that encouraging people to think deliberately, rather than intuitively, decreased self-reported likelihood of \"liking\" or sharing fake news on social media (Effron and Raj 2020) , as did asking people to judge the accuracy of every headline prior to making a sharing decision (Fazio 2020) or simply asking for a single accuracy judgment at the outset of the study . Indeed, encouraging individuals to think deliberately and focus on retrieving accurate information has also been shown to reduce the influence of misinformation in contexts beyond fake news-for instance, when encouraged to deliberate, fact check, and edit fictional texts with inaccurate assertions, people are less influenced by the inaccurate claims they encounter (Rapp et al. 2014) .",

Different emotions have been suggested to differentially impact judgment in general, as well as perceptions of political fake news in particular. An extensive literature assesses the differential impact of specific emotions on cognition and decision-making (e.g., Appraisal-Tendency Framework; Lerner and Keltner 2001; Feelings-as-information theory; Schwarz 2011) . For instance, Bodenhausen et al. (1994) found that anger elicits greater reliance upon heuristic cues in a persuasion paradigm, whereas sadness promotes an opposite, decreased reliance on heuristic cues. Literature on the relationship between emotion and gullibility has found that a negative mood state generally increases skepticism, whereas a positive mood state increases gullibility and decreases the ability to detect deception (Forgas and East 2008; Forgas 2019) . Affective feelings have also been found to demonstrate a flexible influence on cognition; that is, both positive and negative emotions may improve cognitive performance, depending on the nature of the task (e.g., creative versus analytic) and processing styles available (e.g., heuristic versus systematic; see Huntsinger and Ray 2016) .",

Furthermore, evidence suggests that the illusory truth effect (i.e., believing fake news content after repeated exposure) is in some part driven by feelings of positivity cueing truth (Unkelbach et al. 2011) , whereas sadness may reduce the illusory truth effect (Koch and Forgas 2012) .

Furthermore, some evidence suggests that even negative emotions, generally thought to promote skepticism (Forgas 2019) , can also contribute to belief in conspiracy theories, particularly when such emotions are related to the subject of the conspiracy theory (e.g., dejection-agitation; Mashuri et al. 2016) . Such findings suggest that relying on existing feelings may contribute to inaccurate assessments of truth by directly increasing credulity of typically implausible content, rather than solely by reducing analytic thinking.

In contrast, both emotion and reason may complimentarily aid in the formation of beliefs (Mercer 2010) . The current study addresses this issue by separately modulating the use of reason and use of emotion. This approach, as well as the inclusion of a baseline condition in our experimental design, allows us to ask whether belief in fake news is more likely to be the result of merely failing to engage in reasoning rather than being specifically promoted by reliance on emotion. Furthermore, it allows for differentiable assessments regarding use of reason and use of emotion, rather than treating reason and emotion simply as two directions on the same continuum.",

Participants first completed demographics questions, including age, sex, and political preferences. Next, participants completed the 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scale (PANAS; Watson et al. 1988 ). For each item, participants were asked \"To what extent do you feel [item-specific emotion] at this moment?\" Likert-scale: 1 = Very slightly or not at all, 2 = A little, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Quite a bit, 5 = Extremely. This measure was designed to assess the current mood state of each participant. After completing this measure, participants received a series of 20 actual headlines that appeared on social media, half of which were factually accurate (real news) and half of which were entirely untrue (fake news) Furthermore, half of the headlines were favorable to the Democratic Party and half were favorable to the Republican Party (based on ratings collected in a pretest, described in Pennycook and Rand 2019a) . Participants in the pretest also rated the headlines on a number of other dimensions (including prior familiarity); however, they were only balanced on partisanship. These headlines were selected randomly from a larger set of 32 possible headlines-again half real, half fake, and half Democratfavorable, and half Republican-favorable. All fake news headlines were taken from Snopes.com, a well-known fact-checking website. Real news headlines were selected from mainstream news sources (e.g., NPR, The Washington Post) and selected to be roughly contemporary to the fake news headlines. The headlines were presented in the format of a Facebook post-namely, with a picture accompanied by a headline, byline, and a source (see Fig. 1 ). For each headline, participants were asked: \"To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim in the above headline\" using a 4-point Likert-scale: 1 = Not at all accurate, 2 = Not very accurate, 3 = Somewhat accurate, 4 = Very accurate.",

We used the R packages lme4 (Bates et al. 2015) , lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al. 2017) , and arm (Gelman and Su 2018) to perform linear mixed-effects analyses of the relationship between perceived accuracy, specific emotions measured by the PANAS, and type of news headline (fake, real). A mixed-effects model allows us to account for the interdependency between observations due to by-participant and by-item variation. We entered the PANAS score for the item of interest, type of news headline, and an interaction between the two terms into the model as fixed effects. We had intercepts for headline items and participants, as well as by-item random slopes for the effect of the PANAS emotion-item rating and by-participant random slopes for the effect of type of news headline, for random effects. The reference level for type of news headline was \"fake. \" Since 20 emotions were assessed by the PANAS, we performed 20 linear mixed-effects analyses. To further demonstrate the generalizability of our results across emotions, we also performed two additional linear mixed-effects analyses with aggregated PANAS scores for negative and positive emotions, which were calculated via a varimax rotation on a two-factor analysis of the 20 PANAS items. The beta coefficients for the interaction between emotion and news type are reported as \"Discernment\" (i.e., the difference between real and fake news, with a larger coefficient indicating higher overall accuracy in media truth discernment), and the betas for real news were calculated via joint significance tests (i.e., F-tests of overall significance). Our results are summarized in Table 1 . 2 Overall, our results indicate that, for nearly every emotion evaluated by the PANAS scale, 3 increased emotionality is associated with increased belief in fake news. Furthermore, we also find that nearly every emotion also has a significant interaction with type of news headline, such that greater emotionality also predicts decreased discernment between real and fake news. Indeed, the only emotions for which we do not see these effects are \"interested, \" \"alert, \" \"determined, \" and \"attentive, \" which arguably are all more closely associated with analytic thinking rather than emotionality per se; however, although we do not find significant relationships between these emotions and belief in fake news or discernment, we also do not provide evidence that such relationships do not exist. Our results also suggest that the relationship between emotion and news accuracy judgments appear to be specific to fake news; that is, for every emotion except \"attentive\" and \"alert, \" no significant relationship exists with real news belief. Our key findings are also robust when controlling for headline familiarity (see Additional file 1, which contains descriptive statistics and additional analyses).",

Our maximal linear mixed model failed to converge, so we followed the guidelines for how to achieve convergence in Brauer and Curtin (2018) , and removed the by-unit random slopes for within-unit predictors and lower-order interactions, leaving the by-unit random slopes for the highest order interactions (see also : Barr 2013) . This left us with by-item random slopes for the interaction between PANAS emotion, concordance, and political party and by-participant random slopes for the interaction between type of headline and concordance. We again assessed how each emotion was associated with belief in fake news and real news, as well as the interaction between news type and emotion.

Looking at the relationship between aggregated positive emotion and belief in news headlines for only participants with above-median positive emotion, we still find that greater positive emotion relates to increased belief in fake headlines (b = 0.23, SE = 0.06, t(135.44) = 3.93, p < 0.001), and that greater positive emotion results in decreased discernment between real and fake news (b = \u2212 0.17, SE = 0.07, t(111.60) = \u2212 2.34, p = 0.021.

(2018) . The general procedure across all four experiments was as follows. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a reason induction (\"Many people believe that reason leads to good decision-making. When we use logic, rather than feelings, we make rationally satisfying decisions. Please assess the news headlines by relying on reason, rather than emotion. \"), an emotion induction (\"Many people believe that emotion leads to good decision-making. When we use feelings, rather than logic, we make emotionally satisfying decisions. Please assess the news headlines by relying on emotion, rather than reason. \"), or a control induction (with the exception of experiment 1, which had no control condition (see Table 3 ); participants in all three conditions first read \"You will be presented with a series of actual news headlines from 2017-2018. We are interested in your opinion about whether the headlines are accurate or not. \"). After reading the induction prompt, participants receive a series of actual headlines that appeared on social media, some of which were factually accurate (real news), some of which were entirely untrue (fake news), some of which were favorable to the Democratic party, and some of which were favorable to the Republican party (based on ratings collected in a pretest, described in Pennycook and Rand 2019a). Fake and real news headlines were selected via a process identical to that described in Study 1. Our news items are available online (https ://osf.io/gm4dp /?view_only=3b375 4d708 6d469 cb421 beb4c 66595 56). For each headline, real or fake, perceived accuracy was assessed. Participants were asked: \"How accurate is the claim in the above headline?\" Likert-scale: 1 = Definitely false, 2 = Probably false, 3 = Possibly false, 4 = Possibly true, 5 = Probably true, 6 = Definitely true. The specific number of fake, real, pro-Democrat, and pro-Republican headlines each participant viewed varied by experiment (see News headlines section of Table 3 ). After rating the headlines, participants completed various post-experimental questionnaires. Most relevant for the current paper, participants were asked if they preferred that Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton was the President of the United States. 5 Pro-Democratic headlines rated by Clinton supporters and Pro-Republican headlines rated by Trump supporters were classified as politically concordant headlines, whereas Pro-Republican headlines rated by Clinton supporters and Prodemocratic headlines rated by Trump supporters were classified as politically discordant headlines.",

First, this substantially improved our statistical power for assessing the relative roles of relying on emotion and relying on reason in the formation of news headline accuracy judgments.

Study was added as a covariate, without interactions. Our maximal linear mixed model failed to converge, so we followed the guidelines for how to achieve convergence in Brauer and Curtin (2018) and removed the by-unit random slopes for within-unit predictors and lower-order interactions, while leaving the by-unit random slopes for the highest order interactions (also see Barr 2013) . As a result, our random effects included intercepts for headline items and participants nested by study; by-item random slopes for the three-way interaction among relative use of reason, concordance, and partisanship; and by-nested participant random slopes for the interaction between type of headline and concordance. The reference levels were \"fake\" for news type, \"Clinton\" for partisanship, and \"discordant\" for concordance. As in our model without partisanship and concordance, we found that relative use of reason was negatively associated with perceived accuracy of fake stories (p < 0.001) and had a significant interaction with type of headline (p < 0.001), such that no relationship was observed between relative use of reason and real news perception, b = 0.01, F(1, 114.61) = 0.12, p = 0.730.

The motivated account of fake news would predict that higher relative reasoners perceive concordant fake news as more accurate as compared to lower relative reasoners. However, we found the opposite: for concordant fake news headlines, relative use of reason was associated with decreased accuracy ratings, b = \u2212 0.09, F(1, 609.63) = 9.72, p = 0.002. Both accounts would predict higher relative reasoners to perceive concordant real news as more accurate. We found that relative use of reason was nominally positively associated with accuracy ratings of concordant real news headlines, b = 0.05, F(1, 600.57) = 3.08, p = 0.080, though this relationship was not statistically significant.",

However, neither of the latter two effects were themselves significant (p > 0.1 for both); thus, we do not think that this three-way interaction is particularly meaningful.

Experiment 2 served as our reference level for study. We included random intercepts by item and by participant nested by study as random effects. We were unable to include random slopes, as no random slopes model was able to converge. We found a joint significant interaction between condition, type of news, and study, F(4, 37,541.93) = 3.00, p = 0.017. This joint significant interaction appeared to be driven by the interaction between the reason condition, type of news, and experiment 4 (p = 0.001). Since experiment 4 utilized a different online platform (Lucid) than the other three experiments (MTurk), we fit a model replacing study with platform as a fixed effect. MTurk was the reference level platform. In this model, we were able to include random slopes by item for the interaction between condition and platform, as well as random slopes for type of news for participants nested by studies. With random slopes, we did not find a significant joint interaction between platform, condition, and type of news, F(2, 35.65) = 2.32, p = 0.113. The interaction between the reason condition, type of news, and platform was only marginally significant (p = 0.050). Taken together, these analyses suggest some evidence of a three-way interaction among study, type of news, and condition. As a result, we performed two separate versions of our main linear mixed-effects analysis looking at the relationship between accuracy, condition, and type of news: one with only our data from experiments 1 through 3 (MTurk) and one with the data from experiment 4 (Lucid). We found that the MTurk-specific results are similar to the results from our aggregated analyses, except the effects are even stronger: a significant effect of condition on fake news, F(2, 88.12) = 5.62, p = 0.005, and a significant interaction between condition and type of news, F(2, 66.37) = 4.83, p = 0.011, were observed. Conversely, our results from only the Lucid experiment were essentially null, with no condition effects. The results of these analyses are presented in the Additional file 1. Our Additional file 1 also include analyses assessing differences in adherence to our causal manipulations across experiments, in which we find adherence to be significantly lower in experiment 4 (Lucid) than in experiments 2 and 3 (MTurk). These results provide tentative evidence that lower adherence to our manipulations on Lucid may explain our null effects on Lucid in experiment 4.",

Our correlational analyses also showed that use of emotion was unrelated to real news accuracy perceptions. Additionally, we found no experimental effect of thinking mode on real news accuracy ratings. Although we only found a marginal overall interaction between condition and type of news headline, the interactions with type of news were significant when comparing emotion vs. control and emotion vs. reason; and the overall interaction was significant when consider the MTurk experiments (no manipulation effects at all were observed on Lucid).

Whereas the motivated account would predict analytic reasoning to increase ideologically motivated belief of politically concordant fake news (see Kahan 2017) , our results show no interaction between condition and concordance. We find no evidence suggesting that people utilize ideologically motivated reasoning to justify believing in fake news; rather, people appear to believe fake news if they rely too heavily on intuitive, emotional thinking. The motivated account would also predict analytic thinking to justify greater belief in concordant real news. However, we do not find a statistically significant association between relative use of reason and perceived accuracy of concordant real news. Our findings support the classical account of fake news perception, which posits that a failure to identify fake news stems from some combination of a lack of analytic, deliberative thinking and heightened reliance on emotion. Therefore, the mechanism by which individuals fall prey to fake news stories closely resembles how people make mistakes on questions such as the bat-and-ball problem from the CRT; that is, people mistakenly \"go with their gut\" when it would be prudent to stop and think more reflectively. Just as the bat-and-ball problem has an intuitive, albeit wrong, answer, evidence suggests that people have an intuitive truth bias (see Bond and DePaulo 2006) , and thus, analytic reasoning aids in overcoming such intuitions in some contexts. Indeed, an abundance of evidence suggests that individuals assume they are being informed of the truth and are bad at identifying lies and misinformation (e.g., Bond and DePaulo 2006; Levine et al. 1999) . This suggests that an over-reliance on intuition-and, specifically, having a reflexively open-minded thinking style (Pennycook and Rand 2019c)-is likely to result in people being more susceptible to believing fake news. As we find, inducing emotional, intuitive reasoning does in fact increase the propensity to believe fake news stories.",

Therefore, susceptibility to fake news appears to be more about increased reliance on emotion rather than decreased analytic thinking. One potential explanation for why our induction of analytic thinking did not improve perceptions of fake news or discernment between real and fake news relative to the control is that participants in the control condition already may have been relying generally more on reason than emotion. This is supported by our manipulation check data, which suggests that people in the emotion condition used emotion relatively more than reason, whereas people in the control and reason conditions used reason relatively more than emotion. Such findings are also consistent with literature suggesting that, on average, fake news does not make up a large proportion of people's media diets but rather is particularly consumed and shared by specific political and demographic groups (Guess et al. 2019 (Guess et al. , 2020 . Our results are largely consistent with the general idea that fake news belief and consumption may be driven by a small share of individuals sharing specific traits-one of which may be extremely heightened reliance on emotion.

However, our current work does not specifically assess the relative emotionality of fake news and real news in the context of accuracy assessments. Indeed, a key feature of fake news may be that it is more emotionally provocative than real news. Therefore, our current research does not control for the arousal or valence of headlines across real and fake stimuli. Instead, the current studies focus on the individual's experience of and reliance on emotion while making media accuracy judgments. An examination of whether heightened reliance on emotion promotes increased belief in fake news because of the increased emotionality of fake news headlines themselves or whether an increased reliance on emotion promotes belief in fake news due to increased gullibility or susceptibility to inaccurate information regardless of the intrinsic emotional arousal or valence of such content is beyond the scope of this study. To reiterate, whether similar results would be found if fake news stimuli were adjusted to have the same emotional content as our real news stimuli remains unclear. An interesting and important future research direction would be to assess the interaction between emotional processing and the emotional content of fake and real news.

Although we find in Study 1 that most emotions measured by the PANAS are associated with increased belief in fake news and decreased ability to discern between real and fake news, we cannot speak to whether the mechanisms behind these relationships are uniform or vary between emotions. A number of studies detail how different emotions are associated with different processing patterns; for instance, positive emotions may facilitate assimilative processing (i.e., changing external information to fit internal representations), whereas negative emotions may be associated with accommodative processing (i.e., changing internal representations to fit external information; see Fiedler and Beier 2014; Bohn-Gettler 2019). However, other models of emotional processing posit that both positive and negative emotions may place limitations on cognitive resources if experiencing such emotions is part of a semantic network (Meinhardt and Pekrun 2003) . Furthermore, even more complex relationships between emotion and cognition may exist and explain our results; for instance, the same emotion may promote different judgments depending on the appraisal of that emotion (e.g., pleasantness/unpleasantness of confidence/doubt appraisal; see Bri\u00f1ol et al. 2018 ). Although we find that both positive and negative emotions are associated with greater belief in fake news, whether uniform or distinct emotional information processes and appraisals drive these results is unclear.",

Emotions and affective responses have been found to be relatively stable over time (Diener and Larsen 1984) , and these stable emotional states thus may reflect general affective personality traits. In our current work, we assess the role of momentary mood states (Study 1) and emotional processing (Study 2) on belief in fake news. However, we do not measure or manipulate traitbased emotions. Future research may examine how traitbased emotions may impact who falls for fake news.",

Although previous work has shown that Amazon Mechanical Turk is a reasonably reliable resource for research on political ideology (Coppock 2019; Krupnikov and Levine 2014; Mullinix et al. 2015) , our samples were not nationally representative and our political ideology comparisons should be interpreted with this in mind. However, when assessing the causal role of reason and emotion in perceiving fake news accuracy, obtaining a nationally representative population may not be as important as sampling from groups of people who are frequent internet and social media users and therefore likely encounter fake news stories more regularly. Thus, Mechanical Turk may be an even more appropriate resource than a nationally representative sample. Nevertheless, how our findings may generalize to different populations is unclear. In experiment 4, which utilized a more nationally representative sample via Lucid, we found no effect of condition on fake news perception or on media truth discernment. However, this was not a precisely estimated null, as it was also not significantly different from the overall estimate. Additionally, the null effect may have been caused by Lucid participants being less attentive than MTurkers, rather than due to their differential demographic characteristics, as Lucid participants are perhaps less professionalized than the MTurk population (Coppock and McClellan 2019) . Indeed, we find that adherence to our emotion and reason manipulations is significantly lower in study 4 (Lucid) than in studies 2 or 3 (MTurk). However, whether the manipulation used in our study is effective across samples from different online recruitment platforms remains unclear. Future work should identify whether the effects we found in our MTurk data generalize to other platforms.",

The current results show that emotion plays a causal role in people's susceptibility to incorrectly perceiving fake news as accurate. Contrary to the popular motivated cognition account, our findings indicate that people fall for fake news, in part, because they rely too heavily on emotion, not because they think in a motivated or identity-protective way. This suggests that interventions that are directed at making the public less emotional consumers of news media may have promise in reducing belief in fake news.",
