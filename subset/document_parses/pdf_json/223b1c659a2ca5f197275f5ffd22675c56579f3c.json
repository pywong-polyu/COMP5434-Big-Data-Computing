Improving health in cities is inevitably one of the main targets of the 21st century's public health policy agenda as they currently host more than half of the global population and generate over 80% of the global gross domestic product (Urban Development Overview, n.d; Zhang, 2011) . Large cities, such as New York, Milan, Madrid, and Paris have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (Bouffanais and Lim, 2020; CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020; Riccardo et al., 2020; Salje et al., 2020; ) , suggesting that public health measures tailored to city needs must to be considered. In the first few months of the pandemic, a suite of public health measures notably \"blanket\"/population-wide nonpharmacological measures were deployed to contain and mitigate the spread of the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 , including wide governmental lockdowns (Chu et al., 2020) . This pandemic response sparked numerous discussions about the timing, the extent and proportionality of public health measures, as well as ethical debates, while guidelines and advice were (and still are) continuously adjusted, as further evidence becomes available.",

The characteristics of the urban environment also shape the urban exposome, a complementary concept to the human exposome, which views the city as the unit of measurement (Andrianou and Makris, 2018) . The urban exposome has been defined as the qualitative and quantitative assessment of environment and health indicators that describe the framing and evolution of urban health and its interactions with urban infrastructure, climate, and small area (neighborhood) features (Andrianou and Makris, 2018) . During the pandemic, another parameter has been added to the network of environmental components that comprise the human exposome and that is the pathogen itself (SARS-CoV-2), increasing both individual and population disease risk in the urban setting. At the same time, non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as lockdowns have been widely implemented to tackle SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Such NPI may both indirectly or directly impact and modify the exposome profile of individuals, life in the city and population exposures. Therefore, there is a combined effect of the pandemic on individual, population and urban exposomes.",

These sitespecific approaches are needed to apply measures in a proportionate way while allowing for quick identification of COVID-19 cases and for limiting the risk of transmission. The choice of the most appropriate response approach is critical, since parameters that contribute to increases in cases or new outbreaks in different geographic areas may vary, exhibiting differential impact in areas of the same urban center. The complexities of deploying public health measures in urban settings during the pandemic highlights and reinforces the need to reach across borders of scientific disciplines that are traditionally considered to be separate in research efforts. Cross-and trans-disciplinary approaches allow the scientific community to integrate knowledge, methods, and tools towards evaluating the complexity of the urban environment and the societies from different disciplinary perspectives, thus allowing public health threats to be addressed more comprehensively.",

We searched for records with in-text mentions of the terms \"exposome\" and \"infectious diseases\" or \"communicable\", or combinations of different keywords related to specific infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, measles, antimicrobial, food-, water-or vector-borne) published until September 13, 2020. The majority (40 out of 61) of studies were reviews, commentaries and editorials. Among them, only 18 were original research studies (either observational or experimental) and three of them were protocols or descriptions of cohorts discussing infectious diseases in the scope of addressing other objectives. Although this was not a systematic review of the literature on the topic, it illustrated the level of attention infectious diseases have received among exposome studies. Notwithstanding, there were two studies that included measurements of pathogens as exposures in personal exposure monitoring schemes (Ciss\u00e9 et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2018) . Moreover, infectious diseases have been described as components of the mixture of exposures in association with physiological aspects of infection to SARS-CoV-2 in a commentary and a review article (Land, 2020; Naughton et al., 2020) . So far, the exposome concept has predominantly found use in exposure science and environmental health. In this context, the exposome and its urban exposome \"extension\" provide us with a theoretical framework, where infectious diseases can be integrated within a broader urban health and environmental health research niche.",

The public health measures that were taken to restrict mobility and the number and duration of contacts at home, school and work or in other social events towards decreasing virus transmission modified also a suite of other individual and urban exposures (general and specific external exposome domains). For example, restrictions in public transportation and/or travel led to less people commuting, thus affecting their exposure to outdoor air pollution. In addition, closure of workplaces (e.g. construction) led to workers being less exposed to potentially hazardous substances typically experienced in the industry. Mandatory lifestyle changes, such as having to work or study at home coupled with fewer on average contacts might have also affected mental health outcomes, while staying more at home (increasing exposures to indoor air), or using more cleaning/disinfection products might have led to increased chemical exposures e.g. to disinfection by-products Li et al., 2020) . Upon school closures, education for many moved to online platforms, thereby adversely impacting learning opportunities for students with limited access to such technologies. At the same time, the routine implementation of public health activities, such as vector control or immunization programs might have faced interruptions, leading to possible increase in vector-borne diseases or decreased vaccination uptake, respectively. In cities/towns, most, if not all facilities, infrastructures, transportation systems and networks had to adapt to the new reality of the pandemic. Together, the above examples highlight that the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and response measures to counteract viral transmission have invoked a complex feedback loop in the system of exposures that comprise the exposome framework (Fig. 1) .",

Being exposed to any pathogen is only one step in a sequence of events that could lead to infection and ill health. However, the risk of exposure to the pathogen, the risks of ultimately acquiring the infection and the severity of the infection are a function of multiple parameters that could be grouped together, based on the three exposome domains, into the general external domain, specific external domain, and internal domain (Fig. 1) .",

In the same city, the number of residential units in each building, the mean assessed price of each unit and the neighborhood median household income were inversely related with the probability of infection with SARS-CoV-2, while the neighborhood unemployment rate, the neighborhood household membership and crowding rate all positively increased the probability of infection among pregnant women (Emeruwa et al., 2020) . In another study using data from 50 cities around the globe, results showed that transmission in urban areas was restricted in specific latitude, temperature and humidity windows, suggesting that COVID-19 transmission might be partially driven by environmental determinants (Sajadi et al., 2020) . Given the accumulating evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes evident once more that it is important to simultaneously integrate the effects of multiple risk factors on public health measures and NPI strategies applied within the urban setting.",

The variability in individual and population risk of infection (and its severity) highlights the importance of considering methodological frameworks and approaches that go beyond the reductionist, one-size-fits-all approaches. The application of exposome-based approaches requires the integration of data from various sources and through different data flows. For example, already established ongoing routine surveillance or environmental tracking/ monitoring systems could provide secondary data that can be combined with primary data from ad hoc studies. It should be emphasized here that proper harmonization of primary and secondary data sources should be adequately practiced when used in answering specific research questions or used for hypothesis generation. Comprehensive frameworks such as that of the exposome offer alternatives for better managing public health crises of the future. At the individual level, the new knowledge on COVID-19 reinforces the impact of co-morbidities in disproportionally increasing risk of infection (Grasselli et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020) . At the population level, both susceptibility and broader co-existence of environmental exposures e.g. air pollution or different socioeconomic background could exacerbate disease risks and access to healthcare for certain vulnerable groups and confound, improve or affect the effectiveness of control options due to urban systems complexity (Azar et al., 2020; Khoury et al., 1989; Wu et al., 2020) . For example, individuals in unique windows of susceptibility to health hazards, such as pregnancy, childhood, those with pre-existing illness, or elderly, usually present with higher disease risk due to non-genetic exogenous agents (chemicals, drugs, stress, etc.), which may further aggravate immune function or induce immunosuppression. This may render such individuals even more susceptible to additional downstream end points of disease, such as, lower routine vaccine antibodies counts following vaccination, or hormonal deficits, or occurrence of opportunistic infections (Grandjean et al., 2012; Woodruff et al., 2008) . The exposome approach could find use in monitoring the phenotypic variance of the urban population characteristics before, during, and after epidemics. This would consider the numerous individual exposome components (e.g. unhealthy eating, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, occupation, socioeconomic status, disinfectant use, anxiety, other personal environmental exposures, etc.) and their potential clustering into focused exposure groups (e.g., climate, natural and built environment, air pollutants, diet, infectious agents, lifestyle, behaviors) (Haddad et al., 2019).

The ample availability of tools and methods and the benefit of integrated exposome approaches come along with a great responsibility for researchers and stakeholders as they are in charge of identifying opportunities, performing operational and basic research, communicating limitations and uncertainty and translating results to public health practices. It might not be feasible to deploy all available technological and methodological innovations due to data availability or the lack of technical capacity in different settings. When tools and methods are not available to build capacity or to develop the necessary tools and foster innovation for new methods, prioritization and hierarchy of needs should be warranted depending on the local/regional needs. Using a case by case scenario, the cost and logistics of organizing and coordinating such efforts need to be balanced against anticipated benefits. Additionally, all new technologies that seem promising in terms of data collection efficiency, e.g. (geo)tracking technologies and personal identification systems or digital contact tracing could bring forward sensitive issues with respect to privacy, data protection and ethical risks that must not be neglected. A cost-benefit analysis was out of scope for this article, however, it is obvious that when the wider use of such exposomic tools and technologies is practiced, then their cost is expected to decrease. Lastly, communication and interpretation of data and results with various stakeholders needs to be done in a timely and trustful manner that fosters further collaborations and efficient implementation of outputs in practice.",

The unprecedented crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic brought up changes in the way we live our lives, the way we work/study, and the way we socialize, thus, impacting on the human exposome and the resilience of cities to manage epidemics of high magnitude. New epidemic waves of COVID-19 are anticipated along with the emergence of other new infectious diseases that threaten global health and security, particularly in urban settings.",

Given the experiences acquired so far and the capacity built while responding to COVID-19, large scale, population-wide measures may not be practical or necessary, while more site-specific approaches will be considered based on the so far generated knowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the need to better understand the risk variation and the cost-efficacy of measures and interventions against the disease spread that might present with area-stratified or socioeconomic status-stratified population risk of infection within urban settings. In order for the interventions to become more effective and efficient in protecting susceptible/high risk groups (e.g., elderly), all exposome components that shape the urban environment and define public health response within a city need to be integrated to offer science-based guidance for risk assessment and sitespecific decision making and to provide tailored responses that can quickly become operational. Therefore, the application of a comprehensive framework, such as that of the exposome, could lead to better tailoring and evaluating the effectiveness of public health measures. This may be achieved via the integrated description and evaluation of a suite of exposome components in various areas of a city where health disparities and other risk factors (e.g. co-exposure to chemicals, pollution etc.) often prevail.",

Such efforts will inevitably be proven useful to accompany already established prevention and control measures for infectious diseases. To aid response in urban settings and understand the dynamics that shape health in cities, the environmental features of small areas (e. g. at neighborhood level) need to be fully characterized using the urban exposome framework. The interactions of risk factors of the urban community with the local determinants of infectious disease spread and containment should be better delineated to establish improved response programs for high-risk and vulnerable subpopulation groups. The exposome framework is the featured concept that could simultaneously integrate both environmental and (epi)genetic variants and other health determinants in the same urban study. Such approaches could entail the spatiotemporal integration of hierarchically important clusters of infectious disease risk factors and their linked networks of urban parameters, feeding into preparedness and response measures. The exposome utility and its tools may also find use in the formulation of site-specific public health measures in urban communities of varying risk and exposure profiles.",
