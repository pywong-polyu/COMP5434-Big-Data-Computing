Applying Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) and quantile regressions to panel data and country-specific socioeconomic background data from 53 African countries, the study finds that enhancing capacity for early testing helps for timeous uncovering of cases, early isolation and contact tracing for effective control of the spread. Other factors such as managing of international movements through reduction of international exposure and ensuring better sanitation and hygiene were found to be relevant in diminishing COVID-19 spread, whereas alcohol consumption and population density heighten the spread. The work also highlights that stringent measures will be counter-productive unless they are coupled with measures to create and preserve livelihoods, together with humanitarian relief assistance to the poorest segments of the population. The results are robust to alternative techniques.",

By early March, Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Togo and Tunisia had reported over 40 cases. By early August 2020, there were a million cases and 22,000 deaths, according to Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC, 2020) . Figure 1 shows the evolution of the aggregate total and new cases in Africa from February 2020. Both new and cumulative cases rose steadily from February to a peak of new cases around the end of July 2020, when it began to fall. New cases came to a minimum of 7507 cases per day by the end of September 2020. From there, it began to rise again to a current 24,568 per day as of 4 January 2021. Cumulative cases have risen quite steadily to above 2 million by January 2021. South Africa accounts for 39% of current African cases, with cumulative infections of 1.1 million, representing an infection incidence of 18,772 cases per million population. Morocco is the second highest, accounting for 15.8% of cases in Africa, followed by Tunisia, Egypt and Ethiopia. The top 10 countries with the highest current cases account for 86.2% of all Africa's cumulative infections. It is also worth noting that these countries have the highest testing rate in the sample.",

However, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2020), the health care system of the African continent is weak, and the population seen as immunocompromised, due to economic deprivations, malnutrition and comorbidities. Coupled with the significant inequities in African health systems, a number of critical levers recommended for COVID-19 control are not within reach to African health policy makers. For example, weak health care and public health systems hinder the abilities to test, isolate, quarantine, treat and trace contacts. Consequently, my calculation based on available data show that only 46% of countries undertake effective and consistent testing. For most African countries, the only available curtailing options are closures of international frontiers, partial or complete lockdown of among others, businesses, schools and social services. These have been accompanied by mandatory wearing of masks, social distancing and self-quarantine. Such measures are usually less adhered to, due to deprivations and weak government capacity to enforce.",

This problem is much more precarious for poorer African countries, with limited resources, high levels of socioeconomic vulnerability and poverty coupled with weak governance mechanisms.

Another mechanism is the disinhibition channel (K\u00e4llm\u00e9n & Gustafson, 1998; Steele & Southwick, 1985) , postulating that sober individuals' behaviours are inhibited, but when influenced by alcohol the inhibitions weaken, leading to less control over behaviour.

As discussed in the introduction, the set of levers for most African countries is quite limited and stringency measures become the only options in most cases.

However, the sum of the coefficients remains positive (0.036). A 1% increase in international air transport passengers carried and international tourism arrivals results in 0.81% and 0.64% increases in COVID-19 infections respectively. The implication is that the countries who responded by closing borders would have reduced infections by 0.036% on average. However, it is important to balance this on the loss of revenue and livelihood based on the fact that most developing economies, especially of Africa, depend heavily on international movements and tourism. As the elasticity of economic deprivation (0.686%) is higher than the net effect of international exposure, a carefully balanced act is needed by governments in their attempt to both curb the spread of the disease and preserve livelihoods. Urban population density and median age have positive and significant coefficients. National population density and share of over-65 population have negative and significant coefficients. A percentage increase in urban population density results in a 3.2% increase in cumulative infections, but a percentage increase in national population density leads to 0.84% reduction in cumulative infections. The United Nations, in its 2014 urbanization report, projected that Africa's urban population will grow from 395 million in 2010 to 1.34 billion in 2050, accounting for 21% of the world's urban population (UN, 2014). Africa's urbanization trend is on track; however, due to economic underdevelopment and infrastructure gaps, most of Africa's urban population are in poverty and living in slumps. The projected urbanization trend may spell challenges unless a significant upgrade of health and other social and economic infrastructure is undertaken. Although a good share of Africa's population is rural, the urban density is the highest in the world, meaning that the small share of population living in cities are too close together, coupled with limited social and health infrastructure (Figure 3 ).",

Although the timing of lockdown measures matter, accompanying supportive measures are very important. It appears that the stringent lockdowns increased desperation due to deprivations, which inevitably led to citizens not respecting the conditions. Policy levers are limited for most African countries, leaving stringency measures as the only option. Without livelihood succour for citizens, stringency would exacerbate the spread. African countries have to spend more on appropriate pro-poor socioeconomic infrastructure to empower the deprived, but also save enough for disaster-relieving social assistance.",

By 2050, Africa will account for 21% of the world's urban population. Due to economic underdevelopment and infrastructure gaps, most of Africa's urban population are in poverty and living in slums. The projected urbanization trend may spell challenges if urbanization is not accompanied by a significant upgrade of health and other social and economic infrastructures. Although a good share of Africa's population is rural, the urban density is the highest in the world, meaning that the small share of population living in cities are too close together, coupled with limited social and health infrastructure. Management of urban spaces and ensuring adequate urban infrastructure and habitat is key. The movement-restricting measures can only prove effective to the extent that citizens' livelihoods are somehow preserved or some form of assistance is made available. Restricting population movements without considering other unintended socioeconomic effects will weaken the impact of lowering population dynamics. If a country persists long enough in restrictions of local movements, adverse socioeconomic conditions kick in and many citizens start violating the lockdown measures unless effective socioeconomic support is given. Therefore, measures to contain internal population dynamics has to be accompanied by some socioeconomic support, especially if these measures are to last long.",

The more sanitation measures are taken at the higher levels of infections, the more reduction in infections are obtained. As the future of global health may be marked quite periodically by various infectious diseases, this study recommends that in normal times, good hygiene practices should be inculcated into the behavioural aspects of African citizens. Policy measures should ensure that such good sanitation programmes should become a lifestyle of a society. This is the kind of measure that can prove very effective in flattening the infectious curve of the current pandemic and reduce the exposure of a population to future similar pandemics. This finding has significant implications in raising the awareness of African governments in respect of provision of clean water services to every community, together with programmes for lifestyle change towards good hygiene and sanitation practices.",

            "text": "The use of alcohol can be strongly associated with social gatherings and other social practices that expose much of African's population to the disease. In terms of the spread of an infectious pandemic like COVID-19, countries with less alcohol consumption per capita will tend to have a relatively slower spread of the disease. Alcohol consumption can alter an individual's sense of caution, and result in riskier behaviour that would lead to higher exposure to the disease. Alcohol can also lead to higher levels of contacts through associated social relationships, hence exposing a population to higher levels of infection. Despite this finding, on the one hand, banning alcohol altogether may lead to more agitations in the population due to the addictive nature of alcohol, and hence lead to higher effect of population dynamics on the spread of disease. On the other hand, allowing the uncontrolled use of alcohol would clearly lead to higher infection rates. The solution for countries could therefore be an optimally controlled allowance of alcohol accompanied by restrictions in public places of drinking. The fact that the alcohol economy forms part of most African countries' national business activities and informal livelihood, especially in the urban areas, is also a concern. Diversifying individuals' livelihood away from the alcohol business can prove useful in times of pandemics.",

The results of the analyses highlight a number of findings that bear on public health policy design. The findings show that: enhancing for early testing helps to discover more cases, but also helps in isolation of those cases and tracing contacts in time for effective control of the spread, so that later on, less infections may be recorded. Testing therefore plays some role in flattening the curve. Tailoring government stringency actions in a way that reduces the possibility of stifling the livelihoods of the poor, and accompanying them with some social assistance for effectiveness. Preparedness for managing of international movements NGEPAH | S57 through reduction of international exposure can prove very effective in managing the rate of spread and giving room for health systems to cope. However, the fact that international tourism arrivals is the main channel of impact show that there is a great deal of socioeconomic trade-off to be made by African governments in respect of international travel restrictions. Managing population dynamics is good for curbing infections but restricting population movements without considering other unintended socioeconomic effects will weaken the impact of lowering population dynamics. Ensuring better sanitation and hygiene practices is one of the most important factors in curbing the spread of a pandemic like COVID-19. Policy measures that ensure good sanitation programmes, if they become a lifestyle of a society, will prove very effective in flattening the infectious curve of the current pandemic, and reduce the exposure of African populations to future similar pandemics. Reducing alcohol use also helps in curbing infections. Alcohol use can lead to higher levels of contacts through associated social relationships, hence exposing a population to higher levels of infection. Diversifying urban informal livelihoods to rely less on the alcohol economy will prove effective in case of restrictions or bans on alcohol to curb the spread of pandemics. In light of the significant role of economic deprivations in spreading infections among African populations, the finding calls for a very fine balancing act in the control of alcohol use. Policy measures must ensure that sustainable livelihoods are created and guaranteed for the poorest segments of the population.",
