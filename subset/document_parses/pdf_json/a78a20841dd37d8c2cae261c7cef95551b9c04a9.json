Aged women are at higher risk of osteoporosis, partly because of estrogen deficiency. However, the underlying mechanism of how estrogen deficiency affects osteoclast activity has not yet been well elucidated. In this study, GSE2208 and GSE56815 datasets were downloaded from GEO database with 25 PreH BMD women and 25 PostL BMD women in total. The RRA algorithm determined 38 downregulated DEGs and 30 upregulated DEGs. Through GO analysis, we found that downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in myeloid cell differentiation, cytokine-related functions while upregulated DEGs enriched in immune-related biological processes; pathways like Notch signaling and MAPK activation were found in KEGG/Rectome pathway database; a PPI network which contains 66 nodes and 91 edges was constructed and three Modules were obtained by Mcode; Correlation analysis helped us to find highly correlated genes in each module. Moreover, three hub genes FOS, PTPN6, and CTSD were captured by Cytohubba. Finally, the hub genes were further confirmed in blood monocytes of ovariectomy (OVX) rats by real-time PCR assay. In conclusion, the integrative bioinformatics analysis and real-time PCR analysis were utilized to offer fresh light into the role of monocytes in premenopausal osteoporosis and identified FOS, PTPN6, and CTSD as potential biomarkers for postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

Osteoblasts are the major cellular components of bone, derived from mesenchymal stem cells, and abundant in periosteum, the thin connective tissue layer on the outer surface of bone and the intima (10) . They deposit new bone minerals through a mechanism that has not yet been fully described. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells derived from bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. They have highly active ion channels on the membrane and can pump protons into the extracellular space, thereby reducing the pH of their own microenvironment to promote bone resorption (11) .

The de-ovulatory rat osteoporosis model replicates estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss and shows postmenopausal osteoporosis clinical symptoms (18) . Furthermore, it was reported that six months is the optimal time to induce OVX. The success of OVX can be verified 1-3 weeks after surgery, when the normal estrous cycle is stopped, estradiol, progesterone, and uterine weight are decreased, and LH and FSH levels are increased (19) .

To make sure the outcomes are clear and intuitive, the upregulated DEGs and downregulated DEGs were analyzed separately in GO enrichment. The downregulated genes, the results revealed that myeloid cell differentiation which is significantly enriched in GO analysis, are highly associated with the emergence of monocytes and granulocytes. Additionally the complicated biological processes, namely, regulation of cytokine biosynthetic process, cytokine biosynthetic process, and cytokine metabolic process, have all been linked to osteoporosis. In the upregulated genes, immune-related processes, namely, neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation involved in immune response, neutrophil activation, neutrophil mediated immunity, and immunoglobulin binding, have long been recognized to have a relationship with the skeletal systems. There were fourteen pathways significantly enriched in robust DEGs. Notch signaling pathway is of great importance in Human Skeletal Diseases, and collagen degradation, to a large extent, affecting the balance of bone formation and bone resorption. Moreover, the immune system mediated by PD-1 signaling and the activation of MAPK signaling pathway are also involved in bone regulation.

A diagram exhibited how we validate our results of hub genes ( Figure 7A ). We confirmed that the OVX model was successfully established through the m-CT analysis femur of the SD rat three months later after surgery, and the femur 1.5 mm thick below the growth plate was used for analysis of bone cortex and cancellous bone. The m-CT analysis results showed that the OVX group had fewer trabeculae than the sham group, whereas there was little difference in bone cortex ( Figure 7B) . Meanwhile, the mRNA of monocytes isolated from whole blood was used to detect the expression of those three hub genes (FOS, CTSD, and PTPN6) that we found by bioinformatics analysis, and the realtime PCR results showed that the mRNA expression level of the three hub genes in OVX group was lower than that in the sham group ( Figures 7C-E) . These results are consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results, indicating that the hub genes may be used as biomarkers of PMOP. However, the exact mechanism needs to be further elucidated.",

            "text": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a complex bone metabolism disorder characterized by the loss of bone minerals and an increased risk of bone fracture. PMOP is recognized as a metabolism disease which is caused by the imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption after estrogen deficiency. In previous studies, many susceptibility genes for PMOP (35, 36) , especially cytokines and osteoprotegerin, which are involved in bone remodeling balance, have been identified. It is well known that TNF-a has been shown to affect bone metabolisms by promoting osteoclast differentiation and inhibiting osteoblast differentiation (37) . Spon1 may play an important role in the etiology of PMOP (20) . However, the use of RRA to detect DEGS in PMOP has not been reported. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the cause of this disease and to find potential treatments by identifying the susceptibility gene of PMOP. This study was the first to search and combine microarrays on PMOP in GEO, in particular, the detection and analysis of blood monocytes, which has not been studied in previous research. It is well known that blood monocytes are precursors of osteoclasts (38) , and blood monocytes can secrete a number of potent cytokines important for osteoclast differentiation, activation, and apoptosis (39) . The aim of our research was to identify key genes and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of PMOP. Therefore, two microarrays were included in our studies, gene expression profiles of PMOP were compared with controls, and the RRA analysis was adopted to integrate results with more statistical power. Furthermore, PPI network construction and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment were performed to understand the potential biological function of the DEGs. Meanwhile, hub genes were calculated for further study. There were 68 DEGs filtered out from two datasets with 38 downregulated genes and 30 upregulated. FOS, PTPN6, and CTSD were the most significant genes among these DEGs, which were identified as hub genes by PPI network analysis. As we all know, FOS is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which is a central regulator for many physiological functions. In osteoimmunology, Fos/AP-1, as osteoclastogenic transcription factor, plays a critical role in inflammatory bone loss by regulating genes like NFATc1 and also the interferon system (40) (41) (42) . In the previous study, Sugatani found a positive feedback loop of c-Fos/miR-21/PDCD4, which regulates osteoclastogenesis (43) . Besides, the FOS-related protein Fra-2 controls osteoclast size and survival (44) .",

Moreover, PTPN6 can regulate the activity of over 50 cytoplasmic signaling proteins and cell surface receptors. It has been reported that PTPN6 mediated autophagy contributes to the inhibition of macrophage foam cell formation by the D3-VDR-PTPN6 axis (46) , and participates in the epigenetic regulation mechanism of advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (47) . Besides, PTPN6 was upregulated in the coculture system which consists of primary myeloma and healthy donor hematopoietic bone marrow, indicating that PTPN6 plays an important role in microenvironment interactions (48) . Another hub gene, CTSD, which is one of the major lysosomal proteases indispensable for the maintenance of cellular proteostasis by turning over substrates of endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.

We found that PTPN6, CTSD, and FOS from blood monocytes in the OVX group were lower than that in the control group, which is consistent with our bioinformatic analysis results. However, monocytes isolated from the whole blood of older women may yield different sequencing data than OVX rats. It is a pity that we cannot get sequencing data from monocytes of humans because of strict social rules and ethical requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide a new target for further research on the role of blood monocytes in the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, the occurrence of postmenopausal osteoporosis involves estrogen level, immune factors, osteoblast activity, and many other factors. It will be worthwhile to further study the roles of PTPN6, CTSD, and FOS in other cells or biological processes except osteoclasts, and explore their significance in the occurrence and development of osteoporosis from the perspective of proteomics and protein modification omics.

Has a critical function in regulating the development of cells destined to form and maintain the skeleton. It is thought to have an important role in signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation.Modulates signaling by tyrosine phosphorylated cell surface receptors such as KIT and the EGF receptor/EGFR.
