            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although previous studies have described the clinical aspects of COVID-19, few studies have focused on the early detection of severe COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of severe COVID-19 and to compare clinical features between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with less severe COVID-19. Patients admitted to designated hospital in the Henan Province of China who were either discharged or died prior to February 15, 2020 were enrolled retrospectively. Additionally, patients who underwent at least one of the following treatments were assigned to the severe group: continuous renal replacement therapy, high-flow oxygen absorption, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining patients were assigned to the non-severe group. Demographic information, initial symptoms, and first visit examination results were collected from the electronic medical records and compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of severe COVID-19. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify a threshold for each predictor. Altogether,104 patients were enrolled in our study with 30 and 74 patients in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that patients aged \ufffd63 years (odds ratio = 41.0; 95% CI: 2.8, 592.4), with an absolute lymphocyte value of \ufffd1.02\u00d710 9 /L (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 25.2) and a C-reactive protein level of \ufffd65.08mg/L (odds ratio = 8.9; 95% CI = 1.0, 74.2) were at a higher risk of severe illness. Thus, our results could be helpful in the early detection of patients at risk for severe illness, enabling the implementation of effective interventions and likely lowering the morbidity of COVID-19 patients.",

The threshold for age was 63 years, as indicated in the ROC curve analysis. The threshold age is a predictor for an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In addition, our multivariate logistic regression analysis implied that patients who are older than 63 years are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 (OR: 41.0). The trends indicated in our study are similar to those indicated in previous studies [10] . Moreover, studies show that immune responses in older adults are slower, less coordinated, and less efficient, rendering older adults more susceptible to emerging infections [11] .

The percentage of patients suffering from CVD was higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group. These results have been verified by epidemic reports from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [13] . As in previous studies, the principal symptoms of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms. Some patients also suffer significant cardiovascular damage from COVID-19. Coupled with underlying CVD, these complications may increase the risk of death for some patients. COVID-19 results from a spike protein in the virus binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is highly expressed in the heart and lung tissue. A contributing factor to severe COVID-19 in patient with CVD may be the increased concentration of ACE2 in these patients. As the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may result in acute myocarditis and heart failure, acute coronary syndrome patients infected with the novel coronavirus are at an increased risk of cardiac insufficiency that might lead to severe COVID-19 or death [14] .",

Some patients also experienced dizziness (8.7%), a runny nose (8.7%), nasal obstruction (6.7%), and diarrhea (6.7%). These numbers are similar to those described in previous studies [15, 16] . Our study indicates that in 76.0% of the patients, the initial symptom was fever. In addition, 92.3% of the patients had fever during the inpatient period; of those, all patients with severe COVID-19 had fever. As shown in previous studies, although only 43.8% of the patients had fever on admission, 88.7% of all patients had fever during hospitalization [17] . This implies that fever did not present as an initial symptom in all COVID-19 patients; nonetheless, fever occurred as pneumonia symptoms developed. Fever that developed as a result of critical pulmonary infection was frequently observed in patients with severe COVID-19; therefore, temperature monitoring should not be the only screening measure for COVID-19. We suggest that in addition to temperature monitoring, the patient's contact history and symptoms should be examined to identify individuals who require observation. A higher number of patients showed signs of dyspnea in the severe group than in the non-severe group in our study, indicating that dyspnea was one of the main symptoms among patients with severe COVID-19; thus, a daily evaluation for dyspnea should be conducted among COVID-19 patients. Wang et al. suggest that more frequent chest CT scans should be performed for patients with severe dyspnea to understand the changes and indications in pulmonary imaging [18] . All cases in our COVID-19 study had a decreased lymphocyte count on admission; patients in the severe group had even lower absolute lymphocyte values, as indicated by a median of 0.91 (IQR = 0.59-1.1)\u00d710^9/L. Similar changes in the lymphocyte counts were observed in patients with SARS [19, 20] . A previous study regarding lymphocyte subsets indicated that COVID-19 patients had reduced count of total lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 cases had lower counts than non-severe cases [21] . A study by Qin et al. suggests that COVID-19 might damage lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes; consequently, the immune system is impaired during the course of the disease [22] .The coefficients from our multivariate regression analysis indicated that patients with an absolute lymphocyte value of \ufffd1.02\u00d710^9/L have an increased risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 (OR = 6.1). This implies that a decrease in the lymphocyte count should be a key predictor in the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19. Research on SARS has shown similar results; a decrease in the lymphocyte count could be an early warning of severe disease [23, 24] .",

The risk of developing severe COVID-19 in patients with a serum CRP of \ufffd65.08 mg/L is 8.9 times than in patients with a serum CRP\ufffd65.08 mg/L. At elevated concentrations, CRP, which is an acute-phase protein, is correlated with an increased risk of organ failure and death for patients admitted to the ICU. Further, prolonged periods of high CRP concentrations are associated with adverse outcomes [25] . Previous research in Wuhan indicated that increased levels of CRP were indicative of a sustained inflammatory response subsequent to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, patients with severe COVID-19 had more prominent inflammation [26] . Similar trends of elevated serum CRP were also found in SARS patients [27] ; a previous study shows that a CRP concentration of > 47.5mg/L is correlated with an increased risk of death for SARS patients (OR = 5.8) [28] .",
