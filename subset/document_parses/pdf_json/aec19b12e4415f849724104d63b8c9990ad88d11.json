Up to half the travelling population experience a health problem related to overseas travel, and approximately 5% require medical attention. 1 A recent review of admissions to an Australian tertiary care hospital following travel showed respiratory tract infections to be the second commonest cause of illness after gastrointestinal infections and the second most common cause of fever behind malaria. 2 Travel on commercial aircraft might be a high-risk environment for transmission of infectious diseases. Confined space, limited ventilation, prolonged exposure times and recirculating air, all common to air travel, are demonstrated risk factors for the transmission of upper respiratory tract infections in other settings and create the potential for the spread of respiratory pathogens during flight. 3 The debate regarding infectious disease transmission and air travel has centred on whether cabin ventilation systems, particularly those that involve the now-standard 50% recirculated air, contribute to the transmission of airborne diseases.",

            "text": "The two main transmission routes for respiratory infections are by droplet spread and by the airborne route. Droplet spread involves relatively large droplets containing organisms that settle out of the air quickly. It requires direct contact of droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking onto the mucous membranes of recipients for transmission, necessitating contact at close range (usually within 1 m). The common cold is an example of an infection spread predominantly by this route. Airborne transmission involves dissemination of tiny suspensions of microbial particles (droplet nuclei) that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods. Droplet nuclei are usually 1-10 \u00b5m in size, can disperse widely and rapidly in closed environments with a recirculation ventilation system and can easily be drawn into the bronchioles of recipients' respiratory tracts. Transmission by this route can lead to infections in a large number of people. Tuberculosis (TB) and smallpox can spread in this way. Some infections, such as influenza and measles, can be spread by both routes, but are predominantly spread by the indirect airborne route. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is predominantly spread by droplets, but airborne transmission and transmission by contact with contaminated fomites can also occur. 4 Anecdotally, many people complain of respiratory symptoms following air travel that could be from acquisition of infection, but could alternatively be associated with other factors inherent in flight, such as lowered barometric pressure, hypoxia and low humidity. 5, 6 Breathing low-humidity air for prolonged periods, for example, can result in dry mucous membranes of the nose and throat, which can lead to respiratory tract irritation. 7 The recent advent of SARS brought the issue of potential transmission of infections on board aircraft back into the limelight. Thus, it is timely to review the potential role of air travel in the spread of respiratory infections. Aspects of the aircraft cabin environment that influence the potential transmission of respiratory pathogens on airplanes will be outlined here and then the Internal Medicine Journal 2005; 35: 50-55 evidence for the occurrence of outbreaks of respiratory illness among airline passengers will be reviewed.",

Viruses are usually 0.01-0.10 \u00b5m in size, but generally form clumps or attach to larger dust particles so are also usually trapped in the filters. 7 Thus, the use of HEPA-type filters in aircraft cabin pressurization systems means that 99.9% of bacteria and viruses produced by aircraft passengers are removed from cabin air. 8, 9 Because both air from outside the aircraft and recirculated air are free of microbial agents, the cabin air is essentially sterile. It has a relative humidity of 10-20% and a temperature of 18-30\u00b0C. Relative humidity can influence microorganism numbers: a low relative humidity will generally be beneficial for viral growth, as relative humidity and survival are inversely related for viruses, but bacteria will not thrive in a low relative humidity environment. 9 Air then enters the distribution pipework for delivery to the cabin. Cabin air is taken from below the floor of the aircraft to the overhead cabin ventilation system, which runs the length of the cabin. The ventilation system is usually designed so that air entering the cabin at a given seat row is exhausted at the same seat row. This limits the amount of air flowing in the fore and aft directions (i.e. towards the front and back of the aircraft, respectively), which also helps minimize infection risk.",

Because air flow is generally from top to bottom, with little if any front to back flow, and because respiratory pathogens are diluted by frequent air exchanges, passengers at most risk are those in close proximity to the infected passenger, with minimal risk for others.

The study found the reported rates of a cold and/or runny nose were similar, suggesting that aircraft cabin air recirculation does not increase the risk for upper respiratory symptoms. 3 A few studies have examined microbial contaminants in cabin air and have found no evidence for increased disease transmission on board commercial aircraft than if equivalent time had been spent on any other form of public transport or in other public places. 12, 13 One study assessing the health risks of air pollutants, including bacteria and fungi, found that levels of organisms measured in the airline cabin were lower than that required to pose a risk of illness. 14 A recent study found bacterial and fungal counts in aircraft to be a log concentration below that found on city buses, in shopping malls and in the outside air. 10 Another study found only very low levels of viable organisms during regular checks of cultures from cabin air. 8 Thus, the risk of disease transmission as a result of microbial concentrations in cabin air is considered to be low. However, there are no requirements for airlines to monitor cabin air quality, and whether the few studies that have been performed can be generalized to the thousands of flights undertaken by world airlines every year is unknown.

Nevertheless, the actual rate of transmission of respiratory infections during air travel is very difficult to measure. Accurate epidemiological studies and public health surveys of disease transmission on aircraft are almost impossible to perform, as they involve collecting data from millions of passengers worldwide. As well as problems with the follow up of those potentially exposed, there are difficulties with the detection of infectious cases, proving the source of infection and generalizing results of one outbreak to other circumstances. The speed of air travel is such that infected passengers might arrive at their destination before the end of the incubation period and might therefore spread disease before symptoms develop. Even differentiating the risk associated with the cabin environment from contact in the terminal prior to boarding can be difficult. In addition, many infections are associated with a low attack rate and some have long incubation periods, thereby further reducing the reliability of study results. 15 Thus, it is not possible to calculate the exact incidence of passenger illness in-flight or postflight.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis TB transmission has been documented on commercial aircraft from both crew and passengers, and a high level of attention has been given to the potential spread of TB during air travel. However, documented cases of travel on aircraft by individuals with active TB have occurred infrequently. Transmission of TB has also been reported during train, bus and ship travel. 20 Between 1993 and 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, USA) conducted six investigations into cases of active TB in a crewmember and five passengers in separate events. 21 These investigations focused on the potential exposure of more than 2600 passengers and crew on 191 flights involving nine different aircraft types. 22 Each of these investigations involved a highly infectious index case. Of the six investigations, only two produced evidence of possible TB transmission. 23, 24 One report involved the transmission of infectious multidrug-resistant TB from an infected passenger to six other passengers travelling on the same two commercial aircraft flights within the USA. 23 Several factors were identified as being contributory to transmission of disease. These were proximity of the subsequently infected passengers to the index case (mainly within two rows), the level of infectiveness of the index case and the relatively long duration of exposure. Neither the cabin air in general nor the cabin ventilation system in particular was considered to have contributed to transmission. This suggests that air travel itself does not carry a greater risk of transmission than activities in other confined spaces. None of the individuals thought to be infected during flight subsequently developed active TB.",

The risk of infection also correlated to hours of exposure to the index case. The authors concluded that crew-to-crew transmission of TB had probably occurred. Transmission to passengers could not be excluded: 7% of frequent flyer passengers returned a positive tuberculin skin test and flew during the index case's highly infectious period. Since these six CDC investigations, another two instances of possible TB transmission have been reported. Wang investigated the risk of TB transmission from a person with highly infectious pulmonary TB to fellow passengers and crew members on a 14-h commercial flight. 25 Nine contacts developed a tuberculin skin test conversion, three of whom reported no other risk factors for positive reactions. Although none of the three contacts had sat in the same section of the plane as the index patient, the authors concluded that the clustering of tuberculin skin test conversions among passengers demonstrated the possible risk of TB transmission during air travel. A second contact investigation of passengers who travelled on flights with an individual with pulmonary TB showed that five of 120 contacts (4%) had a tuberculin skin test conversion. 26 This indicated possible recent contact with TB, but only two of the five passengers had no other identified risk factors for infection.",

The authors acknowledged that TB transmission could not be excluded but felt that the likelihood was low. In a second investigation of crew and passengers who had travelled with a person with highly infectious TB on two long flights, four people had a skin test conversion, but again all had at least one other risk factor for a positive result, thus casting doubt that TB transmission during the flights had occurred. 28 Several other investigations have found no evidence of TB transmission to passengers or crew members after passengers with active disease travelled on flights ranging in duration from 30 min to 9 h. 21, 29, 30 Interpretation of these investigations is limited, however, because of low response rates and because screening of passengers from countries with a high prevalence of TB and/or where Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination is common makes interpretation of skin testing and the significance of inflight contact very difficult.",

Illness was related to the physical proximity to the index case, with eight of 23 people seated in the three rows in front of the index patient developing illness compared with 10 of 88 people seated elsewhere (relative risk: 3.1). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic patients with SARS and 242 others resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and a third flight carrying a person with presymptomatic SARS resulted in no documented spread of infection to the 314 others on the flight.

When transmission does occur, it is more likely with pathogens spread predominantly by the airborne route, but it requires close exposure to an infected individual, in which case transmission would be likely to occur regardless of the mode of transportation. Individuals with significant communicable illness, particularly respiratory infections, should postpone commercial air travel to prevent transmission to others, although the overall risk is very low.
