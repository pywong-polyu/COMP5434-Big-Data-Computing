            "text": "Plastic has rapidly transformed our world, with many aspects of human life now relying on a variety of plastic materials. Biological plastic degradation, which employs microorganisms and their degradative enzymes, has emerged as one way to address the unforeseen consequences of the waste streams that have resulted from mass plastic production. The focus of this review is microbial hydrolase enzymes which have been found to act on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. The best characterized examples are discussed together with the use of genomic and protein engineering technologies to obtain PET hydrolase enzymes for different applications. In addition, the obstacles which are currently limiting the development of efficient PET bioprocessing are presented. By continuing to study the possible mechanisms and the structural elements of key enzymes involved in microbial PET hydrolysis, and by assessing the ability of PET hydrolase enzymes to work under practical conditions, this research will help inform large-scale waste management operations. Finally, the contribution of microbial PET hydrolases in creating a potential circular PET economy will be explored. This review combines the current knowledge on enzymatic PET processing with proposed strategies for optimization and use, to help clarify the next steps in addressing pollution by PET and other plastics.",

            "text": "The use of plastics has become an integral part of modern society, with annual production exceeding 350 million metric tons (Danso et al., 2019; PlasticsEurope, 2019) . Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a crude-oil derived synthetic polymer, is currently one of the most extensively used plastics . In 2017, PET production capacity reached over 30 million tons per annum (PlasticsInsight, 2017) . Approximately 485 billion PET bottles were produced in 2016, and an estimated 583.3 billion plastic bottles are predicted to be manufactured in 2021 (Garside, 2019) . This polymer consists of repeating units of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) (Figure 1 ). Due to its light weight, durability and moldability, PET is convenient both in terms of its production and its utility; where it is used in containers, films, and fibers, in addition to bottles. However, the qualities which have made plastic an attractive resource, are equally as responsible for the damage that is typically caused once it becomes waste. Mismanagement of PET-based material has resulted in its frequent disposal and accumulation in the environment where its robustness is problematic, as it is not particularly susceptible to biodegradation. The high stability of the polymer's backbone, together with its crystallinity and surface hydrophobicity are some of the underlying factors which restrict the natural breakdown of this plastic (Kawai et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Jaiswal et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "As the primary use for plastics is packaging, PET is often used in short-term, single use applications. Despite the fact that recycling systems are in place, over half of the PET that is produced escapes collection, and instead ends up in landfills or is released into nature. Only a very limited amount of PET is recycled back into its original form, with the majority being downcycled into lower quality, non-recyclable plastics (Kawai et al., 2014) . PET waste persists in both marine and terrestrial environments, which often results in harm or death to some of the inhabitants. Annually, plastic pollution is considered responsible for the death of around 1 million sea birds, as well as 100,000 marine mammals and turtles (Jaiswal et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the partial breakdown of discarded plastics and treatment of synthetic fibers has resulted in the widespread shedding of microplastics and microfibers, respectively . In this form, plastics readily contaminate marine ecosystems and this has resulted in them entering the animal and human food chain, which has been linked to various adverse health effects, including immune disorders and congenital disabilities, as well as cancer (Jaiswal et al., 2020) . It is now believed that soils may constitute an even larger sink for plastic, and since microplastics can readily leach into groundwater, or contaminate other water reserves, this problem is thought to affect organisms across the entire terrestrial ecosystem . Recently, there has been a marked increase in awareness surrounding the potential detrimental environmental impact of plastics. Therefore, new solutions and technologies, which assist in managing plastic waste, are of major importance (Danso et al., 2019) .",

Microbes have evolved a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that allow them to degrade and process polymers that are prevalent in nature, for example the waxy plant polyester cutin. In a somewhat similar way, some microorganisms are using enzymes to take advantage of PET as an energy source, despite the significant differences between the synthetic and natural polymer structures (Danso et al., 2019; Kawai et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019) .",

These hydrolases have been isolated from bacterial sources such as Ideonella sakaiensis and Thermobifida fusca as well as from fungi such as Fusarium solani, Humicola insolens, and Aspergillus oryzae (Wang et al., 2008; Korpecka et al., 2010; Zimmermann and Billig, 2010) . They are typically serine hydrolases and are characterized by a catalytic triad in their active site that consists of serine, histidine, and aspartate amino acids and an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold (Remington et al., 1992; Wei et al., 2014a) . Most of the PET hydrolases that have been functionally verified also contain a C-terminal disulfide bond which is responsible for promoting thermal and kinetic stability (Roth et al., 2014; Sulaiman et al., 2014; Then et al., 2016) . In general, carboxylic ester hydrolases are defined by their activity on p-nitrophenol (p-NP) acyl esters, whereby lipases act on medium to long-chain acyl esters (>C 10 ), cutinases on short to medium-chain acyl esters (up to C 8 -C 10 ), and esterases on short-chain acyl esters. Although PET hydrolytic activities are not correlated to p-NP acyl ester specificity, these substrates are useful for biochemical characterization of enzymes of interest (Kawai et al., 2020) .",

Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) and cutinase-like enzymes, which are capable of processing high molecular weight polyesters, have become an important focus of PET hydrolase studies . Numerous PET hydrolyzing enzymes have been biochemically characterized to date and are shown in (Table 1) . Actinomycetes, especially Thermobifida species, are of interest for their PET hydrolytic cutinases and will be among the examples discussed. I. sakaiensis, which was discovered in PET-contaminated sediment that was sampled near a Japanese recycling facility, combines a Kawai et al., 2014 FsC Fusarium solani pisi 1CEX 214 30-60 lcPET (7%) and bo-PET (35%) 5% lcPET weight loss Griswold et al., 2003; Silva et al., 2005; Eberl et al., 2009; Ronkvist et al., 2009; Yoshida et al., 2016 HiC cutinase-like hydrolase enzyme termed \"PETase\" with mono-(2hydroxyethyl) terephthalate degrading \"MHETase\" to enable the use of PET as a carbon and energy source Taniguchi et al., 2019) . Strictly speaking, cutinases are defined by hydrolysis of cutin, but this is often left undetermined as cutin is not readily available commercially. Cutin degradation is not crucial for synthetic polyesterase activity, and PET enzymes are often categorized as cutinases, based on showing near-identical structures in crystallographic studies (Kawai et al., 2020) . Cutinases that have been shown to hydrolyze cutin, and various polyesters, can do so under temperature conditions of 40-70 \u2022 C and pH 7-9, without the help of cofactors (Furukawa et al., 2019) . Genomic and metagenomic strategies, which allow both genomic and gene expression analysis of unculturable and culturable microbes, have broadened the extent to which genetic information can be explored (Handelsman, 2004; Parages et al., 2016) . The ever-increasing number of genomic and metagenomic datasets has led to the identification of genes of interest, including those encoding cutinases and PET hydrolase homologs . For example, functional screening of a leaf-branch compost metagenome enabled the isolation of LC-cutinase, a cutinase homolog with PET-degrading activity (Sulaiman et al., 2012) . A metagenome mining approach that searches genome and metagenome databases has also recently been used to identify four novel PET hydrolase genes (Danso et al., 2018) .",

This MHETase is a member of the tannase enzyme family and has been shown to degrade MHET into TPA and EG, with a catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) of 4200 \u00b1 370 s \u22121 mM \u22121 . Interestingly, MHETase displays little activity on other ester compounds. Both PETase and MHETase enzymes were assigned new Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, 3.1.1.101, and 3.1.1.102, respectively, and their role in a PET metabolic model was subsequently proposed (Figure 2) . IsPETase, which acts extracellularly, first converts PET into oligomers (mainly MHET). PET hydrolysates are then transported, through an outer membrane protein (e.g., porin) into the periplasmic space and further hydrolyzed by MHETase into PET monomers . MHETase is predicted to be a lipoprotein, which is likely to be anchored in the outer membrane. A lid domain, which confers its specificity and activity toward MHET, has also been proposed . A TPA transporter coupled with a TPA-binding protein is likely to be responsible for taking TPA up into the cytoplasm (Hosaka et al., 2013) . It is thought that TPA subsequently enters the central tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via protocatechuic acid, while EG is also catabolized in the TCA cycle via glyoxylic acid (M\u00fcckschel et al., 2012) .",

Several groups have elucidated the crystal structure of IsPETase, revealing features shared by lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) and cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), along with unique characteristics that differentiate the enzyme from cutinases previously recognized for PET hydrolysis (Han et al., 2017; Austin et al., 2018; Fecker et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018) . IsPETase has been expressed recombinantly from a codon-optimized gene in various E. coli host strains to facilitate generation of the crystal structure. The enzyme has a basic structure that resembles other PET hydrolyzing enzymes, featuring an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold and a nucleophile-His-acid catalytic triad. The \u03b1/\u03b2 serine hydrolase family displays a catalytic mechanism based on a nucleophilic attack on the substrate's ester bond by serine, which is activated via the other triad residues . This involves serine linking to the ester carbonyl group to form a covalent tetrahedral intermediate that is later stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between amide bonds of the residues in a nearby oxyanion hole (Jaeger et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2013) . In the case of IsPETase, the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold consists of nine \u03b2-strands that form a twisted central \u03b2-sheet conformation, surrounded by six \u03b1-helices , while Ser160-His237-Asp206 comprise the catalytic triad residues (Joo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Following a study based on structural and biochemical analyses of IsPETase, Joo et al. (2018) have proposed a detailed molecular mechanism for this enzyme. A four-MHET molecule called 2-HE(MHET) 4 was used to mimic PET in a covalent docking model to facilitate elucidation of the substrate binding mode. At the catalytic center, triad residue Ser160 functions as a covalent nucleophile which acts on the carbonyl carbon atom of the ester bond, as seen in other carboxylesterase enzymes. The nitrogen atoms of amino acids Tyr87 and Met160 form an oxyanion hole which stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate of the reaction. This stimulates the substrate binding site to form a long, shallow cleft, which is primarily hydrophobic. The first MHET moiety is bound to subsite I, while the second, third, and fourth moieties are accommodated by subsite II. Binding is mediated and stabilized largely by hydrophobic interactions, although certain residues also lead to polar and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Various site-directed mutagenesis experiments were used to verify the key residues in catalysis and substrate binding. This group also presented a molecular mechanism for the degradation of PET, which involves two steps: nick generation and terminal digestion. Once the secreted IsPETase has bound to the PET surface via its hydrophobic substrate binding cleft, the scissile ester bond is positioned closer to the nucleophilic Ser160. This enables the cleavage of one ester bond, creating a nick in PET and resulting in two PET chains with different terminals (TPA-terminal and HE-terminal), that are then digested into MHET monomers. As there are some variations in the digestion process depending on the terminal type, and because the digestions occur in a combinatorial manner, MHET, TPA, BHET, and EG accumulate, with BHET undergoing further degradation into MHET and EG. Interestingly, although IsPETase does not hydrolyze MHET to TPA and EG, a significant amount of TPA accumulates during the degradation reaction, which is believed to be related to digestion of the TPA-terminal described in this mechanism (Joo et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, Chen et al. (2018) summarized recent crystallographic studies, in addition to their own work, to help uncover the key catalytic features of IsPETase and information regarding its underlying mechanism of action. Residue Trp156, which is found near the catalytic center, is thought to have a central role in binding the PET substrate. Although Trp156 is highly conserved across PET hydrolyzing enzymes, \"Trp156 wobbling, \" whereby the residue displays three different conformations, is exclusive to IsPETase. In this enzyme, \"Trp156 wobbling\" is coupled to Ser185, which corresponds to a bulky His residue in homologous structures, that would usually prevent Trp from adopting more than one conformation. A variant created by mutating Ser to His at position 185 resulted in decreased activity and indicated that the performance of IsPETase is at least partially influenced by the smaller Ser185 residue, as it allows more space for Trp156 to rotate (Han et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018) . Using substrate and product analogs of PET to study the substrate-binding mode, the group have also proposed a mechanism of action for IsPETase whereby the enzyme first forms a shallow, superficial cleft, within which \"Trp156 wobbling\" takes place. Next, primarily via hydrophobic interactions, PET substrate binds with its carbonyl group positioned at the catalytic center and its O atom facing the oxyanion hole, while the Trp156 indole ring interacts with the aromatic TPA moiety of PET. Then, successive formation of acyl-enzyme intermediate and cleavage of the ester bond occur in a nucleophilic attack by water (hydrolytic reaction). Finally, the product is rotated and released from the catalytic center following interaction of the benzoic acid group with Trp156 .",

Instead, Wei et al. (2019) propose that hydrolysis of amorphous PET is facilitated by weak interactions between its aromatic phenylene units and the nearby hydrophobic amino acids of the enzyme. This hypothesis is based on phenylene ring motions, which are more inclined to arise compared with the rigid EG units that directly flank the ester bond . Although cutinase catalytic mechanisms have also been explored by studying enzyme structures complexed with inhibitors and natural substrate analogs, the precise binding mode of PET and the underlying mechanism of cutinase PET hydrolysis requires further investigation, as the structure of PET is very different to cutinase substrates, such as cutin and triglyceride (Han et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "In a study on TfCut2 cutinase, the enzyme was crystallized in both free and inactivated forms before structural and functional characterization (Roth et al., 2014) . Combined with molecular models, the structural components responsible for substrate and product specificity were analyzed. TfCut2 displayed a standard \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold and a S130-H208-D176 catalytic triad was found in a crevice on the enzyme surface and the highly resolved structure provided an appropriate foundation for enzyme engineering. The thermostability of TfCut2 was also investigated by comparison with a less stable T. alba AHK119 homolog. While the melting temperature (T m ) of TfCut2 appeared to be 70 \u2022 C when measured by temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy, loss of activity was measured experimentally at 61 \u2022 C (Roth et al., 2014) . Despite this, TfCut2 displayed improved thermal stability when compared with other characterized bacterial cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74). It is believed that denaturation may be prevented in TfCut2 by the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys241 and Cys259 which may stabilize a highly flexible region nearby that surrounds residues 245-247. Residues at the boundary of the active site also exhibit high levels of flexibility in relation to their overall structure, possibly helping to enable induced fit for catalysis. Flexibility in some areas can be susceptible to local unfolding which might explain the lower T m seen in the activity assay. This analysis also suggested that the optimized amino acid sequence pattern and hydrogen bond network of this enzyme contribute to its thermostability (Roth et al., 2014; Taniguchi et al., 2019) .",

For the 3PET assay, the well-studied fungal cutinase HiC was compared with Tha_Cut1 and although HiC released twice as many overall hydrolysates, it was determined than the two enzymes had distinct substrate specificities, with Tha_Cut1 releasing 35 times the amount of a hydrolysis product called 2-hydroxyethyl benzoate (HEB). This comparison provided further insights into the mechanism of Tha_Cut1, revealing the main products of 3PET hydrolysis to be MHET and HEB, indicating efficient hydrolysis of the ester bond between them. Tha_Cut1 displayed a high similarity to Thc_Cut1 from T. cellulosilytica, with a difference of just four amino acids that are located in a key region involved in substrate-enzyme interaction (Ribitsch et al., 2012a) . In addition, two cutinaselike polyesterase enzymes Est1 and Est119 from tandem genes in T. alba AHK119 have been shown to have broad substrate specificity for various polyesters. Purified Est119 has been biochemically characterized, revealing highest kinetic activities (V max and k cat ) toward short-chain p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB). However, the enzyme K m values showed a higher affinity for longer chain (C 6 and C 8 ) acyl esters, indicating that Est119 is a cutinase-like enzyme rather than a true lipase or esterase (Thumarat et al., 2012) . For both Est119 and Est1, optimum temperature and pH were recorded as 50 \u2022 C and pH 6.0, respectively (Thumarat et al., 2015) . Despite the enzymes displaying 98% similarity with each other, Est1 displayed higher activity and thermostability (Kawai et al., 2013) . More recently, an Est1 (A68V/T253P) variant was shown to have the highest thermostability when compared with wild-type and mutant Est1 and Est119 enzymes. Est1 (A68V/T253P) was assayed with 3PET and PET film, shaking for 3 h at 50 \u2022 C, and was noted for its PET surface hydrophilization and polyester degradation abilities (Thumarat et al., 2015) .",

Heterologous expression of the gene in Escherichia coli resulted in the extracellular production of an enzyme, SM14est, that was shown to have polyesterase activity on polycaprolactone, the model substrate for plastic degradation (Almeida et al., 2019) . SM14 is a marine sponge-derived isolate which may have been exposed to plastics and/or microplastics, resulting from its association with the filter-feeding sponge Haliclona simulans. Subsequent amino acid sequence analysis and comparison of SM14est with the well-described IsPETase revealed that the serine hydrolase motif Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly and the Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad are conserved in both enzymes. However, SM14 displays key differences in its catalytic sub-site II residues as well as an absence of the two disulfide bonds and the extended loop featured in IsPETase, which may contribute to a reduced efficiency in PET binding and hydrolysis (Joo et al., 2018; Almeida et al., 2019) .",

As a consortium, these isolates synergistically degraded 100mg of granular PET to give a weight loss of 3.15 mg (\u223c3% reduction rate), following 6-weeks at 30 \u2022 C (Le\u00f3n-Zayas et al., 2019). Most recently, Bollinger et al. (2020) identified a polyester degrading carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) within the genome of the mesophilic marine bacterium Pseudomonas aestusnigri. The enzyme, named PE-H, was revealed as a PET hydrolytic enzyme (type IIa), based on amino acid sequence homology. The group also solved the enzyme's crystal structure, which featured the canonical \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold and showed high homology to known polyesterases. PE-H was shown to hydrolyze amorphous PET film at 30 \u2022 C, with intermediate MHET released as a product. Although the wild-type enzyme failed to hydrolyze a commercial PET bottle-based film, a variant of PE-H (Y250S), which displayed some hydrolytic activity toward PET in this form, was obtained using rational mutagenesis (Bollinger et al., 2020) .",

During a metagenomic study of leaf-branch compost, a gene with 57.4% sequence identity to Tfu_0883 cutinase from T. fusca was identified (Sulaiman et al., 2012) . This gene was found to encode LC-cutinase (LCC), a novel cutinase homolog, following a functional-based screen of a metagenomic library from the compost using tributyrin agar. LCC was subsequently heterologously expressed in E. coli and shown to hydrolyze various fatty acid monoesters optimally at 50 \u2022 C, with a preference for short-chain substrates (up to C 4 ). This reaction was used to show that the optimal enzymatic activity for LC-cutinase occurs at 50 \u2022 C and pH 8.5. The enzyme's specific activity for p-NPB is comparable to that of the T. fusca cutinase, although slightly lower. LCC was also capable of degrading PCL and PET, with the enzyme displaying specific PET-degrading activity of 12 mg/h/mg of enzyme at 50 \u2022 C and pH 8.0 (Sulaiman et al., 2012) . A dual enzyme system, which combined LC-cutinase with an immobilized T. fusca KW3 carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) called TfCa, was subsequently investigated for its ability to hydrolyze PET films . Typically, enzymatic PET degradation is restricted once the MHET intermediate is formed. The presence of immobilized TfCa was, however, shown to enable LC-cutinase hydrolysis of inhibitory MHET. HPLC analysis of degradation products indicated that the LCC-TfCa dual enzyme system gave a 2.4-fold higher yield of hydrolysates compared with one that combined TfCa with TfCut2 from T. fusca. In terms of total amounts of products released with the LCC-TfCa combination, an increase of 104% was observed versus PET enzymatic hydrolysis where TfCa was not added .",

Following determination of its crystal structure, MGS0156 was found to feature a modified \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold, a highly hydrophobic active site, and a lid domain. Structure-based mutational studies revealed the key amino acid residues required for hydrolytic activity, including catalytic triad residues Ser232, His73, and Asp350, and adjacent residues His231, Lys233, and Asp372. The side chains of Cys173 and Cys287 formed a disulfide bond which stabilizes an important protein lid domain.

The second most abundant phylum associated with both datasets was the Proteobacteria, comprising 20 and 30% of hits in the terrestrial and marine data, respectively.

Since over 100 metagenomes were included in the analysis, an overall picture of the occurrence of PET hydrolase enzymes was generated. However, this data may not be an accurate representation of the expression of these genes in the natural environment. The low gene frequencies observed suggests that this trait may have only evolved quite recently and may not have had the opportunity to spread within different microbial populations. Overall, the data suggests that PET hydrolases are rare enzymes (Danso et al., 2018) .

Depending on the intended use of the final product, PET can have different degrees of crystallinity. Generally, PET employed to make bottles and textiles is associated with having a high crystallinity of between 30 and 40%. Conversely, PET which is used to create packaging has lower crystallinities, for example, PET-GF, a commercially available low-crystallinity PET film, is estimated to have 6-7% crystallinity (Kawai et al., 2014) . Numerous reports indicate that PET hydrolase enzymes preferentially degrade the regions of PET that are amorphous in nature (Figure 4) (Welzel et al., 2002; Brueckner et al., 2008; Ronkvist et al., 2009; Donelli et al., 2010; Gamerith et al., 2017) . As the crystallinity of PET increases, the flexibility and movement of the polymer chains becomes more restricted, thus reducing the susceptibility of these chains to enzymatic attack. In spite of this, it has been suggested that hydrolysis of amorphous regions may impact on crystalline regions, such that both can ultimately be digested (Ronkvist et al., 2009; Kawai et al., 2019) . Furthermore, the repeating units of bulky aromatic terephthalate, which are present in the PET backbone, restrict polymer chain mobility and therefore, degradability (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017b) .",

The application of heat above T g is typically used to induce crystallization, normally accompanied by molecular orientation. High crystallinity (and therefore increased resistance to degradation) is associated with higher glass transition temperatures, with amorphous PET having a T g of 67 \u2022 C and crystalline PET having a T g of 81 \u2022 C (Groeninckx et al., 1974; Demirel et al., 2011) . However, when PET is in aqueous conditions, T g values are lowered to 60-65 \u2022 C as a result of the diffusion of water molecules between the polymer chains (Kikkawa et al., 2004; Kawai et al., 2014) . This weakens the associated hydrogen bonds and thereby increases randomness, flexibility, and mobility of the chains. Enzymatic reactions are routinely performed in a solution, meaning that the T g of PET decreases such that enzymes have increased accessibility to the polymer chains. Water absorbency of PET can vary between 0.1 and 1% depending on the form but will also increase under higher temperatures. Therefore, it is recommended to set high PET hydrolysis reaction temperatures, preferably above T g , as this has been reported to give higher rates of degradation (Kawai et al., 2014 (Kawai et al., , 2019 Oda et al., 2018) . On the other hand, it is then vital to employ a thermostable PET hydrolase. Thermostability is generally advantageous as catalysis is promoted at raised temperatures and allows biocatalysis to be maintained over a long period at ambient temperatures (Kawai et al., 2019) .",

The experiment involved TfCut2 digestion of a PET nanoparticle substrate in the presence of these four intermediates, with their inhibitory effect analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC and a model for heterogenous enzymatic polymer hydrolysis. MHET and BHET were shown to competitively inhibit hydrolysis by occupying the substrate binding site of the TfCut2 enzyme whereas TPA and EG had no impact on the ability of the enzyme to degrade the PET nanoparticles . One way of overcoming this challenge has been to use other enzymes in combination with PET hydrolases to improve substrate binding and catalytic characteristics Carniel et al., 2017; Austin et al., 2018) .",

It is also necessary to consider the chosen method for detecting and reporting activity, i.e., weight loss, hydrolysis, etc. In addition, many enzymes, including HiC, TfH, FsC, and Cut190 have been used in the textiles industry to achieve more desirable PET fiber characteristics and this requires only surface modification and avoids degrading the inner PET building block. While PET hydrolases may be used for surface treatments, they are distinct from PET surfacemodifying enzymes.

They have recommended grouping PET hydrolyzing enzymes into, (1) PET hydrolases and (2) PET surface-modifying enzymes. They suggest that the only enzymes which can currently be considered as PET hydrolases are the following cutinases; HiC, LCC and variants of TfCut2 and Cut190 . This is based on criteria for efficient PET degradation, namely thermostability (>65 \u2022 C, or ideally >75 \u2022 C) and the capacity for the open active site to bind multiple MHET monomers. It follows that mesophilic IsPETase, despite its structural similarities to these cutinases and observed hydrolyzing activities at 30 \u2022 C, should not be regarded as a PET hydrolase, particularly with respect to application (Kawai et al., 2020) . It was also recently demonstrated that while amorphous PET supports growth of I. sakaiensis, high crystallinity PET films and bottles do not (unless hcPET is melted and cooled rapidly to give amorphous plastic) (Wallace et al., 2020) . TfH may still be grouped with PET hydrolases as it was the first enzyme reported for efficient PET hydrolysis and it is thermophilic.",

While this does not usually apply to PET manufacturing, plasticizers may be used for some PET products (Hahladakis et al., 2018) . A simple and robust PET powder-based suspension assay was recently used to quantify product release from PET, but product detection was shown to depend on choice of analytical technique. Therefore, it is advisable to use a combined approach. In this study, a plate reader method (for rapid screening, measurement of initial rates, and comparative biochemical studies) was well complemented by reversed-phase HPLC analysis (for more in-depth information on the aromatic monomers produced), which offered greater insight and avoided errors (B\u00e5\u00e5th et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "So far, the consensus in the area of PET hydrolysis has been that known PET hydrolase enzymes have low turnover rates, particularly toward highly crystallized forms of PET (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a; Liu et al., 2018; Danso et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019) . Even IsPETase, which has shown specificity for degradation of hc-PET, is considered to have a relatively low catalytic activity . Furthermore, given that reaction temperatures above the T g of PET have been advised for more rapid hydrolysis, candidate enzymes should ideally display high enzymatic efficiency while also retaining activity over 75 \u2022 C Taniguchi et al., 2019) . For instance, IsPETase is heat labile but thermostable cutinases such as LCC, TfH, and HiC may fall short of IsPETase in terms of specificity for PET substrate, demonstrating the need for a combination of both traits (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a; Liu et al., 2018; Taniguchi et al., 2019) . Enzyme adsorption, whereby the protein adheres to the polymer surface, is a key process in the hydrolysis of PET and other polymers. This binding results from contact between hydrophobic PET fibers and any hydrophobic amino acid residues located at the protein surface (Norde, 1996; Kim and Yoon, 2002; Stuart, 2003; Palonen et al., 2004; O'Neill et al., 2007) . It was mentioned already that T. cellulosilytica cutinase, Thc_Cut2, displayed lower hydrolytic efficiency compared with Thc_Cut1 that could be attributed to the individual hydrophobic surface properties of these enzymes. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis was used to demonstrate that amino acids on the enzyme surface are important for PET hydrolysis, by exchanging selected Thc_Cut2 residues with those only present on the surface of Thc_Cut1 (Herrero Acero et al., 2013) . Another group improved Thc_Cut1 PET hydrolysis through fusion of two hydrophobic binding domains to enhance the enzyme's adsorption abilities . Also, microbial biofilm production can play an important role in plastic biodegradation due to the comparably high hydrophobicity of the associated cell surfaces, which in turn facilitates their attachment to synthetic polymers. Given that cell surfaces are usually hydrophilic in nature, attachment is often enhanced by adding hydrophilic functional groups to the hydrophobic polymers. This increases access of the released hydrolytic enzymes to the plastic surface (Orr et al., 2004; Tribedi and Sil, 2014; Nauendorf et al., 2016; Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017) . Once attachment is initiated, subsequent degradation steps, such as biodeterioration, biofragmentation, assimilation, and mineralization can proceed more easily (Jaiswal et al., 2020) .",

(2019) carried out a study to address the requirement for IsPETase variants with a highly increased capacity for PET hydrolysis and improved stabilities that enable the secreted enzyme to maintain its function in a harsh extracellular environment, over a long period at moderate temperatures. To achieve this, the group designed a plan for rational protein engineering based on the existing crystal structure of IsPETase. Following screening, an IsPETase (S121E/D186H/R280A) mutant displayed particularly enhanced characteristics . This variant was designed such that subsite IIc was extended to provide a non-protruding, hydrophobic cleft, and a flexible \u03b26-\u03b27 connecting loop was stabilized (Joo et al., 2018) . Upon comparison of the mutant with wild-type IsPETase, degradative activity toward PET film was shown to be 14-fold higher at 40 \u2022 C. In addition, the melting temperature of this variant increased by 8.81 \u2022 C and high thermostability was further verified by a heat-inactivation experiment . The same group have since introduced mutations N246D and S242T, generating a quadruple IsPETase variant which displayed a 58fold increase in hydrolyzing activity over its wild-type at 37 \u2022 C, and maintained activity under these conditions for 20 days (Son et al., 2020) .",

More recently, investigated the role of three Ca 2+ ions bound to separate sites (1-3) on Cut190 (S226P/R228S) and found that the ions had different roles in thermal and structural stabilization as well as enzyme activation, generating an overall change in protein conformation that help increase activity. Furthermore, by introducing a disulfide bond in site 2 for thermostability, the melting temperature was increased by at least 20-30 \u2022 C when mutants were Ca 2+ -bound, with the bond mimicking the effect of Ca 2+ .",

This accelerated enzymatic activity by 120-fold, with a 22% decrease in film thickness following incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 36 h (Furukawa et al., 2018) . In a follow-on study, they found that the activity of mutant TfCut2 (G62A/F209A) could be increased by the presence of a cationic surfactant. In this case, the enzyme has a negatively charged surface and is therefore brought closer to the PET film via electrostatic interactions upon addition of cationic surfactant (Furukawa et al., 2019) . Moreover, when investigating the impact of different conditions on IsPETase, that may have relevance for industrial application, Liu et al. (2019) reported that organic solvents and detergents reduced the enzyme's activity, while salts and glycerol led to enhanced enzymatic activity. Of the salts used, Na 2 SO 4 had the most positive effect, which may be due to its higher effective cation concentration .",

Nanotechnology is another synthetic biology tool, that has been used for enzyme immobilization onto nanoparticle beads. This can lead to improvements in enzyme activity, stability, and thus reusability, as demonstrated by an immobilized lipase from a Fusarium incarnatum strain, which retained 75% of its degradation activity after 5 cycles when applied to treat waste cooking oil .

            "text": "Unlike glass or aluminum, where material can be repeatedly recovered in its original form, it is difficult to close the loop on the recycling of plastics. However, PET can to some extent be recycled using mechanical, chemical, or biological routes. In mechanical recycling, collected and sorted PET waste can be shredded and ground into powders before melting and reprocessing to other forms (Koshti et al., 2018) . The resulting fibers, films and sheets cannot, however, be further recycled and are often incinerated, subsequently contributing to increased CO 2 emissions. Chemical recycling aims to degrade PET into its basic monomers which can then be repolymerized. This method is unfavorable from an economic standpoint as the recovered monomers are more expensive than those from crude oil and despite its drawbacks, mechanical recycling is much more cost effective (Awaja and Pavel, 2005; Hiraga et al., 2019) . In addition, chemical methods require the maintenance of high temperature and pressure as well as employing toxic reagents and several preceding unit operations (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a; Koshti et al., 2018) . For both chemical and mechanical recycling, the temperatures used are usually over 100 \u2022 C and often exceed 200 \u2022 C. Unfortunately, there are also several contaminants, that significantly interfere with the effectiveness of these PET recycling methods, whether they arise from other waste collected, the recycling process itself or misuse by consumers (Awaja and Pavel, 2005; Webb et al., 2013) . Overall, PET recycling remains an expensive and inefficient process, regardless of the advantages over waste management via landfill and incineration, which are associated with major environmental drawbacks such as pollution and atmospheric release of harmful compounds (Zhang et al., 2004; Webb et al., 2013) .",

Biological recycling (or bio-recycling) is based on microbial catalysis of polymer bond cleavage reactions, which results in the recovery of monomers that can be subjected to further processing (Koshti et al., 2018) . Bio-recycling holds great potential for improved efficiency and cost effectiveness over the aforementioned mechanical and chemical methods as well as helping to eliminate the occurrence of secondary pollutants that come with landfill and incineration (Webb et al., 2013) . The possibility exists that a biological recycling process could be achieved using PET hydrolysis and further metabolism of its monomers by I. sakaiensis and other PET-degrading organisms and their enzymatic systems . However, bio-recycling is limited by the organism used, inherent polymer properties and the choice of pre-treatment. The future success of this process will rely on optimization and/or modification of these factors (Koshti et al., 2018) . Given the time and variables associated with cultivating and maintaining microorganisms as well as extracting their enzymes and allowing the degradation reaction to proceed, biological recycling is relatively slow when compared with chemical or mechanical methods. Therefore, biorecycling must currently be carried out in combination with at least one of these other approaches (Koshti et al., 2018; Farzi et al., 2019) .",

PET waste, in the form of bottles, was ground down to a powder form prior to the bacterial treatment, which comprised of 18 days incubation in a culture medium at 28 \u2022 C. Powdered PET was separated by particle size (500, 420, 300, and 212 \u00b5m) with 50 mg samples of each size undergoing treatment. Through extraction of residual PET, final biodegradation percentages for the four groups were determined to be 49.2, 57.4, 62.4, and 68 .8%, in order of decreasing particle size. Metabolites were analyzed via GC-MS (gas chromatographymass spectrometry) to detect the hydrolysis products and to confirm the biodegradation process had taken place. In addition, a comparison between powdered and film sample degradation was undertaken using a PET film made from bottles, that was then subjected to the same biodegradation treatment, again for 18 days. Subsequent SEM analysis was used to visualize the surface of this film. While it was shown that degradation of the film surface did occur, results were not significant, particularly when compared to the powdered samples. It was evident from this lab-scale assessment that a mechanical powdering treatment can be very effective, giving high degradation efficiency (Farzi et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "In another study, which combined bio-recycling with alkaline hydrolysis, an alkali-resistant whole cell biocatalyst was employed (Gong et al., 2018) . Alkaline hydrolysis is one of several methods used to achieve PET chemical recycling (Carta et al., 2003; Koshti et al., 2018) . A Comamonas testosteroni F4 strain that had previously been isolated from the wastewater of a factory producing PET (Zhang et al., 2004) , was shown to degrade PET fibers and was subsequently subjected to evolutionary engineering to first give C. testosteroni F5, a strain which could utilize PET as a sole carbon source under alkaline conditions (Gong et al., 2012) . Further modifications were completed to obtain the final alkali-tolerant strain, C. testosteroni F6. With whole-cell bacterial degradation of PET, the products do not accumulate in the culture as they are used during growth of the strain, thereby circumventing any feedback inhibition. Micro-sized PET particles (<10 \u00b5m) prepared by drying and grinding PET were used as the substrate, with no additional carbon sources. These particles were subjected to a 48 h fermentation at 37 \u2022 C under three degradation conditions using: (1) the original F4 strain in a neutral medium; (2) the engineered F6 strain in an alkaline medium; (3) an alkaline medium without any bacterial culture. Under alkaline catalysis, the decomposition products were relatively simple, consisting mostly of TPA. Conversely, MHET, BHET, TPA, and methyl acrylate (MA) were the products obtained following degradation under biocatalytic conditions. The highest quantity of PET degradation products was observed under alkaline conditions with C. testosteroni F6, which was greater than the sum of both products under neutral conditions and alkaline hydrolysis (Gong et al., 2018) . Efficient biodegradation of highly crystallized PET was achieved by Chen et al. (2020) using a cell surface display-based strategy. An IsPETase-displaying yeast whole-cell biocatalyst was developed to overcome the low enzymatic activity of native IsPETase toward hc-PET, which limits its potential use in biorecycling. Engineered Pichia pastoris yeast cells were constructed to functionally display IsPETase from a codon-optimized gene sequence. Endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) proteins in the yeast cell wall were selected as anchor proteins, to which the enzyme could be connected via a flexible linker sequence (Chen et al., 2020) . This strategy aimed to increase the probability of fully exposing the unique active-site cleft and substrate binding sites, which are crucial for IsPETase activity (Austin et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018) . A dramatic improvement in degradation efficiency was observed using this whole-cell biocatalyst system, with an approximated 36-fold increase in turnover rate compared with that of purified IsPETase. The whole-cell biocatalyst was shown to be robust and reusable, with the turnover rate remaining stable up to its seventh repeated use and under certain solvent/chemical conditions. In addition, the pH and thermostability of the enzyme increased following cell surface display. This approach presents a promising route for efficient bio-recycling and coupled with this, there is potential for activity to be further enhanced through similar cell-surface display of engineered IsPETase variants (Chen et al., 2020) .",

The aim of a circular economy is to promote sustainability and efficiency by creating loops which feed resources back into the economy to make the same or new products. Plastic production is relatively sustainable when compared with the resource-intensive processes associated with other materials such as glass and metal. That said, there is a huge need to re-evaluate plastic design, production, use and management in order to improve its ability to reenter the system and to ensure that maximum value is being recovered (Hahladakis et al., 2020) . Through a combination of biodegradation and biosynthesis, there is potential for a circular, bio-based PET economy that could play a significant role in reducing the associated detrimental environmental effects. In general, the low production cost of plastic has played a major role in accelerating its mismanagement as reuse does not offer an economic advantage. While current strategies remain the most profitable option, a PET bioeconomy could match public expectations for alternative PET management, which is already leading to progress in terms of policies and regulations. In this way, the financial gap between strategies could be partially bridged, enabling an opportunity for further development of sustainable PET processing and therefore improving the environmental impact and rates of recycling in the longer term (Salvador et al., 2019) .",

Due to the \"bow-tie\" metabolic structure associated with microbes, there is great potential for biodegradation products to be transformed into a range of useful molecules by channeling the monomers into central metabolism and linking to relevant biosynthetic pathways. This could be achieved by using metabolic engineering and synthetic biology to incorporate PET hydrolase enzymes into a microbial biosynthesis chassis, thereby helping to create revenue from PET waste while also reducing its release into the environment (Salvador et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019; Blank et al., 2020) . Recently, the photosynthetic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum was employed as a chassis to produce and secrete an engineered IsPETase which displayed degradative activity toward different PET substrates (Moog et al., 2019) . These cell factories could be valuable in future applications, including the design of photobioreactors capable of PET biodegradation and synthesis of new PET from the resulting monomers. To date E. coli and B. subtilis are among other microbial systems that have been successfully utilized for the creation of synthetic IsPETase cell factories (Huang et al., 2018; Moog et al., 2019; Seo et al., 2019) .",

This is important to consider when developing PET-based bioprocesses because different pathways will generate a distinct range of metabolites, with varied applications. For example, PCA itself has been used to synthesize adipic acid, which is an industrially relevant metabolite (Johnson et al., 2016; Salvador et al., 2019) and EG, which can be degraded into acetate or glyoxylate (GLA), has an even more diverse metabolism than TPA (Child and Willetts, 1978; Kataoka et al., 2001; Trifunovi\u0107 et al., 2016) . Significantly, EG has been transformed into the bioplastic polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by an engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strain, presenting an opportunity to use PET monomers as a feedstock for the production of a biodegradable alternative (Franden et al., 2018; Blank et al., 2020) .",

While biosynthesis of aromatic compounds by microbes has not developed to the same extent as their degradation, it has been proposed to produce terephthalic acid by harnessing the shikimate pathway to provide p-toluate which could be transformed into TPA (Osterhout et al., 2014) . It may also be possible to achieve sustainable TPA biosynthesis by using aromatics from renewable sources like lignin. However, many complexities are associated with biological TPA production and therefore, it is only EG that is currently produced biologically from renewable feedstocks to give bio-PET (Salvador et al., 2019) . This has been achieved by engineering artificial pathways into microorganisms, enabling the use of renewable plant feedstocks, such as xylose (Cam et al., 2016) and corn stalk (Pang et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "While the efforts to harness the power of microbial PET hydrolase enzymes are ongoing, research in this area has been encouraging and new knowledge has quickly accumulated. Many different groups have been working to identify and characterize PET hydrolyzing microorganisms and their enzymes to explore degradative activities, connect structure with function FIGURE 5 | Prospective overview of PET in the circular economy. Monomers resulting from biodegradation of PET may be recovered for manufacture of virgin PET (biorecycling) or combined with microbially synthesized monomers for a bio-based alternative (biosynthesis). Adipic acid, an important chemical precursor used primarily in nylon production, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are both bio-based and biodegradable, are among the value-added products that may be obtained through transformation of TPA and EG monomers (bio-upcycling). and uncover the mechanisms behind microbial processing of synthetic polymers. This work, together with the use of powerful enzyme technologies to create improved variants, has already improved the feasibility of practical PET degradation and will continue to underpin future applications as well as process optimization. Some of the most promising cases highlighted in this review have included pilot-scale PET hydrolysis using engineered LC-cutinase together with I. sakaiensis enzymes, various IsPETase mutants and IsPETase cell factories or display systems that may enable the break down of high crystallinity PET under mild reaction conditions. Although enzymatic systems that resemble the I. sakaiensis PETase-MHETase PET processing pair have not yet been observed in any other bacterial genome sequences, the chances of finding potential PET metabolic enzymes in the future is likely to increase with the aforementioned ongoing rapid expansion of genomic and metagenomic sequence data.",

            "text": "With the aim of addressing different types of PET waste, especially high crystallinity forms, there is a need for further investigation into strategies such as synergistic combined enzyme systems, use of ionic surfactants, circumvention of PET intermediate inhibition and the development of biosynthetic cell factories. It would also be useful to establish standard protocols and PET substrates to allow for more meaningful comparisons when assessing PET hydrolase candidates and determining optimal process conditions. The development of microbes and enzymes for biological recycling will help progress their implementation in other areas, for instance in bioremediation strategies. Despite the improvements that can be accomplished using enzyme engineering, \"mining\" for new PET hydrolases is still vital to gain a better understanding of plastic degradation in nature and to identify inherent activities that can be enhanced to enable treatment of PET waste in situ. Culture based screening strategies coupled with metagenomic based approaches targeting various PET or hydrocarbon contaminated environmental samples is likely to uncover even better evolved microbial activities for PET metabolism.",

            "text": "In recent years there has been a significant shift in awareness and concern surrounding plastic-related environmental issues. For the most part, plastic is not inherently \"bad, \" with alternative materials often having a higher overall impact when factors such as production requirements and bulk shipping are considered. Plastic packaging also provides the current best solution in niche sectors, for example, in helping prevent food spoilage in the food industry. Today's plastic problem is rooted in a loss of control and the inability of waste collection, disposal, and recycling infrastructure to match the pace of the plastics industry. Therefore, a multi-faceted approach is essential in addressing the complexities of this issue. In the context of contributing microbial based solutions, there must be a balance between process optimization and environmental consequences, such that counterproductivity is avoided. A collaborative effort is needed to reimagine the life cycle of PET, where its value is maximized, and it is treated as a feedstock rather than as a waste product after use. The development of systems which employ microbes for PET biodegradation and biosynthesis hold the potential to fulfill these requirements, at least partially. This shift from a linear to circularized system of PET production and processing could help meet public demands by reducing the need to \"tap into\" fossil fuel reserves and incentivizing better handling of PET waste.",

By highlighting the major challenges in studying and implementing enzymes for PET degradation, a clearer consensus can be developed to guide future work. Plastic pollution has become a global concern, and the interest in sustainable change is shared by the general public, environmental organizations, and by governments and industrial leaders. Therefore, it is hoped that the different perspectives presented in this review will play a role in helping to encourage a more multi-disciplinary approach to address the ongoing problem of plastic waste streams.",
