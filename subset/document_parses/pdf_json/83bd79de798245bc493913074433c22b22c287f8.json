This paper aims to optimize the disease surveillance process by further identifying the infectious or recovered period of flu cases through social media. Specifically, this paper explores the potential of using public sentiment to detect flu periods at word level. At text level, we constructed a deep learning method to classify the flu period and improve the classification result with sentiment polarity. Three important findings are revealed. Firstly, bloggers in different periods express significantly different sentiments. Blogger sentiments in the recovered period are more positive than in the infectious period when measured by the interclass distance. Secondly, the optimized disease detection process can substantially improve the classification accuracy of flu periods from 0.876 to 0.926. Thirdly, our experimental results confirm that sentiment classification plays a crucial role in accuracy improvement. Precise identification of disease periods enhances the channels for the disease surveillance processes. Therefore, a disease outbreak can be predicted credibly when a larger population is monitored. The research method proposed in our work also provides decision making reference for proactive and effective epidemic control and prevention in real time.",

The latest estimates released by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) revealed the worldwide severity of the illness. According to this authoritative report, the US-CDC estimates that in the period between 1 October 2018 and 4 May 2019, there were approximately 37.4 million to 42.9 million flu infectious in the population population, among which there were from 17.3 to 20.1 million flu-related medical visits [3] . Furthermore, 531,000 to 647,000 people require flu-related hospitalizations, and unfortunately, influenza caused 36,400-61,200 estimated deaths. This estimate is based on more recent data from a larger and more diverse group of countries, including lower middle-income countries, and this estimate excludes deaths from non-respiratory diseases. The statistics indicate a severe reality and a pressing challenge because influenza causes significant losses of human life and damage to property worldwide. As evidenced by the current flu season, influenza viruses can rapidly mutate, evading the most current vaccine formulations [4] . Infectious diseases continue to be the leading cause of death worldwide, and they cause serious loss of life and property when they cannot be quickly and accurately assessed [5] . The World Health The fundamental cause of these serious outbreaks is summarized as follows. First, traditional disease prevention and control institutions mainly rely on a single channel for information monitoring and access. Specifically, data are exclusively sourced from clinical statistics. However, relying exclusively on clinical statistics has obvious disadvantages, such as being time consuming and creating high labor costs [8, 9] . The traditional detection methods cannot integrate multichannel infectious disease information, such as social media and search engine data. Second, social media data are a powerful and promising tool that have been applied to many research subjects, such as healthcare informatics [10, 11] , sentiment analytics [12] , and disaster management [13] [14] [15] . The remarkable value of social media has been widely recognized [16] . Particularly in this paper, we refer to microblogs posted on social media platforms especially from Sina Weibo as weibos. Although disease prevention and control institutions have exerted a significant role in disease detection, they might come up against substantial difficulties in using social media data in disease detection and control due to the lack of analytic methods or accurate monitoring of outbreaks and periods of infectious diseases. There is still a long journey to go to fully utilize social media data in disease prevention and control. Third, the flu is characterized by strong contagiousness and rapid spread, which makes it difficult to monitor in real-time or precisely estimate the spread of the flu.

There is still a long journey to go to fully utilize social media data in disease prevention and control. Third, the flu is characterized by strong contagiousness and rapid spread, which makes it difficult to monitor in real-time or precisely estimate the spread of the flu. For example, the flu can be easily spread by droplets or contaminated items in the air and contact among people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes data on influenza-like illness ILI based on statistics and evaluation after a patient's visit. It would be extremely difficult to obtain information and perform an analysis before the visit. However, apparently, time lags could lead to delayed treatment. Fourth, Google Flu Trends (GFT) provided an estimate of more than double the proportion of clinical data for influenza-like illness (ILI) published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [17] . The ILI was calculated based on surveillance reports from laboratories across the United States [18] . Google used web search data to propose a GFT model for real-time monitoring. When patients are aware of their active flu period and search for flu-related keywords through search engines such as Google, the patients' behavior is recorded by the search engine. Social media sensors, in contrast, show unique advantages for quick flu monitoring and reliable estimation and prediction. There has been a growing consensus that social media sensors can also perform real-time monitoring that is more accurate than GFT [8] . Fifth, part of the ILI data cannot be collected and thus are not available if the patient does not go to the hospital, which makes disease monitoring information inaccurate and incomplete. Therefore, the severity and urgency of the disease as reflected by traditional statistics are often underestimated. However, social media can capture this part of the data because when bloggers catch a cold, they can post their own flu symptoms through social media. If bloggers do not realize that they catch flu, they can also post some flu-related microblogs on social media. This part of the data can also be seen in advance of CDC released reports [19] . Sixth, the previous literature mainly focused on whether the bloggers are infected based on the social media platform [20] and cannot accurately distinguish the various periods of the disease, which largely reduces the effectiveness and pertinence of the information for disease control measures.",

Much of the current research focuses on social media to analyze short texts [21] [22] [23] , in which several papers predict flu trends by classifying flu-related social media data [19] . However, these studies do not divide the flu periods any further. Speedily evolving infectious diseases, including SARS, Ebola and influenza, pose significant health threats throughout the world because of their rapidly changing status and complicated detection process [24, 25] . A considerable amount of work is devoted to forecasting disease outbreaks. A two-period model optimized the process of when and where to assign Ebola treatment units across geographic regions during the outbreak's early phases [26] . Chen et al. (2018) developed a mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based framework to systematically analyze a rich set of policies and to determine the optimal hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance policies that maximize the societal net benefit [27] . It is observed that the surveillance policies should be adapted to different disease progression rates and states. Several studies in this area focused on finding optimal surveillance solutions for flu vaccine production and allocation [28, 29] . Another study considered the conditions of limited reporting and spatial aggregation on the optimization of influenza surveillance system design [30] . Research in this area is mainly concerned with epidemiological inference and prediction based on clinical data collection, but few of the studies provide improved detecting measures using social media data, which represent an alternative source of passive traditional surveillance data that have a larger volume and fewer reporting delays.",

            "text": "Sentiment classification [44, 45] , feature extraction [46] and public opinion monitoring [47, 48] are performed based on a social network dataset for sentiment analysis. Chen et al. (2020) introduced a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis, and they applied this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets [49] . The authors also investigated the real-time flu detection problems and proposed a flu detection model with emotional factors and semantic information [50] . Adamopoulos et al. (2018) examined the effect of latent personality traits on consumers' behavior and preferences, which originated from social media users' levels of emotional range [51] . The effect of social media advertising content on customer engagement was also studied via Facebook users' humor and emotion [52] . Although sentiment analysis has been widely applied to many fields, few researchers consider it to be a powerful tool to be used in determining a patient's status when detecting infectious diseases. Furthermore, word embedding techniques, such as bag of words [53] and word2vec [54] , have become effective means of text processing. High-quality word vector representations provide distributional information about words [55] , especially for word2vector, which appears to be outstanding at improving a model's performance on a limited amount of data. The development of word2vector significantly improves the effectiveness of word representations by transforming sparse, discrete and high-dimensional vectors into dense, continuous and low-dimensional vectors [56] . It is a foundation to transform word segments into fixed dimensional vectors, namely, word embedding, when studying user-generated content [57, 58] . In this paper, the use of high dimensional numeral vectors to represent words serve as semantic feature extractors or the input variables of a neural network. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques have been used widely in text classification. Hughes et al. (2017) have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text processing and classification in online news, reviews and medical text [59] . A large number of modified ANN techniques have emerged with technical advancements. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been an effective method for speech recognition and text sequence tagging [60] , and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks [61] perform well for sequence-based learning tasks. In addition, a large amount of text processing research has emerged, including the use of part-of-speech tagging [62] , lexicon approaches [63] , and other deep learning techniques [64] . The extant literature has several key limitations. Firstly, the abovementioned studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of text processing, sentiment classification or flu tracking [43, 62] . More importantly, these papers do not adequately consider the influence of sentiment polarity on the classification of flu-related weibos or on dividing the different periods of flu-related weibos [50] . Therefore, this paper incorporates sentiment factors into flu surveillance research, and the period classifications of flu-related weibos are probed. Second, neural network techniques are used to process the weibos at the text level [61, 65] . LSTM networks can be used for sentiment analysis of film reviews, part-of-speech tagging, and other fields [60] . Previous studies show that LSTM performs relatively well in text processing but has been rarely used for disease weibo analysis. To fill in this gap, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between sentiment polarity and the flu period at the word level and text level based on a weibo dataset.",

As the \"to-be\" process optimized by social media, the MC-IDDP process can improve the reliability of detecting infectious disease and discover more infectious people. It recognizes the disease periods earlier and works in an efficient way. Next, we propose 4 propositions and corresponding demonstrations. Figure 3 . Figure 3a shows the logical structure model of a solitary channel, and Figure 3b shows the logical structure model for multiple channels. The upper part of Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a traditional solitary infectious disease detecting process. Patients usually go to the hospital when they have already suffered influenza. Only afterwards it is possible for the CDC to detect the flu trends of the whole society. In the \"as-is\" process, there is only one channel to detect infectious diseases, which is through hospital institutions. The \"as-is\" process is abbreviated as SC-IDDP. The \"to-be\" process is the multiple channel infectious disease detection process (MC-IDDP). The bottom part of Figure 2 illustrates the MC-IDDP process based on social media platforms. MC-IDDP has three infectious disease detecting channels. Channel 1 is the traditional infectious disease detecting channel, mentioned above. Channel 2 monitors the infectious diseases by using search engines [17, 18] . This paper constructs Channel 3 to detect infectious diseases using social media data. Compared with Channel 1 and 2, Channel 3 enables more effective disease detection for the following three reasons. First, the traditional Channel 1 is not able to use social media data to detect diseases, such as flu, whereas Channel 2 and Channel 3 can use these data. Second, search engines can detect the keywords of the corresponding flu symptoms and treatments in Channel 2 when people realize that they have the flu. It neglects some of the patients who have caught the flu but do not search for flu keywords and simultaneously adds fake patients who run the search engine for flu keywords without flu. Third, although people do not realize that they have caught the flu, they usually post tweets via social media to reflect their feelings, opinions and behaviors, which can be detected by Channel 3. It helps the CDC to analyze social media data to discover early flu trends. Additionally, Channel 3 can not only monitor infectious disease outbreaks in early stages but also identify the flu period. The content inside the dotted line (shown in Figure 2 ) is the main research content of this paper, which aims to find the flu-related weibos and further determine the flu period to improve the accuracy of infectious disease detection.",

Sina Weibo has maintained the top rank in China's weibo. According to the second quarter earnings released by Sina, monthly active users from Sina Weibo reached 431 million by 30 June 2018, outstripping Twitter as the world's largest independent social media company in terms of user scale [67] . Sina Weibo has always been the data source of various types of major events and emergencies in China and has a far-reaching scope of dissemination and important social influence. This study uses web-based social media data in Sina Weibo. The details are clearly shown in Table 1 . We collected the texts that contained the keywords, namely, \"flu (Gan Mao)\", \"influenza (Liu Gan)\", \"cough (Ke Sou)\", \"fever (Fa Shao)\", \"sneeze (Pen Ti)\" and \"nasal congestion (Bi Sai)\" in 2016 and 2017 through a Sina Application Programming Interface (API). We purchased the official data collection service from Gooseeker. Gooseeker is an authorized API of Sina Weibo. The data do not include private information such as personal name, gender, age, etc., and do not endanger privacy and other related issues. All data can be used legally. However, the data include a large amount of advertising and unrelated material. Thus, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to filter out unrelated flu weibos. Ultimately, 100,000 flu-related weibos were chosen randomly as a word2vector training corpus in which 10,000 weibos in 2016 and 10,000 weibos in 2017 were randomly selected as a neural network classification dataset of sentiment polarity and period. In what follows, the 20,000 weibos are labeled according to the following rules. In terms of sentiment polarity, \"0\" represents positive sentiment, whereas \"1\"indicates negative sentiment. In terms of the period, \"0\" indicates the infectious period, while \"1\" represents the recovered period. The dataset was divided into 4 labeled groups with a total of 12 people involved. Every three members were in one group. Each group was assigned 5000 weibos. Each member in one group was required to label all 5000 weibos without communication to intentionally make the marked category accurate since artificial annotation has a certain subjectivity. The blog was thought to be invalid if the results were inconsistent among the 3 members. After the process of cleaning and arrangement, 15,301 weibos were valid, with the remaining 4699 weibos invalid. We randomly chose 70% of the 15,301 valid weibos as the neural network training set and 30% as the test set.",

The words in the infectious period mainly describe flu confrontation and symptoms. The recovered period describes the status of improvement or remission of the flu. One-hundred ninety-five words in four classes can be found in Table 2 . To display the distribution of the 195 words in two-dimensional space, we used t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimension of the word embedding. The scatter plot was drawn by the two-dimensional coordinates of each word in Figure 10 . Each point is a word, with a total of 195 points. It is clear that the words that denote positive sentiment and the recovered period are clustered together, and the words in the negative sentiment and infectious period are clustered together closely. In addition, between these 195 words, this paper calculates the similarity between every two words of the flu period and the sentiment polarity based on word2vector. Additionally, a similarity greater than 0.6 was reserved, which is represented by the connections in Figure 10 . Therefore, as seen from Figure 10 , there are four types of connections, which are divided between the infectious period and negative sentiment, infectious period and positive sentiment, recovered period and negative sentiment, and recovered period and positive sentiment. This paper also performed statistical analysis on these four types of lines in the scatter plot. When the similarity is greater than 0.6, it is found that there are 53 links between the infectious period and negative sentiment and more than 16 links between the infectious period and positive sentiment. Additionally, there are 81 links between the recovered period and positive sentiment and more than 7 links between the recovered period and negative sentiment. Obviously, the infectious period is much more similar and closer to negative sentiment than to positive sentiment. In contrast, the recovered period is much more similar and closer to positive sentiment than to negative sentiment.",

The force of the nodes is the similarity between the two words. It can be clearly seen from Figure 11 that most of the edges around recovered nodes, such as health and fitness, are all positive nodes, such as cheerful and happy. Additionally, positive nodes, such as active, alive and kicking, are connected with recovered nodes, such as get well and heal. In addition, as can be seen from the similarity forces, these three recovered nodes-in good health, healthy, and fitness-which indicate a healthy status, are connected to more positives nodes than these words are, which indicates that the blogger is recovering but not yet healthy.

From the matrix, the distance between the recovered period and positive sentiment is 4.297, while the distance between the recovered period and negative sentiment is 7.632, which significantly shows that the recovered period is closer to positive sentiment. In terms of the infectious period, the distance to the positive sentiment is 9.521, and the distance to the negative sentiment is 7.867, which indicates that the infectious period is closer to the negative sentiment. In addition, another interclass distance measurement method was selected to further verify the correctness of the conclusion, which is known as the between-group linkage and which measures the interclass distance by the average distance between the two categories of individuals. The Euclidean distance matrix is shown in the following section. This finding implies that the conclusion is consistent with the above. The recovered period is closer to the positive sentiment, and the infectious period is closer to the negative sentiment.",

In addition, traditional methods based on clinical data make it challenging to shed light on the current situation and predict future developing trends [41] . Along with the widespread use of the Internet, social networking data, including web-based epidemiological data, have had explosive growth. Data from social networks show apparent advantages in several respects, such as being real-time and having time-sharing, along with a broad scope of data coverage [31] [32] [33] [34] . In terms of the scale of users, Sina Weibo's monthly active users reached 431 million on 30 June 2018, overtaking Twitter, which makes Sina Weibo the world's largest independent social media platform [67] . Sina Weibo is the most popular social media platform in China for the public to share opinions and disseminate information about emergencies and major social events. Therefore, Weibo has a far-reaching scope of dissemination and is an important social influence. Therefore, the use of web-based social media data growth is an imperative trend to use for effective disease control and prevention. Weibo messages carry rich and meaningful implications. Previous approaches in flu state detection through social media have yielded outstanding achievements but have some limitations at the same time. Most obviously, the semantic information was seldom considered; this information might be important for flu detection [50] .",

For example, bloggers experience different flu periods of the latent, infectious, or recovered kind, and their sentiments correspond to the different periods. In reality, most bloggers who are ill are usually negative, while bloggers in recovered periods are active and optimistic. Therefore, omitting the key flu period and non-differentiating Weibo messages data could lead to data contamination and misleading conclusions. It is important to investigate the relationship between the flu period and the sentiment polarity, to make it possible to be conducive to accuracy for classifying the flu period, which directly results in accurately estimating the number of patients in different flu periods.

Several important findings are produced. (1) Social media is a promising and powerful data platform to detect flu patients by earlier discovery rather than traditional medical data. Their periods can be further sorted into infectious and recovered, as mined from social media. (2) The semantic information varies from the weibo texts posted by patients in different flu periods. The interclass distance between the recovered period and positive sentiment is closer than between the recovered period and negative sentiment, and the interclass distance between the infectious and the negative is closer than that of the positive. Additionally, it was noted that the healthier the bloggers are, the more positive sentiments they have. The more serious the flu is, the more that bloggers are connected with negative emotions. (3) A multichannel disease detection model is developed in this study to evaluate and classify the flu period with an accuracy of up to 0.926 based on the LSTM network. Our optimized model effectively improves the classification accuracy of the flu period after adding the sentiment classification results.",

This paper further divides flu-related weibos into two periods: recovered and infectious. Research outcomes improve the reliability and accuracy for the prediction of flu trends. Both point (2) and point (3) not only help the CDC to detect disease information in real time but also provide a novel method for disease information management. (4) The conclusion supports the expansion of the number of neural network training sets, eliminating some of the high cost of manual labeling. The classification results of the flu-period can be replaced in the model to increase the amount of training set data, which enables the LSTM neural network to fully learn to better characterize the model.",

At the text level, the sentiment polarity and flu-period of flu-related weibos were classified by the LSTM networks, respectively. We counted the classification results as both belonging to the infectious and negative sentiment as well as to the recovered and positive sentiment, and we calculated the accuracy rate. We then compared the rate with the overall flu-period classification accuracy to observe the differences.
