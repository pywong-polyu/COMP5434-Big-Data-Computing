Another result was that school psychologists increasingly became female dominated, except in administrative positions.",

The first special edition was on sexism in the schools (Engin, A, Leppaluoto, J. R. (Ramage) , and Fodor, I, 1973). The following comment by John Guidubaldi summarizes the caution of the day: Enthusiastic response to our last issue on sexism reveals a critical concern among many school psychologists that unjustified discrimination causes long lasting adverse effects on emotional and behavioral adjustment. We extend our appreciation to Jean Leppaluoto (Ramage) and Ann Engin for coordinating that issue and increasing our sensitivity to the educationally related problems of women in society. (Guidubaldi, 1973, p. 2) He left out the third coeditor, Iris Fodor. Sexism was not recognized in those days the way it is today. The other challenging publication was a coedited edition of the School Psychology Review on nondiscriminatory assessment, or un-biased multifactored assessment (Engin, Leppaluoto, & Petty, 1977 Eds., 1977a , 1977b .",

We draw heavily from the knowledge generated theoretically by academic psychology and practically from the work of colleagues in other psychological specialties. We are bonded also to the fields of education and special education, which generate theory and technique applicable to the practice of school psychology and to many other relevant sources of information. (p. 138) Another creative publication that came out of the Network was titled School Psychology: A Blueprint for Training and Practice (Ysseldyke, Reynolds, & Weinberg, 1984) . I wrote the chapter entitled \"Systems Development and Planning\" (Ramage, 1984a (Ramage, , 1984b (Ramage, , 1984c Stephen DeMers, and Dr. Judy Alpert, wanted a staff member to represent school psychologists and school psychological services. The role of the Director of the Program was to support efforts of school psychologists through working with Division 16 leaders and to be a part of the alliances and coalitions that advocated on legislation, regulations, and guidelines in areas that affected the children we serve. When Rhonda Talley took over, the office became the Office of Policy and Advocacy in the Schools (Ramage, 2016; Talley, 2016) .",

In this chapter, I have focused on the early years as the context for how I became a problem solver and advocate for children and their families. I am a person who looks at the big picture to see where we need to go, so looking back has been interesting and challenging. There is a consistency that I see from my family and my professional roles. For example, I value working with others, whether it be an individual, group, or agency. I like taking on challenges for which the solutions are long lasting. Whether I am working with one child, a group of people or writing and implementing policy, the change process is the same. My goals have always related to diversifying the field and to serving all children.",

I presently teach in the California State University, Northridge school psychology program that Dr. Wilda Laija-Rodriguez ably coordinates. The program reflects my passions and goals. Most of our students are the first in their families to go on to higher education. Most of them are bilingual. All are devoted to making a difference in children's lives. I run a business with my husband, Don Carpenter, (i.e., Early California potteries and other antiques, and vintage musical instruments). I serve as the liaison between the California Association of School Psychologists and School Psychology Educators of California. I like to travel. In 2016, Dr. Carol Robinson-Za\u00f1artu and I went to Japan to attend the International School Psychology colloquium. Lastly, COVID-19 has entered our lives. We have a tremendous challenge. Because school psychologists have the knowledge and skills to enhance learning and mental health, we are needed more than ever. I look forward to the challenge.",
