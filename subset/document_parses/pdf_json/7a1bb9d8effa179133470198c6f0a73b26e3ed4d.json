Although many new and emerging therapeutic agents are often sufficient to control the disease, there is still a need for alternative treatment options in challenging cases. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been applied to many T-cell-mediated diseases to restore immune homeostasis and treat psoriasis effectively. In this paper, we present a psoriasis patient who did not respond to methotrexate, narrowband ultraviolet B, or acitretin. Because of a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the patient had contraindications for cyclosporine, fumaric acid esters, and biologics but achieved remission with a total of 12 sessions of ECP in two and a half months. Although exacerbation was recorded after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease infection at the end of the first month, scores from the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) and dermatological life quality index (DLQI) were regressed significantly within two and a half months. ECP seems to provide an effective and rapid response for psoriasis and should be considered for psoriasis patients who fail to respond or have contraindications to existing treatments.",

As the disease worsens, numerous traditional agents, such as methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine, and apremilast, are recommended [2] . Owing to the growing understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis, biologics that target the specific immunologic signaling pathways are considered first-line treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis. Although they show excellent long-term efficacy and tolerability, possible risks of systemic side effects and immunosuppression have led to the consideration of other targeted treatment alternatives, such as extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), for the restoration of immunotolerance in cases of patients who have contraindications to immunosuppressive therapies [3] .",

The procedure of ECP consists of ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation of peripheral lymphocytes incubated with 8-methoxy psoralen and reinfusion back to the patient [4] . Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, it is thought to provide its effect through lymphocyte apoptosis and normalizing the immune system. Successful outcomes of ECP were investigated in many autoimmune dermatological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, pemphigus vulgaris, erosive lichen planus, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, cutaneous mucinosis, scleromyxoedema, eosinophilic fasciitis, and psoriasis [5, 6] .",

The patient was diagnosed with psoriasis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma following histopathological confirmation four and three years ago, respectively. He also had psoriatic arthritis and asthma. Dermatological examination of the patient revealed results that were consistent with thick, scaly plaques on the elbows, knees, dorsum of the feet and hands, posterior and anterior trunk. There were prominent signs of psoriatic nail involvement on fingers and toes. Owing to the severity of psoriasis, topical agents alone were not considered. The patient did not obtain any additional benefit from 25 mg/day of acitretin. Methotrexate was administered two separate times but had to be stopped owing to severe liver impairment. The patient was unresponsive to long sessions (62 sessions) of narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB). Because patients with a history of systemic malignancy in the last five years should avoid cyclosporine and biological agents, fumaric acid was considered for off-label use. However, it was not approved owing to the risk of progression of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",

The central venous access, considered a clean skin area from the psoriasis plaques, was used with a double-needle and a total blood volume of 1500 mL. To prevent occlusion of the catheters, heparin was administered in an amount (approximately 1.2 and 1.4 mL) to fill the catheter lumens at the end of each treatment session. The patient had received a total of 12 ECP sessions within 2.5 months, as depicted in Fig. 1 . However, the ECP had to be interrupted for 15 days at the end of the first month because he had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The patient described only flu-like symptoms and did not have severe symptoms that required hospitalization. While exacerbation was recorded during this period, the patient improved significantly after two and a half months on the basis of two objective scores. The PASI score, which is calculated for the extent of involved body surface area and the intensity of redness, scaling, and plaque thickness, was significantly regressed from 17.5 to 2.8 ( Figs. 2 and 3) . The dermatological life quality index (DLQI), which is the tool most frequently used to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life, improved from 19 to 6. Considerable improvement was also observed in psoriatic nail findings, such as distal onycholysis, oil spots, and splinter hemorrhage, according to the records of dermatoscopic photographs taken two and a half months apart (Fig. 4) . The patient tolerated ECP well without any evidence of side effects.",

Several medical comorbidities, especially joint involvement, may accompany psoriasis in patients [7] . While advances in pathophysiology continue to increase, as of today, the pathogenesis of psoriasis can be summarized as alterations or dysregulation in innate and acquired immune response. Interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 12 and 23, produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and myeloid dendritic cells play a central role in the disease pathogenesis but also has led to a tremendous improvement in therapeutic efficacy through selective blockade [7, 8] .

Although it restores immunotolerance, it does not cause an increase in the risk of infection or malignancy as in conventional immunosuppressive therapies. Therefore, it has been used to treat a broad spectrum of autoimmune dermatological diseases, including scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, atopic dermatitis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, cutaneous mucinosis, lichen planus, pemphigus, and psoriasis [5, 6, 10] . In a study conducted with a group of eight patients with psoriasis and seronegative arthritis, it was reported that the effectiveness of treatment lasted more than one year in half of the patients who responded very well [11] .
