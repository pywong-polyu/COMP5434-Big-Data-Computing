            "text": "Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory infection that has had devastating effects on the world. Recently, new COVID-19 variants are emerging making the situation more challenging and threatening. Evaluation and quantification of COVID-19 lung abnormalities based on chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans can help determining the disease stage, efficiently allocating limited healthcare resources, and making informed treatment decisions. During pandemic era, however, visual assessment and quantification of COVID-19 lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive and prone to error, which raises an urgent quest to develop practical autonomous solutions. In this context, first, the paper introduces an open-access COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset containing 433 CT images from 82 patients that have been annotated by an expert radiologist. Second, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based framework is proposed, referred to as the COVID-Rate, that autonomously segments lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 from chest CT scans. Performance of the proposed COVID-Rate framework is evaluated through several experiments based on the introduced and external datasets. The results show a dice score of 0.802 and specificity and sensitivity of 0.997 and 0.832, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate that the COVID-Rate model can efficiently segment COVID-19 lesions in both 2D CT images and whole lung volumes. Results on the external dataset illustrate generalization capabilities of the COVID-Rate model to CT images obtained from a different scanner. arXiv:2107.01527v1 [eess.IV] 4 Jul 2021 2/15 3/15 14/15",

According to the Coronavirus Resource Center of John Hopkins University (JHU) 1 , over 179 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including over 3.8 million deaths, have been reported in 192 countries/regions by 24 June 2021. Numerous studies indicate that COVID-19 vaccination can effectively reduce disease transmission, hospital admissions, and deaths. However, due to new emerging COVID-19 variants 2-4 the number of COVID-19 daily cases is still increasing in many areas.

            "text": "Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold-standard test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the RT-PCR test suffers from high false-negative rates and delayed results. Medical imaging, particularly Computed Tomography (CT) scans, has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a complementary source of data for diagnosis and severity assessment of COVID-19. Countries with high rates of COVID-19 cases use chest CT images as the primary screening/monitoring technique. Several studies, therefore, have investigated COVID-19 manifestations on chest medical images. The most commonly observed chest imaging patterns in COVID-19 patients, as shown in Figure 1 , are Ground-Glass Opacity (GGO) and consolidation [5] [6] [7] . GGO refers to a slight increase in lung attenuation such that the underlying vessels are still observable 8 . The consolidation, on the other hand, is considered as a rise in lung intensity such that the underlying vessels are obscured 8 . The appearance of different types of imaging patterns and their location and distribution can be considered as specific signs of COVID-19 and provide helpful information for identifying the stage and severity of the disease 9-12 . Consolidation pattern demonstrated with red arrows. 24 Evaluation and quantification of lung involvement in COVID-19 patients based on their chest images can help determine the disease stage, have an optimal allocation of the limited health resources, and make informed treatment decisions. Compared to other imaging modalities, CT imaging provides more accurate representations of COVID-19 lesions, making it the most informative imaging modality for the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Radiologists measure the COVID-19 lesions from the chest CT images and quantify the disease's severity using different severity measures such as the Percentage of Opacity (PO) and CT severity score. The PO indicates the extent of involvement of the whole lung volume 13 , while the CT severity score is determined based on the spread of the COVID-19 lesions in each lobe 14 . During the pandemic era, when the number of patients is exponentially increasing, visual assessment and quantification of lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive, laborious, and prone to error. Automatic segmentation of infectious regions can, therefore, help quantify the extent of lung involvement in patients confirmed with COVID-19, compute different severity scores, and speed up the treatment procedure. Contributions: Motivated by the urgent quest to develop accurate and reliable automated models for prognostic assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia, we introduce an open-access COVID-19 segmentation dataset along with a Deep Learning (DL)-based framework for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung abnormalities from chest CT scans.

In the COVID-Rate architecture, a convolution layer with stride of two replaces the max-pooling layer to mitigate information loss during the down-sampling stage. Furthermore, we incorporate a context perception boosting module in the encoding block that can learn the multi-scale representation of COVID-19 manifestations using four parallel paths of dilated convolutions and a linear projection of the input feature maps. Residual links in the encoding block help to learn in-depth features and avoid vanishing/exploding gradients. Implementing an un-symmetric network architecture reduces the model's complexity and computational time while slightly improving its performance. Adopting a hybrid loss function facilitates image-level and patch-level supervision during the training phase. \u2022 We produced a high-quality COVID-19 segmentation dataset containing 433 annotated chest CT images from 82 COVID-19 patients, annotated by a thoracic radiologist with 20 years of experience. \u2022 A novel synthetic data generation (augmentation) pipeline is proposed that generates synthetic pairs of CT images and infection masks by inserting the infectious regions from COVID-19 CT images into healthy CT images.

Open-source pixel-level annotated datasets can promote developing DL networks for COVID-19 lesions segmentation. Furthermore, evaluation of segmentation models on public datasets makes it feasible to fairly compare different segmentation models. To address the aforementioned issues, via this manuscript, we introduce a pixel-level annotated CT dataset, referred to as the COVID-CT-Rate. The CT scans used to generate the COVID-19 segmentation dataset are a subset of our previous COVID-19 diagnosis CT dataset 34 , which is accessible through Figshare 34 .

All CT images are reconstructed by the Filtered Back Projection method using the reconstruction matrix size is 512 \u00d7 512 and D40s kernel, which modifies the data frequency contents and mitigates the noise.

The CT images from diffident parts of the lung (top, middle, and bottom) are included in the dataset with different infection rates (area of the infection divided by the lung area in each CT image). These considerations help the AI models to achieve better performance when predicting the regions of infection on a whole lung volume. Examples of CT images with their ground truth masks are shown in Figure 4 . ",

            "text": "The architecture of the proposed COVID-Rate framework (as shown in Figure 5 ) is an encoder-decoder-based network containing an encoding path, a context perception boosting module, and a decoding path. These three underlying components are described below: Encoding Path extracts informative features from chest images. The Encoding Path is initiated with a 3 \u00d7 3 convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by a Batch Normalization (BN) layer and ReLU activation function. Four encoding blocks with 32, 64, 128, and 256 filters, with the architecture represented in Figure 5 (b), are then applied sequentially. The encoding block has two units, each consisting of two successive 3 \u00d7 3 convolution layers, followed by the BN layer and ReLU function. The first convolution layer of the first unit in the encoding block uses a stride of 2 for down-sampling. The max-pooling layer is replaced with a convolution layer with a stride of two to mitigate information loss during down-sampling. The input feature maps of each unit are then added to the output feature maps using element-wise addition operation. Transmitting the feature maps to the deeper levels (residual linking) facilitates the convergence of the network and alleviates the gradient vanishing issue 36 . Context Perception Boosting (CPB) Module: As mentioned previously, a critical challenge in segmenting COVID-19 lung abnormalities is various sizes and scattered distribution of the regions of infection. Since a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based encoder extracts the information from a local area of the global image by applying the convolution kernel, it may fail to learn the long-range dependencies of the global image. To address this problem and inspired by 37 , we adopt a context perception boosting module in the last encoding block of the COVID-Rate network. This module, as demonstrated in Figure 6 , contains a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution layer for linear projection of the input feature maps and four parallel 3 \u00d7 3 convolution layers with different dilation rates. L2 regularization is applied after each convolution operation to penalize weight matrices and mitigate over-fitting. The outputs of different convolution layers are then integrated using element-wise addition. The dilation rates for parallel convolutions are set to 1, 2, 4, and 8. The context perception boosting module increases the receptive field of the extracted feature maps by incorporating multi-scale kernels, helping the network detect COVID-19 abnormalities of various sizes. Decoding Path, takes the extracted features of the context perception boosting module as input, aiming to restore the spatial representation and generate masks indicating the regions of infection. For reconstructing precise infection masks, four decoding blocks are adopted within the decoder path of the COVID-Rate segmentation network. Each decoding block, presented in Figure 5 (c), starts with an up-sampling layer to expand the feature maps' size to the size of encoding feature maps. The up-sampling layer's outputs are then concatenated to the extracted features from the encoding blocks. A 3 \u00d7 3 convolution layer followed by a BN layer, and a ReLU layer is then applied to the skip connection's output to adjust the number of feature channels and learn the spatial representation of the contextual information. The number of filters for decoding blocks are 512, 256, 128, and 64. The first decoding block of the COVID-Rate network has the maximum number of filters. Indeed, the number of feature channels in each decoding block is not equal to its corresponding encoding block, leading to fewer learning 4/15 parameters, reducing the model complexity, and saving computational time. The output of the last decoding block has the same spatial dimension as the original CT scans. A 1 \u00d7 1 convolution layer with one feature channel is applied on the last decoding block's output. The sigmoid activation function predicts the probability of each pixel belonging to the infection class.",

These techniques mainly include applying simple transformations such as rotating, horizontal/vertical flip, zooming, and/or translation on original images. However, these transformations make minor changes to the existing images, resulting in limited diversity on newly generated images. Development of new data augmentation techniques are therefore crucial to introduce more variability to the synthetic samples for better data reinforcement. For example, recently, Reference 44 implemented a specific data augmentation approach into a generative adversarial segmentation network and achieved improved results. Capitalizing on this vision, we propose a specific approach for generating synthetic pairs of CT images and their corresponding infection masks by extracting the COVID-19 regions of infection from infected chest CT scans and inserting them into healthy chest CT images. We use a chest CT image containing COVID-19 regions of infection alongside its infection mask and a chest CT image from a healthy person acquired by the same scanner alongside its lung mask as the input. First, CT images are normalized using the mean and standard deviation of their pixel intensities. Next, regions of",

After segmenting the lung regions, only CT images containing the lung tissues are passed to the next stage, and the rest are eliminated. Each CT image is normalized based on its mean and standard deviation (std). The datasets are divided into three independent groups for training (60%), validation (10%), and testing (30%). To avoid information leakage, we kept the underlying datasets patient-independent, meaning that patients' CT images are not shared between training, validation, and test sets.

            "text": "This study is motivated by the urgent quest to develop accurate and reliable automated models for prognostic assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia coupled with the need for providing high-quality COVID-19 lesion segmentation datasets. To better position this study within the existing literature, first, we discuss the related works. models are mainly developed based on CNNs. Such DL models are image-to-image networks containing an encoding path for extracting high-resolution features from input images and a decoding path for generating masks indicating the regions of interest. The majority of the COVID-19 lesion segmentation models have been developed upon U-Net 25 due to its superiority for the task of medical image segmentation 26, 27 . For example, using a U-Net architecture integrated with DenseNet blocks in the encoder path, Chaganti et al. 28 proposed a segmentation model to quantify lung abnormalities caused by COVID-19 from CT images. Similarly, Zhou et al. 29 proposed an enhanced U-Net segmentation model by incorporating spatial and channel attention mechanisms. Segmentation networks can be designed based on 2D or 3D CNNs to segment COVID-19 regions of infection either on slice-level or patient-level basis. It should be noted that 3D segmentation networks that can segment infections on the whole lung volumes are more desired from practical point of view. However, they need a large amount of 3D annotated lung volumes for efficient training and are more computationally expensive. Reference 27 trained both 2D and 3D variants of the U-Net model for segmenting COVID-19 infections from chest CT scans of 558 patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia. According to their experiments, the 2D U-Net model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 79.07% while 3D U-Net obtained DSC of 70.35%, demonstrating that on small datasets, slice-level segmentation can achieve better results. Generally speaking, to efficiently train a DL-based segmentation model, large amount of annotated CT images are required. However, due to nonuniform contrasts and irregular boundaries of COVID-19 lesions, providing pixel-level labeled datasets is challenging and expensive. Some research studies use segmentation methods that require less data for training to overcome the lack of sufficient pixel-level annotated CT images. Authors in Reference 30 developed a semi-supervised segmentation framework that is trained only on 50 annotated CT images of COVID-19 patients together with 1, 600 unlabeled CT images. Their proposed model segments the COVID-19 lung abnormalities under both one and two classes of infections. Integrating semi-supervised and few-shot learning methods, Reference 31 introduced a segmentation network that can learn from a few number of labeled chest CT scans. Authors proposed a dual-path network architecture for few-shot learning and incorporated an adaptive knowledge exchange module between the networks' paths to enhance the model's performance in segmenting COVID-19 lesions. Alternatively, one may choose to train a DL network with weak supervision through lower-quality labels, which are inexpensive and need less time to be generated. For instance, Laradji et al. 32 proposed a weakly supervised learning method by annotating a single pixel for any COVID-19 infection region on a CT image and achieved a DSC range of 68% -75% on three public datasets. Their proposed labeling scheme reduced the annotation time for each infection region from 10 -15 seconds to 1 -3 seconds. Using some simple operations, Yao et al. 33 synthesized COVID-19 regions of infection on chest CT scans of healthy people and generated fake image-label pairs for training their segmentation network with no labeled data.",

The results indicate that COVID-Rate can efficiently segment COVID-19 regions of infection from CT scans on both slice-level and patient-level basis. To cope with data hungry nature of deep AI models, a novel data augmentation method that generates synthetic CT images and infection masks by inserting regions of infection from COVID-19 infected CT scans to healthy CT images. In particular, based on the results of the comparison study (Table 4) , it can be observed that the COVID-Rate network outperforms the standard U-Net networks considering all evaluation metrics. Furthermore, COVID-Rate with less trainable parameters and computational complexity yields better results than the residual U-Net. Although adding the CPB module imposes some computational burden to the model and increases the number of trainable parameters from 6.32 million to 8.75 million, it can improve DSC, SEN, and MAE metrics while providing a similar SPC. The results of the generalization experiment (Figures 8 and 9 ) illustrate that despite being trained only on CT images with infection, our proposed COVID-Rate can optimally segment COVID-19 lesions on whole CT volumes. Indeed, by quantifying the regions of infection on 2D CT slices and summing them up for the entire lung volume, assuming that the changes over a thick CT slice are negligible, the model can approximate the patient-level infection rate in COVID-19 patients. Finally, from the results of the experiment conduced to evaluate efficacy of the proposed synthetic data augmentation mechanism ( Figure 10 and Table 6 ), it can be observed that augmenting the training set using the proposed data augmentation method can improve the average DSC from 0.7599 to 0.781, the average SEN from 0.8104 to 0.8308, the average SPEC from 0.9953 to 0.9957, and the average MAE from 0.0074 to 0.0067. The experimental results indicate that concatenating the synthetic images generated by our data augmentation method will enrich the training set by introducing more variability to the training set, resulting in enhanced model performance.",
