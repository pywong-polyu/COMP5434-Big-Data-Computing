However, though powered to assess the vaccines' efficacy and detect common adverse events, these and similar phase three randomized controlled trials cannot identify causal associations for serious adverse events that are very rare or much more likely among populations not included in the clinical trials. As illustrated by reports of a risk for anaphylaxis following vaccination with a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, particularly among individuals with a prior history of serious allergic reactions [1] , potential safety problems may be identified only after widespread use (Table 1) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Failure to undertake rapid, credible assessments of such potential safety problems risks missing a true safety concern or, conversely, use of a vaccine being restricted unnecessarily, as well as loss of trust of the public or health professionals, leading to underuse of vaccines and continued spread of the virus.",

However, lack of a clear biological mechanism for the vaccine to cause the particular adverse event should not be used to preclude a causal association. Almost by definition, a new and unexpected adverse reaction will not have an immediately obvious mechanism, for example, Guillain-Barre syndrome and the 1976 swine flu vaccine [2] . Such assessments should also be open to new evidence over time, as late reported cases, new diagnostic testing, or other factors may lead to different conclusions from those originally reached.",

The strongest evidence comes from: high-quality controlled clinical trials; carefully conducted self-controlled case series or case-crossover studies; demonstration of a live vaccine strain virus from a sterile body site ( meningitis); and well-documented appearance of a non-relapsing syndrome or disease after each of two or more doses of a particular vaccine given to the same individual, particularly when documented in multiple individuals from different independent sources [9, 10] . In practice, evidence of laboratory isolation of the vaccine strain or repeated occurrence of a non-relapsing adverse event in the same individual are only rarely available. High-quality randomized controlled trials often offer the strongest evidence but can be logistically or ethically infeasible for assessing rare serious adverse events once a vaccine is in widespread use. The next strongest types of evidence come from cohort studies with either historical or contemporaneous controls and from case-control studies, especially ones which avoid recall and other biases. Statistical techniques such as propensity scores (for cohort studies) can help strengthen the evidence provided by such studies. This is especially so in dealing with rare reactions where ordinary regression methods are vulnerable when there are few outcome events. The weakest evidence comes from uncontrolled observational studies such as ecological studies, uncontrolled case series, data from passive vaccine adverse event surveillance systems, case reports, and editorial articles. These weakest types of evidence are generally useful only for hypothesis generation.",

Background rate data are critical for rapid assessments of claims of safety issues, as has been observed with multiple vaccines, including human papillomavirus vaccines, influenza vaccines, and measles, mumps, rubella vaccines [11] . However, background rates can vary considerably between populations in different areas due to differences in disease exposure and other factors, so assessments of safety signals should generally rely on background rates for the same population from which the signals arise. Similarly, analyses of adverse events among subpopulations such as pregnant women and the elderly require background rate data reflecting factors such as health care utilization and underlying health conditions of those subpopulations. Ideally, background rates should be from a time when health care utilization was similar as at the time of administration of the vaccine in that population. In comparisons between adverse event rates among vaccine recipients and background rates, a moderate increase, for example, an at-least two-fold increase (with lower 95% confidence limit above 1.5), should generally be considered a relevant increase in risk for objective outcomes such as mortality or myocardial infarctions. For outcomes with less objective definitions, such as some neurological or autoimmune disorders, a larger increase in effect size may be required for credibility.",

However, if a vaccine is confirmed to cause a specific adverse event in one population, the assumption should be that it can cause that adverse event in all populations, unless data of at least equivalent quality show the contrary in a different population.

Besides data from randomized controlled trials conducted for licensure or authorization, strong evidence from self-controlled case series and cohort studies is likely to be available from existing population registries and databases on health care utilization, particularly in multiple high-income countries. Important examples are the Vaccine Safety Datalink in the United States and the European Union Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance Research Network's ACCESS project [13, 14] . Multinational groups such as the Global Vaccine Data Network can help coordinate large studies across such high performing systems [15] . However, in many low-and middle-income countries, the most readily available evidence will be from the weakest category, being sufficient only to generate signals of possible safety problems but probably inadequate to assess whether those signals are real. In such settings, even case-control studies to evaluate signals will often be impractical due to challenges such as relevant medical data on individuals not being collected before or at the time of vaccination or during the course of the adverse event. Even when such medical data are collected, accessing and analyzing them retrospectively can be extremely difficult due to variations in how they are recorded and stored. Limitations in evaluation of safety signals may be particularly problematic for any vaccines that are used in low-and middle-income countries but not in high income countries, or for evaluating safety signals that appear in low-and middle-income countries but not in high income countries for widely used vaccines.",
