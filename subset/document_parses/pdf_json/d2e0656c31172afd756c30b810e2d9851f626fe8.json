            "text": "Background The immune system matures throughout childhood; therefore, evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 in the paediatric population is important. Efficacy and safety have not been established for COVID-19 vaccines in a large part of the paediatric population at the time of the initial approval for use in adults. This study aims to provide an overview of planned and ongoing paediatric clinical trials investigating the safety and/or efficacy of COVID-19. Methods We identified all paediatric clinical trials investigating the safety and/or efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialregister.eu, as well as all clinical trials planned in agreed PIPs (Paediatric Investigational Plans) as of 11 June 2021. Information about the study design, the paediatric age groups that they included, and the primary and secondary safety and efficacy outcomes were collected, together with expected timelines for the studies. Results 21 clinical trials were identified through the clinical trial registries and 19 clinical trials were specified in 6 agreed PIPs, 5 of these trials were also in the trial registers. All PIPs stipulated development of the COVID-19 vaccines for the full paediatric population, with a deferral. The earliest expected completion date of a PIPs is March 2024. The majority (14/21) of registered trials are randomised double-blinded studies. All investigated safety, 20 have a surrogate efficacy outcome (immunogenicity), of these 7 also measure clinical efficacy (COVID-19 infections). 18 studies were initiated, of these, all but one is still ongoing and one in adolescents has been finalised. Conclusion Even though several trials have been planned in agreed PIPs, the registered paediatric clinical trials identified are most often not part of a PIP.",

The regulation was set in place to stimulate the research of medicines for use in the paediatric population and to provide more information about the use of medicines in this population. The agreed PIP describes the studies to be conducted in all relevant subsets of the paediatric population, including the timing of completion.

Sionvac Biotech are the first expecting to finalise clinical trials including children; a Phase 1/2 in September 2021 and a Phase 2 in January 2022. The first trial including infants and toddlers is a Phase II/III investigating the safety of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine which will be completed in June 2023 (see Fig. 2 ). For term newborn, one clinical trial was registered to investigate the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine). This trial is expected to be completed in October 2024. Most (15/21) registered clinical trials were randomised control trials, all but one was registered as double blinded (14/21). All but one of the registered studies will be investigating safety and efficacy, where efficacy is measured by the surrogate endpoint of immunogenicity (see Table 1 ). In addition, seven of the studies will investigate clinical efficacy as the incidence of COVID-19 infection after vaccination, two where the COVID-19 infections are self-reported by study participants (data not shown).",

A discrepancy was observed between planned clinical trials in agreed PIPs and registered clinical trials for infants and toddlers, and term newborn. Only one study was registered for term newborn even though thirteen were planned in the agreed PIPs for COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, there was a discrepancy observed between planned clinical trials with immunosuppressed paediatric patients in agreed PIPs and registered paediatric studies in this population.

For innovative therapeutics, the median time between regulatory approval in adults and the approval in the paediatric population is 5.6 years [19] . This could indicate that market forces are driving the COVID-19 vaccine development for adolescent and children, not the agreed PIPs. Four of the six PIP applications initially contained a waiver for conducting studies in subsets of the paediatric population. These were, however, later withdrawn assumingly because of PDCO's evaluation. If this is in fact the case, the agreed PIPs could play a role in stimulating the development of the COVID-19 vaccines for the younger paediatric populations.",

In our study, we observe PIP-agreed studies for adolescents, however this population was in many cases included in the pivotal trials with adults. However, if sponsors do not generate the evidence needed for safe and effective use of their product in all relevant populations, the burden of medical uncertainty is laid upon the groups not represented in the drug development program [22] . The relevance of this with respect to COVID-19 vaccines is clearly exemplified by the recent observation that suggest a disproportionate higher frequency of post-vaccination myocarditis in adolescents and young adults than in the average adult population [23] .",

Since the vaccines are to be used by healthy individuals, safety is of utmost importance, leaving little room for trade-off on the benefit-risk balance. The benefit-risk balance may be even narrower when developing a vaccine for the paediatric population. Discussions about the use of COVID-19 vaccines approved through the CMA pathway are warranted for children (younger than 12 years of age), as is the evidence needed for a standard approval.

The development is moving at unprecedented speed, as is obvious from the recent expansion in the approved indication of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to adolescents 12-15 years of age in May 2021 [18, 37, 38] , as well as Moderna's application to extend the indication of its COVID-19 vaccine for use in adolescents [9] . Also, this overview is limited to information available in the public domain, specifically studies reported in Clinialtrial.gov, the EU clinicaltrialregister.eu and in the publicly available PIPs. The latter only provides a few details on the planned studies agreed as part of a PIP, and a timeline for the completion of the full paediatric development programme. What is more, the division of the paediatric population into developmental subgroups is to some extent arbitrary [15] . The categorical determinant does not take physiological development into considerations but follows chronological age alone. Post-puberty adolescents' immune systems may be fully matured, which appears to have been considered by some vaccine developers, as, e.g. the initial Comirnaty vaccine authorisation included adolescents 16 year of age or older. Finally, many registered clinical trials were started as phase I for which the protocol was amended into phase II and later phase III (quasi-adaptive). Finally, when interpreting the study timelines, it is important to remember that some phase II/III studies start with the adult population and only include the paediatric population at a later stage.",
