However, as far as we know, the current researches on insomnia during the COVID-19 are all aimed at medical staff. Zhang's team found that the insomnia rate of medical staff in Wuhan is as high as 38.4%, far higher than that of the general population, which is consistent with that of Hu's team (34.0%) (8, 9) .
