The results indicate that information seeking is primarily directed by informational subjective norms (ISN) and perceived seeking control (PSC), while the main predictors of information avoidance include ISN and attitude toward seeking. Because ISN are the strongest predictor of both information seeking and avoidance, the way the public copes with COVID-19 information may be strongly affected by individuals' social environment. Furthermore, a significant relationship between risk perception and affective risk response is identified. Our results also indicate that people who perceive greater knowledge of COVID-19 are more likely to report greater knowledge insufficiency, which results in less information avoidance.",

Thus, to a certain extent, whether the pandemic can be controlled in a short time depends on whether people have relevant knowledge (i.e., information) and respond to the measures taken by the government against the pandemic. That is why the WHO has reminded people to pay close attention to the latest news on the COVID-19 outbreak. An increase in risk information and information seeking can lead to positive outcomes by helping the public improve prevention, decrease the risk of infection, reduce the uncertainty, and alleviate the panic (Winkleby et al., 1994; Viswanath and Finnegan, 1996; Yang et al., 2014; Lep et al., 2020) . As an important topic of communication studies, risk information seeking has drawn increased attention from health communication scholars, who have focused on its characteristics, antecedents, and outcomes to fully comprehend individuals' risk information seeking and processing since the mid \u22121990s (Lambert and Loiselle, 2007) .",

The model has been used in the situation of general health risks and some specific diseases such as cancer (Hovick et al., 2014a) , but few studies (only one paper by Hubner and Hovick, 2020 ) have adopted the model regarding an infectious disease during its outbreak period. Because of the new coronavirus being quite different from other infectious diseases such as the Zika virus, and its worldwide and sustained social impact (as the WHO officials asserted on May 13, 2020, that new coronavirus will be present for a long time), we conduct this research on it via the PRISM model, which will undoubtedly enrich and expand PRISMrelated research. In addition to seeking intention, information avoidance, which deserves more attention suggested by Kahlor (2010) , plays an important role in information management in health contexts. Therefore, information avoidance will also be explored according to the PRISM model in the present study to determine its motivators, which has not been explored yet specifically via PRISM, to better understand the public's COVID-19 risk information decision-making behavior.",

PRISM is a comprehensive model of the above models, but outperforms the TPB or the RISP alone in explaining information seeking on health risk, which was confirmed by Kahlor (2010) 's research. This model regards risk information seeking as a planned behavior and holds that the intention to seek risk information is guided by the public's perceived risk, affective risk response, perception of knowledge and knowledge insufficiency, and beliefs toward information seeking (Kahlor, 2010) .",

            "text": "Risk information seeking can be defined as \"more or less effortful attempts to gather information through a variety of mediated and interpersonal channels to achieve personal goals, including those representing various cognitive and affective motivations\" (Griffin et al., 2012a) , in short, the effort paid to find related information regarding one's personal risk of COVID-19 in this study. It includes both routed seeking (\"fairly passive exposure to risk-related information based on media use habits\") and non-routed seeking (\"more active efforts to gather riskrelated information that go beyond habitual sources\") (Griffin et al., 2012b) . Although information or knowledge related to a certain disease is very important and valuable (i.e., contributing to an in-depth understanding of disease symptoms, prevention strategies, or effective cures), people do not always seek it and sometimes spare no effort to avoid it (Turner et al., 2006; Sweeny et al., 2010; Sweeny and Miller, 2012) . That is, risk information avoidance is also a very important (and potentially disruptive) behavior in the middle of a pandemic, which can be conceptualized as any behavior aimed at preventing or delaying the acquisition of available but potentially unwanted information (Sweeny et al., 2010) . It can be active (e.g., by asking someone not to reveal information, physically leaving a situation to escape from learning information, turning off radios or televisions to avoid hearing about risk-related topics) or passive (e.g., by failing to ask someone a question that would reveal the information) (Sweeny et al., 2010; Barbour et al., 2012) . In fact, people frequently avoid risk information seeking when the topic is disturbing (Brashers et al., 2000; Case et al., 2005) or contrary to their belief system (Zillman and Bryant, 1985; Babrow, 2001) . In addition, research suggests that people may choose to avoid information because the information might: (a) compel them to give up or change cherished belief, (b) force them to take an action or adopt a behavior that they would rather not undertake, and (c) cause unpleasant emotions or reduce pleasant emotions (Sweeny et al., 2010) .",

And research on this topic by PRISM has not been found, although a few researchers have examined information avoidance using the RIS-P model, when people choose to maintain a degree of information insufficiency because their uncertainty assessment shows that they do not want to obtain more information about the risk (Yang et al., 2011; Yang and Kahlor, 2013) . Such studies propose that if an individual feels that he/she has enough information to deal with the risk, it may lead to avoidance (accuracy motivation) or be base-d on two of the other motivations (defensive and impression motivations) from the Heuristic Systematic Model, the latter two motivations not having been tested yet in the RISP (Griffin et al., 2012a) . A multi-application analysis of RISP, as applied to health and environmental risks (Dunwoody and Griffin, 2015 , table on p.109), found that individuals are more likely to avoid risk information when they realized they already had adequate information about the risk (less insufficiency meant more avoidance-but the opposite regarding seeking), and when they believed that the channels of risk information were biased; avoidance was less likely when people felt social pressures to understand the information (informational subjective norms) and when they were capable of critically seeking and evaluating the information, based on the revised capacity measures used in the latter two studies reported.",

This model comprises two of TPB concepts-subjective norms and perceived control (information gathering capacity), while not containing two other TPB variables-attitude toward behavior and behavioral intention, which has been included in PRISM. In addition, PRISM focuses on information seeking rather than processing, which is also very essential for the RISP. These are the main differences between the RISP and PRISM. Compared to the RISP, the PRISM model has been validated by previous researchers and is a useful theoretical framework for predicting the intention to seek information in the situation of general health risks (Kahlor, 2010; Willoughby and Myrick, 2016) , natural and environmental risks (Kahlor, 2007; Ho et al., 2014; Eastin et al., 2015; Kahlor et al., 2019) and specific diseases such as cancer (Hovick et al., 2014a) , and the Zika virus (Hubner and Hovick, 2020) . Therefore, this study is based on PRISM, which is viewed as more effective and appropriate in exploring our topic-information seeking and avoidance, rather than the former and aims to examine Chinese adults' COVID-19 risk information seeking and avoidance intentions during early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

When people are confronted with a particular risk, they evaluate their risk level and then determine whether they need more information on the topic. Specifically, when people sense a greater risk from a particular hazard, they will also have a greater emotional response to the issue (Loewenstein et al., 2001) . As affective risk response related to these perceptions may be negative in nature due to the negative valence of risk perception (Griffin et al., 2004) , increased risk perception could result in negative emotional response such as fear and anxiety (Witte, 1992; Turner et al., 2006) , which would promote them to assess their existing information level and then decide whether they need to obtain additional information or process existing information more carefully (Yang, 2019) . As COVID-19 has great disaster potential and fatal results, people will have high risk perception and strong emotional reactions, such as fear, anger, and anxiety.",

Moreover, the more scared (angry, or worried) they feel, less knowledgeable about their risk, the more actively seeking information, and the less avoidance. That is, affective risk response drives knowledge insufficiency. It, independent of a sense of information insufficiency, also motivates information seeking intention as emotions (including negative and positive emotions) stimulate the tendency to act and prepare for action (Frijda, 2004; Griffin et al., 2008; Kahlor, 2010) . In addition, when people feel threatened or dangerous and feel powerless (low efficacy), they may turn to fear control and avoid further information to reduce their negative emotions (Witte, 1994) . Thus, we predict that risk perception will be positively related to affective risk response (H1). We also propose that affective risk response will be positively related to knowledge insufficiency (H2) and COVID-19 information seeking intention (H3), while it will be negatively associated with information avoidance (H15).",

Within PRISM, this is also true (Kahlor, 2010; Hovick et al., 2014a,b) . ISN indicate an individual's tendency to respond to social expectations that they should obtain adequate information to cope with a risky condition (Yang et al., 2014) . That is, when individuals believe that people who are important to them want them to possess some knowledge regarding a risk issue, they are likely to more actively search for information (Yang and Kahlor, 2013) . In the case of COVID-19, people who believe that information seeking is a normative behavior, will want more information than they currently have (Kahlor, 2010) . Therefore, we expect that ISN will be positively related to information seeking intention (H4), but negatively related to information avoidance (H16). In addition, it is expected that ISN will be positively related to perceived knowledge (H5) and perceived knowledge insufficiency (H6).",

If an individual perceives that performing the behavior (information seeking) would be in his or her favor, the individual will be more likely to perform the behavior, while less likely to avoid it, just for this reason that attitude toward information seeking is negatively related to information avoidance (Yang and Kahlor, 2013; Howell et al., 2016) . That is, when individuals have more positive attitudes toward seeking risk information, they are less likely to avoid it. Other research has shown that implicit attitudes about learning health information predicted risk information avoidance (Howell et al., 2016) . Thus, we put forward the following hypotheses, which are supported by previous studies (Kahlor, 2010; Eastin et al., 2015; Kahlor et al., 2019; Hubner and Hovick, 2020) : attitude toward seeking information will be positively related to seeking intention (H7), but negatively related to information avoidance (H17).

Past studies have shown mixed results (Kahlor, 2007; Yang, 2012) . Currently, people have easier access to risk-related information involving the ways the novel coronavirus is transmitted and ways to protect themselves due to the popularity of the Internet and the government's vigorous publicity. This appears to make individuals sense that their ability to search for information has increased and they have a high level of knowledge about COVID-19. Thus, according to PRISM, we expect that PSC will be positively related to information seeking intention (H10), perceived knowledge (H11) and perceived knowledge insufficiency (H12), but negatively related to information avoidance (H18) proposed by Yang and Kahlor (2013) .",

In the RISP, knowledge insufficiency concept is based on Eagly and Chaiken's Heuristic Systematic Model, especially the \"accuracy\" motivation which is part of the drive for sufficiency in judgmental confidence in HSM. There is a gap between an individual's current level of understanding and the desired level of understanding, which should be related to seeking more information hardly to achieve processing goals (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993) . The concept of knowledge insufficiency in the RISP is based on the above assumption and shows that information seeking is driven by the gap between what one currently knows and the knowledge needed to fully understand a given topic (Griffin et al., 2004 (Griffin et al., , 2012b Kahlor, 2010) . A person will continue to actively process related information until they have achieved the depth or breadth of understanding that they conceive to be sufficient (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993) . W-hen applied in the RISP, respondents are essentially asked how much more Knowledge they need in order to deal adequately with the risk in their own lives, that is, ho-w much would be sufficient, which is used for reference in PRISM. Moreover, in the latter model, perceived knowledge insufficiency is driven by perceived knowledge, affective risk response, subjective norms, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control.",

However, affective risk response is not proven to be a powerful driver of information seeking. Compared with ISN and PSC, affective risk response plays a more marginal role in determining seeking information. This issue may be related to our survey time. At the beginning of March, the pandemic situation in China, especially in Wuhan City, was undergoing positive changes after the Chinese government adopted timely and effective prevention and control measures. Thus, people's negative response to COVID-19 risk, such as anxiety and panic, was relieved to some extent, and its impact on their information decision-making behavior was reduced. These are our speculations. Future research should explore the relationship between positive and negative affective response and information seeking as well as the relationship between various affective response and information avoidance. Furthermore, attitude toward information seeking was positively related to both knowledge and knowledge insufficiency but negatively related to information avoidance. People who hold a favorable attitude toward COVID-19 information seeking are more likely to perceive that they have a greater knowledge base about this topic, perceive the need for more knowledge and are less likely to avoid new information. A relationship was not found between attitude toward seeking and information seeking, which needs further exploration.",

Future studies can conduct several investigations at different times of the pandemic, such as the early stage, peak stage, and aggravation stage, to make such a comparison. Then, the other limitation is that the perceived source or channel characteristics are not considered within PRISM, while other models such as the RISP treat it as an important predictor to the intention to search for risk information (Johnson and Meischke, 1993; Griffin et al., 1999a; Afifi and Weiner, 2004) .

Our results provide theoretical and empirical insights into those predictors and offer empirical support for the assertion of Kahlor (2010)-PRISM performed better than the TPB and RISP models in demonstrating people's information seeking and avoidance intentions. Information seeking is mainly directed by ISN and PSC, with affective risk response playing only a marginal role. We also explored the predictors of information avoidance, which included ISN, attitude toward seeking, knowledge insufficiency and PSC. Among them, the first two played a greater role in driving information avoidance. Particularly, ISN were the strongest predictor of both information seeking and avoidance. Therefore, ISN should be the focus when designing risk information communication strategies. People may be driven by information that emphasizes perceived pressure from the others to become more active information searchers (Hovick et al., 2014a) . Future research should further explore what factors may influence informational subjective norms and how to highlight their role in designing risk communication strategies and carrying out communication practices.",

In addition, the information of greatest concern to the public should be updated and released in a timely manner. Such information includes the latest progress of the pandemic, knowledge of pandemic prevention and control, and relevant government policies, which should be clear, accurate, and useful. Especially, we should pay special attention to the release of the opinions of some leaders (e.g., Academician Nanshan Zhong and Lanjuan Li, who are highly respected and trusted by the public in China), which is very helpful to relieve people's panic, especially during the severe period of the pandemic. Through the above measures, the supply of knowledge can be increased to meet people's urgent information needs so that they can strengthen their self-protection and relieve their anxiety and panic to actively cooperate with government initiatives.",
