            "text": "It is challenging to elucidate the effects of changes in external influences (such as economic or policy) on the rate of US drug approvals. Here, a novel approach-termed the Chronological Hurst Exponent (CHE)-is proposed, which hypothesizes that changes in the long-range memory latent within the dynamics of time series data may be temporally associated with changes in such influences. Using the monthly number FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approvals from 1939 to 2019 as the data source, it is demonstrated that the CHE has a distinct S-shaped structure demarcated by an 8-year (1939-1947) Stagnation Period, a 27-year (1947-1974 Emergent Period, and a 45-year (1974-2019) Saturation Period. Further, dominant periodicities (resolved via wavelet analyses) are identified during the most recent 45-year CHE Saturation Period at 17, 8 and 4 years; thus, US drug approvals have been following a Juglar/Kuznet mid-term cycle with Kitchin-like bursts. As discussed, this work suggests that (1) changes in extrinsic factors (e.g., of economic and/or policy origin) during the Emergent Period may have led to persistent growth in US drug approvals enjoyed since 1974, (2) the CHE may be a valued method to explore influences on time series data, and (3) innovation-related economic cycles exist (as viewed via the proxy metric of US drug approvals).",

The investments cover the costs associated with acquiring both the hardware (e.g., laboratory materials and space) and software [explicit (e.g., patents) and tacit (e.g., know-how) knowledge] as well as executing the various DDD activities [1] . Ultimately, should an investigational candidate survive the attrition process and obtain marketing authorization (also known as marketing approval) by a health authority, a sponsor then enjoys economic rents secured from supplying the approval medicine. On the demand side, the patient receives a trusted medicine associated with a market innovation based on a new chemical and biologic entity, a cost advantage (generic), or a more efficient delivery of drug product [2] .",

            "text": "Importantly, the twentieth century also gave rise to the modern regulated DDD industry including the invention of an objective, independent, and external agency [collectively termed the health authority (HA)]. The HA performs a vital function by attesting to a medicine's quality, safety, and efficacy profile and to formally authorize a drug for marketing purposes in a given jurisdiction. Since its original conception, there have been increasing refinement in its scope proportional to changes in the social environment Table 1 Brief Milestones in FDA Drug Regulation [10, 37] https:// www. fda. gov/ about-fda/ virtu al-exhib its-fda-histo ry/ brief-histo ry-center-drug-evalu ation-and-resea rch through amendments in policy. For example, focusing on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there has been an evolution in the number and variety of policy initiatives focused on providing oversight to the DDD process due exclusively to important social concerns regarding safety and efficacy of certain drugs circulating in inter-jurisdictional commerce [10] . The FDA policy environment has evolved considerably from placing under regulation on specific drugs (e.g., insulin and penicillin) and describing the basic tenets of the safety sciences in its infancy to building a robust infrastructure commencing in the 1960s with the Kefauver-Harris amendments to regular updates in the policy landscape starting in 1977, with the introduction of the Bioresearch Monitoring Program, pushing the frontiers of regulatory science into the twenty-first century (see Table 1 ). Concomitantly, economic factors have also greatly influenced the landscape of DDD. Unlike the US (21 CFR 310 et seq.; 21 CFR 601 et seq.), in many jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union), HAs consider cost and/or reimbursement when assessing the merits of granting a marketing application. The ability of sponsors to obtain the economic rents from supplying quality, safe and efficacious HA-authorized drugs is a key driver that has sustained the DDD process. Among other factors, expected revenues from marketing an innovative HA-approved drug product would be proportional to monopolizing power of the intellectual property [1] as well as the amount of labor required to move the drug from concept to delivery, thereby requiring a broad assortment of various investments in terms of tangible and intangible assets. While beyond the scope of this work, cost estimates to secure marketing authorization vary based on the types of challenges experienced in various phases (e.g. target/modality in discovery; the number, length and type of clinical trials in development) [11] , with significant savings expected with expediting development [12] . Thus, drug approvals may be thought of an economic outcome within a given jurisdiction, and should behave as such. One such test would be to investigate the presence of cycles in the number of approvals similar to that found in other forms of economic output.",

This work is exploratory and empirical in nature. As presented in the Materials and Methods section below, the data source is a time series of monthly values of US drug Approvals from Jan. 1939 through Dec. 2019 from the Centers of Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) branch of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which \"regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including biological therapeutics and generic drugs. 1 \" While this is not the only institution that regulates the DDD process within the FDA, it is one that provides a publicly, reliable and valuable source of longitudinal metrics regarding the DDD process from the dawn of the review process (1939) to the present time. The methods are standard with the exception of the Chronological Hurst Exponent to explore the persistency latent in the time series. All datasets and R Project code are provided in the Electronic Supplementary Materials section for the sake of transparency and replicability as well as to encourage future researchers in investigate a potentially very interesting and informative aspect of drug development.

The Chronological Hurst Exponent proposed herein is a simple algorithm that reiteratively calculates the Hurst exponent (a measure of persistency) over an incrementally increased time period. With each iteration, an additional data point (here the next monthly observation of US approvals) is taken into account until the exponent of the which the Hurst exponent remained at or around 1. A saturated Hurst exponent implies that the time series has become (for lack of a better term) inelastic; that is, any further changes in the degree and/or number of exogenous variables do not affect the persistency course of the time series (as it is already maximized).",

Several tiered periodicities (17 years, 4-8 years, and intermittent monthly/yearly) were identified within Periods 2 and 3 of the CHE.

After 1947, a general rise in the number of approvals per month and per annum is observed. It is also a period of commensurate changes to the policy and social landscape pertaining to DDD, as well as continued investment into R&D. These changes were seemingly due to end of World War II (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) (1944) (1945) , the beginning of the so-called 'Golden Age of Capitalism,' and the associated economic progress [39] with a relatively small number of economic disasters (see Fig. 3 in [40] ). Since the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic act, no significant advances in policy occurred until the 1962 Drug Amendments (see Table 1 ), while there were significant milestone activities in terms of congressional review (the Kefauver Hearings dealt with pricing and market control [41] . One could therefore speculate that it an overall increased economic activity (and not specific FDA policy changes, per se) that may have driven the changes in the persistency measurement. The appearance of Period 3 [45-years (1974-2019)] suggests a uniform pressure onto the time series. Two general reasons present themselves to foment such a sustained persistent alteration in the fabric of US drug approvals: some sort of substantive and everlasting change (1) to accounting practices regarding US drug approvals (that is, how the source data were initially contrived and/or collected); or (2) in the scientific, social, economic, and/or legislative landscape. The former is unlikely to cause a persistent shift. To illustrate, FDA data sources state a change in department ownership in and around that time, as well as issues regarding changes from fiscal to calendar year practices. 3 It is unlikely that either of these reasons would have changed the time series in such a permanent manner. The latter reason, while likely, however, is ill-defined, but does allow for hypothesis generation.",

In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris (KH) amendments to the original Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FD&C) of 1938 introduced (inter alia) broad requirements on drug efficacy (including key concepts of 'substantial evidence' and 'adequate and well-controlled studies'), drug quality (via good manufacturing practices), ethical guidelines (patient informed consent), and physician-researcher supervision of the clinical trials. Subsequently, a review of prior-to-1962 approved drugs were retrospectively investigated based on the evidentiary standard of the KH amendments, which led to revocation of \"over 1000 ineffective drugs and drug combinations from the marketplace (page 13 of ibid.).\" The concepts such as those introduced in the KH amendments (partly listed above) have been refined and reinforced through ongoing congressional action, directly contributing to the identified persistency affect and cyclicity. Ongoing policy actions, such as Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and its subsequent 5-year amendments commencing in 1992, or the introduction of new technologies may have directly contributed to innovation-based periodicities, leading to significant increases in the promulgation of guidelines that may have furthered drug approvals [37, 42] .",

The periodicities began at different times with different durations (Fig. 4) . The dominant periodicity of 17, 8 and 4 years has reoccurred during the longest (45 years), medium (20 years), and short-term (intermittent) durations, respectively (Fig. 5) . Thus, it seems that US drug approvals follow a Juglar/ Kuznets mid-term cycle with Kitchin bursts. Only time will tell if a longer-term cycle (Kondratieff) emerges, irrespective of any downside pressures (such as multi-decade bear cycles). A key difference between the identified approval cycles as compared with economic cycles may be the degree of importance of the regulatory context. While a potentially coarse interpretation, without the legal requirement for market approval there would not have been a US drug approvals time series, whereas for variables such as gross domestic product typically used to consider economic cycles this is not the case (as the legal regimes do not define (as much as support) the existence of these more traditional economic variables).",

Using this algorithm, US drug approvals are examined. The CHE of US drug approvals is found to follow a distinctive S-shaped (trichotomized) curve, with three periodicities that seem to be correlative with the evolving US drug development policy landscape, as well as macro-variable changes that may be relevant to drug development. Further, using wavelet analysis, cyclicity in the frequency of US drug approvals was observed in the most recent period identified in the CHE analysis. These periodicities adds evidence to the concept of mid-term economic cycles, assuming US drug approvals data are viewed a proxy metric of innovative capacity. The empirical findings and statistical approaches outlined in this report promise an exciting new frontier of further research into the various forces driving drug development.",

In this calculation, the time-varying nature of the H constant was investigated using time windows from the first datapoint (Jan. 1939) to the end of the window length, with 1-month increments. The algorithm to calculate the Chronological Hurst Exponent is as follows:IV. Determine the periodicities within the time series. Wavelet analyses used to investigate the structure of the periodicities within the time series given its dynamics (particularly its non-stationarity; see step II). Two wavelet methods were utilized: one with a smoothing (Loess) approach [31; R package: 'Wave-letComp'] and one[32-34;  R Package: 'dplR'] without. The average period versus the average power for each method was then calculated to elucidate the main periodicities. The dominant frequency was then re-checked with spectral analysis[35, 36;  R Package: 'forecast'].",
