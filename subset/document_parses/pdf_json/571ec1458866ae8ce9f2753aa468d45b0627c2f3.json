            "text": "This chapter presents a new model of thinking for evaluating social development work. The social assessment framework put forward is based on TNS stakeholder management model, TRI*M, and focuses on the critical area of how aid and donor organizations can assess the effectiveness of social development programs. The Millennium Development Goals have opened up a two way street between donors and beneficiaries and has provided for a need to look at social development assessment from a new perspective. The reader is taken through a journey of how the model came about, challenges faced during the process, and a vision for how the model will be used in the future. The two basic components of the model, the Program Effectiveness Index and the TRI*M Grid for understanding program drivers, are explained. A case study covering the Tsunami relief effort in Aceh, where the model was used for the first time, is included as an example of how TNS was able to deliver insight and clear direction in an otherwise complex environment. A client perspective is also provided both in terms of needs assessment and actions taken by UNICEF as a result. The chapter concludes with a reflection of what the future holds and the opportunity to apply the framework in other countries as well as for different situations.",

Consumer research is called KAP surveys -knowledge, attitude and practice. But such research is often narrowly focused and too often a one-way street. Impact studies are conducted but mainly to inform communicators about the effectiveness of their specific campaigns and messages. How beneficiaries regard the campaign and the issue as a whole and what they think is beneficial or even needed in the broader context of the services provided is often overlooked. So the question is, how can we use the beneficiary's perceptions of the effectiveness of a campaign in order for it to be more effective? In other words start a dialogue -make the beneficiary an active participant in the process.",

            "text": "Working closely with several of the world's most prominent aid and donor agencies, one of the main challenges that is evident is the need for good program evaluations. Aid organizations in particular, large and small, receive a large proportion of their funding for specific projects. As with any commercial operator aid organizations often have to compete for this, often limited, pool of funds. There is a tender process and the aid organization has to present a strong case for their project in terms of how it will contribute to the betterment for beneficiaries as well as how results will be evaluated. Donors, like investors, would reasonable like to know that the money was well spent. Hence, some, but far from all, social development projects have a research component for evaluation. Ideally there should be a baseline measure followed by an impact measure. But more often than expected perhaps, the evaluation is conducted internally in sometimes very ambiguous and arbitrary circumstances. Audits are part of daily life in commercial operations (Scharioth, Huber 2003) . But anyone dealing with large aid organizations will be aware of the frantic atmosphere in the client's office at the end of a large project. Yes, the auditors are coming and everyone is scrambling to come up with a good story to show that their contribution was indeed worth while. Having met with many program staff across an array of different organizations it is amazing to see their commitment to their work. Not to mention the field operators, who are often tucked away in the bush somewhere without access to modest, or even basic, conveniences. Their inspiration stems from caring about people in need and because they themselves believe a difference can be made. At the end of the day it would often be unfair to question their commitment to the cause, but donors want proof of their work in terms of measurable outcomes. Key Performance Indicators or KPIs is a term with which aid organizations are quickly becoming more familiar. Aid organizations are slowly beginning to realize that even the warm and fuzzy world of social development is becoming subject to accountability. No doubt many resist this but there seems to be no escape.",

As has been pointed out, the truth is that many aid and donor organizations are not able to effectively measure the performance of social development programs. Within the area of corporate reputation, effective tools have been developed over the years to allow organizations to becoming more knowledgeable about their own industry (O'Gorman, Pirner, 2006) . Understanding ones corporate reputation provides for a holistic picture of how different stakeholder groups view an organization as well as how the company should align its resources to communicate more effectively (Hermann 2007) . It is all about building awareness, changing attitudes, and ultimately have people behave is such a way that it benefits the company.

And just as corporate reputation is dependent on several stakeholder groups, social development programs rely on support from multiple parties often including various government departments. Communication is not about selling a product or service but rather to inform and educate as an end goal (selling ideas). Whether in a commercial or social context, media spending can be substantial and media channels employed can be similar. It is sometimes necessary to develop peoples' mind-sets by changing their attitudes. Just a like a mining company wants people to be forgiving towards its impact on the environment, a social development program on AIDS wants people to acknowledge there are people who live with this decease and they should not be ignored. Ultimately and ideally, social change is about engagement through participation rather than persuasion. But the ultimate goal of a social development program is not to build a reputation for the organization behind the program but rather for the program itself.",

First of all, are Having a standardised, independently measured PEI has an important advantage in that it can be used across countries and programs. This allows for effective benchmarking, a tool which is becoming more and more essential for global companies including aid and donor organisations. Further, the PEI allows for flexibility in terms of diagnosing the level of performance across time, geographical areas, stakeholder groups, and time. So it is a very effective monitoring tool and provides for a quick overview of where a particular program is working and where it is having less impact.",

Indonesia had the biggest death toll with some quarter of a million people confirmed dead or missing. No less than 385,256 people were displaced, loosing their home, family members or both (UN Information Management Service 2005). The table below shows some of the worse hit regions. The 8.6 magnitude earthquake on the island of Nias, that struck shortly after the Tsunami made matters worse. The disaster was met by unprecedented support from the international community and it has been estimated that some 200 organizations set up base in Aceh alone to assist in the relief effort. The amount of donations contributed from the international community was so significant that it far exceeded what is needed for the reconstruction effort. Yet, the traumatized region is still struggling to get back on its feet. This may seem odd but the fact is, having excess funds only adds to the problem, especially in Indonesia, one of the world's most notorious nations for corruption. Too much money brings out the worst in people and means the relief effort has in many parts been brought down on its knees with very little progress, especially in the first 12 months (TNS Indonesia 2006). Having so many organizations operating simultaneously adds to the complexity and coordination alone has become a gigantic task.",

Focusing on the areas of health, education, water & sanitation and child protection, UNICEF has a fair challenge in coordinating its own activities. Research carried out by TNS in 2005 confirmed the notion that the relief effort, whilst moving in the right direction, was not moving ahead quickly enough. Feedback from beneficiaries was therefore needed to understand their perceptions as to how effective the relief effort has been. The brief from UNICEF was simple, what are the red button issues that IDPs want to see improved immediately? With this brief, the first opportunity to test the new social assessment framework had materialized. The performance effectiveness index was able to show that performance varied across regions. The index showed that the more easily reached regions, Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar, had the worst performance ratings whereas Aceh Barat and Aceh Jaya, some of the most badly hit remote regions, had significantly better performance ratings. However, when sharing the results with UNICEF staff in the respective regions said they were not surprised. Banda Aceh as the capital of the province has served as a hub for much of the relief effort. IDPs in this area have had relatively easy access to assistance without having to rely on their own efforts. Whilst the devastation was large, many parts of Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar were unaffected and meant IDPs were not totally stranded. This led to IDPs becoming somewhat complacent. In contrast, more remote regions have had relatively limited resources to begin with and meant that IDPs and their local communities had to put in significant effort to rebuild their lives, to survive. This logic became evident when looking at the extent to which IDPs have developed a mind-set that was coherent with the program objectives outlined by UNICEF. In short, an examination was done in relation to IDPs knowledge, attitude and behaviour to see how developed their mind-set was in order to cope and improve their livelihood. Figure 1 clearly shows that IDPs in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar had a much less developed mind-set compared to Aceh Barat and Aceh Jaya. In other words, there was a very strong association between program performance and the actual ability of IDPs to cope and improve their livelihood.",

Looking at the 6 core program components it can be seen that UNICEF is perceived to perform well in the areas of Education and Health & Nutrition. The PEI for these activities is higher than the overall PEI of 49. The remaining program areas have a PEI lower than the average. It is interesting to note that child protection is generally not seen to be important by IDPs. Nor does it have any significant impact on program effectiveness. It is likely that more education is needed in this area and improved access to information is needed to achieve this effectively. For each program component a leverage score has been calculated which can range from 0-10. Leverage scores help to identify which program activities have the highest impact on program effectiveness, and therefore indicate the relevance for taking action. The leverage metric is intended to provide decisional support regarding resource allocation to different programs. Both Education and Health & Nutrition generate high leverage for UNICEF probably because these activities are the most visible for IDPs. On the other hand, Water & Sanitation represents a fundamental, basic need not currently met. This area became the single most important opportunity for improvement. It is also clear that the local Government in Aceh, the most important collaboration partner for UNICEF, may not be pulling their fair share of the work. ",

They did grasp the survey's importance and at this point are still digesting the points made. It is a work in progress. It is globalization by the most unwelcome of definitions. It links the donor to the beneficiary in a challenge which will leave neither untouched. If the Governments and agencies involved in combating AI in Indonesia, or Thailand, Vietnam or China succeed it will save lives everywhere. This thought motivated the Japanese Government to provide a staggering USD 40 million grant to UNICEF to conduct a global public awareness campaign to prevent a pandemic in 2006.
