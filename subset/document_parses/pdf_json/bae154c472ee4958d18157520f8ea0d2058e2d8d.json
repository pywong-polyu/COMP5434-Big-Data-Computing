An effective intervention using these approaches to improve the well-being of lonely older people is the \"Circle of Friends\" (7, 19) developed and run by The Finnish Association for the Welfare of Older People. According to Hawkley & Cacioppo [6] , it may be the only form of intervention that is also effective for preventing adverse health effects of loneliness. Savikko et al. (20) presented the essential elements required of the participants and facilitators, favourable processes among and within the group, and the mediating factors that occurred during the group process and promoted the alleviation of loneliness. In the randomized controlled trial, the Circle of Friends improved lonely older people's health, cognition and wellbeing, reduced the use of health care services and mortality among the participants (7, 19, 21) .",

The main idea of the group is to value older people's active agency, empower them to take mastery over their own lives, and to allow them to gradually take over the responsibility of interaction in the group. A properly facilitated group process and group dynamics are used as means to empower participants to confront their loneliness, to support their peers in the group and to start keeping in touch with each other on their own without the facilitators (23) . Each group always has two facilitators. Their competence in favourable group processes and group dynamics is important, and skills in empowering and supporting interaction among the participants is essential.

            "text": "Over the last two decades, the Circle of Friends has been widely disseminated in Finland (22) . More than 10 000 lonely older people have participated in these groups. The Circle of Friends is feasible in long-term care facilities and among people with cognitive decline (24) . The model has also been modified and exported to some other countries (25) . At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Finnish Association for the Welfare of Older People started to modify the original Circle of Friends model into online group sessions. These online groups are on an electronic platform which is easy and safe to use, and its virtual meeting room is free of charge for the participants. The online version of the Circle of Friends has the elements of the original group model. Of the first online groups, all the participants have kept in touch with each other independently.",
