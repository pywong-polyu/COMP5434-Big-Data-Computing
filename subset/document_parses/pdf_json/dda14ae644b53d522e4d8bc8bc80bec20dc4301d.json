Thus, we propose strategies for the inclusion and training of medical students in telemedicine and address challenges in this transition.",

The suspension of clinical placements has hindered undergraduate clinical teaching, raising concerns about the unknown consequences on future doctors' competence. In urology, as in other surgical specialties, elective procedures have been cancelled because of COVID-19 and students are losing valuable clinical experiences, potentially affecting training. Moreover, the opportunity to take part in the management pathway for seriously ill patients is limited given their susceptibility to COVID-19 [2] . Losses in experiential learning may reduce specialty interest and career selection, which correlate with early specialty exposure, leading to adverse long-term ramifications for urology as a specialty [3] .",

Medical students should receive technical telemedicine training, with emphasis on providing bespoke care adapted to individual patient needs [1] . In urology, the vast majority of patients are older adults, often with comorbidities. While these patients will benefit from a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 [5] , they are also likely to face technical challenges in using telehealth tools. Along with urology specialists, students should learn to triage patients suitable for telemedicine by considering patients' capabilities and preferences [1] . Moreover, telemedicine brings new risks to data privacy and students should be trained in privacy and data protection regulations [5] . Finally, urology often involves intimate health issues, so establishing adequate doctor-patient rapport is vital. Medical education should focus on training students to provide comfort and reassurance to patients who are reluctant to use telehealth tools. Mastering telecommunication and online delivery of clinical skills is crucial for future doctors [2] .",
