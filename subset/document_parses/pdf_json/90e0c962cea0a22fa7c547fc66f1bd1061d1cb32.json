            "text": "In the ageing European countries, prolonging working lives has become an important goal [1] . Unemployment and work-related disability, which may be manifested in sickness absence (short-term disability) or disability retirement (long-term or permanent disability), are the two main reasons that shorten working careers. Unemployment and disability risks are also interrelated. Several studies have shown that unemployment is positively associated with an individual's risks of later sickness absence and disability retirement [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The literature has attributed this positive association to causation and selection that are at work simultaneously: unemployment may have adverse effects on health (=causation), but on the other hand, health problems and weak work ability also increase the risk of unemployment (=selection) [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, a high area-level unemployment rate has also been shown to increase an individual's sickness absence and disability pensioning risks [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Accordingly, studies using aggregate level data have shown positive area level cross-sectional correlations: higher area-level unemployment rates are associated with higher area-level disability rates [16] [17] [18] .",

In fixed-effects models, only within-municipality variation is utilized; thus, the results reveal how changes in the independent variables between successive years are associated with changes in the dependent variables when following the same municipalities over time.",

The correlation coefficients mostly show positive and statistically significant-albeit rather low-cross-sectional correlations, meaning that a higher unemployment rate of the municipality has generally been associated with both a higher sickness absence rate and a higher disability retirement rate. Figure A2 (Appendix A) visualises these cross-sectional associations with scatter plots for year 2017. Before year 2007, the correlations between unemployment and sickness absence rates were low and not statistically significant. A one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the sickness absence rate (\u22122.2%, p < 0.001) in the unadjusted model (Table 3 , Model 1). Adjustments for simultaneous changes in population, demographic structure, socio-economic structure and morbidity (Model 2) resulted in some attenuation of the estimate (\u22121.7%). Some further attenuation of the estimate (\u22121.3%) was observed when variables on the economic situation of the municipalities were entered (Model 3). Both Model 4, with Model 3 variables for years 2007-2017, and Model 5, with added variables of industry structure, did not alter the result concerning unemployment. The estimate for unemployment was statistically highly significant in all models. In addition, changes in many of the covariates showed statistically significant associations with changes in the sickness absence rate in Models 4 and 5. In particular, changes in variables depicting population size, population density, educational level, tax revenue and proportion of employees working in manufacturing showed highly significant associations (p < 0.001) with changes in the sickness absence rate.",

However, the longitudinal analyses revealed a pro-cyclical pattern between unemployment and sickness absence and disability retirement rates. During the period 2003-2017, adjusted for simultaneous changes in a set of municipality-level covariates, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with a 1.3% decrease in the municipality-level sickness absence rate, i.e., in the proportion of working-age population on long-term sickness absence during the year. Likewise, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with a 2.1% decrease in the disability retirement rate, i.e., in the proportion of working-age population entering disability retirement during the year.

The association of unemployment rate with sickness absence and disability retirement rates was only partly attenuated after inclusion of the covariates in the models. Some interesting associations were found also concerning the covariates that were adjusted for, with the aim of tackling confounding associations. For example, an increase in the municipalities' tax revenue per capita was associated with a decrease in the sickness absence rate but an increase in the disability retirement rate, net of changes in unemployment and other covariates. On the other hand, an increase in the educational level, in terms of the proportion of persons with a tertiary education, was associated with a decrease in both the sickness absence and the disability retirement rates.

However, our results concerning the pro-cyclical nature of also disability retirement are in contrast to those obtained previously at the macro level from Iceland [29] . While the Icelandic study showed that increasing unemployment resulted in increasing disability retirement rolls, our study showed a negative association between the two measures. The diverging results may partly be explained by different settings, time frames, research designs and data sets used. The authors of the Icelandic study state that the level of the disability pension benefit is higher than the level of the universal unemployment benefit in Iceland. Thus, there has been a clear financial incentive for those becoming unemployed in Iceland to seek a disability pension even though remaining on unemployment benefits would be the more relevant option [29] . Those who become unemployed and suffer from work ability problems may therefore often transfer to disability retirement in Iceland, while in other countries, such as in Finland, they often continue to draw unemployment benefits.",

An explanation for this stronger association with the disability retirement rate is that also at the individual level, unemployment seems to be more strongly linked to later disability retirement than to sickness absence [4] . Further, statistics show that among those who enter disability retirement, there is a larger share of persons with an unemployment background than among those having sickness absence spells [36, 37] . Future studies, utilizing more varied data sets and preferably linking individual-level data to area-level data, need to find further explanations for this observation.",

            "text": "The benefit schemes for unemployment and disability are designed to tackle two intrinsically different types of risks in an individual's life. However, it can be argued that unemployment and disability benefit systems are deeply intertwined and may in practice partly work as substitutes for each other. In some cases, they may be alternative benefit options for persons with a precarious labour market situation, often characterized by past periods of unemployment and by weaker than average health [18, 38, 39] . During economic downturns, those in most precarious situations and having poorest health are the first ones at risk of unemployment. This may then decrease the observed sickness absence rate and flow into disability retirement in the work force. Thus, when unemployment is higher, there is less pressure on the disability benefit systems since more persons with health problems are covered by the unemployment scheme and do not necessarily seek disability benefits as their subsistence is already settled for the time being. On the other hand, when the economy recovers again towards a better employment situation, unemployed persons with work ability problems may also move from unemployment to employment-but since their health is likely to be more fragile, they may often end up on sickness absence and thus increase the average sickness absence rate during economic booms. In addition, when employment prospects are higher during low levels of unemployment, their weak work ability may become visible to the point that they are admitted a disability pension. Beatty et al. [18, 39] call this intertwining of unemployment and sickness/disability as \"hidden unemployment\" and \"hidden sickness\", depending on which benefit seems to prevail in the ongoing economic cycle and benefit system. Furthermore, the result of the positive area-level cross-sectional association despite the negative longitudinal association is understandable in light of the fact that there are areas that suffer simultaneously from both unemployment and disability problems. This may happen if there are few employment opportunities and a large share of individuals suffering from health-related or skills-related employability problems. Often these are remote areas characterized by economic decline and rather scarce employment possibilities, especially for those with weakened work ability [16, 18, 39] . In this respect, British studies have highlighted areas that have most suffered from a decline in industrial employment that has concerned especially low-skilled, older workers previously employed in traditional industries. In Finland, areas with both high unemployment and high disability benefit rates are often situated in the rather remote, sparsely populated regions in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country, which have also suffered from job loss, decreasing opportunities and population decline and where morbidity and disability is higher than in the Southern and Western part of the country [40, 41] .",

For example, we were not able to use operable variables on the service structure-either depicting the availability and quality of overall health care and social services, or more specifically variables on work ability services for the unemployed.

Due to differences in benefit systems, the results of this study may be generalized only with caution to other countries. However, as our results were largely in accordance with previous macro-level studies, the area-level temporal associations are likely to hold in many other contexts. Future research should study the associations and interplay between unemployment and sickness absence and disability retirement benefits in different social security systems with different types of benefits that tackle risks in life, thus taking into account different contexts, economic cycles and different conditions for receiving benefits. Further, the current unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has rapidly increased both unemployment and morbidity and most likely has long-term consequences also on work ability, warrants future research on the associations between these phenomena.",

On the other hand, it should be noted that decreases in the sickness absence and disability retirement rates may coincide with increasing unemployment rates. The observed temporal association may be explained with the correlation of the risks of disability and unemployment at the individual level. Work ability of those in precarious labour market positions should be monitored and their health problems tackled in the early stages. Unemployment and disability rates should more often be assessed together both at the national level and at the area level in order to reach a more complete understanding of the situation of those outside employment and of those suffering from work ability problems.
