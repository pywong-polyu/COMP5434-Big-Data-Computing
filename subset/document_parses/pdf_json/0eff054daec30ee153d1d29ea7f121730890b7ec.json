After quality control, the final case-control cohort included 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain. After genotyping and imputation on genome build GRCh38, univariate analysis was performed for 8,582,968 singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The resulting summary statistics including individual SNP positions and p-values were submitted to the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas; accession numbers, GCST90000255 and GCST90000256) and are available from www.c19-genet ics.eu. The GCST90000255 was the main analysis in which all the association statistics were corrected for the top 10 principal components (PCs), whereas in the additional analysis of GCST90000256, association statistics were corrected for the top 10 PCs, age, and sex. In [7] , the main results were found in the analysis on GCST90000255, and GCST90000256 was used for ancillary analysis. In the current study, we therefore focused on the summary statistics of GCST90000255 for further biological analysis because the analysis on GCST90000255 resulted in more plausible biological correlates likely associated with respiratory failure than those in GCST90000256.",

            "text": "Gene ontology analysis identified wound healing, cardiac-related biological process, and muscle system process as key correlates. For PPI analysis, we attempted to find the largest connected network in the list of 144 genes, assuming that interacting proteins in a biological network tend to have the same or similar molecular functions. As a result, the largest connected network consisted of 8 gene products from the following genes: GATA4, ID2, MAFA, NOX4, PTBP1, SMAD3, TUBB1, and WWOX. A literature search was conducted through PubMed to investigate whether there are previously reported results in terms of biological associations between these genes/proteins and respiratory or cardiac symptoms. Interestingly, we found that most of these gene products are relevant to both respiratory and cardiac diseases. In what follows, we describe the role of these biomarkers in biology.",

GATA4 also has been found to be a human candidate gene relevant to congenital heart disease [13, 14] . Several studies showed that GATA4 is a key protein responsible for the development of the lung, heart, and diaphragm in mice [15] [16] [17] . Arwood et al. described a mechanism of pulmonary hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), using transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing [18] . When comparing the transcriptomic difference between patients without pulmonary hypertension and those with combined post-and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, six differentially expressed genes were identified. In a further replication test on an independent cohort, only ID2 was validated and in an additional animal study, ID2 expression was significantly upregulated in mice with HFpEF and pulmonary hypertension compared to control mice. Another study showed a functional role of ID2 as one of the culprit genes in both the arterial and the venous poles of the heart [19] .",
