Unique hurdles included the delay of the 2020 ABR Core Exam, which caused significant disruption to PGY4 residents preparing for the exam (1), as well as clinical redeployment, which heavily impacted junior residents (2) . To address COVID-19 challenges, programs adopted social distancing, virtual curricula, and remote-read out techniques (3\u00c05). Despite these changes, a recent survey of program directors still suggests an overall negative impact on educational activities and decreased resident morale (6) . Given COVID-19 remains an active concern globally and with uncertain times still ahead, prospective residents are also stakeholders in how a program has responded to COVID- 19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020\u00c02021 residency application cycle was performed completely virtually per recommendations from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (7) . In June of 2021, the Association of Program Directors in Radiology issued a statement recommending continued virtual interviews for the 2021\u00c02022 residency application cycle (8) . In this virtual era, studies within and outside of radiology have reported generally positive feedback among faculty and applicants to the electronic interview structure (9\u00c012).",

In place of in-person interactions, program websites and other online resources have increased in importance in describing the resident experience to applicants and their decision making for program ranking (9, 13) . Departmental websites vary widely in the level of information they provide (14\u00c017).

While it is too early to evaluate the long-term impacts from virtual interviewing, there are a number of immediate benefits which may argue for maintaining their use even if not necessitated by a pandemic. Cost and time savings can be tangible, with estimates of average interview travel expenses costing $4,000\u00c0$4,500, often requiring additional loans or compelling applicants to forego a portion of interviews (22\u00c024). Cost savings have helped increase interview attendance (13) and likely improved equitable access (22) . Environmental cost savings are also substantial, with literature estimating the carbon footprint of travel at 0.21-0.49 metric ton of CO 2 per interview (11, 12) . If extrapolated across the number of diagnostic radiology ranks per US MD/DO applicant (25, 26) , the carbon footprint in 2020 amounted up to 5,092 metric tons of CO 2 . This carbon offset is equivalent to powering 925 homes for 1 year (27) .

Candidates may learn of open houses on social media (28), but we find only one-third of programs linked their social media accounts on their websites. Although open houses may be most impactful at the start of an ERAS application season, improving applicant exposure to current residents and faculty as well as bolstering avenues to connect on social media may still impact rank list decisions (13) . Program videos, virtual tours, and testimonies likely play an important role in introducing applicants to a program's culture and its resident experience (9, 20) . Out of the programs that displayed a video on their website, 21.3% (14.4% of all residency websites) had only a generic video from the institution's GME.

Chi-square analysis of eight criteria previously evaluated shows that department-funded socials and pictures of social activities remain more prevalent than expected at the largest third of programs, in addition to resident mentoring as well as wellness and social committees. On the other hand, the other criteria (formal retreats, wellness and non-clinical curricula, and dedicated wellness or social pages) are no longer statistically significantly associated with the largest programs, though still increased in online representation.
