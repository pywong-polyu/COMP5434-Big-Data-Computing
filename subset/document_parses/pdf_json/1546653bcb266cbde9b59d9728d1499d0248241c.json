Students learn to conduct research with a decision support system utilizing CT. The system is demonstrated through a case study of a capstone research project course. The course is a 3 rd year single semester capstone in an aviation program. CT was integrated over a decade, through 21 semesters of coordinating and delivering the course. The CT practices evolved and were utilized for more aspects over time. The CT system facilitated a significant reduction in staff workload by eliminating the need for direct one-on-one supervision and enabling the streamlining of marking. This resulted in fairer marking by eliminating supervisor bias. Student feedback shows a high degree of satisfaction, with comments highlighting choice and learning.",

The capstone project in higher education fulfils the same role, it is not a new part of the supporting structure, it is above it. In a capstone course, students utilize their knowledge and skills constructed throughout their program in a \"substantial real world project\" (Herbert, 2018) . Capstone projects can help to prepare students for their career by involving real experiences relevant to their profession (Neyem et al., 2014) . In the context of undergraduate US institutions, estimates suggest capstones are utilized in 40 to 98 percent of programs, depending on the institute and discipline (Hauhart & Grahe, 2014) , which is a rapid increase from three percent in the 1970s. Clearly, the capstone has become a significant aspect of modern higher education.",

A potential issue is the significant staff workload required, which is across multiple roles, advisors, instructors, and markers (Novitzki, 2001) . Two other issues include generating the required number of topics and student performance (Novitzki, 2001) . Farrell et al. (2012) suggest that there are specific challenges when it comes to assessing capstone projects. There is also the issue of fairness when different supervisors and markers are involved. Lawson et al. (2015) states that the course coordinator is the key to achieving fairness, by ensuring the course and the associated assessments are designed to support supervisors, markers, and any necessary moderation. The key issue identified by Lawson et al. (2015) was supervisor bias, which typically requires additional workload for mark adjustment and moderation. Alternatively, supervisors can be removed from the assessment process; although, they have knowledge of the student's work that is not reflected in certain assessed items. While the thesis is a key element to reporting the findings of science, students who are more practically or even mathematically minded may not be fairly assessed with a written thesis or oral presentation.",

Hassanien (2006) found that \"poor communication\" and \"poor attendance at group meetings\" were the primary issues identified by students. Lee et al. (2016) showed high response rates for issues such as personality clashes, which resulted in difficulty compromising. Similarly, different personalities resulted in different levels of engagement and motivation. Another commonly discussed issue is uneven distribution of workloads (Wilson et al., 2018) , which can be the result of initial task delegation or devolving situations over the project duration. Finally, LaBeouf et al. (2016) found that the primary issue was around grade assignment and fairness. Again, there are significant benefits that come with groupwork, especially the transference of teamwork skills to the workplace, where working in groups is almost unavoidable. However, another interesting feature to note is that higher-degrees-by-research is exclusively the domain of individual work.",

            "text": "Another complexity of capstone projects is the question of what constitutes a suitable or applicable project, which can vary by disciplines and traditions. As self-directed learning courses (Blanford et al., 2020) , two broad categories can be used to describe the types of work undertaken; these are akin to Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) (O\u011fuz-\u00dcnver & Arabacio\u011flu, 2011) . That is, students can set out to solve a problem (PBL) or answer a question (IBL); more technical disciplines favor the problem-solving approach while pure sciences favor inquiry. However, variations can come about due to differences in preferences by supervisors or those proposing/providing topics, including the students. This is further compounded considering what is and is not research. Leedy and Ormrod (2013) note that a literature review is not in itself research; however, these are readily proposed topics. Wing (2006) defined computational thinking (CT) as solving discipline independent problems utilizing the fundamental concepts in computing. Wing (2008) stated that computing in this context referred to \"computer science, computer engineering, communications, information science and information technology.\" These same algorithmic traditions span most of STEM, in particular physics, mathematics, and engineering, where computing solutions is a regular occurrence. This should not detract from the refinements that \"pure computer science\" has made, but reflects the broader sense that computing is wide reaching. This can be seen in the modern k-12 educational initiatives (Wing & Stanzione, 2016) , where \"coding\" can be applied to storytelling. Lee and Kang (2019) state that the effectiveness of CT applied outside engineering and more broadly STEM specific courses is limited. Their work investigated the application of CT to capstone projects for non-engineering students, which highlighted positive outcomes.",

The structured systematic capstone research project approach was initially envisioned as a \"choose your own adventure\" capstone project (Mundy & Consoli, 2013) , balancing choice, learning, and effort. The evolution of the delivery, dealing with issues, and the improvements in both student satisfaction and outcomes are presented.

If an aviation program focuses on the flying, safety, and management aspects, reporting will be a common theme, and hence report writing is a critical skill for students to master. It is not uncommon for a university aviation course to include an individual report assignment and a larger group report, typically with an oral presentation. This addresses practical work-ready skills developed by students which are essential for industry success (Chia & Round, 2015) . Nathan (2013) outlines the different forms of case reports representing most reporting activities aviation students complete.

The relevant chronology begins in 2012, as a physicist and mathematician teaching aviation systems and technology. I mostly looked through a positivistic lens and was completely objectivistic, while noting life was never truly black or white. For physics or engineering research, I was applying objectivism and positivism and as an educator I was moderating this with subjectivism and post-positivism. In both scenarios, I believed in realism. I completed a 3 rd year capstone project, an honors degree, and a PhD in physics, each with an associated thesis; this gave me a black and white view of research, with research only using filtered information, and unfiltered information used in reporting (analogous to journalism). Now, my research has expanded beyond objective laboratory experiments; I code qualitative data from content analyses and case studies. This required professional development in qualitative methodologies, and I joined the University's Qualitative Interest Group. While typically one should first consider their philosophical orientation to inform their methodology, I believe the reverse is also possible. That is, you can select a methodology and ensure that you orient yourself philosophically to undertake that research, being a methodological chameleon (Martin, 1990 ).",

The theses from that semester were mostly \"super case reports\", understandable given the average student had never done a university experiment, nor engineered solutions to problems, and most did not understand research past the tools used for their case report assignments. I instinctively wanted to emulate the activities of my previous research groups for my \"team\" of students. I scheduled a weekly session where we could all sit and talk about each other's research. My team of about three grew quickly to a collection of about seven students, where classmates who were likeminded also sat in, seeking guidance. Common issues were highlighted; I spoke to them about literature and what was scholarly and not scholarly, about structure and writing, and even formatting and using software (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint).",

The goal was above a case study, or at least a substantial collective case study. Colleagues who had PhDs in business and psychology exposed me to the concept that not everything was either literature reviews or laboratory experiments; obvious in retrospect given my previous physics education research including supervising an honors student. In 2013, the plan was to schedule a weekly workshop, emulating the process from 2012. This worked well, given the first semester cohort was half the size of the second semester cohort. However, the result was more student questions, some I could not answer given I did not know enough about the research traditions of business or much outside STEM. For the second semester I organized a guest presenter to come in each week. This covered literature (presented by me), doing surveys (presented by a colleague), how to do interviews (presented by a former news journalist), the methodology of case studies (presented by an education professor), and other topics. In two years, the course had gone from a single two-hour class in week one, to a six-week lecture schedule covering the basics of research. As the course became standardized and systematized, common technical issues persisted; to address this a one-hour lab per week was added in 2015. This used a different piece of software each week (Google Scholar to find literature, Endnote to manage literature, Word to format and edit a journal article, PowerPoint to make research posters, and two labs on Excel for research data).",

Workloads increased, with day one offshore as soon after January 1 st as possible, meaning most staff had just started four weeks of annual leave and were unavailable to supervise. A new issue became cultural differences, and especially the asking of questions in class (Chu & Walters, 2013) . The lack of topics from other staff required an examination of past topics to provide more. There were recognizable patterns that could be generalized. When examined objectively side-by-side new topics were being iteratively generated. Heuristically, through trial and error, popular topics became seeds for the next generation of the genetic algorithm. The result was a general potential topic space. This process was described as a \"choose your own adventure\" approach to topic selection (Mundy & Consoli, 2013) . The methodologies that aligned with these topics were apparent. The complex process of identifying a research project and selecting a research methodology had been dimensionally reduced. In each of these paired contexts and methodologies, there was an associated accumulation of knowledge about reliable data types and sources. What was previously a long complex sequence of decision making, had been reduced via abstraction to a single choice; each option had associated essential characteristics.",

While ambition should be commended, some students with better fundamental skills were being tasked with preliminary exploratory research to assess the potential for future research. If unfruitful, students were left with little to show; this required a pivot, maintaining the context, and simultaneously reducing topic complexity. These pivots were not with the support of supervisors given the distress expressed by students. If possible, these students were encouraged to embrace their negative result, and not focus on the irrelevant goal of positive outcomes. This involved changing research questions to ask if the tools and techniques were applicable or relevant in their aviation context. A more significant issue was if the tools and techniques were above the students' abilities.",

Leedy and Ormrod (2013) had been the class text since 2014, selected because the School purchased every staff member a copy. Three key issues were identified. The first was topics that were just literature reviews previously identified as not research. Second was not applying methods appropriately like using qualitative analysis for quantitative research. Finally, there were supervisors who just wanted another case report, which no longer aligned with the course learning outcomes. To try and resolve these issues the offshore online topic structure was adopted in 2018. Students were presented with the option to use the \"choose your own adventure\" or engage with an academic staff member to work on a specific topic. Although, growing postgraduate numbers reduced the number of unique topics from other academic staff. Students were cautioned, supervisors were not responsible for marking, they did not set the course learning outcomes, and while there may be different opinions on what was research, there were very clear minimum standards thoroughly documented for the course. Each issue was discussed with students in week one when talking about topic selection, and how to manage them. If a supervisor wanted a literature review, the student used content analysis with the literature as data following a well-defined methodology (Snyder, 2019) . Most students adopted the \"choose your own adventure\" style, and the main reason not to was because they had a specific desire to work with a particular member of staff, enabling them to engage in the student-staff partnership of their choice, providing value (Martens et al., 2019) . Figure 1 shows the original process from 2012. The process started with the \"context\" (in 2012 this term was topic). The context is the knowledge domain or aspect of aviation the student will focus on. This could be airline operation or aircraft maintenance, etc. This choice is the first reduction in potential topics. The scoping process was next, and a preliminary version of this came from supervisors with the provided topics. Students would then decide on their specific objectives (research questions), and select their methodology, with reference to the literature and with guidance from a supervisor. These were significant steps that were completed with a lack of knowledge in terms of what the options were. To better define the process of an undergraduate capstone research project, a structured problem decomposition approach was taken to divide the process into algorithmic procedures that the student steps through, inputting some choice or following the automation. That is, the previous project flow evolved over time to a systematic CT inspired process.",

As such, this hard line is just to eliminate \"type 2 errors\" while allowing \"type 1 errors\". That is, some acceptable sources will be forbidden to ensure no unacceptable sources are allowed. ",

It decomposes a large literature review (collecting and reviewing approximately 40 academic sources) into SMART weekly goals (Rubin, 2002) . The literature review procedure is illustrated in Figure 4 , where raw references are \"stored\" and reported numerically in the order found. When they are reviewed, they are \"stored\" and reported alphabetically (based on the referencing style utilized). The double handling is a marking feature, where weekly reports require a complete list of literature in the order found; this starts at four in week two becoming 40 in week 11. This was needed to prevent the practice of recycling references previously reported. The predefined processes are covered in laboratory activities (Lab 1 -Endnote, Lab 2 -Literature), and in the lecture program (Week 2, Chapter 3 Review of the Related Literature). ",

However, teamwork could be utilized by grouping students according to their methodology. While not a group project, students with related specific topics could work together through the research process. However, a comparative study between the individual student's subjects could be a groupwork extension. Mentoring of these teams by additional academic staff members would also be an interesting practice.",

In these novels from the 1980s, there were branching storylines in a single book, and you could choose to turn left or right, turning to the corresponding page to continue the story. This resulted in different outcomes for different readers, with the same page limit. The key point here is that the incorporation of CT practices does not mean the lack of variety and potential, nor does it mean a lack of creativity, imagination, and freedom; rather, the algorithms and automation provide a scaffold which countless capstone projects can be built with, just as the tree search that makes up a \"choose your own adventure\" can still facilitate artistic creativity (Newman, 1988) . Interestingly, there is a body of literature on \"choose your own adventure\" in education which will also retrospectively embody CT practices.",
