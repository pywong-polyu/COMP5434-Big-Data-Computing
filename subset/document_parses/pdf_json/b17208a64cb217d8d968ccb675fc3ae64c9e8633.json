Indeed, significant elevation of TPO and secondary thrombocytosis is observed in many clinical inflammatory conditions such as myeloproliferative disorders, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders. This elevation in TPO and platelet count is mediated by IL-6, which increases TPO production both in vitro and in vivo [1] . In fact, IL-6 knockout mice do not demonstrate increases in TPO levels during inflammation [7] . Further, platelet levels in these mice are lower during inflammatory conditions compared to wild-type mice. This is directly related to a lack of an IL-6-mediated increase of mRNA transcription of TPO by the liver during periods of inflammation [7] . IL-6 plays an important role in inflammatory and neoplastic disease. IL-6 is among the most potent regulators of acute inflammation. Administration of IL-6 has been demonstrated to increase acute phase inflammatory reactants and platelet count. In addition, overexpression has been found in most types of tumors [8] . Further, IL-6 has been found to be significantly higher in patients with reactive thrombocytosis than in healthy controls [9] .",

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) refers to an uncontrolled and overwhelming release of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6, by an overly activated immune system [10] . Thromboinflammation, defined as the convergence of thrombotic and inflammatory processes, is well recognized in the context of CRS [11] . Thromboinflammation is a pathologic condition described extensively in the context of sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, major trauma, and several other disease entities [11] . Central to thromboinflammation is the loss of normal antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory function of endothelial cells, leading to dysregulation of coagulation, complement, platelet activation, and leukocyte recruitment in the microvasculature [12] . When severe, thromboinflammation can extend systemically and damage remote organs, particularly the lung and kidneys. This may lead to development of multiorgan dysfunction and death [11] . Despite use of anticoagulation therapies in the past, bleeding complications undermine clinical benefit. Thus, defining molecular mechanisms regulating thromboinflammation in specific disease states is of major clinical importance.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations within the c-Mpl pathway in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms may be hypersensitive to TPO, resulting in skewed signaling [19] . Further, overexpression of TPO in mice leads to the development of lethal myeloproliferative disorders or myelofibrosis [20] . Recent data have also demonstrated a reduction in hematopoietic stem cells in the absence of TPO genes, supporting the hypothesis that myeloproliferative neoplasms are growth factordependent diseases [18] . Given these facts, TPO silencing may offer a potential therapeutic target for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms [18] . In addition, thrombosis and thrombocytosis are both predictive of poor survival in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and many treatment goals for patients are aimed at prevention of these complications [21] . Since TPO induces thrombocytosis and subsequent thrombosis, TPO silencing offers the additional advantage of lowering platelet counts and thrombotic complications.",

Multiple previous animal studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of TPO silencing as a means to decreasing platelet numbers safely. TPO inhibition has been found to be safe with regards to the moderate reduction in platelet count in primates without adverse bleeding consequences [30] . Further, global TPO knockout mice have a 90% reduction in MK and platelet level. They also do not exhibit excessive bleeding [34] . MKs and platelets in these mice are morphologically and functionally normal, and importantly these mice survive into adulthood [34] . To date, the only documented adverse event associated with TPO silencing in TPO silencing models is prolonged bleeding time when platelet levels are allowed to drop to levels less than 100,000/ \u03bcL [25, 30, 34] . Notably, this is the threshold for increased bleeding time in any cause of thrombocytopenia [30] . Another advantage of TPO silencing for platelet reduction is that it allows for normal platelet function such that in cases of severe thrombocytopenia new platelets may be reintroduced without adverse effects on their function. This is in contrast to other anti-platelet medications such as aspirin and clopidogrel that directly impair platelet function and remain in circulation for several days after administration [30] . In addition, TPO may be directly administered to patients quickly increase TPO levels to a physiologic range.",

In fact, these cases were the first report of MKs found in cerebral capillaries for any cause in the medical literature. Further, platelet-rich thrombi were found extensively at multiple end-organ sites. Thus, it appears that many patients with COVID-19 have significant pathologic MK and platelet manifestations.

A multicenter retrospective study demonstrated that platelet count > 450 \u00d7 10 9 / L was predictive of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. As such, the elevated MKs and platelets are likely contributing to the hypercoagulable states associated with COVID-19 patients [13] . Recent autopsy reports documented up to a 3-fold increase of MKs in the lungs and hearts of COVID-19 patients who died from the disease [14] . In addition, these reports demonstrated a remarkably high number of platelet-rich thrombi in multiple end-organ systems. Alveolar capillaries were filled with fibrinrich thrombi containing neutrophils, indicating extensive platelet activation. These thrombi were also directly associated with myocardial infarction unrelated to underlying atherosclerosis as well as acute tubular necrosis in the absence of renal glomerular pathology. Notably, these pathologies were found in the absence of other causes of hypercoagulable states such as DIC or superimposed secondary infection [14] . Elevated levels of platelet/ fibrin thrombi were also noted in COVID-19 patients on pharmacologic anticoagulation treatments, suggesting investigation of alternative therapies, such as TPO silencing, aimed at decreasing COVID-19 related hypercoagulable states is warranted. As mentioned previously, TPO silencing has been safely used to reduce platelet count and rates of thrombosis formation.",

Autopsies of COVID-19 patients report mononuclear cell infiltrates around thrombosed small vessels and neutrophils within the platelet-rich fibrin thrombi. In addition, resident lung MKs were increased and actively producing platelets [14, 39] . Notably, young platelets have increased coagulation potential [14] . Activated platelets bind to leukocytes and promote leukocyte activation and extravasation. They also form aggregates with neutrophils and induce neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [12] . NETS have many functions, including prothrombotic activity. NETs were markedly increased in the blood of COVID-19 patients and were noted in the pulmonary capillaries of COVID-19 acute lung injury [12] . Thus, resident lung MKs may be adding highly thrombogenic platelets to an already hypercoagulable environment [42] . Importantly, previous studies have found that by inducing platelet depletion with TPO silencing, inflammatory immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages, are reduced in the lung. This is in addition to bone marrow mediated platelet and MK lowering effects induced by TPO silencing [35] . Thus, TPO silencing may offer many potential therapeutic advantages in treating thromboinflammation associated with COVID-19.",
