The patients with frailty currently account for one-third of the critically ill, resulting in higher mortality. There is evidence of how frailty affects the intrahospital functional trajectory of critically ill patients since prehospital status is often missing.",

Older patients are more likely frail, which is a multifaceted condition characterized by the loss of physiologic and cognitive reserves (3, 4) . The observational studies suggest that the patients with frailty currently account for up to one-third of the critically ill (5, 6) . Consequently, the patient outcome is determined not only by the acute critical illness but increasingly by the reduced functional reserve of preexisting frailty resulting in higher 30-day mortality (5, 7, 8) . In accordance, the likelihood to be discharged to a nursing home is greater in the patients with frailty (9) , if the critical illness is survived. This might be caused by the higher odds of disability in the activities in daily living (10, 11) and increased functional dependence (12, 13) . Despite this finding, the factors affecting the recovery of physical function after a critical illness remain poorly understood. The patient-level characteristics should be evaluated as the recovery trajectories differ between the cohorts in both the extent and speed of recovery of physical function. A functional trajectory is used to describe this complex process by measuring the changes in the functional status at different time points (14, 15) .",

We used a 1:N matching approach with a starting caliper of 0.0001 and repetitive matchings with an increasing caliper (35) . After each matching routine, the selected patients with non-frailty were excluded from the further matchings. The procedure was stopped when the necessary sample size was reached to prove the significance (p < 0.05) with a power of 80%. The sample size was calculated using the univariate OR of 0.524 between all the patients with frailty and non-frailty for the deterioration of the Mobility-Transfer-Barthel till hospital discharge. Assuming a ratio of approximately 1:2 between the patients with frailty and non-frailty, we calculated a necessary total number of 654. With a caliper of 0.0001, 28 patients were selected; with a caliper of 0.001, we obtained a total of 173 patients; with a caliper of 0.01, 483 patients were obtained; and with a caliper of 0.1, we exceeded the necessary threshold obtaining 687 patients. The stepwise resulting subcohorts were not comparable regardless of the caliper chosen when a standardization mean difference (SMD) <0.1 between the groups is required for all the cofactors. The effect sizes of all the endpoints, therefore, were adjusted for these cofactors using multivariate conditional regression. We performed several sensitivity analyses: first, the primary analysis was repeated in the survivors only in the propensity matched cohort. Second, a logistic regression model for the primary endpoint was used with all the patients. As an exploratory analysis, MTB over time using a multivariate mixed model with the clinically relevant covariates was applied. The independent variables were the same factors as in the propensity score matching, the points in time obtaining the MTB, and the interactions terms of the factor frailty and these points in time. The covariates used were tested for collinearity calculating the variance inflation factor. Missing collinearity was assumed with a variance inflation factor <5; otherwise, one of the factors had to be omitted in the adjusted analysis.",

Actually, the pre-existing differences in the functional status of patients with frailty and non-frailty converged at hospital discharge, indicating that intensive care is justified in patients with pre-existing frailty as well.

In another study in more than 1,000 patients, frailty was again associated with an increased disability after critical illness (11) . In both studies, the parameters of functionality were obtained before the onset of critical illness. Brummel et al. investigated the functional status at 3-and 12-month after critical illness, which did not evaluate the influence of intensive care on the clinical outcome. Similarly, in the study from Bagshaw et al., the outcome was assessed at 6 and 12 months. Furthermore, the authors mentioned a limitation that they were not able to integrate the baseline functional measures, such as mobility.

However, the prehospital frailty status was assessed retrospectively which is a limitation. Although we implemented detailed and recurrent training of our study staff, the assessment depends on the ability to either correctly recall the prehospital status by the patients or to adequately know the status by proxy (memory and information bias). This important problem is not satisfactorily answered yet. The upcoming results of the ASTON study (NCT03785444) will likely improve our insight on assessing the prehospital functional status in patients with critical illness. Until then we must accept this as a limitation. Since the majority of our patients are surgical or trauma, the results should be validated in the medical ICU patients as well.",

The factors leading to nonselection in propensity scoring were admission from a nursing home, an advanced age, a low GCS, a high APACHE II score, and a high level of comorbidities represented by CCI in the patients with frailty. In the patients with non-frailty, younger age and a low CCI (showing a healthy overall status) lead to non-selection. Nevertheless, this approach strengthens the conclusion that the effect is due to frailty itself and reduces the likelihood of bias. The assumed risk of limited generalizability is countervailed by the confirmation of all the results in the sensitivity and exploratory analysis performed in the complete cohort.",
