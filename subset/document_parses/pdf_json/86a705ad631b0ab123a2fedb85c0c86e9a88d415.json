Both now and before COVID-19, frequency of each HE and associated symptoms (dryness, itching, erythema, desquamation, pain/burning, vesicle, oozing, and fissure) were asked separately. Survey respondents were asked to self-evaluate the current state of their hands for HE and related symptoms.

We investigated HE-associated symptoms both pre-and post-COVID-19 in the same group of individuals. As a result, we were able to clearly show the increased prevalence of HE-associated symptoms after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Although the prevalence of HE was found to be common in men [2] and equal in both genders [6] in several previous studies, it was generally observed that the prevalence of HE was higher among women in many studies [17, 18] . Most of the women in our study were nurses, but being a nurse was not associated with HAG in multivariate analysis. One possible explanation for the considerable HE prevalence among women is that they may perform more \"wet work\" at home or work [17] . In our study, we found that a history of atopic disease increased the risk of HE-associated symptoms in HCWs. Previous studies also support our findings [6, 14, 17] . Atopic diseases increase the skin' s susceptibility to irritation, decrease the irritation threshold, and prolong dermal recovery time [14] . As such, it further reinforces the importance of atopic diseases in recognition of HE as an occupational disease and the need for special preventive strategies to help reduce the clinical burden of this condition in atopic individuals [14] .",

[13] showed that high frequency of handwashing [13, [19] [20] [21] . During handwashing, it is recommended to avoid overly-hot water and the application of moisturizers after handwashing [20, 21] . In our study, the use of disinfectants was very low. The median use of disinfectants was 10 in HEG and eight in NHEG. Erdem et al. [7] reported that 64.5% of HCWs use hand disinfectants more than 10 times a day. Guertler et al. [10] reported that the median frequency of hand disinfectant use was four times per day during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences in the frequency of disinfectant use in these studies may be related to the daily or weekly working hours of the HCWs, and the participant' s total number of patients with or without COVID-19. In our study, in multivariate logistic analysis, the use of hand disinfectants was not found to be associated with self-reported HE-associated symptoms. We think that the use of disinfectants was low in our study and that handwashing may be replaced with disinfectant use whenever possible. Hand moisturizers are recommended for the treatment of HE in the literature [9, 13, [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, in our study, we found that the increased use of hand moisturizers was independently associated with self-reported HE-associated symptoms. We did not investigate the use of moisturizer before the pandemic. We only investigated the current use of moisturizers. This might suggest that individuals in HEG used moisturizers with a therapeutic intent after the development of HE, rather than for prevention. It is reasonable to suspect that healthcare workers with dry and damaged skin might use moisturizers more frequently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Erdem et al. [7] found that frequent use of moisturizing creams was associated with HE, and we agree with their conclusion. Some of our survey responses seemed unrealistic. For example, one respondent answered that \"I use 35 moisturizers a day\". However, in cross-sectional survey studies, every response should be accepted as correct and analyzed. We do not think that the statistics were affected by these extreme values since the number of cases in our study was large and because our analysis used the median rather than the mean.",

Hand eczema may cause sleep disturbance, distancing from sports and social activities where hands are using, and embarrassment due to the undesirable aesthetic changes. These may lead to social isolation and depression [17] . HE may reduce the effective HCW workforce [11, 23] . Hand eczema causes a financial burden due to direct treatment costs and indirect loss of working capacity, sick leave and job loss [17] . Depending on the severity of eczema, HE may reduce the quality of life (QoL) [22, 24] . Damaged skin barrier may cause new sensitizations to allergens in atopic individuals by facilitating the migration of allergens [8, 17] . Hand eczema increases the colonization of pathogenic microorganisms on the hand, which indicates a possible risk for the transmission of these microorganisms [19] . Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry, is abundantly expressed in the skin on blood vessels, basal cells, hair follicles. Thus, damaged skin barrier due to HE may lead to a route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 [20, 23, 25] .",

            "text": "For the many reasons stated above, it is important that the focus should be on strategies to prevent HE. For hand care, HCWs should apply a light, fragrance-free moisturizing lotion during the day, and every time after hand hygiene, if conditions allow. A fragrance-free, lipid-rich moisturizer should be used before bedtime [26] . To treat and protect against HE, moisturizers may be insufficient and anti-inflammatory treatment, especially local corticosteroids, may be required [8] . If hands are not visibly soiled, using alcohol-based disinfectants should be preferred rather than handwashing. Because alcohol-based disinfectants show high antimicrobial activity and low risk of skin damage [13, 21, 24] . Alcohol-based hand solutions containing glycerin may use as a moistur- izer [26] . HCWs can wear protective gloves when necessary and especially during tasks with wet work [24] . A double set of gloves may be used for prolonged periods. Correct alcohol-based glove hygiene is required. To reduce sweating and skin irritation, the use of cotton gloves under medical gloves is recommended [26] . Providing educational information about appropriate hand hygiene methods and HE preventative measures may induce behavioral change and reduce the prevalence of HE [3, 20, 23, 24] . It is important that healthcare professionals be closely evaluated and trained by allergists or dermatologists. Due to the visual character of HE and to reduce the contact of HCWs with each other, who are in the biggest risk group for COVID-19 cross-transmission, HCWs can be easily evaluated by allergists and dermatologists using telemedicine tools. Our study has several limitations due to the nature of cross-sectional survey studies. Because the participants were not examined directly, a definitive diagnosis of HE could not be made. Another limitation is responder bias: HCWs who suffer from HE may be more likely to respond to the survey because of an interest in improving the working environment. Thus, this may lead to the over-representation of HE-associated symptoms in this study. Finally, questions about pre-existing factors, such as the frequency of handwashing or moisturizer use before COVID-19, were not included in the survey. However, our study provides insights into the prevalence and risk factors for handwashing behavior related HE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such information could be useful for interventions to minimize these occupational skin problems.",
