            "text": "Despite being vaccine preventable, rabies (lyssavirus) still has a significant impact on global mortality, disproportionally affecting children under 15 years of age. This neurotropic virus is deft at avoiding the immune system while travelling through neurons to the brain. Until recently, research efforts into the role of non-coding RNAs in rabies pathogenicity and detection have been hampered by a lack of human in vitro neuronal models. Here, we utilized our previously described human stem cell-derived neural model to investigate the effect of lyssavirus infection on microRNA (miRNA) expression in human neural cells and their secreted exosomes. Conventional differential expression analysis identified 25 cellular and 16 exosomal miRNAs that were significantly altered (FDR adjusted P-value <0.05) in response to different lyssavirus strains. Supervised machine learning algorithms determined 6 cellular miRNAs (miR-99b-5p, miR-346, miR-5701, miR-138-2-3p, miR-651-5p, and miR-7977) were indicative of lyssavirus infection (100% accuracy), with the first four miRNAs having previously established roles in neuronal function, or panic and impulsivity-related behaviors. Another 4-miRNA signatures in exosomes (miR-25-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-218-5p, miR-598-3p) can independently predict lyssavirus infected cells with >99% accuracy. Identification of these robust lyssavirus miRNA signatures offers further insight into neural lineage responses to infection and provides a foundation for utilizing exosome miRNAs in the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics for rabies.",

As rabies is a neglected tropical disease that predominantly impacts economically poor and non-industrialized countries, the actual burden of this disease is likely to be significantly under-reported (Taylor et al., 2017; WHO, 2018) . Classical rabies virus is the most commonly known member of Lyssavirus genus (Troupin et al., 2016) , however there are 15 other genetically related viruses within the genus, most of which have been isolated from bats (Delmas et al., 2008; Rupprecht et al., 2017; Shipley et al., 2019) .",

From the wound site, the virus migrates to the brain via the peripheral nervous system in an asymptomatic pre-clinical phase, typically taking between two weeks and three months to occur (Schnell et al., 2010) . Once resident in the CNS, the virus causes encephalomyelitis and manifests in neurological symptoms including, seizures, confusion, aggression, muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately culminates in death. Treatment of patients presenting with clinical signs is limited to palliative care, or in rare cases, implementation of the \"Milwaukee protocol\" is used to induce a therapeutic coma and an antiexcitotoxic strategy while the native immune response matures (Willoughby et al., 2005; Ledesma et al., 2020) . However, more contemporary review of these methods has cast doubt on scientifically proven validity of this approach (Wilde and Hemachudha, 2015; Zeiler and Jackson, 2016) .",

The virus can efficiently evade antigen presentation to the immune system during replication and transit between neurons (Ito et al., 2016) , so traditional serological and molecular diagnostics are often unable to detect pre-clinical viral infection and sensitivity to serological tests is as low as 20% in unvaccinated patients (Mahadevan et al., 2016) . The current gold standard diagnostic test for rabies utilizes post-mortem brain smears to fluorescently detect viral antigens, and is, for obvious reasons, of little help outside disease surveillance and reporting. Additionally, other etiologies (both infectious and noninfectious) may result in a similar clinical presentation, which can result in misdiagnosis, especially in regions where human rabies is less common (Fooks et al., 2017) . Therefore, the development of diagnostic or testing protocols for detection of rabies virus infection needs to circumvent the pitfalls of \"traditional\" approaches and instead consider a more novel approach to understanding and detecting this evasive virus.",

To investigate the host molecular response to lyssavirus infection we utilized several different strains, including a laboratory-adapted CVS-11 strain, an Australian bat lyssavirus strain isolated from an infected horse (H.ABLV), and two rabies viruses, one from a Canadian silver-haired bat (SHBRV), and the other from a Zimbabwean dog (Z.Dog). Briefly, infections were conducted using human stem cell-derived neural cultures differentiated in a 24-well plate for 25-32 days with an MOI of 1 (based on the viral titre determined in BHK-1 cells). Uninfected \"mock\" controls had an equal volume of cell culture media added. Viral adsorption was left for 16 hours, then the inoculum was removed, the cells were washed, and fresh media added. Infections were left for a further 3 days before samples were taken. Four lyssavirus strains were utilized in this study: CVS-11, a laboratory adapted strain, and 3 field isolates (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2020a) . The field isolates included Australian bat lyssavirus isolated from a horse (H.ABLV), and rabies viruses isolated from a Canadian silverhaired bat (SHBRV) and a Zimbabwean dog (Z.Dog). Three separate differentiation and infection experiments were conducted per lyssavirus strain, each with three technical replicates.

Machine learning (ML) analysis was conducted using the scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) module in Python. Highly correlated miRNAs (Pearson R of >0.8 or <-0.8) were removed, then the data was scaled using a robust scaling method (the median was removed, and the data scaled according to the interquartile range). Feature (miRNA) selection was performed using recursive feature elimination (RFE) based on a logistic regression classification model. The model was optimized then assessed by splitting the data up randomly into 70% labelled training data and 30% unlabelled test data, and the predicted classes of the test data samples were compared to the true classes. This process was repeated 1,000 times to ensure confidence in the classification performance. The logistic regression models were assessed for their accuracy (how many of the predictions were correct), precision (how many of the predicted positives were true positives), recall (how many of the true positives were found by the model), and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC), which is a succinct metric to describe a binary classification model (Tribolet et al., 2020) . All ML analysis was conducted by comparing uninfected mock samples with lyssavirus infected samples (all strains grouped together).",

CVS-11 infection had a more widespread effect on miRNA expression than the field lyssavirus strains (21 differentially expressed miRNAs compared to 8-9 miRNAs in the field isolates), with 14 miRNAs changing only in response to this lab-adapted virus (Supplementary Table 1 ). Five miRNAs (miR-619-5p, -10395-3p, -345-3p, -3609, and -5701) decreased in response to all lyssavirus strains tested ( Figure 3A) . Supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA) shows moderate separation between mock infection and lyssavirus samples using the 5 common DE miRNAs, however one mock sample clustered with lyssavirus samples ( Figure 3B ). Machine learning (ML) was then used as a multivariate analysis tool to identify miRNAs whose combined change in expression allowed lyssavirus infected cells to be distinguished from uninfected mock controls. ML identified 6 miRNAs (miR-5701, miR-138-2-3p, miR-346, miR-99b-5p, miR-651-5p, and miR-7977) ( Figure 3C ) that could distinguish lyssavirus infected neural cells with 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC ( Figure 3D ). Of these, only miR-5701 was also identified through DE analysis. These 6 ML miRNAs allow greater separation between the groups, and deliver a classification model with high confidence, as seen in the decision boundary graph ( Figure 3E) .

Mirroring the cellular miRNA results, CVS-11 triggered the most diverse changes, with the abundance of 12 miRNAs (6 up, 6 down) significantly altered ( Figure 4A) . Surprisingly, SHBRV did not result in any DE miRNAs being detected, while only 2 DE miRNAs (both downregulated) were found in exosomes from Z.Dog infected neurons ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Table 2 ). As there were no common DE miRNAs, the abundance of all 16 identified DE miRNAs was used in the supervised LDA analysis, which resulted in moderate separation between the uninfected mock and lyssavirus infected groups ( Figure 4B ). ML was then employed to identify a minimal exosomal miRNA signature that could be used to predict lyssavirus infection in the neural cells. The data was randomly split into discovery and validation sets, a logistic regression classification model was trained and tested, then this process was repeated 1,000 times to determine reproducibility. The most predictive miRNAs were selected using recursive feature elimination ( Figure 4C ). Four miRNAs (miR-25-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-218-5p, miR-598-3p) were identified to be the optimal signature, resulting in 99.2% accuracy, 99.8% precision, 99.2% recall and 100% ROC AUC ( Figure 4D) . Interestingly, only miR-25-3p and miR-218-5p were identified using DE analysis; if using only these two DE miRNAs the accuracy of the ML model drops to 86.1%. Adding additional miRNAs into the signature did not improve performance, and more than 12 miRNAs resulted in the accuracy of the model falling significantly ( Figure 4C) . A decision boundary graph shows a clear separation between the uninfected mock samples and the lyssavirus groups ( Figure 4E ).",

In concert, a lack of appropriate ex-vivo models for studying rabies infection in human neurons has contributed to the critical knowledge gap around the clinical pathogenesis of the virus. Here, we have utilized a previously described human stem cell-derived neural model (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2020a) to better explore host-cell and exosome associated miRNA expression during human rabies infection, and ascertain the use of miRNA expression as a reliable predictive biomarker of infection. Several studies have previously examined lyssavirus-mediated miRNA changes in brain homogenates of infected mouse models (Han et al., 2011 , Zhao et al., 2012a Zhao et al., 2012b , Shi et al., 2014 . However, despite recent advances in modelling neurotropic viruses in human neural stem cell systems (Tabari et al., 2020) , the application of in vitro or human neural stem cell model systems has not been employed for improved differentiation between cellular or non-cellular (exosomal) miRNAs for lyssaviruses.",

DE is performed by comparing the expression levels of each miRNA between groups and using a statistical test to assess the probability of any difference happening by random chance. As there is usually a large number of comparisons (832 in the cell samples), stringent p-value corrections are often applied to control false positives. This approach effectively identifies large scale changes but can result in false negatives due to overly harsh p-value corrections. This potentially explains why no DE exosomal miRNAs were identified in human neural cultures infected with SHBRV ( Figure 4A) . DE also only looks at individual miRNA changes, with no regard for the complex molecular interplay which occurs in biological systems.",

This will better take into consideration the complexity of the larger system and enable accurate predictive analysis. Unfortunately, ML can be challenging to implement, and its performance is often dependent on the amount of data available (more samples generally result in a stronger model). ML is yet to be become a default methodology within the biological sciences, although it is likely to become more widespread.

This response may act as a putative neuroprotective mechanism against the transport of the pathogen through the peripheral and central nervous system. A similar axonal destruction mechanism, called Wallerian degeneration, has also been reported in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (White et al., 2019) . Deletion of Dicer (a key protein in miRNA biogenesis) results in progressive axonal degeneration in the peripheral nervous system of mice , indicating a role for miRNAs in regulating this cellular response.

For instance, miR-138-2 (ML cell signature) is associated with panic disorder and directly targets the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor GABRA6, a gene implicated in the etiology of anxiety disorders (Muinos-Gimeno et al., 2011) . Overexpression of this miRNA in C57BL/6J mice lead to impaired learning and memory, and increased anxiety (Boscher et al., 2020) . MicroRNA-598-3p (exosome ML signature) was also shown to change during hearing loss-related cognitive impairment (Mun et al., 2021) . Circulating miR-26b-5p was altered in Alzheimer's disease and the behavioral variant of Frontotemporal dementia, a condition that leads to behavioral disinhibition, impulsivity, and deficits in complex thinking (Denk et al., 2018) . Finally, although not significantly correlated with impulsive traits, miR-346 (exosome ML signature) is located within Neuroregulin-3, a gene that has been shown to regulate impulsivity in mice (Loos et al., 2014; Pietrzykowski and Spijker, 2014) and promotes synapse formation in excitatory neurons (Muller et al., 2018) . This miRNA was also reduced in extracellular vesicles in the forebrain of mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (Gitai et al., 2020) . Together, this cluster of miRNAs generated from the ML algorithm may point to a role of miRNAs in the behavioral alterations, confusion, and anxiety that is often seen in clinical rabies infections. Again, this would warrant a much deeper analysis, but provides a basis for furthering our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning clinical signs and symptoms of the disease.",

This has important implications for studies exclusively employing lab-adapted strains for rabies disease modelling as these strains may not offer a realistic insight into rabies pathogenesis of field isolates. Indeed, attenuated lyssaviruses have been shown to activate the host immune response, rather than evade it (Wang et al., 2005) , and CVS-11 specific miRNA responses may play a role in this divergent host-pathogen interaction, although further work is warranted to confirm this relationship.",

As previously mentioned, Rabies has an unusually long asymptomatic incubation period with little to no early immune activation, which has led to a gap in effective antemortem diagnostic testing protocols. Prophylactic treatment is effective but costly, and sometimes inaccessible. A tool to stratify infected patients and justify the cost versus benefit of therapeutic intervention would enable more efficient implementation, particularly throughout the developing world.",

Seven serum miRNAs were found to be DE in the study by (Han et al., 2011) , none of which were identified by our analysis. Several reasons may have contributed to this discrepancy, including the use of an in vivo murine model of infection as opposed to/ compared to our in vitro human neural culture system; serum versus cell culture supernatant sampling of putative miRNAs; low sampling numbers from the animal model which displayed extensive heterogeneity in viral RNA and protein expression in infected groups; and the timing of sampling -1 week versus 72 hours post-inoculation. On this last point it is interesting to note that (Han et al., 2011) do state that the expression of the seven miRNAs identified was specific to the infected mice, regardless of infection stage between 1-3 weeks. However, from this study it is not known if the miRNA expression profile would be different at a time point earlier than 1 week post-inoculation.",

Whilst this is promising foundational data upon which to develop a novel circulating biomarker, further work is still needed to ensure these miRNAs are detectable in vivo at clinically relevant time points. It would also be prudent to more accurately determine the level of expression of miRNAs in different nerve populations, such as the sensory and motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system and the differing classes of neurotransmitter-responsive nerves in the central nervous system. Given the supporting role of glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells) in nerve function, damage and repair responses, the contribution of glial miRNAs to viral pathogenesis and neural system damage also warrants a more detailed investigation. Finding these signatures in accessible body fluids is also an essential step toward the establishment of this miRNA infection signature as a biomarker for in vitro diagnostics.",

We show that applying a machine learning approach to conventional bioinformatic assessment can improve the accuracy and detail of our datasets. In addition, information obtained from DE and ML analysis provides interesting insights into the molecular role and relationship of miRNA clusters during viral infection. It would be interesting, and pertinent, to examine these miRNA changes in other neurotropic infections to assess their specificity to rabies and their role in wider diseases states. Lastly, we have identified a novel exosomal miRNA signature can independently predict lyssavirus infected cells with >99% accuracy and provides a foundation for utilizing exosome miRNAs in the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics for rabies. Although still in the early discovery stage as an \"ideal\" biomarker for rabies, further research of this signature, or the methodologies used to find it, may eventually become the foundation upon which diagnostics, improved pre-clinical management and potentially new treatments are identified for the disease.",
