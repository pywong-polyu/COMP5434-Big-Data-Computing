The online tool for parents, iCygnus, was designed to reduce the psychological impact generated by the pandemic on the child population (2-12 years of age) through automatic recommendations to parents based on individual responses about their parenting styles and their child's characteristics. The profiles of the 710 families indicate a higher prevalence of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in children, as well as a relationship between punitive parenting in families where the parents lost their jobs due to the coronavirus disease . The usefulness of the help offered by iCygnus was evaluated after 6 weeks, and almost 80% of the families indicated that they used the recommendations and that they helped them in their relationship with their children.",

Unlike the citizens of other countries, such as Germany or France, Spanish citizens were required to stay home at all times, and only activities aimed at acquiring basic necessities or attending health or work centers were authorized. Children stopped attending school and performing all their routines and lost social contact with friends and family. Spanish society as a whole, like that of many other countries, was facing a situation of isolation for the first time and experts predict that it will have repercussions on mental health, such as anxiety and depression disorders, substance abuse, and domestic violence or child abuse, among others [2] . A review of previous confinement experiences in other countries also indicates that likely psychological consequences include post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger [3] .",

There are very few studies that evaluate the psychological impact that this confinement situation is having on children, but some experts suggest effects at different levels such as concentration difficulties, boredom, irritability, lack of rest, nervousness, feelings of loneliness, restlessness, and worries [6] . Some recent research underlines how the increase of parental stress or parental burnout due to the pandemic situation makes parents more likely to engage in child abuse and neglect [7, 8] . To these data are added those obtained by Xie et al., who determined that 22.6% of school-age students had depressive symptoms and 18.9% had symptoms of anxiety, in a sample of children in China, during the confinement in the months of February to March, 2020 [9] . Likewise, Brooks et al. point out the possible presence of posttraumatic stress based on previous studies [3] , such as that of Sprang & Silman, in which children in a confined state presented post-traumatic stress levels four times higher than those of unconfined children [10] . Also, the loss of routines can make them lose their sense of structure, predictability, and security.",

Lee highlighted the change in routine that it entails for children, the loss of social contact, the uncertainty for those children during critical school years, such as changes in the educational cycle or loss of all secondary benefits that the school provides for children, as well as individual therapies for children with special educational needs [12] . In Spain, children will go without school for six months since the last stages of return to normal after confinement overlap with the start of the summer holidays. Poletti & Raballo consider that the prolonged closure of schools is an important stressor for children, which increases the risk of loneliness, addiction to video games and compulsive consumption of screens, alteration of circadian rhythms, as well as, in some cases, being victims of or witnessing domestic violence [13] . All this is added to the academic gaps that the closure of schools imply for some children, which in turn increases the inequalities of the most vulnerable.",

            "text": "Despite the limited existing data, it seems evident that the combination of the psychological impact on children and on the adult population makes families one of the major sources of vulnerability to this crisis. Parents, in addition to bearing the stress derived from the direct impact of the disease on the social environment, adjustment to new working conditions or temporary or permanent loss of employment, and the physical and psychological consequences of confinement, have had to face and sustain the whole impact of this situation on their children. COVID-19 is a stressor and anxiety factor for many parents [18] . Parental stress, in turn, is a risk factor for children's well-being [19, 20] Families thus face a host of stressors that can negatively influence parenting. Humphreys et al. [21] explain that this confinement situation, where children's routines are altered, is prone to generate in them an increase in challenging behaviors that tend to provoke harsh responses from parents more easily. These authors also consider that, if the stress of the parents' own individual experience is added to this, it is easier for them to manifest outbursts of temper or even exercise physical or verbal abuse [22] . Without a doubt, these relational dynamics impact the emotional state of children, who are permeable to the changes that occur in their environment, translating the unpredictability or stress of the environment into symptoms of anxiety, greater behavioral problems, or sadness [23] .",

One of the most important goals for this research team is to promote the prevention of children's behavior problems. Although adolescence is a developmental period of special importance, we have focused the psychological orientations of the iCygnus tool between the ages of 2 and 12 in order to help parents in their difficult task and prevent the appearance of major behavioral problems as a consequence of home confinement. This tool was designed according to 4 fundamental criteria. First, that it should offer psychological guidance tailored as much as possible to the characteristics of the child and the educational style of the parents or guardians. Second, that it should be kept short. Given the emotional overload involved in a confinement situation, it was necessary to develop a tool that could shape the child and the educational style of the parents or guardians with as few questions as possible. Third, psychological counseling had to be automatic and offered in real time. In many cases, the results of scientific advances are returned to society with a certain delay. However, in this case, families needed answers on how to handle their children at home at a very specific and immediate moment. Finally, it was necessary for the tool to reach many people-the distribution and diffusion had to be massive.",

The SDQ instrument was selected because with few questions it evaluates the variables of emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial behavior, which have been shown to especially impact the child population affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [19, 22] . The orientations offered by the tool were different depending on whether the children scored more or less on each of these variables. For example, if the child's profile had high scores for emotional symptoms, iCygnus offered parents strategies to help their child reduce their discomfort. As with high scores in behavior problems, parents were offered guidance on understanding and managing these behaviors in a stressful situation, such as prolonged confinement. Similarly, if the child's profile yielded high scores for prosocial behavior, the iCygnus tool highlighted the child's strengths for parents by promoting positive interactions. The child's sociability levels were also evaluated through the EAS subscale since the situation of social isolation could cause profiles with high scores on this variable to experience confinement in a more negative way. In these cases, the iCygnus guidelines were aimed at channeling the need for social contact through online platforms or video calls.",

The cutoff points, both for the children and parents variables make it possible to dichotomize each subscale, which forms 18 different categories. In this way, specific guidelines were developed according to whether the child presented (1) or not (0) emotional problems, behavior problems, hyperactivity, or problems with peers, prosocial behavior, and sociability; and according to whether the parents presented (1) or not (0) positive parenting, inconsistent parenting, or punitive parenting.

The high prevalence found may be due to the effects of confinement and are in the same line as other studies that warn of the possible negative consequences of confinement in children [13, 39] . Although this higher prevalence is likely to represent an adaptive response of children to the situation they are living in depending on personal characteristics and context resilience factors [40, 41] , it is advisable to monitor the effect of confinement on children in the long term, since the early onset of internalizing and externalizing problems, together with the experience of traumatic episodes, considerably increase the risk of serious behavior problems and mood disorders in adolescence and adulthood [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . For this reason, the guidelines sent from the iCygnus tool placed special emphasis on offering parents strategies to help their children promote their emotional regulation, since this variable is a protective factor for the development of behavioral problems in the future [43] .",

The data obtained from this study indicate that there are no statistically significant differences between the comparison groups of boys and girls in the different age groups. These results are similar to those found in other investigations [45] , and although they may seem surprising in the context of the pandemic, our data indicate that the mean sociability in all comparison groups is approximately 17 points, with a maximum score of 20 points. That is, parents who consult the iCygnus tool report having highly sociable children, so they have received specific guidance to help their children channel their personal relationships in the new context of the pandemic. Regarding the differences in children's age and gender, it was determined that, in the group of boys vs. girls up to 5 years old, there is a greater presence of hyperactivity and a lower level of prosocial behavior than in the girls. Furthermore, in the 6 to 12-year-old stage, a significant difference also exists regarding behavior problems in boys compared to girls. The differences between boys and girls in internalizing and externalizing variables varies throughout their development. Our data supports previous research indicating that, around the age of 4 years, boys tend to show more externalizing symptoms than girls.
