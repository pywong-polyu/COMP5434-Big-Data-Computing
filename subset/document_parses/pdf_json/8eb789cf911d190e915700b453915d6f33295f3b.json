Some may be experiencing early symptoms of illness, yet still are not seeking assessments due to fear of the virus or lack of access to oncology providers. Depending on cancer type and location, a delay of six weeks in most cases is problematic but surmountable; a delay of six months may lead to stage progression and dramatic increases in death rates in cancer [1] . The number of people who die as a result of these delays could end up rivaling or exceeding deaths due to COVID-19. Adding to this potential crisis are the increased burdens being placed on health systems and medical providers which will impede their ability to provide timely and optimal care.",

The causes of any increase now appear to be more nuanced based upon geography. The reductions in new cases appear to be more due to social distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and public health measures such as lockdowns and contact tracing. Even in those places where there is current respite from the ravages of the virus, there may be a major aftershock that could throw the health systems into further crisis: a flood of patients with other illnesses who are much sicker than they would be had they not delayed visits to their doctors for fear of coronavirus exposure. Healthcare executives and policy experts should focus on serving this potential \"third wave\" of patients; otherwise, the exuberance from having \"flattened the COVID-19 curve\" may be short-lived. Stopping COVID-19 is critical. It's also essential to plan for the coming wave of patients who may be suffering from untreated cancer.",

            "text": "Cancer screenings, diagnosis, and treatment are being delayed. While certain tumors are indolent and slow growing, others are aggressive and call for early treatment. A recent UK modeling study concludes, \"Our estimates suggest that, for many cancers, delays to treatment of 2-6 months will lead to a substantial proportion of patients with early-stage tumors progressing from having curable to incurable disease.\" [3] Additionally, a related UK based group has calculated that a 3 to 6 month delay in cancer surgery will have an average loss of life years gained of 0.97/2.19 LYG per patient [4] . While delays may be inevitable, optimizing treatment through use of available evidence will minimize adverse outcomes. Also of major concern is the impact of the pandemic on the cancer research enterprise, with the near-total cessation of clinical trial activity during the early phase of the pandemic in the US. Estimates suggest that patient enrollment in oncology trials has deteriorated by 10% each month, since the pandemic began [5, 6] . What has emerged, however, are a number of improvements to the logistics and operations of many research programs, such as the implementation of streamlined trial activation processes, remote investigational drug delivery, remote patient consenting, and virtual patient monitoring, among others [7] .",

Based on their experience during the SARS outbreak in 2003, they have established goals for treatment completion in each tier and have established intra city cooperation among surgeons to expedite surgery and treatment [9] . A multi institutional group of urologic oncologists from Europe and the US has evaluated evidence for worsening outcomes from delays in various urologic malignancies and provides evidence-based guidance for timing of treatment of patients with specific urologic malignancies [10] . At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) in Houston, disease teams have developed treatment guidelines to prioritize safe and optimal oncologic therapeutic decision-making for vulnerable populations [11] [12] [13] [14] . By leveraging its national cancer network, MDACC has facilitated the care of its patients with collaborative health systems within its network. This has allowed patients to continue with therapeutic interventions, surveillance care and maintenance on clinical trials, thus minimizing high-risk travel during the early phase and peak of the pandemic.",
