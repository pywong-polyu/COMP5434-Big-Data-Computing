Guangfa Wang, an expert on COVID-19, reported that he developed red eyes several days before the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 10 A retrospective study tested conjunctival samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 30 infected patients, and the conjunctival samples from one patient were positive for the viral RNA on 3 days after onset. 11 The fact that our patient developed acute viral conjunctivitis with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in conjunctival swab samples indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could indeed cause ocular complications but not necessarily in the early stage of illness. ACE 2 (ACE2) is a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. 12 Given that ACE2 has also been detected in the human retina, 13 vascularised retinal pigment epithelium choroid 14 and conjunctival epithelia, 15 further clinical studies are needed to more fully evaluate the clinical spectrum of ocular diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

More viral RNA in conjunctival sacs (inversely related to Ct value) 9 was detected 13 days after onset, soon after the symptom onset of acute conjunctivitis. Conjunctival specimens obtained on illness days 13, 14, 17 and 19 showed a trend toward decreasing levels of viral RNA.

This case report highlights the necessity to further understand the full spectrum, duration and natural history of ocular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform clinical treatment and affect precaution practices. Our case confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 led to ocular complications, but not in the early stage of infection. On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival specimens might represent a source of spread, particularly with higher viral loads at the acute stage of ocular complications. On the other hand, the conjunctiva might not serve as an ideal site for sampling for early diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of virus infectivity specifically within ocular tissues would facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in the eyes.",
