            "text": "Objective. To evaluate the midterm longitudinal changes in chorioretinal structures in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 . Methods. irty-four eyes of 17 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. e patients underwent retinal and choroidal imaging upon the recovery (baseline) after 1 and 3 months. Retinal measurements in fovea, parafovea, and perifovea were recorded. To calculate choroidal vascularity index (CVI), luminal and total choroidal areas were measured using Sonada's method. Choroidal thickness was measured at the subfovea 500 microns temporal and nasal to the fovea. Results. Mean CVI was 0.64 \u00b1 0.04 at baseline that significantly increased to 0.67 \u00b1 0.05 (P \ufffd 0.012) after 1 month and again significantly decreased to 0.63 \u00b1 0.05 after 3 months (P < 0.001). While the stromal component showed a significant decrease between the baseline and first-month values (1.16 \u00b1 0.29 to 1.01 \u00b1 0.27, P \ufffd 0.03), the luminal area mostly changed between months 1 and 3 (2.03 \u00b1 0.28 to 1.91 \u00b1 0.23, P \ufffd 0.045). e average of subfoveal choroidal thickness and retinal thickness remained unchanged. Conclusion. CVI is increased in patients with COVID-19 1 month after recovery from COVID-19 and returns to baseline values after 3 months. Regarding the reversible nature of changes, there might be a prominent role in inflammation.",

Recent study by Agarwal and associates proposed that CVI can serve as a more stable index to show the changes of the choroid in comparison to subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) since CVI is less affected by physiologic variables like axial length, age, intraocular pressure, and systolic blood pressure [16] . Also, CVI has less variability than SFCT. On the other hand, the choroidal structure is mainly vascular and ocular pathologies that affect the choroid work through vascular changes [20] . To better elucidate the vascular changes of choroidal tissue, CVI can be a more direct surrogate marker than measuring SFCT.",

However, immune reaction of the endothelium has been proposed as the underlying cause [28] . However, the comparison of choroidal vasculature with pulmonary capillaries is not directly possible because of the different regulatory mechanisms governed in each tissue. Still, the enlargement of choroidal capillaries could be considered as the background event of increased CVI. e present study is limited by the small sample size and lack of healthy controls in each follow-up. However, the longitudinal evaluation of the choroidal structure, the use of CVI as a biomarker in the choroid, and the simultaneous assessment of retinal structures are among the strengths of the present study.",
