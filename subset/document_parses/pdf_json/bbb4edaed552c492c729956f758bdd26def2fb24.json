As part of a longitudinal project, children in the study had been diagnosed at a young age, resulting in a homogeneous sample. In this editorial we focus less on the study itself than on the approach used by its authors. As is the norm in the qualitative methods landscape, no p values are in sight. Such a rarity in these pages warrants using this contribution as a springboard for discussion.",

When we are, the literature we read seldom comes from the journals in our field; most of us do not read qualitative works on a regular basis. A quick look at Pubmed shows that in 2000 there was a single published report under the keywords (\"child and adolescent psychiatry\") AND (\"qualitative research\") OR (\"qualitative study\"); in 2001 and 2002 there were none. It is only since 2015 that ten or more articles have been published each year, with a steady increase since then, up to a modest 43 by 2021. Why has our discipline been disconnected from qualitative approaches for so long, and why is it slowly starting to change only now?",

Among philosophers, Plato wanted to engrave at the entrance to his academy, \"Let no ignorant of geometry enter here\". In the eighteenth century, Pascal contrasted in his Pens\u00e9es \"the spirit of finesse\" with \"the spirit of geometry\": on one side, the understanding of the world in its complexity and shades; on the other, the clear-cut representation of reality by abstract and formal concepts reducible through mathematics. By the nineteenth century, scientific disciplines continued to experience tensions of the kind: Auguste Comte, at the origins of the positivist perspective, suggested that the sciences should be conceived as the study of an external and objective reality made out of matter. Tangible matter can in turn be modified by forces subject to universal laws, such as those of Newtonian physics. In turn, Wilhelm Dilthey argued that Comte's position was not relevant when the object of research was human beings. More precisely, he considered that nature can be explained, whereas mind can only be understood: \"we explain through purely intellectual processes, but we understand through the cooperation of all the powers of the mind activated by apprehension\" [1] . Formal and quantitative approaches are relevant to the natural sciences, but human complexity cannot be fully grasped through them.",

Instead, its usual sources of information include in-depth interviews, focus groups, video tapes, written materials: words, and the non-verbal cues related to them (e.g., body gesture, silences). Data analysis does not rely on statistics but on a \"hermeneutic circle\" in which meaning has to be contextualized within cultural, historical, and literary givens, where the whole can only be understood through its parts, and its parts through the whole [2] . In practice, one or more investigators code meticulously all pieces of the materials collected. Through successive iterations, sometimes with the help of software, these codes are grouped into categories that help generate consensual interpretations within the group of researchers. There are many qualitative analytic strategies [3] . Among the most relevant to CAP are: (1) Grounded Theory (GT), which addresses the context in which social actors interact and seeks to develop an overarching theory of the phenomena studied; (2) Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), which aims to understand the subjective experience of people; and (3) Thematic Analysis (TA), focused on the interpretation of patterns of meanings. As sentient beings, we are part of the reality we seek to describe. In that tradition, rather than considering our own views as bias, we can fruitfully incorporate them as part of an exercise in reflexivity. At a practical level, the objective/positivist tradition can be mapped on to quantitative methods; the interpretivist/constructivist, to qualitative methods; and the two synergized when combined into mixed methods designs [4] .",

From the time of Pinel to the work of Freud and beyond, psychiatric investigators have relied on patients' narratives. Talking with patients has been central to psychotherapeutic interventions. Qualitative approaches and their optimal fit to deal with spontaneous offerings and unstructured materials-and to grasp patients' intimate experiences-should thus have an important place in psychiatric research. The increased complexity of child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) makes the approach all the more relevant: children cannot be considered outside their familial and cultural contexts and developmental trajectories. To paraphrase Winnicott, there is no such thing as a baby, only a \"nursing couple\". However, and all too curiously, qualitative research has been marginalized at best, dismissed at worst. Why is this the case, and why might we be taking a turn?",

As a result-and not as a cause-scientific publications become increasingly technical. The precision of statistics, numbers, and p values convey scientific authority. Figures and graphs present the readers with what they are asked to believe. In the words of Latour, \"the question is no longer to believe, it is to see\" [5] .",

First, it focuses on children; second, it deals with mental health; and third, its history involves psychoanalysis.

Despite overwhelming evidence for their return on investment when compared to later allocation of funds, young children's needs are given smaller financial support [6] .

Nevertheless, the mind resists facile explanation through these scientific means, yet CAP has fallen prey to the belief in a hierarchy of medical disciplines, with those related to single organs the most valued.

We consider that despite sharing similar roots with philosophy, sociology, or anthropology in thinking deeply about words and their meaning, as psychiatrists we have snubbed interpretivist ways of knowing in our effort to prove ourselves biological folk, as \"real\" scientists, unlike those caricatured analysts of yore.

This in turn presents a challenge to assess qualitative studies: reviewers may be caught off guard by works belonging to such a different epistemology, an alternative way of knowing. In turn, qualitative researchers are often frustrated when reading comments about their work, the wrong lens through which to assess qualitative findings: \"How did you justify your (small) sample size?\", \"Where is your control group?\", \"How can you generalize your results and determine they are reproducible?\", or \"What is the level of evidence of your findings?\".",

Thomas Insel, former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, concedes in a recent book that \"Nothing my colleagues and I were doing addressed the ever-increasing urgency or magnitude of the suffering millions of Americans were living through-and dying from.\" Allen Frances, a leading American psychiatrist, considers \"[t]he end result of these last 30 years an exciting intellectual adventure, one of the more fascinating pieces of science in our lifetimes, but [one that] has not helped a single patient\". These provocative statements are likely to be extreme but converge in promoting innovation that is closer to the granularity of patients' lives, to their unique perspectives and needs.",

We believe that less quantity and more quality can help us meet those aspirations.",
