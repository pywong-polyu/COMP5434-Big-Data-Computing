            "text": "Public perceptions and sentiments play a crucial role in the success of vaccine uptake in the community. While vaccines have proven to be the best preventive method to combat the flu, the attitude and knowledge about vaccines are a major hindrance to higher uptake in most of the countries. The yearly coverage, especially in the vulnerable groups in the population, often remains below the herd immunity level despite the Flu Awareness Campaign organized by WHO every year worldwide. This brings immense challenges to the nation's public health protection agency for strategic decision-making in controlling the flu outbreak every year. To understand the impact of public perceptions and vaccination decisions while designing optimal immunization policy, we model the individual decision-making as a two-strategy pairwise contest game, where pay-off is considered as a function of public health effort for the campaign. We use Pontryagin's maximum principle to identify the best possible strategy for public health to implement vaccination and reduce infection at a minimum cost. Our optimal analysis shows that the cost of public health initiatives is qualitatively and quantitatively different under different public perceptions and attitudes towards vaccinations. When individual risk perception evolves with vaccine uptake or disease induced death, our model demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the dynamics of vaccination and exhibits an increase in vaccine uptake. Using numerical simulation, we also observe that the optimal cost can be minimized by putting the effort in the beginning and later part of the outbreak rather than during the peak. It confers that public health efforts towards disseminating disease severity or actual vaccination risk might accelerate the vaccination coverage and mitigate the infection faster.",

            "text": "Public health department of every country faces several challenges-economical, infrastructure, epidemiological, political and social-to prevent and control influenza every year. Among these, individual or patient-level perceptions about vaccinations are paramount. Despite the flu awareness program each year by the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza vaccination coverage among high-risk groups has nonetheless been declining in a number of countries, especially, in the WHO European Region in recent years (Jones 2012) . Local beliefs, lack of trust in the health care system, misperception about the probability of infection, indigenous health practices to avoid or treat influenza and such other factors result in low vaccination coverage (Bukhsh et al. 2018; Strelitz et al. 2015) . Individuals decide vaccination only when they perceive high levels of risk from disease; otherwise, they are more likely to evade vaccination, even if vaccines are available at the beginning of the outbreak (Arda et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Shahrabani and Benzion 2010; Seale et al. 2010; Baguelin et al. 2013; Shim 2013) . A recent study by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA, found out persistence of many barriers to vaccine acceptance in public including healthcare workers (HCW)-some of which may include limited understanding of influenza and immunization recommendations, indications of greater subgroup recognition of the value of flu vaccination, continued resistance to vaccinations, and overestimation of the effectiveness of non-vaccine measures, and many other religious misperceptions (Nowak et al. 2015) . This, however, incurs a huge economic burden on the nation. Previous experience such as (H1N1, 2009) pandemics has demonstrated substantial health and economic loss across the world (Donaldson et al. 2009 ). According to the WHO estimates, worldwide annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths (Danielle Iuliano et al. 2018; GBD 2018) .",

            "text": "Classical game theory provides a framework to understand such strategic interactions between epidemiology and human vaccinating behaviour under voluntary vaccination policy. Behaviour-prevalence models based on evolutionary game theory have shown how 'herd immunity' can lead to 'free-riding' behaviour in voluntary vaccination game. Studies have considered the evolution of strategies through imitation dynamics to show how successful strategies are adopted by members of the population (Bauch 2005; d'Onofrio et al. 2012; Bhattacharyya and Bauch 2012, 2011; Galvani et al. 2007; Reluga et al. 2006; Reluga 2010; Reluga and Galvani 2011; d'Onofrio et al. 2007 d'Onofrio et al. , 2011 . On the other hand, there are ample modelling works that highlight on the dynamic vaccination during seasonal influenza and pandemic (Bowman et al. 2011; Baguelin et al. 2012; Mercer et al. 2011; Basta et al. 2009 ), considering strategic allocation of vaccination such as the time when and how long vaccination should be continued, identifying specific age class in population, optimal distribution of vaccines for minimizing infection and severe outcomes from it such as deaths or hospitalization (Bowman et al. 2011; Matrajt and Longini Jr 2010; Patel et al. 2005; Verriest et al. 2005; Gaff and Schaefer 2009; Medlock and Meyers 2009; Lee et al. 2012; Ullah et al. 2012) . Such works, in a more theoretical context, characterize the complexity of dynamic vaccination, frame as an optimal control problem and solve the optimality system indicating its type and possible singularities. However, optimizing public health effort (such as publicizing vaccination and media coverage of infection) under voluntary vaccination and incorporating human vaccination behaviour during an influenza outbreak remain elusive. A recent work by the same authors, in simpler framework, incorporates human decision-making in the optimal budget allocations for controlling infectious disease (Deka and Bhattacharyya 2019) .",

To understand the impact of timedependent public health effort on minimizing the disease burden in the population, we also incorporate the effect of awareness campaign by public health agency in the utility of vaccination game using different functional forms. Applying Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) on the prevalence-behaviour model, we observe that under different functional forms, model exhibits qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns in the epidemic outbreak and optimal cost due to public health effort. The dynamics of vaccination and disease intimately depends on individual risk perceptions that influenced by information such as current vaccine coverage or disease induced death. A numerical simulation of the model also highlights that optimal cost from infection is much higher when there is a delay in initiating the control effort in the beginning. On the contrary, policymakers may reduce the allocation of budgets during the peak of the outbreak or when there is high death or hospitalization rate, and yet the disease burden will not escalate. The perceived risk of vaccine and infection evolves over time, and therefore, understanding the strategic interplay between individual behaviour and disease dynamics informed by perceived vaccine and disease costs during such voluntary involvement may guide policymakers to reduce the cost and their effort in controlling a disease outbreak.",

This equation may be interpreted as imitation dynamics in vaccination decision. It may be assumed that individuals randomly sample other members of the population during the decision and imitate their strategies provided it gives them a higher pay-off, where the parameter k is the sampling rate (Bauch 2005; Reluga et al. 2006) .",

For example, the peak size increases and peak timing shifts towards left with the increase in basic reproduction ratio (R 0 ). Figure 2a depicts an increase in basic reproduction ratio R 0 from 2 to 4, the peak of the outbreak moves towards the left (200 to 100 days). In contrast, if we incorporate behavioural aspect of individuals in the model, it is observed that the peak of the outbreak is conserved even for different values of basic reproduction ratio R 0 from 2 to 4. Figure 2b illustrates that the peak of the outbreak is within the same time interval, i.e. first 30 days. This can be attributed to individuals risk perceptions and vaccination decision. Advance and early vaccination becomes more common as R 0 increases. Individuals experience a higher force of infection with increased R 0 and hence will seek vaccination early during the onset of the outbreak. This works as a feedback mechanism to keep the peak timing unchanged: higher R 0 stimulates more individuals to adopt advance or early vaccination to fend off infection, which, in turn, counteracts the effect of higher R 0 by delaying the epidemic peak.",

Here, we have used different functional forms to simulate the model that how public health effort during an epidemic may act as an incentive for individual decision-making in vaccination. Among four different incentive functions-exponential, quadratic, hyperbolic and square root-we see that exponential and quadratic are more effective, as the peak size is lowest, vaccine uptake is higher, and the underlined optimal cost is minimum (Fig. 3) . In contrast, hyperbolic and square root functional forms exhibit less impact on reducing the infection, and optimal cost is also very high compared to the other two functional forms. The linear function defines Bang-Bang control, which we discuss in Supplementary Information (Sect. S1). Thus, different forms of public perceptions and attitudes towards healthcare service may bring interesting qualitative difference in the dynamics of disease outbreak and may incur different optimal public health costs in disease management. To experiment more on these qualitative and quantitative differences and their dependence on the sensitivity parameter \u03be and disease transmission parameter R 0 , we simulate the model Eq. (7) and plot the cumulative incidence, optimal control, total cost and daily proportion of vaccinators under different values of \u03be , and R 0 . Higher \u03be defines that the individuals are more sensitive towards public health measures. Figure 4 shows the effect of variations in R 0 and the sensitivity parameter \u03be . Higher R 0 increases the cumulative infection, which increases the optimal public health effort and cumulative cost for controlling the disease. The interesting observation is that the daily proportion of vaccinators (x) increases only when there is enough sensitivity from the public health officials. As the parameter \u03be increases, the daily proportion of vaccinators also increases. The results highlight that policymakers should be very sensitive and give optimum effort to inform the public about the severity of the disease, when the actual risk is very high. Here, we demonstrate the plot (Fig. 4) Table 1 Fig. 4 Dynamics of disease and vaccination of the optimal control model (7) under different values of R 0 and \u03be (sensitivity of public health towards disease prevalence). The control function is taken as hyperbolic: (t)). a Cumulative infective, b daily proportion of vaccinators, c cumulative effort from public health and d cumulative cost (absolute value). Here, the parameter regimes are \u03b7 = 0.95, r v = 0.00001, r I = 0.01, k = 4.

But, if everyone tends to delay vaccination at the beginning, ultimately the herd immunity level is never achieved. When no individual goes for vaccination, the disease prevalence rapidly increases and an outbreak emerges. On the other hand, when the infection reaches its peak, individuals may tend to go for vaccination, because it gives a higher pay-off as opposed to the non-vaccinator strategy.

In the non-behavioural model, we assume that vaccine uptake rate proportionately increases with the public health effort u(t) irrespective of disease prevalence. We consider two scenarios in each case: (1) Fig. 6 , where the policymakers delay from 1 to 20 days in providing the effort in the beginning, whereas (2) Fig. 7 , where the policymakers do not initiate any effort for even number of days ranging from 2-20 days during the peak of outbreak, (1-10 days on either side of the peak of the outbreak). Our analysis shows that under a gametheoretic approach, policymakers should be proactive at the beginning of an outbreak. Fig. 6 Analysis of our model with initial delay in release of effort from public health. Delay from the public health could be due to unavailability of vaccine at the onset of the outbreak or due to insensitivity owing to low disease prevalence (see Fig. 5 for reference). The control function for behaviour model is taken as square root. a Cumulative control, b cumulative cost (absolute value), c cumulative infection. Here, the parameter regimes are R 0 = 4, r v = 0.00001, r I = 0.01, k = 7, \u03be = 0.9, \u03b7 = 0.95.

The interesting observation is that the optimal effort and cumulative cost for disease management increase as the initial delay increases from the public health ( Fig. 6a and b) . However, the scenario is opposite in case of public health effort with gap-both optimal effort and total cumulative cost (13) where the perceived risk of vaccine declines with increased uptake. Here, \u03b4 (0-15) is the sensitivity to decline perceived risk of vaccine and \u03be is the sensitivity parameter for control of public health. Higher \u03b4 indicates that the perception of the vaccine risk is declining exponentially. Higher \u03be (0-0.6) implies that public health effort is more proactive.

This difference in the dynamics observed as the initiation of public health effort, in the beginning, increases the daily vaccination level in such a high level. The high vaccination uptake, in the beginning, feeds back on the disease prevalence and reduces the incidence level for future, which all together keeps the incidence level similar even if the number of days without control increases during the peak. In contrast, it is observed that the optimal cost and the disease prevalence both are increasing in the non-behavioural model, in either of the delay or gap in the public health initiatives during the outbreak period. This indicates that initiation of public health effort during beginning and late of the outbreak is much more cost-effective than delaying in the beginning, when behavioural interaction is taken as a component of the vaccination dynamics. Hence, our results illustrate that understanding individual vaccinating behaviour is an important component that should be included in public health policy decision-making to control and manage a outbreak.",

The vaccine has not been used earlier, and nothing much has been known regarding its safety and impact. Under these circumstances, individuals perceived vaccine risk is much higher initially. We have assumed that initially, the perceived risk of the vaccine is (r v = 0.01) which is much higher than the perceived risk of infection (r I = 0.001). Table 1 With increasing daily vaccinators, the perception of the vaccine risks declines as it spreads the information in the population about vaccine safety. The parameter \u03b4 defines the sensitivity of reduction due to increase in the vaccination coverage. Figure 8 shows that when the parameter \u03b4 increases from 0 to 15, i.e. the perceived risk of vaccine declines, so vaccination coverage increases (8b). As a result, the cumulative number of infective also declines (8a). A similar trend in the dynamics of cumulative effort (8c) and in the total cost of managing the disease (8d) is also observed. This demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the model-more people vaccinate, more news of vaccine safety spreads in the population, and this increases the incentives of vaccinations for others and so cumulative vaccine uptake increases. A similar trend in the qualitative dynamics is observed when decline of risk is assumed as linear function of the cumulative vaccine uptake (Fig. S5 in Supplementary information). This, however, signifies the role of public health during the outbreak-they need to act at the beginning of the outbreak, and disseminate information about vaccine safety through more media coverage-rather than putting their effort during the peak.",

Increased death from infection works as an incentive for an individual for vaccination. Figure 9 shows the influence of increased death rates (0.0001-0.01). As shown in Fig. 9b , there is a significant increase in the daily proportion of vaccinators, and lowest new incidence when there is highest death rate (d = 0.01) from the disease. The interesting observation lies in the optimal dynamics of public health effort (Fig. 9c) . It shows that public health program can even delay in the start, while there is death from disease included in the pay-off gain of individual interest ( Fig. 9c and d) . However, the optimal effort is substantially high in the case of the lowest death rate and so is the total cost from infection and public health effort. So, this result essentially echoes the same what we have described in the last section that dissemination about disease severity at the beginning of the outbreak is way more effective to increase the vaccine uptake, rather than in the middle of the outbreak.",

But the safety of the vaccine and its associated perceived risks, particularly, in case of a new vaccine, have led to the failure of vaccine uptake (Reluga et al. 2006; Bauch et al. 2010) . Under voluntary vaccination, there is always a strategic interaction between individuals whether they decide vaccination or not. Hence, the vaccination coverage depends upon the magnitude of disease prevalence, attainment of herd immunity and the safety of the vaccine (Tchuenche et al. 2011; Bauch et al. 2010; Bhattacharyya and Bauch 2011) . Our research highlights that incorporating vaccinating behaviour in disease control models may help policymakers to predict, understand and even reduce the public health cost to manage influenza every year. Analysis of our game-theoretic model illustrates the optimal allocation of public health effort under different public perceptions. It shows that optimal solutions of vaccination model are significantly different under different public perceptions. Not only this, but also model analysis suggests that policymakers should optimally allocate budget for advertisement and promotion of the vaccine, at the beginning of an outbreak which will validate the safety of the vaccine. Individuals who delayed and refused vaccination were more likely to have concerns on vaccine safety and perceive minimal benefits associated with vaccines. Policymakers may assist providers in responding to individuals who may delay or refuse vaccines. Vaccinating a considerable fraction of the population before a pandemic or seasonal outbreak could significantly bring down the transmission rate. This, however, could be an uphill task for the policymakers due to continuous evolution in virus strain, and particularly relevant to seasonal influenza. More media coverage about vaccine safety, disease severity, even through a social network may increase the visibility of benefits and accelerate the mitigation of epidemics.",

There are certain assumptions we have made in developing our model. We have assumed a deterministic model in the spread of the disease dynamics, but the demographic structure is heterogeneous, and therefore, the behavioural structure may also vary within the population. So, developing an age-specific model may be more realistic in such cases. In this work, we do not identify any vulnerable group in the pop-ulation who are at high risk from the infection. In order to make the optimal allocation of limited vaccine supply, policymakers have to target a specific group of population such as children, old people, sick and pregnant women. Targeting populations in the seasonal vaccination would affect the infection rate and also the mortality.",

Under this circumstance, it remains a challenge to model and find the impact of vaccination behaviour and find the social optimum coverage to mitigate the infection. Lastly, we have assumed the perceived risk of vaccine declines exponentially with increasing uptake of the vaccine. Similarly, we have also considered a linear function for the death rate to characterize its influence on individual perceived risk. However, there are no such data available in the literature in our knowledge. So, a scenario analysis with a different type of functions might worth to understand the influence of behaviour and its impact on vaccine uptake in the population. ",
