            "text": "Vaccine trials conducted during epidemics of emerging infectious diseases provide an important opportunity to test the safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates. Increasing our ability to quickly and accurately understand the impact of a vaccine candidate in the urgent setting of an outbreak is critical for enhancing public health response. The use of the ring vaccination strategy in the Ebola \u00e7a Suffit trial during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak highlighted the importance of developing innovative designs for trials conducted during an ongoing outbreak. 1 It also underscored the need to think through trial design and analysis strategies in advance in order to expedite the rollout of a vaccine trial once an outbreak starts and to identify the best methods for obtaining high quality efficacy estimates in outbreak settings. 2 Multiple components of vaccine efficacy can be estimated from a vaccine trial. 3 Individually randomized controlled trials (iRCTs) estimate vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES), the direct effect of the vaccine on vaccinated individuals. 3 If reducing susceptibility to infection is the only effect of the vaccine, then this measure, combined with information on contact network structure and pathogen transmission dynamics, can be used to estimate the total effect of a vaccination program, a combination of the direct and indirect (i.e. herd immunity) effects. Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEI), the reduction in onward transmission from a vaccinated person who is infected compared to an unvaccinated infected person, is another important measure for understanding the impact of a vaccine. 3 Even if a vaccine does not protect everyone who is vaccinated from getting infected, its impact on infectiousness for those who are vaccinated but nevertheless become infected plays a critical role in both outbreak dynamics and also cost-effectiveness of a vaccine program. The significance of understanding interventions' effects on future transmission is exemplified by the efforts of HIV treatment-as-prevention programs to reduce patients' viral loads to undetectable levels in order to prevent onward transmission. 4, 5 In order to estimate VEI, the vaccination status of infectors must be known. VEI is therefore potentially measurable in household studies 6, 7 and partner transmission studies, such as HIV vaccine trials 8 because in these settings, infector-infectee pairs can be identified (by assuming that household members or partners are the infectors), and thus the vaccination status of infectors is known. However, VEI is not currently identifiable in population-level vaccine trials, such as those often conducted during an infectious disease outbreak, because the transmission network, and consequently the vaccination status of infectors, are typically unknown.",

At the conclusion of a vaccine trial, the ratio of the proportion of people infected by vaccinated individuals to the proportion of people infected by controls is a product of both the vaccine's effect on susceptibility to infection and its effect on infectiousness among those who are infected. With knowledge of who infected whom, using the ratio of infector vaccination status, we can therefore calculate VE # : We simulate a compartmental network model of an outbreak, together with a vaccine trial, the details of which have been previously described. 25 Individuals are grouped into communities, with many connections between individuals in the same community and fewer between individuals in different communities. Introduction of infection into the network occurs at a time-varying rate, and the disease natural history in the communities follows a stochastic susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model, with Ebola-like parameters (Table 1) . Each individual has a daily probability of infection from their infectious contacts in the network. Individuals are enrolled into an iRCT, with 50% randomized to vaccine and 50% to control. The vaccine's efficacy against susceptibility to infection is \"leaky\", with 60% efficacy (VES = 0.60), meaning upon each exposure, the vaccine reduces a vaccinated individual's chance of infection by 60%. The vaccine's efficacy against infectiousness is 30%, meaning infectiousness among infected vaccinated individuals is 30% lower than among infected unvaccinated individuals (VEI = 0.30). Table 2 shows the number of infections expected for each type of infector-infectee pair from the trial simulations.",

VEI is important for fully understanding and modeling the impact of a vaccine and both sequence and contact tracing data have the potential to allow us to estimate VEI in large individually-randomized controlled trials conducted during an epidemic. Previously, this estimate was only attainable from household and partner studies.

We find that while sequence and contact tracing data have the potential for enabling estimation of VEI, misclassification of the trial status of infectors due to imperfect reconstruction of the transmission network leads to bias towards the null of VEI estimates and overall limits our ability to detect an effect of the vaccine on infectiousness. Given the consistent direction of the bias, if an estimate is obtained in a trial using the methods described here, it is expected to be an underestimate of the true VEI. The approaches using the top cluster of most likely infector(s) identified from the deep sequence shared variants and hybrid data perform the best of all of the methods using sequence data alone and remain the most accurate method when contact tracing data are incorporated. If deep sequencing data are not available, relying on contact tracing data becomes even more important. The substantial improvement in the estimates when restricting to contacts further underscores the importance of contact tracing for reconstructing transmission networks.",

[22] [23] [24] The intuition of this approach is that the pathogen population within an infected host is not composed of identical genomes, but contains some polymorphisms (depending on the population size and the mutation rate). If the transmission bottleneck is sufficiently large, more than one of these genotypes may be transmitted, and the finding that individuals share the resulting polymorphism is then a likely indication of transmission. The methods described here will therefore have variable efficacy for different pathogens. For example, influenza has a high mutation rate, 9 so there is likely sufficient phylogenetic signal and within host variation to support reconstruction of the transmission network and estimation of VEI. Initial genomics analyses of SARS-CoV-2 found a low mutation rate; 30 recently, however, there is evidence of minority variants detectable by deep sequencing, 31 suggesting deep sequencing approaches have the potential to be used in ongoing vaccine trials to estimate VEI.",

We also assume complete and correct sampling of sequence data (which in turn means that everyone in the community is a participant in the trial, as we assume, or at a minimum is followed up in the trial), full knowledge of the contact network, and complete contact tracing.

Despite these simplifying assumptions, this work highlights the potential for existing data sources to be used in the midst of an outbreak to estimate a key measure of vaccine efficacy. It further identifies the data sources that will lead to the most accurate estimation and can thus be used for better targeting of the limited resources available for data collection in the midst of an epidemic. The median VEI estimates from 500 simulations with the baseline parameters, with a true VEI of 0.3. \"None\" refers to simulations that use only sequence data, without incorporating any epidemiologic information from the network. \"Restrict to contacts only\" restricts the analysis of sequence data to potential infectors who are contacts from the network.",
