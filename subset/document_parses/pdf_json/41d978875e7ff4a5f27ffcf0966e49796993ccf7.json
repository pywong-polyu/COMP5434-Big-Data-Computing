            "text": "This review aimed to assess the quality and content of recommendations for delivering an autism diagnosis, published internationally within clinical practice guidelines. Seventeen relevant guidelines were identified. When methodological information was provided, recommendations for feedback were predominantly formed through consensus. Recommendations consistently included who should attend feedback, the timing and mode of delivery, the clinician's manner, and what should be discussed and/or included in an accompanying report. Specific recommendations were not consistent however, and a number of gaps were identified, such as the inclusion of educators and educational specific recommendations. Although individual variation is necessary for autism diagnosis disclosure, agreement on minimum standards of practice is warranted. Further investigation is required to establish best practice.",

Behavioural characteristics of autism can vary in nature and severity between individuals and within the same individual across their lifespan (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013; Williams et al., 2014) . Intellectual and language abilities also differ between individuals (APA, 2013; Klopper, 2017; World Health Organisation [WHO] , 2018) and attention, behaviour and mood difficulties frequently co-occur (Klopper, 2017; Simonoff et al., 2008) . This range of features can impact the presentation of autism in an individual, adding complexity to assessment and diagnosis. In the absence of biological indicators, autism is defined and diagnosed based on reported and observed behaviours and relies on the clinical judgement of experienced clinicians (Rogers et al., 2016; Ward et al., 2016) .",

Numerous autism assessment guidelines have been published by government jurisdictions and professional associations (Penner et al., 2018) . However, recent reviews of the quality and content of these guidelines revealed inconsistencies pertaining to all aspects of the autism diagnostic assessment, including whether autism must be diagnosed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT), the composition of the MDT and the time frame for completion of the assessment (Hayes et al., 2018; Penner et al., 2018) . Variations and ambiguity also exist around other recommendations relating to the key elements of the assessment, including the choice of diagnostic tools and the classification system to utilise. Appraisals also identified variability in the identification and synthesis of empirical evidence supporting the recommended diagnostic practices and little guidance in relation to their applicability to health services associated with autism (Hayes et al., 2018; Penner et al., 2018) . Notably, reviews to date have not focused on the recommendations for the feedback of diagnostic assessment results to families and/or the individual themselves.",

The first communication of a child's developmental disability diagnosis can be an enduring memory for parents (Hasnat & Graves, 2000) and, all too often, a distressing and overwhelming experience (Hennel, 2016; Mulligan et al., 2012) . Parents have reported being able to distinguish between their personal reactions to the diagnosis itself, and their reactions to how the diagnosis was delivered (Fallowfield & Jenkins, 2004) . Only half of the families surveyed expressed satisfaction with the way their child's autism diagnosis was disclosed (Brogan & Knussen, 2003; Crane et al., 2016) . Families have described issues relating to the structure, style and content of their autism assessment feedback session (Abbott et al., 2013) . Crane et al. (2016) indicated the information provided at feedback and the clinician's manner can influence parents' overall satisfaction with the entire diagnostic process. Potter (2017) reported fathers described frustration related to the \"insufficient information\" (p. 95) provided to them at feedback, as well as the lack of support offered to them afterwards.",

Only five guidelines provided information regarding the methodology and evidence quality used to form these recommendations. The majority of the recommendations for feedback were based on the opinions of the development groups, with most of these guidelines reported finding limited to no evidence, or evidence of \"very low\" (NICE, 2017, p. 120) to \"fair\" (NZ, 2016, p. 7) quality to support them. The quality of the information produced by an expert panel is dependent on the information inputs and methods used to reach the consensus (Jorm, 2015) . When experts are informed by professional experience, as well as high quality information such as the results of systematic reviews or randomised controlled trials, the quality of the consensus results increases (Jorm, 2015) . Likewise, a formal method of reaching consensus, such as the Delphi method, is more likely to produce a true reflection of the opinions of the entire group (Hohmann et al., 2018; Jorm, 2015) . Few guidelines within this review reported using consensus agreement of expert opinions, and only one utilised a formal, but different, method. Similarly, many relied heavily on the professional background of the guideline development groups to inform recommendations for feedback. Formal consensus methods can produce higher quality evidence and are well suited to producing health guidelines (de Meyrick, 2003; Jorm, 2015) , however the methods used to form recommendations for feedback within these guidelines were of a low standard, and therefore should be interpreted with caution.",

Similarly, none of the guidelines published after 2013 specifically mentioned discussing adaptive functioning, despite \"clinically significant impairment in social, occupational or other areas of current functioning\" being a requirement for autism diagnosis according to DSM-5 criteria (APA, 2013). These factors influence a child's functioning in the present and potential for functioning in the future (Kanne et al., 2011; Kraper et al., 2017) . Therapeutic and educational training for individuals with autism is increasingly focusing on improving adaptive behaviours and participation as per the International Classification of Functioning framework (World Health Organization, 2007) , making it important to discuss a child's adaptive functioning at feedback. Additionally, without explaining how these areas of functioning and ability impact all children, including those with autism, families may find it difficult to completely understand their child's presentation.",

Guideline development groups may have found it difficult to provide details around which topics are most important to discuss at feedback, as this may vary depending on the child. Parents have reported wanting more information from the diagnosing clinician (Hennel et al., 2016; Potter, 2017) and have found it challenging to identify evidence based information when forced to conduct their own research online (Adler et al., 2015) .

Second, although a research librarian was consulted to construct search terms and minimise the possibility of missing guidelines, and multiple authors screened and appraised guidelines, and consulted on data extraction tables, only the first author extracted data for the review, which may have resulted in unintentional biases. A third limitation of this study was the adaptation of the AGREE-II tool to consider all questions in the context of assessment. This adaptation means scores for domains three, four and the overall measure may not be directly comparable to the AGREE-II scores (Brouwers et al., 2010) generated in other studies. There is also no validated cut-off score or pattern of domain scores established for the AGREE-II to differentiate between high and poor quality guidelines (Brouwers et al., 2010) . As per the recommendation of the instrument developers, we interpreted scores using categorisation of domains similar to another recently published study (Amer et al., 2019) .

It is highly probable that there are currently great practice variations across clinicians from all settings, due to the lack of clear and detailed guidance regarding feedback, and that many families may currently be receiving less than optimal feedback. Before assessing current practice and making recommendations for improvement, it is imperative we establish what best practice involves. In a similar manner to other research into the disclosure of diagnoses of dementia (Lecouturier, 2008) and Down syndrome (Sheets et al., 2011) , establishing specific guidelines for feedback of an autism diagnosis, using formal methods of reaching group consensus between expert clinicians and informed by high quality empirical evidence, could be the first step in greatly improving clinicians and family's experiences.",

Detailed guideline recommendations could initially be used to train and assess clinicians working within local settings, and if successful outcomes resulted, this information could be used to inform international guidelines and training programs across the worldwide autism community.

The variations are likely due to the fact that the majority of recommendations for feedback were created based on the expert opinions of the respective guideline development groups and the limited empirical research that exists within this area.

The CDDS (2002) guideline suggested the communication style of the clinicians should be considered and to avoid a large number of clinicians being present at feedback as this may overwhelm families, however did not quantify a \"large number\" (p. 71).
