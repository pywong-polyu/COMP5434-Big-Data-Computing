            "text": "There is an urgent need for robust and high-throughput methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in suspected patient samples to facilitate disease management, surveillance, and control. Although nucleic acid detection methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the gold standard, during the current pandemic, the deployment of RT-PCR tests has been extremely slow, and key reagents such as PCR primers and RNA extraction kits are at critical shortages. Rapid point-of-care viral antigen detection methods have been previously employed for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Therefore, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in patient samples could also be used for diagnosis of active infection, and alternative methodologies for specific and sensitive viral protein detection should be explored. Targeted mass spectrometry techniques have enabled the identification and quantitation of a defined subset of proteins/peptides at single amino acid resolution with attomole level sensitivity and high reproducibility. Herein, we report a targeted mass spectrometry assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein in a relevant biological matrix. Recombinant full-length spike protein and nucleoprotein were digested and proteotypic peptides were selected for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) quantitation using a high-resolution Orbitrap instrument. A spectral library, which contained seven proteotypic peptides (four from spike protein and three from nucleoprotein) and the top three to four transitions, was generated and evaluated. From the original spectral library, we selected two best performing peptides for the final PRM assay. The assay was evaluated using mock test samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions, added to in vitro derived mucus. The PRM assay provided a limit of detection of \u223c200 attomoles and a limit of quantitation of \u223c 390 attomoles. Extrapolating from the test samples, the projected titer of virus particles necessary for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein detection was approximately 2 \u00d7 10 5 viral particles/mL, making it an attractive alternative to RT-PCR assays. Potentially, mass spectrometry-based methods for viral antigen detection may deliver higher throughput and could serve as a complementary diagnostic tool to RT-PCR. Furthermore, this assay could be used to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in archived or recently collected biological fluids, in vitro-derived research materials, and wastewater samples.",

So far, nucleic acid tests and antibody detection assays have been employed for the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic assays preferentially target the S and nucleocapsid (N) genes, the nonstructural RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and replicase open reading frame 1a/b genes. 1 In SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected patients, the most reliable samples for detection via RT-PCR are nasal and pharyngeal swabs, and sputum/mucus, but not blood samples. 2, 3 Indeed, in one study, only 15% of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia had detectable RNA in serum. 3 While principally satisfying the requirements for rapid sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic tests, the deployment of RT-PCR tests has been extremely slow, especially in the U.S. and parts of Europe, and key reagents such as PCR primers and RNA extraction kits are at critical shortages to enable wide-screen testing of the general public, requiring hundreds of millions, if not billions of tests in a very short period of time. As alternatives to the detection of the viral genome through molecular amplification, serological tests, which detect antibodies to SARS CoV-2 in blood samples, have been developed. Unlike RT-PCR tests, immunoassays that target immunoglobulin M and G (IgM, IgG) host responses are less susceptible to sequence erosion due to genetic drift. Knowledge of individuals who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have produced antibodies would be crucial information to guide necessary quarantine strategies and determine accurate mortality rates. However, because of the delay of antibodies generated in SARS-CoV-2-infected humans, serological testing for antibodies will not be of use to prevent disease spread during an outbreak. 4 Rapid point-of-care viral antigen detection methods have been employed previously for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, 5 and have most recently been developed for coronaviruses, but are plagued by the lack of specificity and sensitivity.",

Continuously improving targeted MS instruments and methodologies have enabled the identification and quantitation of a defined subset of proteins/peptides at single amino acid resolution with attomole level sensitivity and high reproducibility. 7, 8 This approach has the potential to quantitate over 1000 proteins in a single analysis, including isoforms, and is, therefore, far superior in terms of specificity and multiplexing capability to conventional protein measurement methods, which rely on immunoaffinity [i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)]. Furthermore, the extendibility of targeted proteomic MS assays to the analysis of newly discovered proteins can be accomplished in a convenient and extremely time-efficient manner. For this reason, targeted MS is gaining popularity as a promising clinical diagnostic tool in a wide variety of disease conditions such as cancer 9,10 and cardiovascular disease 11 and can also be used to monitor the levels of proteins that are targets of therapeutic treatment. 12 While preliminary studies have indicated feasibility, 13,14 the potential for the application of targeted MS has not been fully explored for infectious disease diagnostics.",

A recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-protein monomer was produced using HEK93 cells in-house and a recombinant NP was purchased. To select optimal candidate peptides for PRM quantitation, the proteins were digested with Lys-C/trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using nLC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap instrument (Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid) using DDA. For the S-protein, peptides covering 84% of the protein were detected, and 17 glycosylation sites were characterized. A second digestion test was performed with trypsin and chymotrypsin to enhance the Figure 2 . Schematic of the workflow used to develop a PRM assay for the detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 spike and NP (A) PRM assay development was performed using recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike protein and NP. Proteotypic target peptides/transitions were selected to generate a spectral library in Skyline.

D depth of sequence coverage and detection of glycosylation sites across the molecule. After identical nLC-MS/MS analysis, 97.1% sequence coverage was achieved, and five additional glycosylation sites were confirmed ( Figure 3 ). Therefore, our data validated a previous report of 22 total glycosylation sites present on the native trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. 24 This coverage was achieved only after performing an analysis capable of identifying large nontryptic glycosylated peptides (Byonic). For NP, after Lys-C/trypsin digestion, 77.2% coverage was achieved and one phosphorylation site was identified (S176), which has been previously reported. 25 Based on this extensive sequence coverage and peptide response, we developed a list of tryptic peptide targets for subsequent PRM analysis, and obtained isotopically labeled standards for each peptide. A spectral library was generated, which included seven peptides (four from S and three from NP) and the three to four top transitions for each and their heavy counterparts (Table S1 and Figures S2 and S3) . The inclusion list contained iRT peptides, mucin 5AC, and 5B peptides for data alignment and digestion controls (see Tables  S2 and S3 ).The peptides targeting S are unique to SARS-CoV-2. The NP-targeted peptide GFYAEGSR has 100% homology with SARS-CoV-1, while ADETQALPQR has 90% homology and DQVILLNK has 87.5% homology. Although these peptides/transitions showed the most robust response in our assay, there are potentially many other peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 S and NP sequences that would be satisfactory for accurate targeting.",

To determine the realistic LOD and LOQ for a targeted MS analysis, the proteins of interest should be analyzed in a relevant complex biological background. 17 This helps to identify at an early stage of the method development, matrix effects and other interfering analytes that could potentially reduce detection of the target peptides. Therefore, we next performed a dilution series of the digested recombinant S and NP (3 amol to 12.5 fmol) with the addition of iRT peptides in a digest background containing in vitro derived mucus. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were obtained from bronchial biopsy specimens and cultured under ALI conditions to generate in vitro derived mucus, which was used for this purpose. 26 We reasoned that nasal secretions may provide the best biological sample for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection and, therefore, a mucus sample would offer a relevant biological background. We also performed a \"reverse\" experiment in which the concentration of the isotopically labeled peptides was varied from 3 amol to 25 fmol, while the light peptide concentrations remained fixed at 12.5 fmol. The samples were subsequently analyzed by nLC\u2212 MS/MS on a Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer using a 7 min separation gradient. Each dilution series was run on two separate days using three technical replicates. Using the sum of the peak areas from the four best transitions, we constructed calibration curves. PRM allows the MS/MS sequence Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article confirmation of each peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein simultaneously while monitoring peptide/transition levels for quantitation providing high specificity. Peptides were ranked based on the linear response, precision of the calibration curves obtained on different days, and agreement between the H/L and L/H ratios as determined from the \"reverse\" experiment (see Table S4 ). From the original spectral library, the best performing peptides for NP were (DQVILLNK: aa 348\u2212355) and (ADETQALPQR: 376\u2212385) and the top peptides for S were (NIDGYFK: 196\u2212202) and (FQTLLALHR: aa 238\u2212 246) (Figures S7, S10, and S11) . The linear response and adjusted r 2 values of the calibration curves of the selected target peptides were between 0.995 and 0.986 over a concentration range of 3 amol to 12.5 fmol (Table 1) . These four peptides also exhibited the lowest retention time shift (Figures S4\u2212S6. ). Of the poor performing peptides, GFYAEGSR gave inconsistent results especially at the low end of the calibration curve likely because of the fact that it contains a labile phosphorylated serine (see Figure S12 ).",

            "text": "To further evaluate the selected peptides as good targets for S and NP quantitation, we evaluated the missed cleavages associated with each of the four selected candidate peptides. Using the data from the dilution series, the percentage of the intensity area for the target peptide was compared with different missed cleavage forms. Although this method does Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article not consider ionization efficiency differences, it would allow us to evaluate a high number of potential missed cleavages, which may lower quantitation accuracy. As shown in Figure S6 , there was a prominent missed cleavage peptide found for ADETQALPQR (KADETQALPQR), which accounted for almost 30% of the total intensity observed for the tryptic peptide; therefore, we eliminated this peptide as a good target for our assay. A recent report by Gouveia et al., which evaluated 101 SARS-CoV-2 peptides for targeted analysis also detected many missed cleavages around these peptides, as well as low human-virus interspecies conservation, making them a potential mutational hot-spot. 27 The peptide NIDGYGFK from S exhibited 18.9% of total intensity from missed cleavages and, therefore, also was not selected as a good target. The best performing peptide targeting SARS-CoV-2 NP in a mucin background was DQVILLNK (Table 1, Figure 4A ). We detected evidence of four missed cleavages for DQVILLNK, but they only accounted for 8.9% of the total intensity observed ( Figure S6 ). This peptide provided a calibration curve with an r 2 of 0.995 with LOD and LOQ values of 195 and 390 amol, respectively. FQTLLALHR was the best performing peptide for S. This peptide exhibited more variability in the dilution series (r 2 = 0.986), but the calibration curve also returned an LOD of 195 amol and LOQ of 390 amol (Table 1, Figure 4B ). FQTLLALHR exhibited a very low missed cleavage % signal rate (0.21%), which was confirmed in the report cited above. Interestingly, this peptide also has high intraspecies conservation. 27 Validation of PRM Assay and Feasibility of Detection for SARS-CoV-2 S and NP in Mock Viral Samples. We next evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 PRM assay by creating a mock test sample, which contained in vitro derived mucus spiked with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virions. A stock culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was inactivated using a denaturing buffer and heat. This material was spiked into the mucus samples at two different volumes to create low and high virus mock samples. A control sample containing no virus material was also evaluated. This material was digested on three separate days and run in triplicate to evaluate reproducibility of the method. Using the calibration curve from the best performing peptide for NP (DQVILLNK), the low and high SARS-CoV-2 mock samples contained on average 227 and 422 amol of NP, respectively, on column (see Figure 5A ). The low virus sample result is only slightly above the LOD for this peptide of 195 amol, and the high virus sample average is above the LOQ of 390 amol. Control samples indicated a moderate level of interference, which was well below the LOQ. The level of variability observed in the low virus mock sample was acceptable over the three days (CV = 8.1%). A higher level of variability was observed between the three biological replicates in the high virus mock sample (CV = 24%). The intraday variability for this peptide was low for both the low (CV = 2.1%) and high (CV = 11.7%) mock virus samples (see Table S5 ).",

            "text": "Our results indicate that attomole sensitivity is achievable for these SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a complex background containing mucus using our PRM technique. In order to determine, if the level of sensitivity obtained in the PRM assay will be adequate to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S and NP in real clinical samples, we first needed to consider the titer of the SARS-CoV-2 viral stock we used for the mock samples. After inactivation, the viral titer of the inactivated virus material was \u223c9.3 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/mL. Recent reports have indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal-derived swabs ranges from 1 \u00d7 10 4 to 1 \u00d7 10 10 copies RNA/mL, while the viral titer in saliva samples ranges from 1 \u00d7 10 5 to 1 \u00d7 10 11 copies/mL as determined by RT-PCR. 28 Copies/mL can be compared to virus particles/mL because each virus carries one copy of the RNA sequence amplified and detected. If we consider that each of the mock samples represents a volume of original virus stock diluted in mucus in a total reaction volume of 150 \u03bcL, we can extrapolate the representative titer for each sample. For example, the low virus sample contained 3.125 \u03bcL of material from the original SARS-CoV-2 stock, which contained 9.26 \u00d7 10 6 particles/mL. Therefore, before S-trap processing, this sample represented a titer of 2 \u00d7 10 5 particles/ mL in the original mucus containing sample. Likewise, the high virus sample contained 8 \u00d7 10 5 particles/mL. Therefore, our PRM assay should have adequate sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 in samples with a titer above \u223c2 \u00d7 10 5 particles or copies/mL. Because that is the lower range of the observed titer from saliva and nasal swab samples, this bodes well for future clinical applications for PRM-based diagnostic applications. Furthermore, viral S-protein or NP shed at the site of infection and collected in the nasal swab or mucus sample could potentially contribute to the total protein level available for detection. Finally, considering that the inactivation step, which was required for the safe handling of the viral sample in our laboratory, was not optimized for the final PRM assay, it is feasible that a PRM-based assay can deliver the level of sensitivity necessary for the detection of authentic virus at titers below 2 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL. Of the two peptides, we selected for the final assay, FQTLLALHR from the spike protein is unique to SARS CoV-2, while DQVILLNK from NP shares 87.5% aa homology with SARS-CoV-1. Additional peptides could be added to the PRM assay, which are specific for SARS-CoV-1, thereby making the assay discriminatory between the two viruses.",

The PRM assay we have developed employs a processing and digestion time of approximately 4 h and a short 7 min gradient. To facilitate sample throughput, automated preparation of samples for processing anddigestion could be performed in a 96-well plate format. Thus, the turnaround time for the PRM assay could match that of RT-PCR based tests. SARS-CoV-2 NP has also been detected in diluted gargle solutions from infected patients using nLC-MS/MS. 30 Although a 3 h gradient was needed for detection, the use of an easily collected gargle or saliva solution would be advantageous for creating a high-throughput assay.",

Additionally, this assay could be used to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in archived or recently collected biological fluids or in vitro derived research materials. The PRM assay could also be exploited to evaluate viral contamination in environmental samples, such as sewer and waste water, because of the inherent higher stability of peptides than viral RNA. Future development of the PRM assay in a saliva background may also prove useful as it would allow patients to self-collect samples and send them to reference labs for testing. Potentially, MS-based methods could serve as a complementary diagnostic tool to RT-PCR and may deliver a higher throughput with increased safety because the virus can be fully deactivated at the site of collection without sacrificing the ability to detect antigens. Considering the current slow pace of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the difficulty in obtaining RNA extraction materials and PCR primers, antigen detection methods should be explored for the development of rapid point-of-care assays. Therefore, studies that estimate viral protein antigen levels in clinically relevant samples such as this also have value in ascertaining if rapid test paradigms such as lateral flow immuno-assays would have adequate sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.",
