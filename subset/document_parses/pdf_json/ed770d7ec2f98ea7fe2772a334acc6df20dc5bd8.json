We propose a program evaluation framework to measure policy spillover effects and apply that framework to study the governmental responses to COVID-19 in the United States. Our analysis suggests the presence of social spillovers. We estimate that while state closures directly reduced mobility by 3 to 4%, all other states locking down further decreased mobility in the focal state by 8 to 14%. Similarly, while reopening directly increased mobility by 2 to 3%, all other states' reopening increased mobility in the focal state by 12 to 21%. Our analysis also suggests geographic spillovers: Travel from locked down origins to open destinations increased by 12 to 29%. In contrast, travel from reopened origins to locked down destinations decreased by 6 to 7% for nearby counties and by 14 to 18% for distant counties. Despite its limitations, we believe that our approach takes the first steps toward creating a framework for interdependent program evaluation across policy domains.",

This interconnectedness means that the policies enacted by one governing body affect outcomes beyond the area in which the policy is expected to have a direct effect (1) . For instance, previous studies have identified the presence of both geographic and social spillovers in contexts such as voting, crime reduction, and physical exercise (2) (3) (4) . As the world continues to grow more interconnected, program evaluation methods need to be systematically expanded to assess the effectiveness of policies that exhibit meaningful spillover effects.",

In the early months of the pandemic, countries around the world imposed strict limits on human mobility by banning gatherings, closing down nonessential businesses, and instituting shelter-in-place orders. Although human mobility levels were already decreasing before the enactment of such policies (5, 6) , these measures further reduced the spread of the virus (5-9) and led to lower morbidity and mortality rates. These policies had effects beyond the counties or states in which they were implemented. These spillover effects need to be explicitly considered, as they can have profound policy implications. For instance, Holtz et al. (10) found that cross-county spillovers from shelter-in-place policies exceeded the direct impacts of local policies, underscoring the importance of governmental coordination to reduce a potential \"loss from anarchy\" due to piecemeal implementation of closure policies across regions.",

Although most of the research is not causal (13, 15) , the more causally rigorous studies (14) neglect the magnitude of a policy's spillover effects relative to its direct effects and do not account for non-travel-related social spillovers. If reopenings cause substantial increases in mobility and exhibit strong spillover effects, then countries that reopen without national coordination could face substantial difficulty in controlling the resurgent spread of the coronavirus and future pandemics. Furthermore, understanding whether the effects of closures and reopenings are symmetric or asymmetric is important in determining the optimal adaptive policy in response to the ebbs and flows of local COVID-19 case rates.",

We use these data to measure the direct causal impacts of a state's COVID-19 closure and reopening policies on its own mobility patterns; the causal spillover effects of other, socially connected states' closure and reopening policies on a state's mobility patterns; and the impacts of both origin-and destination-county closure and reopening policies on cross-county mobility, capturing the travel-related spillover effects created by uncoordinated policies implemented across different states and counties. In doing so, we contribute to a growing literature that uses populationscale digital trace data (16) to study the impacts of mobility-related interventions in response to COVID-19 and what makes them successful (5, 17) . Researchers have shown, for example, that demographic attributes (18) , political partisanship (19, 20) , broadband access (21) , belief in science (22) , and information exposure (23, 24) moderate compliance with social distancing policies.",

            "text": "Our empirical methodology is grounded in a reduced form econometric approach called difference-in-differences (DiD), which is widely used across economics, political science, and public health for policy evaluation. One of the key identifying assumptions of DiD is the \"parallel trends\" assumption, which states that in the absence of the policy being studied, the time series trends for units that enact the policy (treated units) and those that do not (untreated units) would move in parallel. This assumption is often tested by verifying that the treated and untreated lines move in parallel before the policy intervention in question. Figure 1A shows the time series trends for the four human mobility measures we track, each of which is constructed using data provided by SafeGraph: the daily average number of locations visited by mobile devices, the proportion of devices traveling more than 2 km, the proportion of devices that spend over an hour away from home, and the proportion of devices leaving home. The trend lines for each outcome suggest that in our context, the parallel trends assumption is credible. For DiD to yield unbiased causal estimates, the timing of the treatment also needs to be (conditionally) exogenous. To, as well as is possible, account for potential endogeneity in the timing with which different states enacted different policy interventions and also to make our DiD models robust to deviations from the parallel trends assumption, our DiD models control for weather, COVID-19 case counts, COVID-19 deaths, and unemployment levels using daily temperature and precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (25) , daily COVID-19 case and death counts from the New York Times, and unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

            "text": "Our state-level data on closure and reopening policies come from the COVID-19 U.S. State Policy Database (26) . During our observation period, different U.S. states implemented a number of different policies, including bans on large gatherings; closures of businesses such as gyms, movie theaters, and restaurants; and shelter-in-place orders with varying degrees of strictness. To create sufficient statistical power to identify causal effects, we collapsed the many different policy interventions into three general classes of policies based on their level of restrictiveness and identify the \"periods\" during which different states are subject to these policy types. The policy types we analyzed are as follows: \"initial policies\" (ip), which covers the set of moderately restrictive policies from when a state implements its first closure policy of any kind until it implements a shelter-in-place order; \"shelter-in-place\" (sh), which covers the more restrictive statewide shelter-in-place orders or stay-at-home orders; and \"reopening\" (ro), which covers various reopening plans. We also replicated our main results using an alternative middle policy period definition that accounts for a broader set of \"movement restriction\" policies, as opposed to just shelter-in-place and \"stay-at-home\" orders (see section S4.3). In all of our analyses, we interpret the effect of the initial policies as a weighted sum of the causal effects of many different mobility-curbing interventions implemented by states across the United States at different points in time, the effect of shelter-in-place as the causal effect of implementing some type of shelter-in-place order, and the effect of reopening as the causal effect of enacting some type of reopening plan. It is worth noting that collapsing COVID-19-related mobility policies into these three broad classes prevents us from measuring the causal effect of any specific policy (e.g., banning indoor dining at restaurants) but enables our causal estimates of direct and indirect policy effects nationwide. The timing with which different U.S. states entered different policy periods is shown in Fig. 1B . Many states implemented their initial policies in mid-March, during which all four mobility measures were falling (see Fig. 1A ). Mobility continued to fall during late March and early April, during which most states implemented some sort of shelter-in-place order. States began enacting reopening plans in late April and continued doing so through early June. During this period, mobility levels rose gradually until they returned to the same levels observed before March.",

Throughout the paper, we adopt language from the networks literature and refer to the state whose mobility levels we measure as the \"ego\" state and refer to the states to which it is connected as that state's \"alter\" states. To construct the weighted set of counties to which a given county is connected, we combined Facebook's \"Social Connectedness Index\" (SCI) (27) , which uses an anonymized snapshot of the Facebook social network to provide a measure of the intensity of social connectedness between geographic locations, with county-level census population estimates to create a population-weighted SCI. The larger the value of this index for a given ego-alter county pair, the larger the fraction of ego county Facebook friendships that are with people in the alter county. More details on the construction of the population-weighted SCI can be found in sections S1.3 and S1.4, and verification that our results are robust to alternative transformations of the population-weighted SCI can be found in section S4.2. Figure 2 shows choropleth map visualizations of the population-weighted SCI for three different ego counties (King County, WA; Boulder County, CO; and Suffolk County, MA) and each possible alter county. For a given ego county, the alter counties with the highest connectedness index are typically a combination of nearby counties and far away counties with large populations.",

In this model, our estimates of the direct effects of each type of policy on human mobility remained quantitatively and qualitatively consistent with the estimates obtained from the no spillovers model (see the top row of Fig. 4 ). Our estimates of the spillover effects caused by different mobility-related policies are found in the bottom row of Fig. 4 . The spillovers model suggests the existence of spillovers caused by social distancing policies, shelter-in-place orders, and reopenings. The leftmost column shows that according to the spillovers model, when the ego county's alter states began implementing initial social distancing policies, ego county mobility dropped by 6.1 to 8.2%, depending on the mobility outcome used. Furthermore, the middle column shows that according to the spillovers model, when an ego county's alter states implemented shelter-in-place, ego county mobility dropped by another 8.3 to 11.7%. Last, the rightmost column shows that according to the spillovers model, when an ego county's alter states began reopening, ego county mobility increased by 12.1 to 21.4%. All of these effects account for the ego counties' policies and estimate the additional effects of alter states' policies on ego mobility. Figure 5 shows the results from a cross-state travel DiD model that measured the effect of origin-and destination-county policies on travel from the origin county to the destination county. The top row shows the effects on the number of devices traveling from the origin county to the destination county, whereas the bottom row shows the effects on the proportion of devices traveling from the origin county to the destination county. Overall, these results show evidence plausibly consistent with the existence of travel-driven policy spillovers. The right column shows the effects of the destination county implementing different policies. We found that when a destination county was subject to a statewide shelter-in-place order, it received 2.3 to 6.8% less cross-state traffic, depending on the outcome metric used (see blue points). In contrast, being subject to a statewide reopening plan increased cross-state travel to destination counties by 4.2 to 5.4%. In addition to communicating overall effects (blue points), Fig. 5 also communicates the heterogeneous effects of origin-and destination-county policies for distant pairs of counties (orange points) and nearby pairs of counties (green points). We observe notable levels of heterogeneity; for instance, we estimate that destination counties in distant pairs being subject to statewide reopenings increased cross-state travel by 4.5 to 5.3%, whereas destination counties in nearby pairs being subject to statewide reopening plans increased cross-state travel by 8.2 to 9.9%. Insofar as we observe differences in the effects of origin and destination policies across our two outcome variables, we believe that this is due to the fact that the proportion of origin devices traveling to the destination county is bounded between zero and one, whereas the number of devices traveling from the origin county to the destination county is much more highly dispersed. Counties in which there are many origin county devices therefore have much more influence on our \"number of devices\" estimates.",

The second column from the left shows that when origin counties were subject to their own initial policies, the enactment of destination policies did not appear to measurably affect cross-state mobility. However, we estimate that when origin counties were subject to a shelter-in-place order (second column from the right), travel to distant counties that were subject to initial distancing policies decreased by 5.6 to 11.2% (orange points), whereas travel to nearby counties that were subject to initial distancing policies increased by 29.0 to 29.6% (green points).

Our study contributes to an emerging literature on the impact of COVID-19 reopening policies (13) (14) (15) and, to our knowledge, is the first to attempt to causally estimate the magnitude of reopening policy spillovers, to explicitly estimate crossstate travel spillovers due to reopening, and to compare estimates of the causal effects of reopening to estimates of the causal effects of related interventions, such as shelter-in-place orders and other policies aimed at curbing human mobility. That said, this work has a number of limitations. First, there are limitations associated with the data we used to conduct our analyses. Although the SafeGraph panel is sufficiently large to minimize concerns about sampling error, it may exhibit sampling bias as mobile device ownership varies considerably by age and income (28) . While SafeGraph has shown that their panel is geographically consistent with the U.S. Census population estimates (29), it is not clear whether certain demographics are over-or underrepresented, as no devicelevel demographic data are collected by SafeGraph. Although it is reassuring that we find similar results when using mobility data provided by Facebook as a robustness check (see section S4.1), there are concerns about the representativeness of Facebook's data as well.

We encourage follow-up work on both of these fronts. Accounting for disputes between states and localities will likely enable more accurate assessments of the impact of state-level policies. For example, such disputes may have affected the extent to which state-level policy interventions effectively limited mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, while it is widely believed that reductions in mobility drive reductions in new infections and their associated deaths (30) , rigorously establishing the causal chain from cross-state spillovers to infection rates and deaths is beyond the scope of this paper. Our analysis also does not explore the impacts of specific reopening policies (e.g., resuming restaurant dine-in service or lifting gathering restrictions) and instead measures the average causal effects of different \"types\" of policies, as defined through \"policy periods,\" on human mobility.",

With regard to the quantification of uncertainty, although our results remain statistically significant when calculating adjacency-and cluster-robust standard errors (SEs) and when conducting Fisherian randomization inference (see sections S4.5 and S4.6), it is possible that there is still correlation structure in the assignment of our treatment variables that we do not properly account for.",

Our investigation of potential anticipatory or lagging behaviors (see section S4.4) suggests that the parallel trends assumption is plausible in our setting. However, conditional exogeneity of treatment timing is more difficult to verify. Although our analyses make use of a robust set of controls, it is possible that both our ego policy \"treatment\" and our alter policy \"treatment\" suffer from endogeneity. The fact that our ego state policy estimates do not meaningfully change after the inclusion of alter state policies is encouraging, but our estimates of ego state policy effects may yet be confounded by unobserved, time-varying factors that affect both ego state policy enactment and mobility. For instance, COVID-19-related (mis)information shocks may affect both state-level policy and human mobility.

It is also possible that our spillover analysis suffers from what epidemiologists refer to as \"the ecological fallacy\" (33), as we are unable to observe and analyze human mobility outcomes for the specific subsets of people in a given ego county that are socially connected to each possible alter county. When applied in the context of COVID-19-related mobility interventions, our analysis framework suggests that local social distancing or shelter-in-place orders may only have limited effectiveness and that the totality of the policies implemented by \"peers\" is approximately three times more effective at reducing mobility compared to the local policy alone. If our causal estimates are accurate, then they indicate that such policy contrasts may create scenarios in which closure policies are counterproductive (34, 35) , as those living in locked down regions may travel to reopened regions, potentially causing new COVID-19 hot spots to emerge.
