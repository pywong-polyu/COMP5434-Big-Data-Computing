We identified and sequenced a novel sarbecovirus (RhGB01) from a British horseshoe bat, at the western extreme of the rhinolophid range. Our results extend both the geographic and species ranges of sarbecoviruses and suggest their presence throughout the horseshoe bat distribution. Within the spike protein receptor binding domain, but excluding the receptor binding motif, RhGB01 has a 77% (SARS-CoV-2) and 81% (SARS-CoV) amino acid homology. While apparently lacking hACE2 binding ability, and hence unlikely to be zoonotic without mutation, RhGB01 presents opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecovirus homologous recombination. Our findings highlight that the natural distribution of sarbecoviruses and opportunities for recombination through intermediate host co-infection are underestimated.",

Currently, the natural hosts of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (family Coronaviridae; subgenus Sarbecovirus) 2 , the causative agents of SARS and COVID-19 respectively, are thought to be horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), with the zoonotic spillover process involving one or more intermediate hosts, during which time viral mutation, recombination and/or amplification could have occurred 3-7 . Phylogenetic analyses of novel horseshoe bat sarbecoviruses in China have shown these to be most closely related to both SARS-CoV and to SARS-CoV-2 3,4,7 .

Faecal samples were collected from lesser horseshoe bats R. hipposideros during routine annual population monitoring surveys at three sites in August and September 2020 following approval by the University of East Anglia Ethics Committee and adhering to UK Government COVID-19 safety regulations in place at the time. Samples were either obtained from individual bats at the time of capture or from under-roost sampling. In Somerset (n = 20 bats) and Monmouthshire, Wales (n = 7) bats were captured using harp traps or mist nets placed near roosts or in woodland under government license. A faecal pellet was collected from each of 23 bats held individually in sterile holding bags and the other four samples were collected as anal swabs using rayon-tipped dry swabs (MW100; Medical Wire & Equipment), which were taken from bats that did not defaecate when captured. All bats were released at the site of capture immediately after sample collection. In Glouces- Figure 4 . Amino acid sequence and STAMP structural alignments of the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 compared to a predicted 3D structure of the RBD of RhGB01 highlighting structural differences in regions housing hACE2 contact residues for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Contact residues are described in the literature (black), with residues in red the most identified residues. Regions coloured in purple have high structural similarity (> 0.7) and residues with a low structural similarity coloured in red/white (< 0.3). BM48-31 is included as comparison to a second Sarbecovirus from a bat source. (A) STAMP alignment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB ID 6M0J) in the conformation of being complexed with hACE2 aligned with the RhGB01 RBD. The areas where structural similarity is low are seen to contain contact residues defined in the literature. (B) Sequence alignment of RhGB01 and SARS-CoV-2. The sequence used is identical to (C). (C) Sequence alignment of the RBM with 28 residues up and downstream, to facilitate the inclusion of K417. The coordinates provided refer the SARS-CoV-2 (NC_45512.2) residue position within the spike protein alignment. (D) STAMP alignment of SARS-CoV RBD (PBD ID 2DD8) aligned with the predicted RhGB01 RBD. The region highlighted in green are residues upstream and downstream of the structural alignment which do not align. (E) Sequence alignment of RhGB01 and SARS-CoV. (F) Sequence alignment of RBM with SARS-CoV contact residues highlighted, and the coordinates provided refer to the residue position for SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3) within the spike protein alignment. 28 residues are included up and downstream of the RBM to include V404. \u25c2",

Of these viral reads, 68% of reads (1668) were classified at species level to bat betacoronavirus BM48-31/ BGR/2008 (GenBank reference NC_014470.1) 32 . De novo assembly of the Illumina reads generated multiple contigs with homology to members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus as assessed via BLASTn; the largest single contig being ~ 7 kb. To investigate, further additional sequence data were generated using Oxford nanopore technology. Using the 562,461 nanopore reads with an average length of ~ 600 kb as scaffold, a hybrid assembly generated a single 29 kb contig similar to sarbecovirus genomes in both size and gene organisation (Fig. 1A,B) . To increase confidence in the assembly we performed further Illumina sequencing. With the increased depth, Illumina data alone were assembled into a contig of 21 kb, which was again further assembled to a 29 kb contig with the inclusion of the nanopore data in a hybrid assembly. Mapping all raw reads to this contig shows that Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:14723 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94011-z www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 0.97% and 2.37% map to the contig for Illumina and Nanopore respectively. In total, mean read depth along the assembly is ~ 25 \u00d7 for Illumina data and 20 \u00d7 for nanopore data. Combined depth coverage across the assembly is ~ 50 \u00d7, confidently supporting the presence of this virus, in the positive sample (Fig. 1C ).

By comparison it shares 79.78% nucleotide identity across 85% of the assembly with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/FL-CDC-STM-000005640/2021, MW586221.1).

It is possible that the infection prevalence was even higher and RT-PCR, which would improve sensitivity of detection, should be utilised to screen British bat samples in the future now a sarbecovirus has been detected in the UK. While other sarbecoviruses have been identified in rhinolophid bats in other European countries by polymerase chain reaction and partial gene sequence analyses, RhGB01 is only the second from Europe to be fully sequenced 43 , and the first from a lesser horseshoe bat. The only other full sequence betacoronavirus from a European horseshoe bat is BM48-31/BGR/2008 from R. blasii. Our results, therefore, extend the geographic and species ranges of SARSr-CoVs and suggest that sarbecoviruses are likely www.nature.com/scientificreports/ to be present throughout the range of the Rhinolophidae, which are distributed from Australia and Japan to Europe and Africa. The range of the lesser horseshoe bat extends from Western Europe to Central Asia, overlapping with those of other rhinolophid species, including the greater horseshoe bat (R. ferrumequinum), which ranges from Western Europe to Japan 44, 45 . Where they co-exist, the species can be syntopic allowing opportunity for cross-species virus transfer. Prior to our results, the observed and predicted (cut off \u2265 0.9821) number of coronaviruses in the greater horseshoe bat were 13 and 19 respectively, and in the lesser horseshoe bat these figures were zero and three respectively 46 . This suggests that the complement of Sarbecovirus species in horseshoe bats is greater than predicted so far, with the possibility of virus sharing across species and large geographic areas.",

Host specificity is dependent on the ability of a virus to attach to host receptors and enter host cells; a binding process facilitated by contact residues contained within the RBM 37 . RhGB01 demonstrates low amino acid homology to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBM compared to that between SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related bat (RaTG13) and pangolin (PCoV_GX_P4L) sequences identified in Asia 48, 49 . The low level of homology, lack of contact residues and structural differences compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 most likely indicate a lack of ability to bind hACE2 and, hence, RhGB01 is unlikely to be zoonotic without mutation. To experimentally validate the absence of hACE2 or other human cell receptor binding and to identify binding abilities to other mammalian ACE2 receptors, in vitro binding assays are required.",

            "text": "Aside from the variation observed in amino acid homology within the RBM, RhGB01 also exhibits variation within the furin cleavage site and ORF8 when compared to zoonotic sarbecoviruses. The absence of the furin cleavage site indicates the absence of enhanced efficiency of host cell entry observed with SARS-CoV-2 50 . However, RhGB01 does retain a similar motif responsible for cleavage in the S2' region by host transmembrane serine protease 2, also required for spike protein proteolytic priming for ACE2 attachment 47 . SARS-CoV-2 variants with a functional ORF8 are associated with greater pathogenicity, thought to be due to downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC 1), and thus a reduction in antigen presentation to CD8 + T www.nature.com/scientificreports/ lymphocytes which facilitates prolonged infection 51, 52 . The absence of ORF8 from the genome of RhGB01 suggests that this virus lacks these immune evasion properties. It has been postulated that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 evolved through mutation, possibly involving homologous recombination, during passage through at least one intermediate host; probably civets (viverrids) or mustelids for SARS-CoV 53,54 and possibly a species of pangolin for SARS-CoV-2 49 . In this way, the progenitor virus from the natural host (a species of horseshoe bat) gained genetic adaptations to allow successful infection of, and transmission between, human beings. Where there is opportunity for homologous recombination of sarbecoviruses through co-infection, there is the possibility of novel zoonotic emergence. Thus, co-infection of horseshoe bats with their natural suites of coronaviruses and with SARS-CoV-2 could lead to the development of novel zoonotic emergence. While there is a need to increase surveillance for coronaviruses in horseshoe bats across their range, and also in other bat species, especially those syntopic with, or closely related to, horseshoe bats (e.g. the Old World leaf-nosed bats, family Hipposideridae), it is also important that steps are taken to minimise opportunities of virus transmission between novel hosts.",

While the risk of reverse spill over of SARS-CoV-2 from researchers to bats and onward spread within bat populations has been shown to be medium to high 55 , it is the caring of sick or injured bats, in particular, that provides most opportunity for long-term close contact and virus transfer in either direction. Although the IUCN Bat Specialist Group has produced guidelines to minimise this risk 56 , the degree to which these are known or followed is unclear. Our findings highlight that the natural distribution of sarbecoviruses and opportunities for recombination through intermediate host co-infection are underestimated. Preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to horseshoe bats, with the risk this presents of further mutation, is of particular significance with the current roll out of a global mass vaccination campaign against this virus.
