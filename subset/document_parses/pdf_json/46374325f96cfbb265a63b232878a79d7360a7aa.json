This article seeks to discuss the potential for hidden \"prejudice\" should Artificial Intelligence (AI) gain a dominant foothold in healthcare systems. Using a toy model, this piece explores potential future outcomes, should AI continue to develop without bound. Where potential dangers may lurk will be discussed, so that the full benefits AI has to offer can be reaped whilst avoiding the pitfalls. The model is produced using the computer programming language MATLAB and offers visual representations of potential outcomes. Interwoven with these potential outcomes are numerous historical models for problems caused by prejudice and recent issues in AI systems, from police prediction and facial recognition software to recruitment tools. Therefore, this research's novel angle, of using historical precedents to model and discuss potential futures, offers a unique contribution.",

Germ theory was in its infancy and the plague was considered an \"Oriental disease\" (Morton Todd 1909) . This scapegoating was not new; Malaria, Smallpox and Leprosy were all placed at their door (Trauner 1978) . Racial prejudices justified such claims; the phrase 'yellow peril', coined at the time, demonstrated the supposed threat that Asian immigrants represented for European-American civilisation (Risse 2012) . In the 1870s, these racist arguments broadened as Chinatown grew. It was argued that their cheap labour undermined wage rates, their poor sanitation endangered the nation and they were 'inferior in organic structure, in vital force, and in the constitutional conditions of full development' (Trauner 1978: 70-72) . The result was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which dictated policy for the next sixty years. Popular racism enabled the maltreatment of the Chinese and explains how politicians could disregard the plague in Chinatown.",

In San Francisco in 1900, prejudice was present in multiple forms, demonstrated by numerous characters and its impact had life and death consequences for those on the receiving end. Also, this case study offers the first example, of many for this piece, of how such prejudice can trigger a negative feedback loop. That is, as the plague worsened, Sinophobia intensified, further limiting the response and allowing the loop to repeat. Unfortunately, over 100 years on, similar biases and feedback loops are emerging, only this time our technological creations have the potential to be biased. On various scales and in areas from recruitment to policing, bias could emerge and if unchecked could guide decisions worldwide.",

O'Neil acknowledges that human decision making can often be flawed but can also evolve, unlike automated systems which 'stay stuck in time until engineers dive in to change them' (O'Neil 2016: 203-204) . This inference that humanity's biases can sometimes be replicated in our technological creations also appears in Whitaker, Colombo and Rand's (2018: 10) findings: 'the distributed collective intelligence of machines is also a social endeavour, and it is potentially susceptible to prejudicial phenomena as seen in the human population'. Sismondo (2010: 9) agrees regarding this social side of technology, arguing that 'people act in the context of available technology'.",

To do this, it will focus on an area of the most pressing importance should such biases emerge: healthcare. Specifically, a toy model imagining an AI in control of a vaccination programme in the event of an epidemic will form the basis of this article. From this basis, the paper has an overarching narrative which is split into three sections (called stories) for structural reasons. While the scenarios discussed are strongly intertwined, they are tackled separately here to demonstrate the multiplicity of the dangers. The first proposes that this fear of the algorithm is an overreaction. It will proffer that the outcomes can be the same, no matter if the algorithm is altered, hence, there is nothing to worry about? In contrast, the second story observes how seemingly insignificant changes to the code and alterations to the datasets used can hugely alter the outcomes for individuals. Finally, the third story alters the dataset again to demonstrate the consequences when supposedly 'clear' instructions are written into AI systems and yet when the programme is allowed to run freely, deviation from these instructions can occur. Then, a discussion will draw together all these ideas from the toy model and reference real-life situations, including referring back to the example of San Francisco's Chinatown, to further enhance this paper's arguments.",

In fact, they note that 'simulation methods are prominent in planning and system/resource utilisation' which enhances the legitimacy of this paper's choice of modelling technique to effectively meet its target (Brailsford et al. 2009: 139) . Brailsford et al. (2009) demonstrate the sheer range of potential methods to be used but regarding the earlier suggestion of more complex alternative models, Weng et al. (2017) offer an excellent overview of some of the machine-learning models being used to help improve cardiovascular risk prediction. They looked at four different machine learning algorithms compared to an established algorithm that predicts future risk based on well-established factors such as cholesterol or smoking (Weng et al. 2017 ). On the other hand, the machine learning approaches can exploit 'big data' and the neural network model performed the best in their study (Weng et al. 2017) . Therefore, the two mentioned studies demonstrate the wider ranging and more complex nature of models currently at work in the 'AI in healthcare' field. However, they also evidence that for the scope of this paper, the simple stochastic network models used are ideal as suggestions of what could happen, and the use of features-even on this paper's smaller scale-is clearly a well-founded technique in this field.",

For example, over sixty-fives are one of the groups specified for the free flu vaccine in the UK (NHS UK 2019). 1 Similarly, Gupta et al. (2014) state that 'top-ranked influential spreaders need to be identified for targeted immunization' and that traditionally 'nodes with high centrality are considered to be the influential nodes'. Although they admit that many measures can be used for this 'centrality' parameter, they note that 'degree centrality', where each node is given an 'importance score based simply on the number of links held by each node' (Disney 2020) , is a popular choice (Gupta et al. 2014 ). More generally, in any network or population of people, every individual has a vast number of different attributes, including age and weight but also race and religion, or any number of medical conditions. These attributes could be linked to susceptibility and, like age for the flu vaccine, be used to classify or, in AI parlance, cluster individuals for the purposes of determining a vaccination policy Fig. 1 . Although, populations are not an unstructured, homogeneous wholes in which disease spreads out. They are heterogenous, structured by social connections, be they physical or virtual via social media. For this toy model, two types of parameter will be used as metaphors for all the various attributes of individuals in a population. The first will be referred to as health parameters, which for this toy model will be summarised by age and weight. The second are network parameters, which will be simplified to the edge degree of each node in the population (number of connections an individual has to others in the population).",

By social connection, this term was considered to imply a relationship through which a disease could be contracted and corresponds to the edge degree of each node. Of course, this is an idealised view of AI-based disease management. However, it does not detract from the essential point being made, that of the interactions and feedbacks between data, vaccination, and propagation of the disease.

Then, to replicate the situation detailed in Fig. 2 , the exclusion element of the model commences and is iterative and repeats after every timestep. The point being made here is that AI systems can continuously re-classify features. So that if, for some reason, data are omitted for a node, then this will impact or feedback, on clustering. Consequently, as the disease outbreak progresses so potential biases may emerge due to this feedback between the data, vaccination, and disease impact. For example, apps that collect exercise data would miss data for individuals who did not exercise because of illness. But that missing data would influence cluster membership, vaccination and, in turn, recovery from illness. Similarly, immigrants without papers or modern slaves would have no medical records or online presence. Therefore, they would not just be missing some data, they would have none and under this system of vaccination, they would always be excluded from vaccination. In the simulations, people who have been infected for a long time are excluded from clustering to illustrate the impact of this feedback on clustering. Whilst this model's outcomes may be simpler than reality, there are numerous parameters in Table 1 , some set and some chosen by the modeller, that can alter these outcomes. This 'toy model' was produced in MATLAB (Appendix 2 in Electronic Supplementary Material). The model is built around an adjacency matrix (Appendix 1 in ESM), which depicts the connections in the population through which a disease could be contracted and is read into the programme, from an Excel spreadsheet, at the outset. At the same stage, the population's features are also read into the model, (Appendix 1 in ESM). In fact, all the parameters noted in Tab. 1 are created before the iterative process begins in the model. Whether an individual becomes infected is a random process driven by the susceptibility probabilities. Therefore, the 100-timestep simulation is repeated 1000 times and the plots created in this work and the results discussed depict the summary statistics of all of these runs.",

The difference between the two depends on a variable called the 'seed', specifically an initial guess at the cluster centres. Simply, this parameter determines how the clustering simulation commences on each run. The first plots for each pairing use a fixed seed, meaning that for each of the 1000 runs of the model, the simulation will always start from the same clustering centres. On the other hand, the second plots use an updating seed which means that the model takes the previous run's cluster centres as its new starting point or seed. This may only seem like an insignificant alteration but that is the reason for its inclusion; to demonstrate how such a small change could potentially impact To fix the seed when the rest of the model is constantly changing could be questioned. Equally, to keep changing elements of the model continuously, including even the starting point could be questioned. Both options can be justified and neither option is wrong or right. Hence, why this seed altering aspect of this paper is included, to demonstrate the sheer unpredictability of such small changes. Four different plots are used throughout the three stories. The first plots the nodes according to their health and network features in question (Appendix 4 in ESM). Also, included on these plots are the cluster ellipses and centres to demonstrate the average size of the groups and average placement of the centres, represented by the dash-dot rings and crosses, respectively. As these plots are an average of the 1000 runs over the 100 timesteps, the plots include 'shadows' for both the ellipses and crosses. These shadows are the average of the 1000 runs at each specific timestep so they show how the groups have moved over time with the shade darkening as the simulation nears the end. The threshold lines are marked on these plots. The cluster centres must be above these threshold lines for the nodes included in their group to be considered for the vaccine, assuming they are still being clustered at that point in time. Finally, the radius of the nodes themselves demonstrates the probability that they were vaccinated at a given time. A larger ring around a node means a higher probability of being vaccinated. Shading of the ring indicates progression of time-from light to dark as simulation time progresses. Note, two of these style plots will be included in each section, corresponding to the fixed or updated seed alteration described above.",

All of the cluster groups collapse in size as the exclusion element is added into the model, but they are all able to recover steadily almost to their starting size as the vaccine is effectively distributed among the population, in turn reducing infection levels. Notably, the four nodes above both the threshold lines, therefore most in need of the vaccine, are unable to recover from the disease for long enough to be clustered, they are excluded throughout. This could be due to their location in the network and number of social connections meaning they are constantly being infected through contact with infected individuals. Figure 9 is almost identical to Fig. 8 , despite the change in the seeding technique. The same nodes are excluded and the cluster group size recovery over time is very similar. The most obvious difference is the slight shift in the right-most blue-solid cluster group to the left in Fig. 9 compared to Fig. 8 , but this seems to have minimal overall effect on the population and individual-level outcomes. Figure 10 helps with the reading of the other plots in this paper as it adds context to the rings around the individual nodes in the above and following plots. As discussed for Fig. 9 many of the nodes are in receipt of the vaccination, as seen by how many of the line graphs in Fig. 10 are at one on the y-axis. Hence, Fig. 10 makes it easy to see how The cluster groups at the start of the simulation are marked by the primary red and blue colouring, and the end point is marked by the black ellipses. The shades in between correspond to how these change over time. The same is true for the crosses which mark the centre of the clusters. The individual nodes are marked by the black dots. A black ring around these signifies that they are vaccinated all the time, the rings which go from white to black signify an increasing probability of vaccination and no circle at all means that they are never vaccinated. Finally, the blue lines at y = 5 and x = 65 mark the thresholds for vaccination Fig. 9 Plot depicting the population according to their edge degrees and weights using the updated seeding. For details on how to read the plot, see Fig. 8 caption the vaccination programme is successful for the population as a whole. However, equally obvious are the four nodes that never receive the vaccine, are often infected and are excluded from the clustering at an early stage.",

Now, story two uses a new pairing, the health parameter age with network edge degree. It is vital to appreciate the importance of such dataset choices and small changes, such as the seeding alteration, and the affect these can have on individuals. As already discussed, populations can have countless features; hence, unconscious or conscious biases emerging in AI systems have the potential to impact a wide range of different people, since they can target any of these features. Rittmuller (2018) claims that 'minorities have much to fear from an AI future', which is difficult to argue against. However, there is another point that is important to comprehend; these groups that are excluded or highlighted by these systems are not homogeneous wholes. Within each group are individuals and the decisions made by these AI systems could have life-changing impacts on these people. Compared to Figs. 8 and 9, the different outcomes caused by the change in dataset in Fig. 11 are clear. The left blue cluster and the two red clusters do collapse a little and recover. However, the blue-dotted cluster collapses completely and fails to recover which leaves the two nodes above both thresholds completely excluded and unvaccinated for the duration of the model. Below the degree threshold line, there is a whole group of nodes that suffer a similar fate, very different to the simulations in story one where almost all the nodes at some point received the vaccine.",

The two dotted clusters almost recover to their initial size but the blue solid one does not which leaves the top right node excluded and unvaccinated. Figure 16 mainly confirms the dramatic change seen in the solid red cluster group's position in Fig. 15 and the dramatic size change in the blue solid cluster group.

The changes in the position of the red solid line are very drastic in the first two plots in Fig. 18 . Yet, all the other cluster groups vary a lot too. The differences between Figs. 16 and 18 are undeniable and dramatic. Therefore, story three's results have highlighted the impact of the change in datasets, with Figs. 15 and 17 looking completely different to their corresponding plots in the other two stories. However, the differences between Figs. 16 and 18 have also highlighted Fig. 16 The left picture shows the variance in the x-value of the cluster centres over time, the centre picture shows the y-value and the right plot shows the variance in the radius of each cluster group at each timestep. This plot corresponds to the fixed seeding age vs weight plot depicted in Fig. 15 and its colours and dotted/solid line variations correspond to the cluster groups in that plot Story three's simulations have shown that despite the initial model parameters being set, as shown in Table 1 , and who was to be vaccinated being defined, the re-clustering and exclusion processes have altered the shape of this population to the extent that the algorithm seems to be diverting from its original instructions. However, it is the initial instruction to have exactly four cluster groups that has caused the variance in all of the cluster groups, once the bottom left group had been excluded, the algorithm must find its fourth group elsewhere. It could not have been foreseen that that entire cluster group would be constantly excluded, hence the outcomes of this simulation were equally impossible to predict. Herein lies the danger when programming AI systems, the outcomes caused by the innocent change in dataset and experimentation with the seed have demonstrated how certain programmers need to be in the results of their programmes before releasing them into the real world. 2",

The inputting of a biased dataset, rings comparable, if intrinsically different, alarm bells to those of San Francisco in 1900. Those health officials may have used health records to identify who 'needed' the vaccine. The programmer of the toy model above holds a similar role and uses records of age, weight and edge degree to determine vaccine receipt. In both these cases, the prejudice is written in, be it via a prejudiced dataset or prejudiced thoughts inherent to the time period. However, where this toy model deviates from the San Francisco case study is where bias emerges separate to this inherent feature. The further biases that emerged in both story two, against the individual, and in story three, against particularly the youngest cluster, could not have been predicted. In the simulations in story three, bias emerged on top of what was dictated, simply by the algorithm's requirement to follow the initial instructions to the end, despite it no longer being the best option for the population. The feedback loop that emerged between clustering, exclusion and vaccination proved impossible in story three for the algorithm to escape from. Importantly, even if the initial prejudice that was written in here was completely unintended, the emergent bias would remain an outcome from the AI system. The idea of intended or unintended (emergent) bias is not distinguishable to an AI.",

However, The variances in the centres and radii of each cluster group at each timestep 2 One real-world example of this was the A-level results fiasco in Britain during the Summer of 2020. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, A-level exams were cancelled. Instead student's results were based on an algorithm that used each school's past performance as a parameter (BBC News 2020). However, the reliance this algorithm had on this parameter meant that some high-achieving students at underperforming schools had their results downgraded (BBC News 2020). On the opposite side, this meant that the results for private schools were benefitted (BBC News 2020). This is just one example of the potential negative outcomes should the parameters inputted into algorithms be poorly considered and then not noticed until it is too late. similar such models are already in action; as an example, consider crime prediction software in America, specifically PredPol. This system looks at crime in one area and uses historical patterns to predict when and where it might occur next (O'Neill 2016 Leonhard (2016: 75) accurately states, the 'technology is neither good nor bad; it simply is. We must-now and here-decide and agree which exact use is evil or not'. Predpol is not the only example of unintentional biases guiding the decisions of AI systems. Examples of this phenomenon are commonplace. Even the big technology giants are not immune. In 2018, it came to light that Amazon had to scrap its AI recruiting tool because it was biased against women (Dastin 2018) . Their model was trained on applications submitted to the company over the past ten years, which reflected the male dominance of the industry (Dastin 2018 ). The AI system was trained on the data of the past resum\u00e9s, whilst the new resum\u00e9s became the so-called test data. It was from the training data that the AI picked up the bias against women, it then transferred this knowledge onto the test data. Therefore, the system learnt that male candidates were preferable and penalised the resum\u00e9s that included words such as 'women's' and downgraded graduates of two all-female colleges (Dastin 2018) . This obviously had not been Amazon's intention but their lack of consideration of the potential consequences from using the biased dataset, resulted in a biased recruitment tool. By simply changing the dataset used, the outcome could have been very different for the women who were rejected purely based on their gender, since the system would not have learnt to exclude them. However, as the toy vaccination model proved, changing the dataset may well improve the outcomes for one individual or group but equally likely, it could cause other individuals or groups to be even worse off. If Amazon are having such difficulties, then it is unsurprising that others are too, with stories of 'biased AI' frequently in the news.",

However, an entire population would never conform to such 'simple' groupings, making the process completely inconsistent (Bowker and Star 2000) . Despite the problems, a person's racial classification could be challenged at any time, even if you merely associated with someone of the 'wrong group' (Bowker and Star 2000) . Also, these cluster groups were not just administrative, they determined where a person could live and work (Bowker and Star 2000) . In effect this process 'separated families, disrupted biographies, and damaged individuals beyond repair' (Bowker and Star 2000: 218) . While this may be an extreme example of the consequences of classification, it does demonstrate the dangers of trying to make individuals fit into groups. As Bowker and Star (2000: 224-225) state, 'there can be tremendous torque of individual biographies'. The toy model in this paper demonstrates these damaging consequences for individuals from over-simplifying a population into a set number of groups. Particularly, its outcomes in stories two and three show how algorithms will not remove this potential for damaging 'torques' should care not be taken when determining datasets and making 'innocent changes'.",

The model's consequences may be exaggerated but the consequences detailed in the case studies above were very real. As already stated, it is extremely unlikely that such a simplistic modelling technique would be used in reality in healthcare. However, it has been used here to highlight a feedback loop between datasets and outcomes which are not idealised. Such feedback loops do exist and are already having negative impacts on certain groups' lives as seen in the examples offered. All of the points raised by the toy model; feedback loops, dataset choices and small changes in code are all tied together and impacting on each other to have sometimes disastrous consequences. Clearly, people do not fit neatly into groups and this toy model has shown that by simply changing the dataset and seeding, the outcome for an individual can be completely different. The apparent human need to classify things, and in this case, people, is visible throughout our history (Bowker and Star 2000) . Equally visible, however, are the problems that come with this desire to sort people and there will always be anomalies. If this is forgotten, then the true impact of oversimplifying these decisions over datasets and variables, such as the seed, cannot be truly appreciated and may not be prioritised. As AI branches out into more areas of life the focus needs to be on protecting those members of society who could potentially suffer at the hands of a poorly considered AI system. It is vital we take heed from the examples that have gone before and consider this 'toy model's' worst case scenario outlook and work to avoid it.",

Models in this paper have focussed on the impact AI could have on healthcare today, one of the most current and certainly topical dilemmas in the field. A report from the NHS in the UK recognises the problems with data as discussed in this research but equally, they recognise the opportunity that AI presents for improvement and therefore to save lives (Harwich and Laycock 2018) . But to blame AI and present it as 'bad' is to paint too simple a picture, the bias that is appearing in systems in all areas is often inherited from the data or even the programmer, whether it is deliberate or unconscious is another question. Equally, learning from the past will prevent making the same mistakes again. Unless care is taken, prejudices such as those that governed both San Francisco's Chinatown in 1900 and South Africa under apartheid will continue to emerge, only now they will emerge through AI systems. Stopping and considering the datasets we are using, what the consequences of a seemingly harmless decision could be, will enable us to get the best out of this bright, new technology.",
