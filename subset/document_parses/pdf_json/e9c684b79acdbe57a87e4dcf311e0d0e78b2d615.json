We included all patients aged 18 years and older with clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19 (by RT-PCR test) from assumed community-acquired infection. We did a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and in-hospital mortality, adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness) and quantifying potential mediators (level of respiratory support and steroid treatment). The primary outcome was weekly in-hospital mortality at 28 days, defined as the proportion of patients who had died within 28 days of admission of all patients admitted in the observed week, and it was assessed in all patients with an outcome.

            "text": "There is growing evidence that mortality from COVID-19 declined during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, both in hospital and in the community. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] One explanation for this decline could be that the case-mix of patients presenting to hospital changed across time towards a younger and less comorbid demographic, who were at lower risk of dying than were patients at the start of the first wave. The national UK lockdown and effective shielding measures in susceptible at-risk populations could have reduced transmission of the virus during the course of the first wave. 6 Additionally, easier access to testing and advice about seeking medical help might have resulted in earlier presentation to hospital. Familiarity with the virus and clinical course could have also led to better management of patients through improved ward and intensive care unit (ICU) care. 7, 8 Corticosteroids have been shown in trials to reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19, and there was an increase in the use of corticosteroids during the course of the first wave. 9, 10 The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) 11 was activated on Jan 17, 2020, to recruit patients with COVID-19 admitted to a network of hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales. 12 ISARIC has been prepared for outbreaks such as COVID-19 for the past 8 years, with the aim of providing data and samples for near real-time analysis. 11 During the COVID-19 outbreak, analysis of the CCP-UK cohort in the first wave allowed development of the pragmatic International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) Mortality Score for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in readiness to aid clinical management decisions in the second wave. 13 We aimed to use the ISARIC CCP-UK cohort to describe how in-hospital mortality changed over time in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We aimed to explore potential drivers for these changes by assessing patient characteristics, illness severity, and treatment received during the hospital stay.",

Mortality in hospitalised patients at the beginning of the first wave (ie, between March and April, 2020) of the pandemic was extremely high. Patients who were admitted to hospital in March and early April, 2020, were substantially more unwell at presentation than patients who were admitted in later months (June and July 2020). Mortality declined in all age groups, in all ethnic groups, in men and women, and in patients with and without comorbidities, over and above contributions from declining illness severity. After adjustment for these variables, a fifth of the reduction in mortality was explained by changes in the use of respiratory support and steroid treatment. However, mortality was persistently high in patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, and in those who received non-invasive ventilation outside of critical care.",

In addition, the introduction of community policies, such as the wearing of masks, physical distancing, the shielding of susceptible patients, and the UK lockdown, potentially resulted in people being exposed to less virus. We found that the decrease in mortality varied depending on the level of respiratory support received. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation have persistently high mortality rates, albeit with a changing case-mix, and further research should target this group of patients. Severe COVID-19 has primarily affected older (ie, those aged >70 years) people in the UK.

Missing data for number of comorbidities were classified as none, for health-care worker status were classified as no, and for respiratory support received (ie, oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, and non-invasive ventilation) were classified as none. For the primary analysis, multiple imputation with chained equations was done for missing markers of illness severity. Ten sets, each with ten iterations, were imputed by use of 35 explanatory variables including outcomes. We did For the primary outcome analysis, we excluded patients without an outcome date (classified as \"survivors\" in the sensitivity analysis results in the appendix [p 31). For the primary outcome, our modelling strategy was informed by a putative causal model (see the proposed directed acyclic graph in the appendix [p 26]). Using logistic regression, we specified three models exploring the association between admission week (as a continuous variable) and in-hospital mortality. A baseline model included adjustment for age, sex, and admitting hospital as a random effect. A second model accounted for known baseline confounders, including variables previously shown to be associated with in-hospital mortality (age, sex, number of comorbidities, index of multiple deprivation score, and severity of illness [respiratory rate, SpO 2 , Glasgow coma scale score, serum urea concentration, and C-reactive protein concentration]). In a third model, potential mediators were added to explore the effect of treatment (steroids and respiratory support, thus considering accrued clinical knowledge of respiratory support) on the association between week of admission and mortality (controlled direct-effect models). We extended this same model in a potential outcomes framework to perform a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models. 19 We sought to control confounding between exposure and outcome, exposure and mediator, and mediator and outcome, and we carefully considered potential mediator-outcome confounders influenced by the exposure. Using standard frequentist approaches, we imputed unobserved nested counterfactuals with an outcome model to accommodate our nominal mediator (respiratory support). Exposure-mediator interactions were explored and a joint model was used to incorporate steroid use. Robust SEs (based on a Sandwich estimator) were generated, and the results were presented as a proportion mediated on the risk difference scale.",

Patients in critical care units at this time were considerably younger than those on wards; even so, in-hospital mortality was much higher for COVID-19 than for other severe acute respiratory infections, such as viral pneumonia. 7 During the peak admission period, the proportion of patients aged older than 80 years and the proportion of patients with two or more comorbidities admitted to critical care units was lower than after this time point; however, this pattern reflected the demographic of patients admitted to wards during the peak admission period.",

            "text": "A fifth of the reduction in in-hospital mortality in our study can be explained by changes in respiratory support and steroid treatment, together with associated changes in clinical decision making associated with respiratory support. At the beginning of the pandemic, much attention was given to early intubation and to different ventilator management practices based on different presumed phenotypes. These practices changed as clinicians started to manage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 as routine ARDS. The proportion of patients receiving invasive ventilation reduced over time; however, in-mortality remained persistently high after adjusting for patient demographics and illness severity, as shown in our study. It would be unwise to interpret this association as causal, as use of invasive mechanical ventilation is reserved for patients with the most severe illness, and there was an overall reduction in mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units in our study. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, the change in case-mix might not have been adequately captured by multimorbidity and age; a higher proportion of older patients (ie, those older than 70 years) and patients with comorbidities were ventilated later in the first wave, potentially at a time when there was more critical care capacity than at the start of the first wave. Second, critical care practices changed, with increasing use of non-invasive ventilation over time, and only patients presenting in extremis or those who did not respond to a trial of non-invasive ventilation received invasive mechanical ventilation. This change in practice could be partly due to the changing case-mix, but also due to increasing clinician familiarity with the use of non-invasive ventilation, and an improving ability to identify which patients might benefit from this intervention. 34 It is possible that patients admitted early in the first wave who received invasive mechanical ventilation would have received non-invasive ventilation if they had been admitted later in the first wave, and that they would have survived regardless of the mode of ventilation. Therefore, compared with patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation early in the first wave, those admitted later who received invasive mechanical ventilation were a more severely ill population who had failed to respond to treatments and would die if not offered invasive mechanical ventilation. This notion is supported by the significant increase in the effect of respiratory care over time; allocation to respiratory support was linked to better prediction of outcome by clinicians over time in our study. Ongoing trials comparing the use of non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 will help to overcome this selection bias and confounding by indication to ascertain whether patient selection or non-invasive ventilation itself is improving outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19.",

Together with a higher proportion of patients with comorbidities, particularly dementia and chronic pulmonary and cardiac disease, this observation could indicate that the benefit of these treatments in this group of patients is limited, and could also indicate a potential ceiling of treatment for patients receiving non-invasive ventilation on the ward. In-hospital mortality was high in older patients (ie, those older than 80 years) who received invasive ventilation. The benefit of ICU admission for older frail patients remains uncertain, as rates of mortality and long-term functional impairment in survivors are high in this population. 35 Critical care interventions might not be associated with improved outcomes in this group. In a previous study, protocolised ICU referral in patients aged 75 years and older led to significantly higher ICU admission rates but had no significant effect on mortality, functional status, or health-related quality of life. 36 It is essential that meaningful discussions about the available treatment options, as well as the risks and benefits of each, are discussed with these patients and their families. 37 Such discussions should also emphasise that much of the potential benefit of care can be derived without the need for ICU level care.",

We did not record treatment escalation plans, but we were able to examine changing case-mixes in the ward and in critical care units. Due to the nature of the pandemic, there were more missing data than would normally be expected in a prospective cohort study, but missing data were handled with the appropriate methods, as discussed in the methods and appendix. We were unable to comment on community factors leading up to admission, and indeed, for patients who were not admitted to hospital. The change in management of ventilated patients would have benefitted from measurement of physiological variables; however, we did not collect this information. We also did not include unproven treatments being investigated in randomised controlled trials, which could have had either a beneficial or harmful effect. We were unable to locate any publicly available data for strain in the National Health Service (NHS) during the first wave (ie, excessive demand on the strength, resources, or abilities of hospitals). Although data on the proportion of ICUs that had reached so-called surge capacity were available for Scotland, equivalent data for England were not available. Furthermore, different hospitals had surges in both daily admissions and number of in-patients at different times; therefore, defining a time when hospitals were working beyond their pre-COVID-19 capacity was complex. We were unable to identify individual hospital strain; however, we did include hospital as a variable in our model. We used components of the ISARIC4C Mortality Score for severity of illness at presentation. This is a pragmatic score-based model, therefore discrimination and calibration might be reduced in subgroups of patients. Furthermore, with changes in treatment and outcomes over time, predicted in-mortality could be overestimated. However, in internal temporal and external validation studies, performance of this model has remained good. As this was an observational study, we were unable to assign causality, and unmeasured confounding might remain. The issue of selection bias for those admitted to critical care, compared with those who are cared for on the ward (ie, collider bias), is well established in critical care epidemiology literature, and its effect on associations is understood. The comparison of ward versus critical care cohorts is absent from most other studies.",

This reduction persisted after adjusting for illness severity and changes in patient case-mix. Patients were most severely unwell at hospital presentation at the start of the first wave and presented later in the disease course than did patients at the end of the first wave. A significant proportion of the reduction in in-hospital mortality can be explained by changes in clinical management, including respiratory support and steroid treatment. Hospital practice has changed; the use of non-invasive ventilation has increased substantially, and many patients have been included in drug trials and trials of other treatments, which might explain the reduction in in-hospital mortality and inform future waves. In-hospital mortality remained high for patients receiving invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation on the ward, and these populations should be a priority in ongoing research.",
