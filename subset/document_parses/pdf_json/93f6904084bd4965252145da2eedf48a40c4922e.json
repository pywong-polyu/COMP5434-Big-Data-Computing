AD is one of the top medical care concerns across the world with a projected economic burden of $2 trillion by 2030. To date, however, there remains no effective disease-modifying therapy available. It is more important than ever to reveal novel therapeutic approaches. Peptide-based biotherapeutics has been a great potential strategy attributed to their distinct and superior biochemical characteristics, such as reproducible chemical synthesis and modification, rapid cell and tissue permeability, and fast blood clearance. Phage display, one of today's most powerful platforms, allows selection and identification of suitable peptide drug candidates with high affinities and specificity toward target, demonstrating the potential to overcome challenges and limitations in AD diagnosis/treatment. We aim to provide the first comprehensive review to summarize the status in this research direction. The biological overview of phage display is described, including basic biology of the phage vectors and construction principle of phage library, biopanning procedure, mirror image phage display, and various binding affinity evaluation approaches. Further, the applications of phage display in AD therapy, targeted drug delivery, and early detection are presented. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and offer a future outlook for further advancing the potential application of phage display on AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Among them, extracellular senile plaques (SPs) formed by the deposition of A\u03b2 from amyloid precursor proteins sequentially cleaved by multiple splicing enzymes, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) contributed by the aggregation of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau Ivyspring International Publisher proteins are two prominent histopathological hallmarks of AD [7] . The imbalance of metal homeostasis in the brains of AD patients is also of great concern [5] . Excessive metal ions accumulated in brain, such as copper, zinc, and iron ions, can coordinate with A\u03b2, promoting the formation of neurotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers and producing oxidative stress molecules. These factors damage intracellular biological macromolecules (e.g. lipid, protein and nucleic acids), which cause neural dysfunction and finally lead to neuronal death [8] .",

Wild-type M13 phage infection of enteric (gut) bacterium Escherichia coli is a nonlytic process without killing the host cell and replicates by assembling in the bacterial periplasm and secreting through the outer membrane. It has a rod-shaped structure with a length of 1 \u00b5m and a width of 6 nm (Figure 2A) . The structure of the M13 phage is relatively simple, which comprises of a single-stranded, circular DNA genome surrounded by its correspondingly encoded protein outer shell ~ termed capsid. The capsid consists of a long tubular array of \u223c2700 copies of one major coat protein (pVIII) subunits, and is capped at each end by 5 copies each of four minor proteins (pIII and pVI on one tip and pVII and pIX on the other tip) [20] . pIII and pVIII capsid are the two commonly used coat proteins due to their wider tolerance range or stronger productivity [21] . The M13 phage display system is in a position to display folded proteins carrying disulfide bonds [22] . Numerous enzymes, functional antibody fragments, and inhibitors have been displayed using the M13 system [23] . Another representative phage vector is the T7 phage species, which has an icosahedral head and a short tail ( Figure  2B ) [20, 24] . The outer shell of the T7 phage head is composed of the 10A and 10B capsid proteins, and exogenous peptide sequences are typically displayed as C-terminal fusions of the 10B capsid protein to avoid the stop codon problem [25] . The T7 phage is lytic, so display and reproduction are not dependent on the secretion through the bacterial membrane [13] . M13 phage DNA genome surrounded by five capsid proteins. pIII and pVIII capsid proteins are usually utilized in inserting foreign peptide. (B) Representative T7 lytic phage structure. The T7 phage head is composed of 415 copies of the capsid protein 10A and 10B. The genetically engineered peptide sequence can be modified on the capsid 10B. (C) Biopanning process of phage-displayed peptide libraries. The phage library is bound to the target molecular. The weakly bound and unbound phages are removed by stringent washes, and phage associated with the target are eluted and amplified in E. coli. Three-five rounds of biopanning are necessary, and then the phage genome is sequenced. (A) Reprinted with permission from [26] . Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society.

The phage library represents a mixture of millions of phage particles, each displaying a unique and random set of peptide/protein [26] . According to the size of displayed peptide, epitope or antibody and the nature of antigen, different phage libraries have been constructed, mainly divided into two types of libraries, phage antibody libraries and phage peptide libraries. Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv), a fragment of antigen binding (Fab), and fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) belong to the phage antibody library, which requires small size, easy cloning, and large-capacity phage vectors load [27, 28] . Random phage peptide libraries are now one of the most extensively used types of phage display constructs, which provides a basis for selection affinity peptides with specific target molecules. The linear random peptide library can be constructed through introducing degenerate oligonucleotides into the phage genomes. Currently, peptides ranging in length from 6 to 43 amino acids have been successfully displayed as peptide-capsid fusion proteins on phages [29] . In 2005, Scholle et al. generated 22 different phage peptide libraries ranging from 8-20 amino acids in length with sizes of up to 10 11 clones, and have used these libraries to select peptide ligands to several protein targets [30, 31] . Excepted homemade libraries, commercial random peptide libraries and commercial vectors, such as PhD series phage libraries from New England Biolabs, are available to accelerate the work of scientific researchers [32] .",

            "text": "Through an evolutionary selection process called biopanning, functional peptides with high affinity and specificity toward specific targets could be selected from a large random library containing up 10 9 phage clones. The biopanning procedures generally include the following steps ( Figure 2C ). First, a customized phage library could be constructed to display desired foreign peptides. Second, the phage library is incubated with the target molecule (e.g., peptide, protein and cell) to achieve binding. Billions of phages with randomly displayed peptides competitively bind to the target molecules, and potential peptides with stronger affinities are preferentially retained. Third, the weakly bound and unbound phages were removed by a wash buffer. Fourth, a low pH buffer or competitive elution is used to elute the high target-bound phages, and the eluted bound phages infect host bacteria to become a more selective phage library for the next round of biopanning. Three to five rounds of biopanning are indispensable for obtaining the phages with high affinities for the target molecule. In each round, the stringency and effectiveness of selection are improved by increasing the number of washing and reducing the amount of target molecules. Special care should be taken to avoid wild-type phage contamination during the biopanning procedure, as even vanishingly small levels of contamination can result in a majority of phage pool becoming wild-type phages after three rounds of biopanning. Subsequently, the foreign DNA inserted in the phage genome is sequenced after a final round of selection. The encoded amino acid sequences are the peptide ligand that binds to the target molecule, and the specificity verification of ligand was required in subsequent tests.",

In situ phage selection is the simplest and most versatile method, requiring only the coating of the target molecule to the surface of the well plate or bead, and the entire selection is performed without a living system. For example, the selection of A\u03b2 in the current literature used biotin-conjugated A\u03b2, that was fixed in the well plate pre-coated with streptavidin to carry out multiple rounds of biopanning [33] . Larbanoix et al. also described the A\u03b2 immobilization on the bottom of the polystyrene well plate by hydrophobic absorption. [34, 35] Ample researches for selection functional peptides are also being conducted in cells, in vivo, ex vivo and even in patients to better mimic cellular and body original conditions. Phage in vitro cell selection provides a method for peptides recognition and binding specifically to individual cells. Majerova et al. used a 12-mer phage library to screen against the mouse blood-brain barrier (BBB) cell model, two BBB shuttle peptides were obtained capable of effectively permeating the brain, which could serve as transporters for brain drug delivery [36] . It is common knowledge that the in vitro condition is quite different from the complex in vivo environment. Phage biopanning in living animals and even in patients is aimed at producing organ/tissue targeted peptides that are closer to the physiological conditions. Not the same as in vitro selection, the in vivo selection procedure involves systemic intravenous injecting the phage library into the body, and after a period of circulation, the desired organ/ tissue is collected, homogenized and the phage extracted for sequencing [37, 38] . Arap et al. reported the first in human phage display selection to identify several peptides that home to specific vascular beds in 2002 [39] . A patient received an intravenous infusion of a phage peptide library and underwent tissue biopsies of several organs 15 min later, followed by bioinformatical analysis of thousands of phage clones. They reported a peptide with the sequence of CGRRAGGSC, which could specifically home to prostate vasculature rather than other organs. It is worth noting that the biosafety of phages in vivo application should be taken seriously.",

            "text": "Phage display-derived peptides are clinically promising due to their high specificity, selectivity and targeting characteristics. However, functional peptides identified from traditional phage display are composed of naturally occurring L-amino acids ( Figure 4A ). These peptides are prone to degradation by proteases and therefore have a short half-life [40] . The chemical reactions in which enzymes degrade peptides are stereoselective, and the rate of reaction is highly correlated with the configuration of the reactant. In vivo degrading enzymes can effectively recognize the natural configuration of peptides and make them inactive, which limits the applications of peptide drugs. While D-configuration peptides (enantiomers of the corresponding L-configuration peptides) cannot be degraded by degrading enzymes and are highly stable under physiological conditions. Taking into account this, Kim' groups proposed the concept of mirror image phage display technology, which greatly expanded the application of phagederived peptides in vivo [41] . Mirror image phage display mainly takes advantage of chiral amino acids and, consequently, of the peptides or proteins that they form ( Figure 4B ). Its principle is described as following: biopanning is first carried out against the image of the target molecule (D-target) to obtain an affinity phage display-derived L-ligand, and then the corresponding D-ligand could be chemically synthesized. Depending to the mirror symmetry theory, the D-ligand could specifically bind to the naturally-existing L-target molecule. Willbold's group took the lead in applying mirror phage display in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. A randomized 12-mer peptide phage library was used to select against A\u03b242 fibrils consisting of all D-amino acid residues confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) assay ( Figure 4C) . The most representative D-enantiomeric peptide named D1 was selected and chemically synthesized. D1 was able to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and specifically bind to natural A\u03b2 amyloid fibrils in the brain tissue of AD patients ( Figure 4D ) [42, 43] . A series of D1-derived peptides have further demonstrated their applicability for in vivo molecular imaging [44, 45] . This highlights the great potential of mirror image phage display in the AD diagnostic and treatment.",

Furthermore, CD spectra [59] and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) [60] are also complemented with fixed point and in vitro detection.

The application of functional peptides in animal models of AD represents a more realistic therapeutic efficiency under physiological conditions. The decrease of SPs and NFTs in AD transgenic (Tg) mice are undoubtedly the most important indicators [59, 60] . Staining of brain tissue sections (Congo red, ThT, or antibody staining) or western blot analysis of proteins are the classic evaluation measures [35] .

The targets that they screened were A\u03b2 intermediates with two different conformations: monomeric and highly aggregated ones. Interestingly, they found that the peptides identified from the selection for the A\u03b2 monomeric state had little effect on A\u03b2 aggregation, but those peptides selection against the A\u03b2 aggregated state increase the rate of A\u03b2 aggregation. The underlying mechanism was that the peptides might have facilitated the conversion of soluble, toxic A\u03b2 oligomers into insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates to reduce their toxicity. This highlights the ability of phage displayed peptides to recognize distinct conformations of the proteins and produce different affinity ligands. Moreover, SPR-based affinity assay revealed that the endogenous peptide to modulate aggregation correlated with its affinity for the N-terminal 10 residues (A\u03b21-10). Armed with this knowledge, a highly specific A\u03b2 1-10 affinity peptide (PYRWQLWWHNWS) was identified by phage display [67] . TEM analysis showed the addition of both the selected phages and special synthetic phage displayed peptides can perturb obvious A\u03b2 plaques into bundles of short fibrils. The peptide alleviated A\u03b2-induced PC12 cell viability, apoptosis and exhibited a protective effect against A\u03b2-induced learning and memory deficits in rats.",

Among the 16 identified affibody variants, the two most promising affibody variants (Z A\u03b21 and Z A\u03b23 ) ( Figure 5A ) were shown to predominantly bind to A\u03b2 peptides, and enable to capture A\u03b2 peptides from human plasma and serum samples. Affibody molecules in dimer form were constructed to improve the binding ability with A\u03b2 peptides. Further ITC and ThT fluorescence assay indicated dimeric ZA\u03b23 (abbreviated as (Z A\u03b23 ) 2 ) bound to the monomeric A\u03b2 40 with a high affinity of K d = 17 nM ( Figure 5B ) and could inhibit A\u03b2 40 fibrillation at stoichiometric concentrations ( Figure 5C ) [49] . NMR structural analysis revealed that two Z A\u03b23 molecules linked by disulfide bond encapsulated the aggregation-prone part of the A\u03b2 peptide, thereby inhibiting A\u03b2 40 aggregation (Figure 5D ). In in vivo study using A\u03b2-Tg fruit fly models, both Z A\u03b23 and (Z A\u03b23 ) 2 were able to promote the clearance of A\u03b2 from the Drosophila brain ( Figure 5E ) [69] . In 2015, in order to further improve the affinity between A\u03b2 40 and Z A\u03b23 , Lindberg et al. rationally improved the molecular structure of Z A\u03b23 using staphylococcal cell surface display combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) approach [70] . The best performing candidate affibody Z SYM73 bound A\u03b2 with an approximate K D of 340 pM, corresponding to a 50-fold improvement in affinity relative to Z A\u03b23 . In their work published in 2019, Z SYM73 and albumin binding domain (ABD) were genetically linked (Z SYM73 -ABD) to increase Z SYM73 in vivo half-life. Z SYM73 _ ABD treatment reduced amyloid burden in the brains of APP/PS1 Tg mice ( Figure 5F ) and rescued cognitive functions in behavioral tests (Figure 5G ) [71] . Taking into account the limitation of natural configuration of peptides sensitive to proteases in vivo application, Willbold's group conducted a series of work to develop D-peptide inhibitors based on mirror image phage display technology over the last 20 years. The novel and potential candidate D-enantiomeric peptide D3 (RPRTRLHTHRNR) was identified against A\u03b242 monomeric or small oligomers [72] . ThT fluorescence and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) assay suggested that D3 could not only inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation, but also redissolve pre-existing A\u03b2 fibrils. D3 treatment can rescue A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells and significantly reduced the amount of inflammation and A\u03b2 plaque load of Tg mice. Furthermore, oral administration of the D3 improved the cognitive performance of both young and old AD Tg mice and yielded a substantial reduction in the amount of amyloid deposits and associated inflammatory response [73, 74] . Further pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that D3 had high proteolytic stability, effective penetration through the brain and high oral biocompatibility [75] . Based on these research, several rational design D3 derivatives, for instance, D3D3 [76] , RD2 [77] , RD2D3 [78] , were also subjected to in vitro and in vivo investigation. D3D3 is the head-to-tail tandem version of D3, which has a higher affinity with A\u03b2 and a higher efficiency in eliminating A\u03b242 oligomers. RD2 is a rationally designed reshuffled form of D3 with a C-terminal penta-D-arginine sequence, and has revealed enhanced A\u03b2 oligomer elimination efficacy compared to D3 both in vitro and in vivo [79] . RD2 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic properties and had successfully completed clinical phase 1 [80] . RD2D3 is a head-to-tail tandem peptide derivative composed of D3 and RD2, which exhibits a lower plasma clearance rate and higher bioavailability than D3D3 after intraperitoneal injections.",

In view of the lack of efficacy of amyloid \u03b2-targeted therapy for AD so far, interest is growing in tau as a potential alternative target. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, which plays an important role in stabilizing microtubules and promoting microtubule assembly under physiological conditions. However, tau can be aggregated into straight or paired helical filaments through dimerization and oligomerization reactions, which further combine to form neurotoxic NFTs [82, 83] . Two hexapeptide motifs with high \u03b2-sheet propensity in the second and third repeat domains of tau, named PHF6* ( 273 VQIINK 284 ) and PHF6 ( 306 VQIVYK 311 ), respectively, are two key sequences in tau fibrillization [84] . Due to their importance to the aggregation process, the whole repeat domain, PHF6 and PHF6* constitute an interesting target for phage display technology to interfere with tau assembly [60, 85] .",

Further molecular modeling study showed that p-NH interacted with PHF6 fibrils mainly through Van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding to block the addition of another layer of PHF6 and leave them in a blocked antiaggregation state, thereby effectively inhibiting fibrils growth ( Figure 6E) . Furthermore, p-NH reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in both okadaic acid-treated N2a cell model and Tau P301S Tg mice model, and significantly attenuated cognitive behavioral deficits of mice in Morris water maze and nest construction test (Figure 6F) .

The most potential candidate peptide PZn with the sequence of HMQTNHH, had the highest affinity and specificity toward Zn(II), but not toward other metal ions, such as Cu(II), Fe(III), Ca(II), Mg(II) and Al (III) ( Figure 7B) . Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) were loaded with the PZn (abbreviated to PEG/PZn-CS NPs) to maintain PZn peptide stability and biocompatibility ( Figure  7C) . PEG/PZn-CS NPs had a certain sustained release property (73% of PZn released at 72 h) and exhibited anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic responses, and rescue cytotoxicity in N2a-sw cells induced by Zn(II). PEG/CS-PZn NP treatment reduced A\u03b2 burden and ameliorated cognition and memory impairments in APP/PS1 Tg mouse.

Phage display technology provides new ideas for the prevention or treatment of AD by developing novel biocompatible chelating agents targeting metal ions. As more functions of metal ions in the brain are discovered, various other metal ions besides Zn and Cu ions will also become the bait for selection. In addition, in the context of metal chelation therapy, it seems that it is not enough to consider the effect of a single metal element on AD, and how to ensure that the chelating agent only chelates excess metal ions without affecting their normal functions in vivo will be an important research direction for the treatment of AD in the future.",

Therefore, the development of functional carriers that can deliver peptides or other drugs to the brain, thus ensuring drug efficiency and reducing drug adverse effects, is a prerequisite for clinical success in the treatment of AD. The recent advances in the development of brain targeted ligands by phage display technology indicate that it is a reliable and valuable tool.

The cyclic heptapeptide phage library was added on the luminal side of the hCMEC/D3 cell monolayer, and the phages capable of penetrating the cell monolayer were recovered on the abluminal side after a short period of permeation (1-3 minutes in the third round) for a total of three rounds of penetration assays (Figure 8A) . One of the recovered phage was named SLS phage, and the displayed cyclic heptapeptide sequence was C-SLSHSPQ-C (SLS peptide). SLS significantly promoted M13 phages penetration in monkey and rat BBB co-culture model ( Figure 8B) . Intravenous administration of mouse SLS-phages showed that cyclic SLS peptides distributed around the brain microvessels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Figure 8C) .

Further investigation with ELISA and peptide competition binding assay indicated AD#1 peptide (HMRQGMA) had high and specific affinity to AD plasma, while Con#1 peptide (DGARHGR) specifically bound to healthy people plasma. In the validation phase, an additional independent set of 35 AD patients, 45 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 45 healthy people as controls, and 20 Parkinson's disease patients were included.

Phage display integrated protein microarrays were used to screen AD autoantibodies as blood biomarkers for early diagnosis [104] . Segundo-Acosta et al. used T7 phage libraries displaying AD brain tissue mRNA to identify phages against serum purified IgGs from AD patients ( Figure 10C ). Subsequently, those phages displaying the specific target protein corresponding to AD autoantibodies were extracted and printed on the microarrays for further validation with new serum samples from AD patients and healthy people. Among the thirteen proteins with high immunogenicity with AD serum samples, four proteins, anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), glycogen phosphorylase (PYGB), and olfactory receptor 8J1 (OR8J1), were identified and showed abilities to distinguish AD patients from the healthy people using a fine-tuned luminescence beads immunoassay, thus being added to the blood-based criteria for AD biomarkers (Figure 10D ). In 2020, Plano et al. performed a double binding phage display selection to identify new conformation antigens of A\u03b21-42 by alternating biopanning with AD serum and monoclonal antibody YPF19 (chosen as like A\u03b2-amyloid structure protein), which can be used as novel diagnostic biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD patients [111] .

In the past two decades, tremendous contribution in distinguishing protein conformation has facilitated the understanding of the process of amyloid aggregation. Therefore, the target molecules by the phage selection in AD is incline to select single and clear objects, such as A\u03b2 oligomers [61] , A\u03b2 protofibrils [114] , and tau fibers [59] . By comparison, intermediate conformation of these proteins, such as transition states from monomers to oligomers, or from oligomers to fibers, are found to have stronger neurotoxicity but these intermediates are dynamic and unstable, being too difficult to be identified (Figure 11 ). In addition, a multitude of currently unknown three-dimensional structures are likely to appear during the aggregation process. Recent research based on cryo-electron microscopy technology has achieved high-resolution structural analysis of A\u03b2 oligomers [115] and tau protein [116] .

            "text": "It is also noteworthy that some synthetic peptides generated by phage display exhibit variable and weak function in treatment or brain delivery targeting. Potential difference between the phage microenvironment and practical physiological condition in the peptide configuration may account for these discrepancies. Moreover, chemically synthetic peptides may not maintain the original configuration displayed at the bacteriophage tip, which confer the target recognition and specificity. Similarly, multiple copies of the exogenous displayed peptide on the phage result in strong binding to the target during the selection process, but only a single synthetic peptide might not be strong enough. A typical example is GYR peptide targeting brain capillary endothelial cell showed weak target engagement on liposome surfaces. Instead, GYR self-assembled into supramolecular core-shell nanoparticles and nanofibers, rather than in its monomeric state, resulting in significantly improved target recognition and binding performance [117] . Therefore, sequence analysis and structure prediction of the phage-derived peptides, as well as exploring whether supramolecular assembly of peptides occurs, need to be considered carefully. Cyclic peptides may be a better choice as BBB penetrate peptides than their linear counterparts due to conformational rigidity and structural controllability.",

            "text": "False positives and omitted screen represent additional challenges in the phage display. Considering that phages bind to plastic substrates or blocking agents (such as bovine albumin solution) [46] , as well as M13 phages possess negative charge preferentially bound to positive charge vectors [47] , a large number of phages have been occupied by nonspecific adsorption prior to the positive selection. Additionally, amplification is necessary for the enrichment of eluted phage after each round of selection, but increases the risk of introducing biological bias and collapse of library diversity. For instances, some phages are not amplified preferentially due to poor infectivity, and wild-type phages introduced due to contamination are preferentially amplified. Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) make it possible to address these concerns. NGS allows for the characterization of more than 10 6 reads in a single run so that repeated peptide sequences can be identified Figure 11 . Continuously dynamic process of proteins aggregation. Protein fibril formation is a continuously dynamic process, where the process initiates with a lag phase followed by elongation and fibril maturation. Some unknown intermediates are likely to appear during the aggregation process.",

Despite scientists have made significant progress in understanding the pathobiology of AD, no effective disease-modifying therapy has been identified so far.
