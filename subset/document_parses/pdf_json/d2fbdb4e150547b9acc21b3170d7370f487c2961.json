We have developed a tool to measure stakeholder engagement, called the Research Engagement Survey Tool (REST). The purpose of this paper is to present the implementation and uptake of the stakeholder engagement measure REST among research teams, including the assessment of barriers and facilitating factors for use of the new research engagement measure in practice. METHODS: In this implementation study, project team members participated in baseline and follow-up webbased surveys. Web-based interviews were conducted with a subset of project teams that implemented the REST. On the baseline survey, project teams were asked to provide details about up to three ongoing or recently completed projects, were asked if they agreed with compensation for REST completion, and were asked if they would like to send the survey to stakeholders or would prefer our project team to email their project stakeholders. Follow-up surveys contained questions on reactions to implementing REST and results of REST. RESULTS: Project team members/researchers who completed the baseline survey (n=86) were mostly female (79%) and Non-Hispanic/Latino(a) White (76%). Those who implemented REST were also mostly female (86%) and Non-Hispanic/Latino(a) White (71%), with an average of 11 years in academic research. About 98% of all participants completing the baseline survey had the capacity to survey partners, while 100% of all teams who implemented REST did. A small portion of respondents indicated the time commitment of REST would be a barrier (29% of baseline survey respondents, 10% of those who implemented REST) and indicated workload would be a barrier (31% of baseline survey respondents, 14% of those who implemented REST). DISCUSSION: The data presented here indicate that REST implementation is feasible in a volunteer group of ongoing research projects.",

Inclusion criteria for the recruitment of project teams include (1) teams with ongoing or recently completed (within the last calendar year) stakeholderengaged projects, and (2) interest in working with this PCORI project to provide feedback on implementing the Research Engagement Survey Tool (REST), and, possibly, to implement it in a current or recently completed project. Additionally, during data collection, we added a screening question to determine if a tool available only in English would be useful to teams. If a tool in English only was not useful to teams, we deemed those teams ineligible for the implementation study. Forty-one Patient-Centered Outcomes Research/Community Engaged Research (PCOR/CEnR) project teams responded to the request to examine uptake among research teams, barriers, and facilitating factors for use of the research engagement measure.",

We sent follow-up emails to project investigators who did not respond.

Because we were not aware of the size of the staff who were eligible to participate in the survey, we do not know how many may have declined in this effort. Teams were separate groups of investigators and staff focused on a study or studies, and stakeholders were the non-academic individuals who comprised each team (i.e., community advisory board members, patients, healthcare organizations).

The data presented here indicate that REST implementation is feasible in a volunteer group of ongoing research projects. These projects were from multiple sources (e.g., PCORI, NIH), suggesting that the tool has some flexible appeal for many different types of research projects. Time and workload were perceived barriers to implementation of REST; however, stakeholder access to the Internet was not reported as a significant barrier.",

However, the qualitative research methods often used to evaluate stakeholder engagement also requires resources and time. REST utilization of the type we evaluated might be necessary, but there are other ways to promote engagement and use of a tool like this one to measure the extent of engagement. One strategy would be for funders to require projects to carefully evaluate their engagement as part of their ongoing research and to offer this tool as an evaluation metric.",

We suggest that mailings be conducted with a larger group of research projects and groups, to let them know about the idea of using an evaluation tool like this one in their projects. We also hope that we will be able to show them how it could benefit their projects to use such a tool over time to gauge the strength of their engagement efforts. This project only used a single tool and timepoint to measure the strength of engagement in research, and using multiple tools at multiple timepoints, or perhaps a mixed methods approach might yield more nuanced results and findings. There is a bias in the reports of the ratings of the usefulness of the results that is not apparent from the study flow. Only 114 of the 482 (479 eligible) replied to the initial request and then only 86 completed the baseline-so 86 of 479 (18%) provided some data. We do not know anything about the non-responders, and this could form the focus of another study. From this project, we learned overall that it is quite possible to implement the REST as an evaluation tool in large complex stakeholder-engaged research projects. Most of the project groups agreed with the ratings given by their completed survey data, suggesting that there is acceptability of the results with practitioners in the data provided by the REST. We do not fully know how the REST measures change over time, in response to research participation, and this is a topic for future research projects.",
