Under this context, we investigated associations of HEXACO personality with COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (self-reported hygiene, distancing, going out). We tested unique associations through regularized regressions and out-of-sample prediction after establishing the best level of analysis (HEXACO traits, facets, items). Personality always explained out-of-sample variance over and above demographics, COVID-related knowledge, concern, impacts, and goals. Hygiene and distancing were best predicted by HEXACO traits, whereas facets constituted the best level for the prediction of going out. In general, honesty-humility (trait or facets) was the clearest predictor of safer behaviors. Results corroborate the relevance of personality even in strong situations, as well as its importance for COVID-19 mitigation.",

At that time, the most effective strategies to mitigate the virus diffusion were based on individual behaviors such as washing hands and keeping safety distance in social interactions. Also, periods of lockdown were enforced to reduce social contacts and contain the pandemic. In Italy, a lockdown began on the 9th of March 2020. 2 It was not until the 3rd of May that the government initiated a loosening of the restrictions. This period, referred to as \"Phase 1\", was a national extension of the restrictions that had been initially selectively applied to several specific areas of northern Italy since the end of February. During the national lockdown, most activities were subject to a complete shutdown. Schools, universities, restaurants, cafes, and most retailers were closed or inactive. Gatherings of people in public places were forbidden, as was meeting with relatives or friends at home. Going out was only permitted for substantiated and compelling reasons (i.e., health-and work-related reasons or need for supplies). Market places or pharmacies (with the related production chains) were among the few functioning business activities, ensuring basic services to the citizenship. Yet, access to such places was limited and subject to the use of protective devices (e.g., masks). Law enforcement authorities were instructed to sanction any deviation from the rules.",

They uniformly came from media, government, and scientific agencies, and a violation of those indications could have led to legal and health-related consequences. Characteristics of clarity and consistency of the information, presence of constraints, and specific consequences in case of inconsistent behavior (Meyer et al., 2020) have been described as key attributes of the so-called \"strong situations\". We argue that the lockdown constituted a prototypical example of a strong situation. In particular, a situation is strong when it is characterized by the ability to induce uniform expectancies and behaviors, ultimately reducing the behavioral expression of individual differences such as personality traits and motives (Meyer et al., 2020) . Although strong situations have been investigated through experimental paradigms (Cooper & Withey, 2009 ), they are not easy to observe systematically in ecological contexts among a broad population. In a way, the lockdown represented one of the \"strongest\" collective situations experienced in Italy in the last 70 years.",

Nonetheless, evidence showed some variability in the compliance with mitigation norms despite the high situational strength. For instance, studies found higher rates of self-reported compliance among women and healthier participants (Barari et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2020; Zettler et al., 2021) , as well as more educated and informed individuals (Harper, Satchell, Fido, & Latzman, 2020) . Several studies in the social and behavioral sciences investigated the impact of personality on enacted behaviors during the pandemic (Van Bavel et al., 2020; Preti, Di Pierro, Fanti, Madeddu, & Calati, 2020) . The HEXACO honesty-humility dimension stood out among the most important correlates of self-reported compliance with mitigation measures (Zettler et al., 2021) . Dark personality features (e. g., psychopathy), which largely correspond to the opposite pole of honesty-humility (Hodson et al., 2018) , were also frequently related to mitigation compliance (Blagov, 2020; Zettler et al., 2021; Zettler, Schild, Lilleholt, & B\u00f6hm, 2020) .",

There is evidence that facets can outperform higher-order traits, as domain scales can obscure linkages at more specific levels of analysis (Paunonen & Ashton, 2001; Pletzer, Oostrom, Bentvelzen, & de Vries, 2020) . At an even lower level, items detect personality nuances that may add predictive validity to specific outcomes (M\u00f5ttus, Kandler, Bleidorn, Riemann, & McCrae, 2017) . For instance, HEXACO emotionality includes aspects of negative affectivity and hyper-vigilance (i.e., fearfulness, anxiety) but also encompasses more general predispositions toward emotional sensitivity (i. e., sentimentality), being quite heterogeneous. The specific effects of facets or nuances on an outcome are almost certainly missed if personality is considered exclusively in terms of broader traits. Focusing on finer-grained levels provides more detailed information for predictive and explanatory purposes (Costantini & Perugini, 2016; M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020) . However, the cost of increasing specificity is a decrease in parsimony and ease of interpretability, with the best trade-off between generality and specificity varying from situation to situation.",

In particular, we examined the extent to which personality could improve the prediction of behaviors after controlling for more direct predictors (e.g., demographic variables, knowledge of COVID-19) and personal goals related to COVID-19. We considered different personality hierarchy levelstraits, facets, or itemsto investigate the relative predictive performance of different levels for COVID-related behaviors. We relied on the HEXACO model of personality structure, as strong evidence supports its utility compared to alternatives (Ashton & Lee, 2020) . Given our interest in facet-and item-level analyses, we employed a methodology that allowed us to control for overfitting and inspect the true outof-sample predictive value of goals and personality variables, an approach that is seldom used in personality psychology (M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020) despite its utility (Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017) .",

Scores for each scale were computed as the mean of the items loading on the factor, with Cronbach's alphas in this study being 0.66 for distancing (6 items) and going out (5 items) and 0.74 for hygiene (7 items) (\u03c9 range: 0.70-0.80). Full details about this scale are reported elsewhere (Costantini et al., 2021) .

Items were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (completely false for me) to 5 (completely true for me). This and the following scale were translated into Italian through back-translation. Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.86 in our sample (\u03c9 = 0.90). (Conway et al., 2020) This 9-item questionnaire assesses the financial and psychological impact of the coronavirus disease and the difficulty in obtaining necessary resources during the lockdown. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely false for me) to 5 (completely true for me).

The HEXACO-Personality Inventory (HEXACO-PI) is a 200-item measure assessing personality traits in a six-factor perspective (Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness). Each trait can be further decomposed into 4 facet scales, with 8 additional items investigating the interstitial facet of altruism. Responses are based on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). In this study, Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.86 to 0.91 for the six domains (omegas range: 0.92-1.00). 4 As to facet scales, alphas ranged from 0.65 to 0.87 (omegas range: 0.69-0.90).",

First, we explored correlations between behaviors, personality, and other predictors. Then, we used a stepwise procedure and performed six regression analyses of increasing complexity (Models 1-6) for each mitigation behavior as a dependent variable. Model 1 only included age, education, and gender as predictors (participants identified as transsexual or \"other\" were not included due to paucity of data). Model 2 added COVID-specific variables (COVID knowledge, impacts, and concern scales). Model 3 added the two goal classes (safe and free). Model 4 added the six HEXACO personality traits. Finally, Models 5 and 6 substituted traits with facets (24 facets plus altruism) and items, respectively. Hence, we considered the level of traits, facets, and items separately. All variables were standardized. Since we were interested in the true out-of-sample predictive utility of our estimates (as opposed to in-sample explained variance), we combined an out-of-sample prediction strategy with lasso regularized regressions, employing a nested cross-validation approach (James, Witten, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2013; Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017) . The analytic procedure is described in detail in Supplementary Materials. Two model fit measures, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R 2 , were estimated for each model and used to compare their predictive performance. Lower RMSE and higher R 2 values indicate a better ability of the model to predict new data.",

Table S1 presents other descriptive statistics and correlations of all variables with the three mitigation behaviors (including HEXACO traits and facets), whereas the full correlation matrix is in Table S2 . HEXACO traits showed weak-tomoderate correlations with several behaviors. In particular, honestyhumility and conscientiousness correlated with safer behaviors, and a similar pattern was observed for most of their facets. The three behavior classes also correlated with each other. Hygiene and distancing were positively related (r = 0.26, p < .001), and going out negatively related to both hygiene (r = \u2212 0.12, p < .001) and distancing (r = \u2212 0.28, p < .001). Table 1 shows RMSE and R 2 values for each model. When predicting hygiene and distancing, there was a clear progressive improvement in prediction from Model 1 to Model 4, as shown by a decrease in RMSE and an increase in R 2 . Models 5 and 6, on the other hand, did not represent an improvement over Model 4.

More specifically, models that included goals and personality features (regardless of their level of specificity) performed best in predicting behaviors.

In this sense, our results are in line with more recent and nuanced descriptions of the situational strength theory (Schmitt et al., 2013) . Furthermore, one could have imagined that specificity would dominate over generality: The distal influence of basic personality traits (e.g., conscientiousness) could have affected proximal specific variables (e.g., concern for COVID-19), leaving little to no additional variance explained in behaviors. On the contrary, personality traits clearly provided additional direct information on COVID-19 mitigation, confirming the incremental utility of personality (Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007) even in a naturally occurring strong situation.",

However, the intermediate level of HEXACO facets improved the prediction of going out. Facets can often provide important insights into blurred higher-order associations (Paunonen & Ashton, 2001; Pletzer et al., 2020) . For example, trait conscientiousness was related to generally safer behaviors but organization, one of its facets, predicted going out. We can speculate about the reasons behind this fine-grained association. As a tendency to seek order and plan ahead , organization may lead people out for various reasons, spanning from stockpiling (Garbe, Rau, & Toppe, 2020) to lower abilities to adapt to a changing reality (e.g., a form of rigidity). As to extraversion, our study suggests that risky going-out behaviors were driven by its components of energy (i.e., liveliness, sociability), rather than self-confidence. Finally, facets of dependence and fearfulness in the emotionality domain had opposite associations with going out, suggesting that only dependent individuals may have been seeking support from friends and relatives during the lockdown. Two more findings are noteworthy. Honesty-humility had meaningful effects on all behavioral classes, both at the trait-and facet-level, whereas agreeableness was mostly unrelated to them. In general, honesty-humility refers to the prosocial tendency to refrain from exploitation Ashton & Lee, 2007) , a \"pro-active\" prosocial tendency. By contrast, HEXACO agreeableness captures the tendency to tolerate and be patient Ashton & Lee, 2007; Ashton, Lee, & de Vries, 2014) . Unlike previous meta-analytic finings including Big Five measures (Zettler et al., 2021) , our study suggests that this dimension of pro-sociality is much less relevant in COVID-19 mitigation, with the HEXACO model offering more accurate discrimination between different prosocial tendencies (Ashton & Lee, 2020) .",

            "text": "The epidemiological parameters and the social context have now changed relative to when the study was carried out, with new relevant behaviors gaining importance for the mitigation of the pandemic (e.g., undergoing vaccination). Yet, some of the old behavioral indications are still valuable (e.g., washing hands), and most of them could be important again in the near future (Fan, Jamison, & Summers, 2018) . Hence, a cautious generalization of our results to a more general understanding of norm-adhesion in pandemics may also be a starting point to derive practical implications from our findings. When looking at previous research, studies demonstrated the importance of personalizing persuasive messages. For instance, personality traits are associated with increased positive ratings of an advertisement only if the advertisement emphasizes aspects coherent with the personality trait itself (Hirsh, Kang, & Bodenhausen, 2012; Matz, Kosinski, Nave, & Stillwell, 2017) . Albeit our study did not address persuasion directly, our results can nonetheless inform future research on this topic. For example, our results suggest the importance of considering trait honesty-humility, which has been often neglected in past research (Ashton & Lee, 2020) . Take the example of fairness, the honesty-humility facet that was found to inhibit going out. A way to capitalize on this finding could be emphasizing fairness-related implications of mitigation behaviors in persuasion attempts. For example, this could be implemented by showing that doing what is necessary to slow down the pandemic leads to equal opportunities for everyone (e.g., health-related opportunities for more fragile individuals; economic-related opportunities for those who would suffer the most in case of restrictions; etc.). Facets such as sociability or dependence predicted risky behaviors: Acknowledgment of social and relational needs, along with invitations to be responsible in managing those personal needs, could ensure congruence between public messages and extraversion-or emotionality-related content that tends to be associated with risky behaviors, thus buffering their harmful impact. Future targeted intervention studies may test these more specific hypotheses, overcoming the limits of our cross-sectional design and shedding more light on the causal processes underlying the connections that we have identified (Costantini & Perugini, 2018; Stieger et al., 2020) .",
