            "text": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a high interest in mathematical models describing and predicting the diverse aspects and implications of the virus outbreak. Model results represent an important part of the information base for the decision process on different administrative levels. The Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) initiated a project whose main goal is to predict COVID-19-specific occupation of beds in intensive care units: Steuerungs-Prognose von Intensivmedizinischen COVID-19 Kapazit\u00e4ten (SPoCK). The incidence of COVID-19 cases is a crucial predictor for this occupation. Methods: We developed a model based on ordinary differential equations for the COVID-19 spread with a time-dependent infection rate described by a spline. Furthermore, the model explicitly accounts for weekday-specific reporting and adjusts for reporting delay. The model is calibrated in a purely data-driven manner by a maximum likelihood approach. Uncertainties are evaluated using the profile likelihood method. The uncertainty about the appropriate modeling assumptions can be accounted for by including and merging results of different modelling approaches. The analysis uses data from Germany describing the COVID-19 spread from early 2020 until March 31st, 2021. Results: The model is calibrated based on incident cases on a daily basis and provides daily predictions of incident COVID-19 cases for the upcoming three weeks including uncertainty estimates for Germany and its subregions. Derived quantities such as cumulative counts and 7-day incidences with corresponding uncertainties can be computed. The estimation of the time-dependent infection rate leads to an estimated reproduction factor that is oscillating around one. Data-driven estimation of the dark figure purely from incident cases is not feasible. Conclusions: We successfully implemented a procedure to forecast near future COVID-19 incidences for diverse subregions in Germany which are made available to various decision makers via an interactive web application. Results of the incidence modeling are also used as a predictor for forecasting the need of intensive care units.",

Nowcasting focuses on the precise description of the present situation based on incomplete, noisy and/or systematically biased data about the current state [2, 3] . Forecasting tries to make predictions about the near future providing policy makers with reliable estimates of advancing developments [4] . Similar to nowcasting, forecasting is strongly oriented towards realistic settings. The work presented in this publication focuses on a near-future prediction and can therefore be classified as forecasting.",

            "text": "A standard approach when describing infectious disease transmission are compartmental models or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) -like models [5] . In general, both approaches divide the population into subpopulations with disjoint properties. Transition rates allow for flows between the subpopulations and define, in combination with the initial values of the subpopulations, the time evolution of the system. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) representation of the compartmental scheme we use is the well-known Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model [6] : A key ingredient is the number of newly reported cases from the RKI which also has to be predicted (indicated by blue box). Results are used for visualization by the DLR and by decision makers, such as the BBK and RKI as well as local and regional health authorities with N = S + E + I + R resembling the entire population and where the dot notation is used to indicate time derivatives. Furthermore \u03b2, \u03b3 , \u03b4 resemble the infection rate, the rate to become infectious and the rate with which one dies or recoveres, respectively. The rationale in choosing this model class is that it is concise which is important for frequent evaluation and allows for a more flexible infection time when compared with the standard SIR model. A special characteristic of the current pandemic is the massive political and social reaction. In contrast to, e.g. the annual influenza season during which the social and professional life used to proceed pretty much as usual, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to vast political interventions and personal restrictions aiming mainly at the reduction of infections [7] . Within the SEIR scheme these changes over time can be described by a time-dependent infection rate \u03b2(t) which translates to an effective timedependent reproduction number R(t) = \u03b2(t)\u00b7S \u03b3 \u00b7N . The latter quantifies how many other people are infected on average by a single infectious individual and determines at which rate the number of currently infectious individuals is growing (R(t) > 1) or decaying (R(t) < 1). It should be noted that, despite the fact that \u03b2(t) is extrapolated as remaining constant (see Eq. 4), R(t) is not necessarily constant. This is because R(t) includes the monotonously decreasing susceptible density S(t) N . The dynamics of all additional states can, for one example, be found in the supplement (Additional file 1).",

Furthermore, w min = 0.01 \u00b7 A denotes the minimal weight factor used for data observed in the past. w min is necessary for numerical reasons: the first summand of the square root is exponentially decreasing towards zero and would (without additional second summand) lead to a divergence of the used standard deviation. The value of 0.01 is somewhat arbitrary. It effectively serves as a lower bound on the weights (or upper bound on standard deviation, respectively) for data points that are long time ago. Thorough evaluation of this hyperparameter of value 0.01 has not been performed, however it is not expected to have a crucial impact on results. Moreover, we chose \u03c4 = 7 as time-constant of this weighting step. To be clear, on the county-level, \u03c3 i from equation (7) should be thought of as first being transformed according to the mapping (13) before entering equation (6) as the standard deviation of Gaussian observation errors.",

Thus, the uncertainty will be underestimated in these cases and obtained results will be overly confident. By fitting the model to incidence data, the measurement errors are not correlated by this effect. Of course, there can be additional reasons for correlations in the residuals.

These omission from the model make quantitative assessments of death rates, (probably time dependent) risk of death and recovery rates not possible. As the goal was to predict development of case numbers, and these events happen downstream without a feedback, these shortcomings are not crucial to us. Furthermore, the unobserved infected and infectious individuals are not in an explicit state. This fact is compensated by two aspects: Firstly, the used data does not contain information about the duration from beginning of infectivity to reporting to the local health authority. Thus, since the additional state would not help to better describe the used data, it is omitted. Secondly, the factor q introduced in the observation function in Link between model and observed data section accounts for individuals that are overseen at all times. The estimated dark figure from Eq. 5 when fitting only incidence data is in the presented modeling approach in most regions compatible with a broad set of values ranging from 0.1 to 1 within the confidence level.
