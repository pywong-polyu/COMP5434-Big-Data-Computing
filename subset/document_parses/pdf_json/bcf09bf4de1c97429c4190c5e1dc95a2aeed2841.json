Inspired by this phenomenon, Anatolii Papyrin and his team first proposed in 1990 that cold gas dynamic spray (referred to as 'cold spray') could be used as a new coating process and successfully deposited a variety of pure metals, metal alloys and composite materials on different substrates, proving the possibility of cold spray technology in engineering applications (Ref 1). Compared with the traditional thermal spray processes, the most notable feature of cold spray is its low process temperature and less thermal impact on the feedstock/substrate materials. The typical benefits of cold spray over thermal spray are minimized materials degradation, wide sprayable materials range, high deposition efficiency/rate and high adhesion strength, unlimited workpiece size, thick deposits, etc. ( Ref 2, 3) . Cold spray is particularly suitable for preparing certain materials, for example, metals or materials (such as intermetallic compounds) that must avoid oxidation and heat impact during spray, amorphous materials that are easy to crystallize, and nanomaterials that have grain growth issue Wen Sun and Xin Chu contributed equally to this work. This invited article is part of a special issue focus in the Journal of Thermal Spray Technology celebrating the 30th anniversary of the journal. The papers and topics were curated by the Editor-in-Chief Armelle Vardelle (Ref 4, 5) . In the past 30 years, cold spray technology has attracted widespread international attention. Countries such as the USA, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, Singapore and China have carried out related cold spray fundamental studies and application developments. After entering the twenty-first century, cold spray research has experienced more rapid development.",

            "text": "Cold spray has been reported to deposit most metals, metallic glasses, cermets (metal/ceramic composites), some ceramics and polymers, as well as powder mixtures onto a variety of substrate materials including metals, ceramics and polymers. Table 1 gives a brief overview of different types of typical material systems investigated in cold spray. More comprehensive overview of cold-sprayed material systems and their applications can be found in the literature ( Ref 4, 5) . Materials hardness is often treated as a key metric determining the cold sprayability: very broadly, for metals with hardness less than 300 HV, cold spray can produce excellent deposit with no thickness limitations; for metals with hardness between 300 and 400 HV, cold spray gives out acceptable deposit performance but may require post-processing, e.g., heat treatment or HIP; for metals with hardness greater than 400 HV, cold spray can be used as a method to produce porous-structure materials. For metal matrix composites, if prepared from mechanically mixed feedstocks, a ductile metallic component is needed exhibiting the 'cushion' effect to help retain the brittle component, and the composition yield varies depending on the specific material systems (Ref 7 Al-, Cu-, Ti-and Ni-based superalloys are important types of widely studied engineering materials in cold spray literature. Aluminum and its alloys have the characteristics of low density, high ductility, good corrosion resistance, excellent thermal and electrical conductivity and they are widely used in industry. Cold-sprayed aluminum and its alloy coatings can be used for repairing industrial parts to save a lot of cost and therefore have received extensive attention from academia and industry. Although aluminum and its alloys have relatively low strength and melting point, they have good plasticity, high deformability and low critical velocity during cold spraying, so they are materials theoretically easy to spray. However, due to the low density of aluminum, the motion state of in-flight particles is easily affected by the bow shock wave near the substrate. Also, the surface of the aluminum powder can easily get oxidized, and there are still challenges to overcome the effect of oxide layer and prepare high-density deposits. In addition, aluminum is a relatively active metal, which is prone to nozzle clogging and thus difficult to spray stably for a long time. Figure 1 shows the metallographic and mechanical properties of cold-sprayed pure aluminum prepared after optimizing spraying parameters and nozzle design (Ref 9). The prepared pure aluminum deposit is very dense, and the porosity is less than 0.5%. The tensile strength (about 70 MPa) of the as-sprayed pure aluminum exceeds that of the bulk. However, the plasticity is poor (the elongation is about 0.2%), and the fracture mainly occurs at the particleparticle interfaces. The properties of pure aluminum coatings can be further improved by heat treatment. The tensile strength and the elongation is increased to 100 MPa and 0.3%, respectively, after heat treatment at 200\u00b0C. This can be ascribed to the atomic diffusion between particles, thereby improving the cohesive strength between particles and the tensile strength of the coating. With further increase of the heat treatment temperature, the plasticity increases and the elongation can exceed 20% after heat treatment at 600\u00b0C, but the corresponding tensile strength decreases (Ref 9) . This is because the increase of the heat treatment temperature promotes the grain growth and recrystallization of the coating material. In addition to pure aluminum, cold-sprayed aluminum alloys also have excellent properties and have attracted many researchers' attention. Al-Si alloys have high strength, low thermal expansion and excellent anti-friction properties. Studies found that during cold spray of Al-Si alloys, due to the thermal effect of the high-temperature gas, Al-Si alloy coatings not only exist a-Al phase but also fine silicon particle reinforcement phase, thus exhibit the improved strength (Ref 10). Al-Sn binary alloys have excellent anti-stick properties and low modulus, which are often used as sliding bearing materials in automobile industries. Cold-sprayed Al-Sn binary alloy coatings have the characteristics of low porosity, high deposition rate and excellent mechanical properties ( Ref 11) . High-strength Al-Cu alloys are widely used in aerospace and automotive fields. Adding different alloying elements (such as Mg, Fe, Ag, Ni) to Al-Cu alloys can form different intermetallic compounds (such as Al 2 Cu, Al 2 CuMg, Al 9 FeNi), which can further improve the mechanical strength. Studies found that the cold-sprayed AA2618 Al-Cu alloy coating (Al-Cu-Mg-Fe-Ni) is very dense and has intermetallic compound Al 2 CuMg at the grain boundary and Al9FeNi precipitates distributed within the grain ( Ref 12) .",

They are often used as the model material in cold spray studies considering its ease to deposition. Figure 2 (a) shows the metallographic photographs of cold-sprayed pure copper. The coating is very dense and has almost no pores (Ref 9). Figure 2 (b) shows the stress-strain curves of the deposit under different heat treatment conditions. Similarly, the tensile strength of the as-sprayed copper exceeds that of the bulk, which is almost 300 MPa, but the plasticity is poor (the elongation is about 0.4%). With the increase of the heat treatment temperature, the plasticity increases and the strength decreases. In addition, it is worth noting that the functional properties of cold-sprayed copper coatings are excellent and their electrical conductivity can approach 100% of the bulk in the as-sprayed state (as shown in Fig. 2c ). Figure 2 (d) shows the bonding strengths of coldsprayed copper coatings deposited on different substrates. The bonding strengths on AA5052, AA6063 and 316L substrates all exceed 200 MPa, but the higher the yield strength of the substrate, the higher the particle velocity is required for effective bonding. With the increase of the particle velocity, high adhesion strength of the copper coating can be produced on different substrate materials ( Ref 13) . In addition, the study found that due to the severe plastic deformation and dynamic recrystallization of copper particles during cold spray, there are a large number of nanoscale grains (Ref 14) and nanoscale twins in the copper coating ( Ref 15) .",

            "text": "Due to the characteristics of low density, high strength, good corrosion resistance and good biocompatibility, titanium and its alloys are widely used in aviation, aerospace, petroleum, chemical, medical, construction, automobile, sports equipment and other fields. In cold spray, the critical velocities required for the deposition of titanium and its alloys are high. To obtain dense titanium alloy coatings, high-pressure cold spray system and higher parameters are required (for example: nitrogen as carrier gas, gas temperature 800 * 1100\u00b0C, gas pressure 4 * 5 MPa (Ref [16] [17] [18] ). In addition, the use of helium as the carrier gas can accelerate the titanium alloy particles to higher velocity, so that particles can undergo severer plastic deformation and achieve stronger bonding strength. Researchers also reported the use of mixed feedstocks (Ti?Ti6Al4V) can contribute to relatively dense composite coating (*1.5% porosity) compared with spraying either Ti or Ti6Al4V alone. This observation suggests generating hard/soft impact interfaces during cold spray is beneficial and can lead to better coating performance ( Ref 19) . Coatings of titanium and its alloys with different porosity levels can be obtained by tailoring the process parameters: porous coatings can be used for biomedical applications, and dense coatings can be used for repairing aerospace parts and remanufacturing. Figure 3 shows the cross sections of the cold-sprayed titanium and titanium alloy coatings after optimizing the parameters. The titanium and its alloy coatings deposited by cold spray are relatively dense and have no obvious cracks. In addition, tensile tests showed that the bonding strength of the cold-sprayed Besides the mechanical properties, the residual stress in the cold-sprayed coating also affects the overall properties of the coating. It is generally believed that the residual stress in cold spraying is caused by two main factors, i.e. thermal mismatch and particle peening. Residual stress studies in the cold-sprayed Ti6Al4V coating show there . Moreover, different cold spray parameters and coating thickness will affect the distribution of residual stress in the coating. In addition, the anti-wear properties of cold-sprayed titanium and its alloy coatings are weak. Researchers found that the wear resistance of the coatings can be improved by post-treatment or preparation of titanium-based composite coatings.",

Through the formation of c' and c'' strengthening phases and fine/ stable carbides, Inconel 718 has high strength and good resistance to oxidation and gas corrosion under high temperature, thus it is widely used in aerospace parts with high working temperature. Compared with pure nickel which is an easy to spray material, Inconel 718 has a higher yield strength, poorer plasticity and higher strain hardening rate, therefore it is rather difficult to cold spray. Similar to titanium alloys, the critical velocity required for cold spray deposition of Inconel 718 is high. Researchers at Institute of New Materials, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, through the optimization of nozzle design and process parameters, reported that the porosity of cold-sprayed Inconel 718 superalloy coating can be reduced to below 0.3% (as shown in Figure 4a ). As shown in Fig. 4 (b), the tensile strength can reach 1200 MPa after heat treatment, and at the same time, the elongation can exceed 9%, which is the highest among the published literature. . Thus, cold-sprayed Inconel 718 shows better wear resistance at high temperature than at normal temperature. Due to the excellent comprehensive properties of the coldsprayed Inconel 718 coating, it is expected to be used for repairing nickel-based superalloy parts or as the surface enhancement coating of high-temperature parts.",

The gas pressure is 5-10 bar and gas temperature is 100-500\u00b0C. Different from the LPCS, nitrogen and helium are commonly used as carrier gases in HPCS. The gas is usually preheated to 200-1100\u00b0C, and the pressure range is 30-50 bar or higher. The powder is usually injected from the convergent section of the Laval nozzle. To prevent the powder from flowing back into the powder feeder, the pressure of the powder feeder should be higher than the working gas pressure ( Ref 37) . The nozzle of the HPCS system can be easily clogged, which is more obvious when the temperature increases. Therefore, water-cooling system is often used in the HPCS system. Besides, the nozzle throat of the HPCS system can be severely worn, which can occur during long-term spraying of hard particles. The noise of a HPCS system usually exceeds 100 decibels, so the equipment needs to be operated in a soundproof booth ( Ref 38) . Compared with downstream injection, the interaction time between the powder and the air flow in HPCS is longer, and the spray particles can achieve a higher speed. The HPCS system has a better potential to deposit materials that are difficult to deform, such as steels, titanium, inconel, etc. ( Ref 5) .",

The high-pressure cold spray system of VRC in the USA can also be hand-held, making it highly competitive (Ref 39). The cold spray system operated by the robot can keep the nozzle relatively stable and work for a long time during the spray process. Usually, the heater and the nozzle are integrated in the high-pressure spray system, which has a large weight and is not suitable for hand-held; the manipulator can ensure the relative position of the nozzle and the substrate during the spray process and ensure that the spray angle and distance remain unchanged. The nozzles of the low-pressure cold spray system can also be mounted on the manipulator, so that good stability same as the high-pressure cold spray system can be obtained. Another benefit of using a robot is that it can be planned in different paths to obtain the desired shape for additive manufacturing (Ref 40, 41) .",

Different nozzle materials are suitable for different spray powders. Chemical reactions may occur and clog the nozzle, resulting in a decrease in the cold sprayed coating quality. The nozzle materials include polymer, ceramic, stainless steel, copper, etc. Ceramic nozzles are usually used for spraying high hardness, irregular powder materials because it has high wear resistance, but is not suitable for high ductility materials which can easily adhere on ceramic nozzles ( Ref 42, 43) . Stainless steel nozzles are prone to wear and corrosion, resulting in coatings that are susceptible to contamination by the nozzle material ( Ref 44) . The clogging probability of polymer (PBI) nozzles is low, but they are prone to wear when the working temperature is high (Ref [45] [46] [47] . Different nozzle materials have different effects on the coating deposition efficiency, which may depend on the thermal diffusivity of the nozzle material and the interaction of powder particles with the nozzle inner wall during cold spray. Nozzles with higher thermal conductivity can reduce critical velocities of the powder material, resulting in higher deposition efficiencies ( Ref 48, 49) . The effect of nozzle material on cold spray performance and applicable materials needs further investigation in the future.",

The typical feature of the VRC Gen III cold spray system is the flexible connection between the heater and the cold spray gun, which can effectively reduce the weight of the cold spray gun. VRC has carried out a lot of optimizations on the system insulation to reduce heat loss and improve heater efficiency. The system can be used for hand-held spraying, and it is able to work in the spraying workshop or on-site for repair (Ref 51). Figure 7 (b) shows the German Impact Innovations company HPCS, which has relatively rapid product ). The EvoCSII system adopts a modular system structure, which can also be expanded later if needed. Each equipment contains two spray guns and four powder feeders and can preheat the powder to increase the temperature and deformability of the particles, thereby improving the deposition efficiency and the quality of the prepared coatings. The PCS series cold spray system developed by Plasma Giken of Japan has been widely used globally. The PCS series cold spray system mainly includes the HPCS system PCS-800/1000 and the hand-held low pressure cold spray system PCS-100/E50. The maximum temperature and pressure of the cold spray system is 1100\u00b0C and 7.0 MPa and the rate of powder feeding is 300*500 g/min (Ref 53). PCS-800/1000 series cold spray system is equipped with a water-cooling system. The heater and the spray gun are rigidly connected. They are large and heavy. The equipment is suitable for depositing materials that are difficult to cold spray, such as stainless steels, titanium alloys and superalloys.

Besides, a corroded component from a naval vessel was repaired by high pressure cold spray by Moog and placed back into inventory for future use (Ref 65). The component was fabricated from 6061 T651 aluminum and contained extensive corrosion damage such that it had to be removed from service. The cold spray repaired part is shown in Fig. 9 after finally being machined to dimension and subsequent to anodizing. The repaired actuator was then placed back into use, mitigating the long lead times and expense associated with the purchase of a new component.",

There are a range of materials including tantalum, niobium, titanium, silver, copper and other pure materials available for electronic coatings applied to components used in the sputtering process. Many products commonly used today have a coating created through sputtering targets. These coatings include semiconductors, glass coating, solar cell coating and so on. Most modern electronics incorporate essential components which have been produced with tantalum sputtering targets. These include microchips, memory chips, print heads, flat panel displays as well as others. Sputtering targets are used to produce low-radiation-coated glass-also known as Low-E glass-which is commonly used in building construction because of its ability to save energy, control light and for aesthetics. Demands for renewable energy are on the rise. Third generation, thin-film solar cells are prepared using sputter coating technology. Figure 11 shows the large-scale silver alloy sputtering target prepared by cold spraying and post-process machining. Cold spraying can efficiently deposit and form silver coating, which is more than 16 mm in thickness. The production efficiency of cold spray is much higher than the traditional fabrication methods. Besides, the average grain size is smaller than that of casting materials. Therefore, large-scale metal sputtering targets directly formed by cold spray have been used in the electronics and information industries, such as integrated circuits, information storage, liquid crystal displays, laser memories, electronic control devices, glass coatings and other fields. However, the current challenge is how to effectively fabricate high purity and low oxidation sputtering targets by cold spray technology. Developing low oxidation metal powders and adapting new cold spray strategy are worth exploring in the future.",

The copper coating is prepared by cold spraying. After laser engraving, the pattern is clear and vivid, which fully meets the requirements of gravure printing. Compared with the original electroplating process, the cold spraying process has higher production efficiency, less environmental pollution and can meet the needs of thick coatings so that the printed products have a better three-dimensional effect. Figure 13 shows the electrode used in the polysilicon reduction furnace. It is the core component of the equipment required for polysilicon production. The electrode material is usually pure copper. Although the impurity content in pure copper is very low, the electrode head is heated by the silicon core medium, resulting in trace impurities. It is easy to precipitate and be carried into the process gas, which ultimately affects the quality of polysilicon. To solve this problem, some manufacturers use electroplating/electroless silver plating as a protective coating. The purpose is to prevent the electrode conductivity while avoiding impurity pollution. However, its process stability is poor and the plating thickness is limited (tens to several hundred micrometers), environmental pollution and other problems cannot be solved well. The group at Institute of New Materials, Guangdong Academy of Sciences has used cold spray technology to prepare silver coatings to completely overcome the above problems. The combined strength of the prepared pure silver coating and the copper substrate exceeded 60 MPa, and the thickness is not limited. The purity of the silver coating can be kept the same as that of the powder (99.9%). The coating deposition efficiency is extremely high, the processing capacity is as high as 40 kg/h, and it is environmentally friendly and pollution-free. Figure 14 shows the layout of a cold spray coating on a central processing unit (CPU) cooling unit fabricated by cold spray (Ref 78) . The cold-sprayed Cu coatings on the heat sink could effectively improve the heat distribution and the performance of the CPU. Besides, cold spray copper coatings with *300 lm in thickness were deposited on both sides of ceramic substrates for electronic power modules application ( Ref 79) . The advances of cold spray in recent years have extended its implementation in nuclear energy systems. Zr alloys have been widely used for light water reactors due to their high neutron transparency as well as excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. However, Zr alloys experience severe oxidation and mechanical degradation in high-temperature steam. Cold spray technology is regarded as a promising approach to deposit Cr coatings on Zr alloys, which has been extensively investigated due to its high melting point and excellent oxidation resistance (Ref [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Figure 15 shows the cold spray Cr-coated Zr-alloy cladding tube fabricated by Westinghouse Electric Company and the corresponding cross-sectional micrographs (Ref 80).",

            "text": "Helium is the ideal gas candidate for cold spray to achieve a good quality of deposits. However, the drawback of using helium is its price, which is more than 40 times higher than nitrogen. In this regard, helium recovery system is a good option to recycle the helium gas. The current cold spray helium recovery system needs further Cold spray additive manufacturing opens up whole new opportunities for fabricating large-scale 3D metal materials in a solid-state approach, which has many unique advantages in keeping the materials properties unchanged and depositing large-scale freestanding parts within a short time. However, the resolution of cold spray deposition is limited due to the nozzle exit diameter. Another challenge for cold spray additive manufacturing is how to precisely control the toolpath and fabricate complex structures. Process monitoring and machine learning modules can be incorporated with cold spray process to better control the cold spray additive manufacturing process.",

The tensile strength and bonding strength of the Inconel 718 coating after heat treatment have reached a level comparable to those of the as-cast Inconel 718. In addition, by studying the wear resistance of cold-sprayed Inconel 718 at room and high temperature, a dense and continuous NixFe 2 -xO 4 oxide film was formed on the worn surface of the Inconel 718 coating during high temperature friction, which is believed to improve the material's wear resistance (Ref 23)",

(Ref 24) successfully deposited thick FeCo-NiCrMn high entropy alloys (HEAs) with helium as the propulsive gas and produced dense coatings with no element segregation. High entropy alloys (HEAs) are new member of the metal alloy family discovered by Yeh et al. (Ref 25) in 2004 and have received intensive research efforts in recent years. They are constituted of five or more principal alloying elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratio and thus exhibit their performances from multiple principal elements rather than a single element (Ref 25). Due to their unique phase structure, HEAs have superior mechanical properties, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance and other benefits over conventional metal alloys (Ref 26). They have potential applications in many industrial sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, nuclear power. Dense HEA coatings can provide effective protection to underlying substrate materials against aggressive environments such as corrosion, wear and excessive heat (Ref 24). Chen et al. (Ref 27) used cold spray as an additive manufacturing technology to produce dense Invar 36 alloy and the low thermal expansion coefficient of Invar 36 alloy can give out high thermal and mechanical performances.

The porous structures are beneficial for cell growing and reducing the likelihood of the implant loosening. Other attempts were done with tantalum (Ref 68), Co-Cr alloy (Ref 16), SS316L coatings (Ref 69) by cold spray, where it is observed good interface adhesion, low porosity, low corrosion rate and increase of hardness. Although in vivo tests are still pending, the results showed the potential to be suitable for development of a new class of metallic biomaterials. Some polymers show excellent biocompatibility with human bodies, such as UHMWPE, HDPE, PEEK. However, they have poor integration with adjacent bone tissues upon implantation due to their hydrophilic properties (Ref 70). Ravi et al. (Ref 71) achieved UHMWPE and UHMWPE-Al 2 O 3 composite coatings on the surface of polypropylene (PP) substrate by cold spray technique, which was 1*4 mm in thickness (Ref 71). The addition of Al 2 O 3 ceramic particles can effectively improve the density, bond strength and wear resistance of the UHMWPE coating (Ref 72). King et al.
