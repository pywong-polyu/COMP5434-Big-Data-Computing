We compared the SARS-CoV-2 S-specific total and neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses, and B and T cell immunity, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and blood of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and hospitalized patients. Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower levels of neutralizing Ab against D614G, Delta and Omicron in the BAL compared to COVID-19 convalescents, despite robust S-specific Ab responses in the blood. Further, mRNA vaccination induced significant circulating S-specific B and T cell immunity, but in contrast to COVID-19 convalescents, these responses were absent in the BAL of vaccinated individuals. Using an animal immunization model, we demonstrate that systemic mRNA vaccination alone induced weak respiratory mucosal neutralizing Ab responses, especially against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; however, a combination of systemic mRNA vaccination plus mucosal adenovirus-S immunization induced strong neutralizing Ab response, not only against the ancestral virus but also the Omicron variant. Together, our study supports the contention that the current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against severe disease",

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health crisis, and vaccination is considered the key to ending the pandemic (1, 2). It is well recognized that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, particularly mRNA-based vaccination, can induce robust humoral and cellular immunity and prevent severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (3); however, protection against non-symptomatic to mild infection and transmission by mRNA vaccination is relatively moderate (4) , and the reasons for this are poorly defined. Notably, most of the previous studies were conducted using blood to determine circulating antibodies and B and T cell immunity following vaccination (5) , and characterization of respiratory mucosal immunity is lacking, which is essential for understanding vaccine-and natural infection-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the newest SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (Omicron), has been shown to easily escape both vaccine and infection-elicited Ab neutralization in the blood (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, it is currently unclear whether efficient mucosal neutralizing Ab responses can be induced by vaccination, and/or natural infection, and to what extent this could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study was designed to address these critical questions, and our results demonstrated that robust mucosal immunity can be elicited in the lung by natural infection and mRNA vaccination plus adenovirus-mediated vaccination, but not by the mRNA vaccination alone, and that the induced mucosal immunity is essential for protection against infection by SARS-CoV-2, including the Omicron variant.",

Most of these individuals had received two doses of mRNA vaccination, with 3 individuals receiving the third booster and one having the J&J vaccine. The vaccine type, timing of collection, age, and sex information are included in Extended Table S1 . We compared the vaccine-induced respiratory and circulating Ab, as well as cellular immune responses, to those of hospitalized COVID-19 convalescents that we have previously recruited (13) . We first performed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) to determine and compared the SARS-CoV-2 S1 or receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgA and IgM levels in unvaccinated control (non-SARS-CoV-2 infected), vaccinated, and convalescent groups in the plasma. Similar to what was shown before (3, 14) , COVID-19 vaccination induced robust S1 or RBD-specific plasma IgG at levels comparable to severe cases of natural infection ( Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A ). The S1 or RBD-specific IgG levels in the BAL were also comparable between COVID-19-vaccinated and convalescent . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a perpetuity.",

Of note, COVID-19 vaccination failed to induce significant levels of systemic S1 or RBD-specific IgA, while COVID-19 convalescents exhibited moderate but detectable S1-specific IgA responses in the blood ( Fig. 1D and Fig. S1C ). Importantly, prior severe SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked significant levels of S1 or RBD-specific IgA in the respiratory mucosa, which was not the case for COVID-19 vaccination ( Fig. 1E and Fig. S1D ). We also examined IgM in the blood and BAL, and observed that, while detectable levels of IgM were present in the circulation of both COVID-19-vaccination group and prior infection cases, only prior infection elicited significantly elevated IgM responses in the BAL (Fig. S1E-H) . Together, these results revealed that, in contrast to natural infection, COVID-19 vaccination does not provoke robust IgA or IgM responses in the respiratory tract.",

The titers for the Omicron variants were mostly below the level of detection (Fig. 2F ), reflecting the stronger escape of Omicron from neutralizing antibodies. Of note, one out of three who had received a booster vaccination exhibited above-the-threshold yet low level of neutralization activity against Omicron (Fig. 2F) , suggesting that booster vaccine may offer some, but limited, level of protection (Fig. 2F) . Overall, these results indicate that natural infection elicits stronger humoral immunity in mucosal surface compared to mRNA vaccination, and better vaccine strategies are needed to offer protections against VOC, especially the Omicron variant.",

Both circulating and tissue-resident memory T and B cells are believed to provide disease protection against severe respiratory viral infection (22, (26) (27) (28) . We therefore examined systemic and tissue residing memory T and B cell responses following mRNA vaccination or natural infection. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated individuals had higher RBD-specific B cells in the blood (Fig. S3 A-D) . Notably, RBD-specific B cells were markedly lower in BAL compared to those of PBMCs ( Fig. 3A and Fig. S3E ). As reported before (22, (29) (30) (31) , vaccination induced notable S-specific TNF or IFN-g producing CD8 + or CD4 + T cells in the circulation, but failed to elicit strong S-specific cytokine-producing CD8 + or CD4 + T cell responses in the BAL (Fig. 3B , C and Fig. S4 ). In contrast, convalescent BAL exhibited much higher RBD-specific B cells compared to the paired blood samples (Fig. 3D ), suggesting that vaccination does not induce tissue-residing memory B cell responses as effectively as natural infection. Further, BAL from COVID-19 convalescents had higher cytokineproducing CD8 + and CD4 T + cells than those of blood (Fig. 3E , F and (13)). Within the total CD8 + or CD4 + T cell compartments, the levels of most memory T cell subsets in the blood and/or BAL were quite similar between unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals, except the blood TCM population (Fig. S4) . Thus, unlike SARS-CoV-2 natural infection, mRNA vaccination does not appear to induce significant SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell memory in the respiratory mucosa in contrast to that in the blood.",

To this end, we immunized wildtype mice with PBS, two doses of mRNA-encoding codon-optimized S (mRNA-S), three doses of mRNA-S, two doses of mRNA-S plus an intranasal immunization of S protein trimer with adjuvant (STING ligand, cGAMP (32)), or two doses of mRNA-S plus an intranasal of adenovirus type 5 encoding S protein (Ad5-S) ( Fig. 4A ). We focused on intranasal immunization in mRNA-immunized mice, in keeping the contention that induction of mucosal immunity likely occurs in previously vaccinated individuals who will be willing to receive mucosal booster vaccines. mRNA plus Ad5-S vaccination induced greatly increased BAL RBD-specific B cells (Fig. 4B) . Furthermore, mRNA plus Ad5-S vaccination induced potent mucosal CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses but not in the spleen (Fig. S5 ). mRNA immunization, with or without mucosal booster immunization, induced strong circulating S1 or RBD-specific IgG in the blood and the BAL (Fig. S6 A, B) . A third dose of mucosal immunization of S protein, with S trimer plus cGAMP or Ad5-S, resulted in significant increases of both S1 and RBD-specific IgA in the BAL (Fig. 4C) , with Ad5-S booster inducing the highest RBD-specific IgA in the respiratory mucosa. Ad5-S booster also generated significantly higher levels of plasma IgA than other groups (Fig. S6C) . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Of note, the Omicron variant almost completely escaped the neutralization activity of BAL from either vaccinated or previously infected individuals. Additionally, we provide compelling real world evidence that mRNA vaccination does not induce notable tissue-residing S-specific memory B and T cells. Thus, despite the induction of robust circulating humoral and cellular immunity, current COVID-19 mRNA vaccines likely do not provoke sufficient levels of mucosal immunity in the human lower respiratory tract that would be needed for immediate clearance of the infectious Omicron strain to prevent the establishment of viral infection. Such a notion is consistent with the fact that Omicron continues to spread at a rapid pace in regions with high rates of vaccination and/or prior natural infection.",

The prevention of severe disease after infection is conferred mainly by memory T and B cells (22, 33) . To this end, CD8 T cell epitopes within Omicron Spike protein remain conserved to those of ancestral strains (34, 35). Thus, even though Omicron is able to breach the defense of mucosal neutralizing Ab to cause infection, the recruitment of vaccineinduced circulating memory T cells during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection enables protection that restrains further viral dissemination, preventing severe disease development following infection (Fig. S7 ). Nevertheless, these data suggest that mucosal humoral immunity is particularly vulnerable for immune escape by Omicron. It is thus quite likely that the current vaccine strategy, even with further boosters, will not achieve \"herd immunity\" or prevent the occurrence of new infections or re-infections with future VOCs, particularly those with immune-evasive properties like Omicron. Thus, our findings have significant public health implications.",

Due to the highly invasive nature of the BAL procedure, we were not able to recruit a large cohort of study participants. Furthermore, the study procedure made it challenging to time recruitment or perform a longitudinal analysis; rather it enabled a snapshot of vaccination or infection-induced mucosal immunity. Additionally, most of the participants were older and may not be representative of the entire vaccinated population, although this age group is considered as the primary targeting population for vaccination as they are at highest risk of infection associated with mortality and complications. These limitations need to be addressed by future studies. Nevertheless, we provide key evidence detailing mucosal humoral and cellular immunity following vaccination in the respiratory tract. Our study highlights the importance of focusing on vaccine-induced mucosal immunity (37) and argues for the necessity of a mucosal booster strategy in addition to the current approach of intramuscular COVID-19 vaccines.",

Adaptive immunity in local site fails to prevent respiratory infection by escape variants, but potently protects against severe diseases with the recruitment of systemic humoral and cellular immunity into the infection site upon SARS-CoV-2 escape variant infection.",
