Voriconazole and, more recently, isavuconazole and high dose flucloxacillin are the standard first line treatments for these respective serious infections. However, an underestimated risk of a significant interaction needs to be taken into consideration, when both co-occur. We wish to highlight this important issue in the management of these patients through two case reports and to point to the inconsistency between different validated databases regarding this significant interaction as well the importance of a strict protocol for readily available therapeutic drug monitoring.",

On day 3 of her hospital stay, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit because of severe Covid-19-related pneumonia and ARDS progressing to respiratory failure sequentially requiring non-invasive CPAP (day 3-4) and invasive BIPAP and prone ventilation with a low P/f ratio < 100, followed by difficult weaning only achieved on day 43. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage with ceftriaxone was initiated on day 6 for 9 days because of suspicion of hospital-acquired pneumonia as well as fluconazole on day 9 after isolation of Candida albicans in urine and BAL samples. On day 15, a second BAL yielded growth of Aspergillus fumigatus (BAL 15.66), leading to a diagnosis of probable Covid associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) and substitution of fluconazole by voriconazole in a classic loading and maintenance dose (6 mg/kg bid and 4 mg/kg bid respectively). On day 18, high dose flucloxacillin 6 \u00d7 1 g was initiated because of positive blood cultures for MSSA. The dose of flucloxacillin was increased to 6 \u00d7 2 g 2 days after the therapy was initiated. A first voriconazole level was taken on day 12 of voriconazole therapy, indicating a subtherapeutic level of < 0.2 \u00b5g/ml, however only available 6 days later. Voriconazole dosing was doubled to 8 mg/kg BID on day 18 of voriconazole therapy, whereas 4 days earlier flucloxacillin therapy was discontinued after 11 days because of a positive clinical and biochemical evolution. On day 34, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initiated for ten days. A second subtherapeutic voriconazole level of < 0.2 \u00b5g/ml was reported 2 days after flucloxacillin interruption, subsequently rising to 3 \u00b5g/ml 3 days later under the adapted voriconazole dosing regimen.",

On day 1, high dose flucloxacillin (6 \u00d7 2 g) was initiated. Linezolid was associated on day 27. Because of a positive bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan test (1.5 OD), positive culture from respiratory samples for Aspergillus fumigatus and nodular pulmonary lesions on chest CT scan, as voriconazole was initiated on day 26, followed by an early switch the day afterwards, because of the prolonged QT interval and decreased renal function. The voriconazole therapy was switched to isavuconazole with a loading dose on the first 2 days. After 7 days of isavuconazole therapy, the serum level proved subtherapeutic (0.3 \u00b5g/mL), despite adequate standard dosing. On day 41 linezolid and flucloxacillin were stopped and switched to another broad-spectrum antibiotic because of clinical deterioration without a clear focus of infection.",

We strongly recommend for TDM of voriconazole as described in Patterson TF, et al [4] . Within the institution, this clinical case contributed to a rethinking of the strategy of voriconazole TDM in the intensive care unit, mainly by reassuring the provision of regular thrice-weekly TDM with rapid reporting in order to ensure prompter adaptations. A similar consideration may apply to isavuconazole, especially if combined with other drugs with a potential of interaction.",
