[1] Several countries in Europe, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] the Americas [9] [10] [11] [12] and Asia [13] [14] [15] have, however, reported cases of a rare Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). The symptoms and signs are similar to both Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and are typically characterised by single-or multi-organ dysfunction, although less serious presentations, such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea have also been reported. [12] The first reports of KD-/TSS-like presentations with COVID-19 first emerged in April 2020, [16, 17] and PIMS-TS cases have since been reported globally. [18] In the United States, where PIMS-TS is termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), 1659 cases and 26 deaths were reported by 08 January 2021. [12] In Europe and elsewhere, most PIMS-TS reports have been limited to small case series with varying case definitions. Following the first reports of PIMS-TS cases in London, England, [16] Public Health England (PHE) initiated enhanced prospective national surveillance of PIMS-TS, along with KD and TSS, in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit team (BPSU). Here we present the epidemiology, temporal and geographical association with SARS-CoV-2 incidence, clinical and analytical findings, and outcomes of the first tranche of cases reported up until 24 July 2020.",

Only qualitative analysis was performed because PIMS-TS rates at local authority level were too low to make meaningful quantitative comparisons. Geographical analysis was performed in Python using the GeoPandas (v.0.8.1) package alongside ArcMap software (ESRI). Temporal analysis was performed using published national and regional SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in England. [23] Lag time was defined as the number of days between peak regional SARS-CoV-2 incidence and peak PIMS-TS cases. Mean weight by age and sex data [24] were used to calculate Z-scores [=(value-population mean)/population SD] and identify children who were overweight (2 standard deviations (SDs) above their mean weight for age and sex).",

The selected model provides a conditional probability for membership of the identified latent classes, given the 'yes/no' value of each indicator variable. The R package poLCA (v.1.4.1) was used to identify latent classes based on the 23 indicator variables corresponding to the PIMS-TS, KD and TSS definitions, along with variables confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serology (Supplementary Material 3).",

            "text": "LCA validated the findings of the different phenotypes in our cohort and identified three separate classes which broadly defined patients with PIMS-TS only, those with KD features and a third group with TSS manifestations. Such characterisations are likely to be useful for clinical management of children presenting with such a wide syndrome. The Class 3 patients, for example, had very high proportions with cardiac involvement, vomiting/diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hypotension, low albumin, and raised D-dimers and ferritin, were older, as well as the highest proportions with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antibody, and were most likely to present with multiorgan failure requiring inotropic support and assisted ventilation. In contrast, Class 2 patients had more typical KD features, while Class 1 patients had features of PIMS-TS only and a milder course of illness. These findings are similar to the LCA analysis performed in US children, where Classes 2 and 3 corresponded to their Classes 3 and 1, respectively. [ Cardiovascular assessment was performed at the discretion of the clinician and was, therefore, more likely to be undertaken for more severe cases. Whilst most children had favourable cardiovascular outcomes, the clinical presentation of five children with cardiac arrest and the need for inotropes in a significant proportion of cases suggests that such children need careful cardiovascular assessment, [27, 28] even after recovery to assess their risk of long-term complications as has been reported for KD. [21, 29] Current epidemiological evidence strongly indicates an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PIMS-TS 2\u00c04 weeks later. [2, 12] In our cohort, a substantial proportion of tested children were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody negative. This could be because PIMS-TS occurred in the cusp between elimination of the virus and antibody development. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to PIMS-TS is unknown but would provide useful insight into the pathogenesis of both KD and TSS which have remained elusive so far. It also remains unclear whether PIMS-TS and KD represent a continuum of illness or are completely distinct syndromes. [30] A recent study reported similar immune and plasma protein profiles but different autoantibody targets among KD and PIMS-TS cases, although the sample size was small. [31] 20,26 In our surveillance, 35 children had PIMS-TS features but did not meet the case definition only because their CRP level was below the arbitrary 100 mg/L cut-off. It is likely that these were milder cases along the PIMS-TS spectrum, which needs to be taken into account in future case definitions. As the number of reported cases continue to increase worldwide, it is important to reach a consensus in naming and case definitions so that the data are more comparable between countries and across continents. We purposely opted for a broad reporting case definition to capture as many cases as possible but needed to define boundaries to reduce the reporting of non-PIMS-TS cases. We also asked clinicians to report TSS and KD cases that were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 for comparison, but there were very few such cases reported for comparison. As ours was a paediatric study, we also limited our surveillance to <16 year-olds who would be managed by paediatricians since, in the UK and Ireland, older children and adults would typically present to adult services. [32] Additionally, the BPSU methodology requires paediatricians to report cases to the investigators. Mild cases and those that were not hospitalised or had short hospital stays may, therefore, be missed. Also, since so many reported cases were SARS-CoV-2 negative, it possible that some KD and TSS cases might have been misclassified as PIMS-TS. Moreover, the BPSU was also the only source of reporting; we therefore, cannot comment on the completeness of case ascertainment, especially in nations that reported very few cases. After reporting a case, paediatricians completed a questionnaire using the information documented in the medical records, so some data, such as the child's height or parental occupation, for example, may not be documented. Finally, the investigation and treatment of cases was at the discretion of the clinician and, therefore, variable both geographically and over time with increasing recognition, knowledge and experience with managing PIMS-TS cases.",
