This study reveals that S100A9-deficient neutrophils produce higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide in response to Staphylococcus aureus and, as a result, form neutrophil extracellular traps (suicidal NETosis). Increased suicidal NETosis does not improve neutrophil killing of S. aureus in isolation but augments macrophage killing. NET formation enhances antibacterial activity by increasing phagocytosis by macrophages and by transferring neutrophil-specific antimicrobial peptides to them. Similar results were observed in response to other phylogenetically distinct bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, implicating this as an immune defense mechanism that broadly enhances antibacterial activity. These results demonstrate that achieving maximal bactericidal activity through NET formation requires macrophages and that accelerated and more robust suicidal NETosis makes neutrophils adept at increasing antibacterial activity, especially when A9 deficient.",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes a wide range of infections and is the leading cause of bacterial endocarditis (1) and second most frequent agent of bloodstream infections (2) . Professional phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages (M\u03c6s), have an arsenal of antimicrobial processes that are critical to combating bacterial pathogens. During infection, phagocytosis of S. aureus by neutrophils initiates bacterial killing through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase (3) (4) (5) or fusing granules containing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to the phagosome (6, 7) . In addition, neutrophils combat extracellular pathogens by secreting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) consisting of DNA studded with AMPs through a process termed \"NETosis.\" Within 5 to 60 min of engaging S. aureus, vital NETosis results in the exocytosis of NETs leaving the membrane intact (8) , while suicidal NETosis, which occurs after 2 to 4 hours, causes rupture of the cell membrane through the terminal release of NETs (9) . S. aureus induces NETosis, but the antibacterial activity of NETs varies depending on the context, where NET formation is beneficial to the host during pneumonia (10) and systemic infections (11) but detrimental in combating biofilms (12) . However, in vitro, the biological function of NETs in response to bacterial pathogens has only been assessed in isolation with neutrophils being the only cell type present, which does not reflect the full cellular complexity of the host-pathogen interface.",

In addition, S100A9-deficient (A9 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice, which lack calprotectin, exhibit increased S. aureus burdens in the kidney and liver (16, 17) but lower burdens in the heart with increased survival (22) when systemically infected.

This establishes intracellular S100A9 as a critical molecular rheostat in neutrophil function. Increased suicidal NETosis does not provide an advantage in neutrophil-mediated killing of bacterial pathogens in isolation but rather augments M\u03c6 killing in response to multiple phylogenetically distinct pathogens, including S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. NET formation increases the antibacterial activity of M\u03c6s by facilitating DHR123 ex vivo (fig. S1E).

When cultured with S. aureus, primary degranulation was reduced in A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils compared to WT after 120 min ( Fig. 2A and fig. S1F ). Not all degranulation was restricted in A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, as secretory degranulation was comparable to WT (fig. S1G).

            "text": "Release of enzymes from primary granules into the cytosol is a precursor to NETosis (45, 46) ; therefore, reduced primary degranulation could imply elevated NETosis. To identity NETs, a nonmembrane permeable dye was used to fluorescently stain the DNA backbone of NETs. After a 2-hour culture with S. aureus, extracellular DNA structures consistent with NET formation were more prevalent in cultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils compared to WT by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C) . To more accurately quantify vital and suicidal NETosis, we modified a flow cytometry-based assay that has been applied in vitro and in vivo as a high-throughput, quantitative method to identify neutrophils undergoing NETosis (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) . Neutrophils undergoing NETosis were identified by the presence of extracellular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), MPO, and histone citrulline (H3Cit), while a fluorescent dye allowed for monitoring of the cell membrane integrity to differentiate vital from suicidal NETosis. Thus, neutrophils with permeabilized cell membranes that are positive for extracellular dsDNA, MPO, and H3Cit were defined as having undergone suicidal NETosis, and neutrophils positive for extracellular dsDNA, MPO, and H3Cit and with intact cell membranes were defined as having undergone vital NETosis (gating scheme provided in fig. S2A ). WT and A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils cultured with S. aureus demonstrated similar kinetics of vital NETosis, maximizing at 30 min ( fig. S2B ). However, the percentage of A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils undergoing suicidal NETosis was heightened from 30 to 240 min relative to WT (Fig. 2D and fig. S2C ). Consistent with increased suicidal NETosis, supernatants from cultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils contained higher concentrations of NET DNA compared to supernatants isolated from cultures with WT neutrophils (fig. S2D ). The accelerated suicidal NETosis by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils occurs before nuclease secretion by S. aureus. Specifically, stimulating the Sae sensory system of S. aureus to promote nuclease expression (52, 53) required 2 hours for nuclease activity in the supernatant to exceed the background activity observed in cultures containing a S. aureus strain lacking nuclease (\uf044nuc; fig. S2E ). These data indicate an accelerated and more robust suicidal NETosis by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils in response to S. aureus.",

First, the use of isotype control antibodies demonstrated that nonspecific antibody binding did not account for the positive staining of MPO and H3Cit ( fig. S2F ). Second, we used Padi4 tm1.1Kmow /J (PAD4 \u2212/\u2212 ) neutrophils that do not undergo NETosis in response to most stimuli (54) . Consistent with an inability to NET, PAD4 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils have substantially reduced extracellular MPO and H3Cit compared to WT neutrophils in response to S. aureus ( fig. S2F ). In addition, neutrophils cultured with a strain of S. aureus with reduced lytic activity (agr::tet) (55) had comparable NETosis to a WT strain ( fig. S2G) . Last, to identify whether NET antigens produced by neutrophils undergoing NETosis can contaminate neighboring non-NETing neutrophils, a coculture of WT and fluorescently labeled PAD4 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils were stimulated with S. aureus. Only WT neutrophils robustly stained positive for NETosis ( fig. S2H ), indicating that accumulation of NET antigens on neutrophils not undergoing NETosis only marginally contributes to positive staining. These results demonstrate that the flow cytometry-based approach is specific to neutrophils undergoing NETosis and is not confounded by alternative forms of cell death.",

Coinciding with reduced primary degranulation ( Fig. 2B ) and bacterial burdens (Fig. 1B) , suicidal NETosis was increased in the heart of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice but not significantly different in the liver and kidney relative to WT ( Fig. 2E and fig. S3D ). Vital NETosis was comparable between WT and A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( fig. S3E ). An enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based approach to identifying NET structures has been used successfully to quantify NET DNA in vivo (56) (57) (58) . Consistent with an increased percentage of neutrophils undergoing suicidal NETosis, an increased abundance of NETs was quantified from the supernatant of heart tissue from A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT by ELISA ( fig.

In addition to increasing mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 levels ( Fig. 3D and fig. S4C ), rotenone accelerated and enhanced suicidal NETosis ( Fig. 3E and fig.

The secretion of a nuclease allows S. aureus to escape NET-mediated antibacterial activity by degrading the DNA backbone of NETs (10) . Consistent with NET formation protecting the host, mice systemically infected with \uf044nuc showed reduced mortality ( Fig. 5A ) and weight loss (fig. S6A) relative to WT infected mice. Further, lower bacterial burdens were observed in the heart and liver of mice infected with a \uf044nuc strain relative to WT 4 dpi (Fig. 5B ).

The accelerated and robust suicidal NETosis by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils in response to S. aureus (Fig. 2 ) provides a powerful tool to assess NET-related biology. Therefore, we hypothesized that enhanced suicidal NETosis by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils would render them more bactericidal. However, in vitro, A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils did not restrict S. aureus growth better than WT (Fig. 6A) . Thus, suicidal NETosis alone does not account for the increased protection of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice from systemic S. aureus infections. Neutrophils and M\u03c6s can cooperatively combat intracellular bacterial pathogens during infection (33) (34) (35) (36) , but whether similar cooperative mechanisms exist in combating extracellular pathogens, such as S. aureus, is unclear. During S. aureus infection, the ratio of neutrophils to M\u03c6s is comparable in the liver and kidney of WT and A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice as neutrophils outnumbered M\u03c6s by 2-fold in the liver and 6.5-fold in the kidney ( fig. S6B ). In the heart, the neutrophil/M\u03c6 ratio was 4.6 in WT mice compared to 1.3 in A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice, a difference that can be attributed to a reduction of live neutrophils observed in the heart of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( fig. S6B ) (22) and possibly due to increased suicidal NETosis (Fig. 2E ). Cocultures containing neutrophils isolated from the bone marrow and bone marrow-derived M\u03c6s at a ratio of 1:1 were stimulated with S. aureus. Consistent with increased antibacterial activity, cocultures containing neutrophils and M\u03c6s restricted S. aureus growth better (Fig. 6B ) than cultures containing equal numbers of neutrophils ( Fig. 6A) or M\u03c6s ( fig. S6C ) alone. Further, cocultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils with either WT or A9 \u2212/\u2212 M\u03c6s restricted S. aureus growth better (\u22651.3-log) than cocultures containing WT neutrophils at 6 and 12 hours (Fig. 6B ). Skewing the coculture so that either M\u03c6s outnumbered neutrophils or neutrophils outnumber M\u03c6s at a ratio of 5:1 or higher rapidly ablated the enhanced bactericidal activity of cocultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils ( fig. S6D ). These results demonstrate that A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils have increased antibacterial activity in the presence of M\u03c6s.",

In neutrophil-M\u03c6 cocultures, \uf044nuc growth was reduced relative to WT S. aureus (Fig. 6D ). Expression of nuclease in trans (\uf044nuc pnuc) complemented this phenotype to levels comparable to cocultures containing WT S. aureus.

M\u03c6s expressed low levels of lactoferrin relative to neutrophils before stimulation ( fig. S8A ).

In addition, M\u03c6s in cocultures containing PAD4 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils have a decreased abundance of AMPs in response to \uf044nuc, which are similar to levels observed using \uf044nuc pnuc. Last, isolated NETs from PMA-stimulated neutrophils added to S. aureus were sufficient to increase the abundance of lactoferrin in M\u03c6s, while DNase treatment prevented this accumulation (Fig. 8E) . Therefore, NET formation acts as a conduit to transfer neutrophil-specific AMPs to M\u03c6s, and secretion of nuclease by S. aureus combats AMP transfer. It has been previously demonstrated that NETs transfer neutrophil elastase to M\u03c6s and that elastase retains its activity within the M\u03c6 (56) . The elevated suicidal NETosis by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils efficiently transfers AMPs to M\u03c6s in response to S. aureus (Fig. 8 , A to E, and fig. S8 , B, C, E, and F). To determine whether neutrophil elastase transferred by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils to M\u03c6s retained enzymatic activity, cocultures were stimulated with S. aureus, and neutrophils and M\u03c6s were fluorescently sorted after 120 min. Lysates from isolated immune cells were quantified for neutrophil elastase activity. Neutrophil elastase activity was not detected in M\u03c6s from cocultures with WT neutrophils; however, in cocultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, neutrophil elastase activity in M\u03c6s was detectable (Fig. 8F) , coinciding with the transfer of neutrophil elastase to M\u03c6s (Fig. 8B) . These results suggest that the enhanced suicidal NETosis by A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophil transfers biologically active AMPs to M\u03c6s in response to S. aureus.",

As observed for S. aureus, A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils have accelerated and more robust suicidal NETosis in response to S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa relative to WT (Fig. 9A and fig. S9A ). In addition, neutrophil-M\u03c6 cocultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils restricted S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa growth better than cocultures containing WT neutrophils (Fig. 9B) . DNase treatment prevented the improved restriction of bacterial growth in cocultures containing A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, indicating a dependence on NET formation. A similar but smaller restriction in S. aureus growth was observed in neutrophil cultures (fig.

These results suggest that NET formation broadly increases killing of extracellular bacterial pathogens in the presence of M\u03c6s.",

However, expression of nuclease by S. aureus limits the capacity for WT neutrophils to cooperate with M\u03c6s (Fig. 6D) . These findings highlight S. aureus as a professional pathogen that is capable of uncoupling cooperation among innate immune cells through NET degradation. In addition, alterations in S100A9 abundance have been associated with many clinically relevant inflammatory states, such as autoimmunity (68, 69) , cancer (70-72), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (73), and aging (74) .

Previous studies demonstrate that intracellular S100A9 regulates the respiratory burst (77) , and we observe that A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils have a heightened respiratory burst than WT neutrophils in response to S. aureus in vitro ( fig. S1D ). However, A9 \u2212/\u2212 and WT neutrophils produce comparable levels of ROS in vivo ( fig. S1E) , suggesting that the alterations to the respiratory burst are likely not accounting for the increased protection of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice from systemic S. aureus infections. Instead, we provide evidence that intracellular S100A9 regulates mitochondrial homeostasis, whereby A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils produce higher levels of mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 in response to S. aureus (Figs. 3 and 4) . As a result, A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils have enhanced suicidal NETosis and decreased primary degranulation (Figs. 2 and 4) . Why the heart offers a unique niche for A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophil function is unclear. S100A9 can modulate glycolysis through the nitrosylation of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (78); therefore, it is possible that S100A9 directly or indirectly influences mitochondrial homeostasis and the generation of O 2 \u2212 from the electron transport chain, thereby linking S100A9 to mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1\uf061 in response to S. aureus promotes heightened mitochondrial ROS production and NETosis (58) . While inflammatory conditions of heightened endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress correlate with increased levels of S100A9 (79, 80) , whether intracellular S100A9 regulates ER homeostasis is unexplored. While the exact mechanism by which intracellular S100A9 alters mitochondrial homeostasis is unknown, the unique metabolic/immunologic niche of the heart may amplify suicidal NETosis in A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils during infection. Data presented here demonstrate that A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils in the heart produce more mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 during S. aureus infection, thereby enhancing suicidal NETosis, which is beneficial for the host during systemic S. aureus infections.",

S. aureus (8, 9) , Shigella flexneri (9), S. pneumoniae (66) , Neisseria gonorrhoeae (81) , and P. aeruginosa (67) trigger NETosis; however, the mechanism for the antimicrobial activity of NETs is enigmatic. In M\u03c6s, impaired maturation of the lysosome causes internalized cargo to recycle to and accumulate on the extracellular membrane (82) . We propose a model where altered phagosomal function in neutrophils results in suicidal NETosis, thereby preventing intracellular bacterial replication and enhancing the antimicrobial activity of M\u03c6s. S. aureus can survive the antimicrobial stresses of the phagosome in neutrophils (83) , which provides S. aureus a long-term reservoir to replicate unperturbed (84) . Suicidal NETosis may offer a mechanism to . At 4 dpi, organs were homogenized and intracellular lactoferrin, PR3, and elastase levels within M\u03c6s (CD11b + F4/80 + Ly6G \u2212 ) in the heart were quantified by flow cytometry. MFI was normalized by an isotype control. Each point represents a single mouse (mock, n = 3) (WT; inf., n = 9) (A9 \u2212/\u2212 ; inf., n = 12). Two-way ANOVA with (A) Sidak's or (B to E and G) Tukey multiple comparisons test (*P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01, ***P \u2264 0.001, and ****P \u2264 0.0001). expel intracellular bacteria from the cell while entrapping the bacteria in AMP-rich NETs. These NETs act as a pseudo-opsonin that heightens phagocytosis of bacteria into M\u03c6s (Figs. 7 and 9 ) and transfers neutrophil-specific AMPs to M\u03c6s (Fig. 8 and 9 ). Internalization of AMPs into a phagosome is particularly important because the extracellular release of elastase and many proteases bound to NETs limits their antimicrobial activity (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) . Thus, NETs may provide an efficient mechanism to transfer AMPs back to a phagosomal compartment within M\u03c6s and restore the full activity of AMPs, which coincides with NET formation enhancing the killing of bacterial pathogens in the presence of M\u03c6s (Figs. 5 and 9 ). Similar to nuclease secretion preventing NETs from eliciting direct antibacterial activity on S. aureus (10) , nuclease secretion also can uncouple the NETmediated cooperation between neutrophils and M\u03c6s (Fig. 6D) . We provide evidence that accelerated and more robust NET formation, observed in A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils, can outpace/overwhelm nuclease activity and increase antibacterial activity in the presence of M\u03c6s.",

            "text": "The transfer of neutrophil-specific AMPs to M\u03c6s is not without precedent. NET formation allows for the transfer of neutrophil elastase to M\u03c6s, which facilitates NET DNA translocation into the cytosol of M\u03c6s and inducing the production of type I interferon by activating cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) (56) . We provide evidence that NETs transfer enzymatically active neutrophil elastase to M\u03c6s in response to S. aureus (Fig. 8F) . Similarly, in response to intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila (33) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (34) (35) (36) , phagocytosis of infected apoptotic neutrophils transfers AMPs to M\u03c6s, which enhances M\u03c6 killing. However, apoptotic debris was unable to facilitate the same antibacterial enhancement of M\u03c6s in response to S. aureus (Fig. 6E) , suggesting that these mechanisms may be pathogen specific. The mechanism by which AMPs are delivered to the M\u03c6s may also be critical to establishing the appropriate immune response. M\u03c6s undergo anti-inflammatory responses following phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (90, 91) , whereas necrotic cells (92, 93) and NETs (94) induce proinflammatory responses. The molecular events governing whether neutrophils undergo suicidal NETosis or apoptosis may be pathogen specific and play a critical function in regulating inflammation. Our results demonstrate that NET formation acts as a conduit to broadly enhance antimicrobial activity in the presence of M\u03c6s in response to bacterial pathogens.",

Overnight cultures were grown in TSB and then subcultured 1:100 into 5 ml of TSB. S. aureus was grown to the mid-exponential phase, washed, and resuspended in 100 \uf06dl of ice-cold PBS. All infections used 10-to 13-week-old female mice, which were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol diluted in PBS. Systemic infections were induced by intravenous injection of the retro-orbital sinus with 2 \u00d7 10 7 or 5 \u00d7 10 7 colony-forming units (CFU) of USA300. Mice were monitored before humane euthanasia by inhalation of CO 2 at 4 dpi. For MitoTEMPO treatments, the drugs were diluted in sterile PBS and administered by intraperitoneal injection (0.7 mg/kg) 24 hours before infection and every 24 hours thereafter. In contrast, A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils in response to S. aureus undergo comparable levels of suicidal NETosis as WT after 30 min. This accelerated and more robust NET formation outpaces/overwhelms S. aureus, which allows for increased phagocytosis of S. aureus into M\u03c6s, transferring of neutrophil-specific AMPs to M\u03c6s, and increased antibacterial activity. Therefore, NET formation acts as a conduit for neutrophils and M\u03c6s to combat bacterial pathogens cooperatively during infection that is particularly important within the immunological niche of the heart.

S4C) reduced the percentage of A9 \u2212/\u2212 neutrophils undergoing suicidal NETosis in response to S. aureus (Fig. 3G and fig. S4D), while primary degranulation was modestly increased (fig. S4E). Suicidal NETosis was fully impaired in MitoTEMPO-treated WT neutrophils cultured with S. aureus (Fig. 3G). Mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 did not influence all forms of NETosis as vital NETosis was unaffected by rotenone and MitoTEMPO treatments (fig.S4F). Thus, mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 regulates suicidal NETosis in response to S. aureus. Since MitoTEMPO treatment reduces suicidal NETosis in vitro, treating A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice with MitoTEMPO to reduce the production of mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 was hypothesized to enhance disease pathology in the heart during S. aureus infection. Therefore, mice were intraperitoneally injected with MitoTEMPO daily starting 24 hours before infection. Treatment with MitoTEMPO during infection was sufficient to decrease mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 levels in neutrophils within the heart, liver, and kidney of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice to levels comparable to WT(Fig. 4A and fig. S5A). The activity of MitoTEMPO was specific to mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 as overall ROS levels in neutrophils were unchanged (fig. S5B). Furthermore, while vital NETosis was unaffected by MitoTEMPO (fig. S5C), the percentage of neutrophils undergoing suicidal NETosis was reduced (Fig. 4B and fig. S5D), and primary degranulation was increased (fig. S5E) to similar levels as WT in the heart of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Corresponding with reduced suicidal NETosis, MitoTEMPO treatment increased bacterial burdens in the heart(Fig. 4C) and mortality (Fig. 4D) of A9 \u2212/\u2212 mice to levels comparable to WT. Treatment with MitoTEMPO did not alter mouse weight (fig. S5F), NETosis (fig. S5, C and D), or bacterial burdens (fig. S5G) in the liver and kidney. These results demonstrate that increased mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 benefits neutrophil function in the heart by enhancing suicidal NETosis in response to S. aureus, thereby reducing bacterial burdens.Modulating NET formation alters S. aureus disease outcomeWhile increased suicidal NETosis correlates to reduced heart colonization during systemic infection(Figs. 2 and 4), the antibacterial activity of NETs can vary in response to S. aureus(10)(11)(12). In addition, the role of NET formation in the heart during S. aureus infection has not been explored. If suicidal NETosis is protective during systemic S. aureus infections, then PAD4 \u2212/\u2212 mice, where the neutrophils cannot undergo NETosis in response to most stimulations (fig. S2F) (54), should exhibit increased susceptibility. Following infection, PAD4 \u2212/\u2212 mice had increased mortality relative to WT(Fig. 5A)despite decreased weight loss (fig.",

Further, DNase treatment reduced the restriction of S. aureus growth by M\u03c6s to levels comparable to using serum as an opsonin. Stimulation with an anti-Fas antibody to trigger apoptosis caused neutrophils to release less DNA into the supernatant (fig. S6I) and failed to enhance M\u03c6 killing of S. aureus(Fig. 6E), suggesting that not all forms of neutrophil cell death enhance the antibacterial activity of M\u03c6s. These data demonstrate that NETs increase the antibacterial activity of M\u03c6s toward S. aureus.NETs enhance phagocytosis of S. aureus by M\u03c6sS. aureus has multiple strategies to avoid phagocytosis(62)(63)(64); however, entrapment of S. aureus in NETs may aid phagocytosis by M\u03c6s.
