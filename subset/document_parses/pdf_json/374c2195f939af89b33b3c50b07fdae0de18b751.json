            "text": "Recent reports have shown that bromelain (BL), a pineapple extract, acts as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment and prevention of carcinogenesis. The present study was designed to investigate the possible mechanisms by which BL could radiosensitize tumor cells in vitro and in a mouse tumor model. BL has shown a significant reduction in the viability of the radioresistant human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell line using cell proliferation assay. The in vivo study was designed using the Ehrlich model in female albino mice, treated with BL (6 mg/kg b. wt., intraperitoneal, once daily for 10 days) 1 hour before exposure to a fractionated dose of gamma radiation (5 Gy, 1 Gy for 5 subsequent days). The radiosensitizing effect of BL was evident in terms of a significant reduction in tumor volume, poly ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), the proliferation marker Ki-67 and nuclear factor kappa activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) with a significant elevation in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in tumor cells. The present findings offer a novel insight into the radiosensitizing effect of BL and its potential application in the radiotherapy course.",

            "text": "Radioresistance is the adjustment of tumor cells toward the radiation therapy and developing resistance to the radiation beams by using multiple genes, factors, and mechanisms. Also, it obstructs the improvement of cancer patients' treatments with radiation leading to radiation therapy failure and poor prognosis. 1, 2 This is most likely to occur in cancer cells of some breast tumors which contain lower ROS levels and enhanced ROS defenses compared to equivalent nontumorigenic cells, which may contribute to tumor radioresistance. 3 Moreover, one of the major limitations of radiotherapy (RT) is that the cells of solid tumor become deficient in oxygen. The more hypoxic the tumors are, the more resistant they are to the effects of radiation; because oxygen causes the radiation damage to DNA. 4, 5 So, fractionated irradiation gives chance for reoxygenation between fractions, leading to an increase in the efficiency of RT and, to a decrease of normal tissue complications. 6 Besides, the usage of radiosensitizers could overcome these limitations and improve the treatment. Radiosensitizers are substances that render cells more susceptible to RT. 7 Targeting for DNA repair-deficient mechanisms, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, and increasing lipid peroxidation and ROS contents are considered major hallmarks of sensitization to resistance. [8] [9] [10] Proliferative activity of cancer cells is an important factor for assessing the biological behavior of carcinoma, predicting clinicopathological and prognostic significance. Ki-67 is widely used to reflect proliferation in breast, lung and gastric carcinomas to distinguish between tumors with low and high proliferative activity. [11] [12] [13] PARP inhibitors are becoming important actors in many resistant cancer cells; they are also promising drugs for combined treatments particularly with radiotherapy. 14, 15 The synthetic therapeutics have shown limited improvement in treatment in addition to their side effects. Given that, searching for natural radiosensitizers is needed to establish a potential future drug in cancer therapy as they are believed to be safer than synthetic ones. Using natural radiosensitizers, such as genistein, curcumin, and quercetin in combination with RT was found to be more beneficial than synthetic compounds. 1 Bromelain (BL) belongs to proteolytic enzymes. It contains an SH-group which is essential for its catalysis. 16 It has a wide range of therapeutic benefits such as anti-platelet aggregation, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and analgesic. [17] [18] [19] [20] Very recently, it has been found that BL treatment has significantly weakened the SARS-COVID-2 infection in VeroE6 cells and COVID-19 21, 22 ; moreover, it has been also studied during acute asthma and it displayed a decrease in markers of lung inflammation. 23 BL also has anti-metastatic and anti-proliferative effects, besides increasing autophagy and apoptosis of cancer cells. [24] [25] [26] Polyenzymatic proteolytic drugs were found to improve the results of RT and prevent post-radiation fibrous changes and side effects. 27 Thus, utility of systemic enzyme therapy is capable of improving the quality of life so it could be beneficial for cancer patients. 28 The strategies used to improve radiotherapy aim to increase the effect on the tumor or to decrease the effects on normal tissues. The radioprotection effect of BL on normal cells has been evaluated recently, 29 hence the current work is designed to study the radiosensitizing mechanism of BL in vitro as well as in vivo through inhibiting proliferation and DNA repair mechanisms of tumor cells, aiming to find a potential adjuvant therapy for cancer patients.",

Cell culture MCF-7 cell line (Tissue Culture Unit, The Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA), Cairo, Egypt) was cultured in growth medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 and 95% air. Four groups were used in this study: First: MCF-7 cells (served as a control). Second: MCF-7 with double-fold dilutions of BL in PBS (0.009-5 mg/ml). Third: MCF-7 cells exposed to gamma radiation (6 Gy). 32 Fourth: MCF-7 incubated with double-fold dilutions of BL for 1 hour before irradiation (IRR). Cells were checked under microscope for any physical signs of toxicity, for example partial or complete loss of the monolayer, shrinkage and rounding or cell granulation. Finally, 20 ul of MTT reagent (Bio Basic Inc., Canada) was added. The plate was incubated for 1 to 4 hours to allow the MTT to be metabolized and optical density was measured on a microplate reader at a wavelength of 590 nm. Each sample made in triplicate. The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC 50 ) is the dose of a drug that reduces the viability to 50%, and it was calculated using non-linear regression analysis.",

            "text": "Many factors may affect the radioresistance of cancer cells such as reoxygenation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and proliferation. Hypoxia of the solid tumor tissue is considered a major cause radioresistance. The current study overcomes this problem by using a fractionated dose of radiation to permit tumor reoxygenation between fractions and makes the tumor more sensitive to radiotherapy. 42 Treatment of MCF-7 cell line with BL alone or prior to irradiation showed a significant decrease in cell viability compared to control and irradiated cells, indicating that BL possesses in vitro radiosensitizing activity against the radioresistant MCF-7 cell line. The radioresistance of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells was mention before in the study of J\u00e4nicke et al. 43 Previous reports showed that the in vitro treatment of tumor cell lines with BL results in inhibition of cell growth and invasion capacities. 26, 44, 45 It has been reported that BL has a tumoricidal activity in vitro via induction of ROS and subsequent mitochondrial membrane depolarization, later on leading to oxidative stress as well as through its autophagy action. 46, 47 The anticancer effect of BL has been credited mainly to its protease component through digestion and diffusion in tumor cells. 25, 26 As another possible mechanism, BL has been shown to selectively induce apoptosis in tumor cells by upregulating p53 and Bax expression. This facilitates the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and the heme iron of cytochrome c would act as a catalytic center to enhance ROS production which in turn would provide a background for the development of apoptosis. 23, 48 Since the growth of most cancers is partly dependent on proliferation of the tumor cells, Ki-67 and NF-\u03baB (a proliferative markers) have been assessed in the current study. Here, the regression of Ki-67 and NF-\u03baB in BL treated groups indicates impairments of EST proliferation. However, when comparing the BL+IRR group with the IRR group, a low percentage of Ki-67 positive cells and inhibition of NF-\u03baB expression occurred. The NF-\u03baB expression signal was triggered in the IRR samples due to the increase in ROS levels and protein kinase which in turn activates NF-\u03baB expression. 49, 50 Previous study of El-Naa et al 51 has shown that the activity of Ehrlich solid tumors excised from mice could be inhibited by down-regulation of NF-\u03baB and Ki-67 expression, since radiosensitizing drugs should inhibit proliferation. 52 Hence, we could postulate BL as a radiosensitizer. An assessment of malignancy in some tumor entities has shown that Ki-67 is highly susceptible to protease treatment. 53 A study by Amini et al 54 reported that combined treatment of BL and N-acetyl cysteine inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo gastrointestinal tumor model through the reduction of Ki-67 expression. Several studies have explored the impact of NF-kB inhibition on radiosensitivity in various models. 55, 56 For instance, cisplatin, one of the main chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing agents, through inflicting DNA damage has been shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity and expression of antiapoptotic genes. 57 Moreover, it was shown that BL-induced blockage of NF-\u03baB/Cox2/PGE2 pathway may inhibit the inflammatory response in tumor resulting in suppression of tumor progression. 58, 59 Further, it was considered that drugs which inhibit NF-\u03baB, COX-2, and PGE2 activity may have a potential cancer treatment potency. 60 PARP-1 is a multitasking enzyme that controls many intracellular processes, including DNA repair, signaling and transcription. The proliferating cancerous and non-cancerous cells such as macrophages possess high PARP-1 expression. 61 To gain more insight into the radiosensitizing action of BL, PARP-1 activity and relative gene expression were assessed in the current study. EST bearing mice treated with BL and exposed to radiotherapy revealed significant PARP-1 inhibition in comparison with either irradiated or untreated EST bearing mice. These data again support our conclusion about BL treatment, that it could overcome the radioresistance of tumor cells. Other reports indicated that PARP-1 inhibition effectively sensitizes cancer cells to IRR in both in vitro and in vivo models. 8, 62, 63 Additionally, in previous studies BL showed an inhibition in PARP-1 cellular proteins, indicating that BL induces cell death mainly through apoptosis and regression in DNA repair mechanisms. 64, 65 Since the essential role of PARP is double and single strand break (DSB and SSB) recognition and repair, the underlying mechanism of radiosensitization by PARP inhibitors has been suggested to be caused by a delay in DSB and SSB repair processing, resulting in DNA break accumulation and cell death, 66, 67 especially for tumors with DNA repair defects, such as BRCA mutations. 14 In addition, vasoactivity has been reported for some PARP inhibitors which may modulate the levels of hypoxia within tumors. Indeed, as hypoxic cells are more radioresistant than oxic cells, the reoxygenation of hypoxic tumors could be of therapeutic benefit. 42 Inhibition of PARP activity can sensitize hypoxic cancer cells and the combination of ionizing radiation and PARP inhibition has the potential to improve radiotherapy. 8, 68 ROS synthesized during mitochondrial respiration exacerbate the DNA damage caused by radiotherapy. 69 ROS levels may influence the extent to which cancer cells are resistant to therapies like radiotherapy. 3,70 LPO has been used as an indicator for ROS-caused damage to cell membranes. MDA is one of the paramount end-products of peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and is commonly used to estimate oxidative stress. 41, 71 In the present study, the MDA level in irradiated groups was significantly lower than the non-irradiated EST group. while the levels of MDA and ROS were found to be increased in the tumor tissues of EST bearing mice upon treatment with either BL alone or combined with IRR, in comparison with both untreated and irradiated EST bearing group. The low MDA levels in irradiated samples may be due to the radioresistant nature of the solid tumor. Therefore, there is no damage to the cell membrane to produce MDA. While the increased level of MDA in the cancer non-irradiated group may be due to the pattern of MDAmetabolizing enzymes in the tumor cells, the lipid composition of the cell membranes with a different level of peroxidizable substrates, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the presence of inflammatory cells, which can increase the level of diffusible MDA from the tumor surrounding tissues. 72, 73 Previous reports suggested that BL induced ROS production in monocytes of patients suffering from X-linked agammaglobulinemia and in carcinoma A431 and melanoma A375 cells causing subsequent mitochondrial membrane depolarization later on leading to oxidative stress and also through its autophagy action. 46, 58, 74 Also, treatment with BL has been demonstrated to induce ROS and reactive nitrogen species in macrophages as well as to decrease levels of free glutathione (GSH). 65 Depletion of GSH content may increase the radiation sensitivity of tumor cells due to a reduction in the radioprotective reaction. 75 This action of BL has been attributed to its cysteine protease activity as cysteine is an amino acid that limits GSH biosynthesis (ROS quencher). 76 This may account for the high level of ROS in tumor tissues, which in turn react with the polyunsaturated fatty acids of lipid membranes and induces lipid peroxidation. 73, 77 These outcomes reflect the apoptotic and killing effect of BL together with inhibiting Ki-67 and PARP-1, which give BL the opportunity to act as a significant radiosensitizer.",
