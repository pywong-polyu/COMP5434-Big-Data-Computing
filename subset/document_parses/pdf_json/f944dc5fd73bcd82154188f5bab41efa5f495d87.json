Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in either April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and nicotine and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco or nicotine with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. Results: Compared to people with self-identified \"excellent\" or very good health status, those reporting \"good\" or \"fair\" health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection.",

Comorbid conditions (which are also more common among smokers), and increased age were first identified as risk factors for severe disease and death in China [2] [3] [4] [5] . Data from other countries also showed an increased risk of death with each additional decade of life [6, 7] . Poor health status and the presence of immunocompromising conditions each emerged as predictive indicators of severe or fatal outcomes [8, 9] . Among the more than 7000 cases of COVID-19 initially reported in the U.S., more than 37% had at least one underlying health condition that would be considered a risk factor for severe disease, hospitalization, and intensive care with mechanical ventilation [9] . Importantly, at the beginning of the pandemic, most of the existing epidemiological information was based on those with severe disease because asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals are not routinely tested in the United States nor many other countries.",

Smoking, vaping, and other uses of nicotine and tobacco products are significant risk factors for multiple poor health outcomes in a population including tissue damage and cancers [10] [11] [12] [13] . Both smoking and vaping can weaken lung tissue and be a source of inflammation potentially creating an opportunity for infection to occur [12, 14] . However, while it is known that tobacco use is associated with severe disease, it is less clear if such behaviors are associated with an increased risk of infection [15] . In sum, the relationship between nicotine consumption and risk of infection is unclear and being evaluated in other studies globally [16] .",

Specifically, in the current study we examine how overall health status, as well as nicotine consumption and smoking behaviors, are associated with current and previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Indiana has higher adult and youth smoking rates than the US; and the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products nearly doubled in the past 6 years [14, 18] . As such, our data represents an opportunity to understand the epidemiology of key risk factors especially among asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals not included in previous research. Understanding who is most at risk for infection is paramount in the ability to control the spread and protect those at highest risk until vaccines are widely distributed worldwide.",

In each wave, some participants were randomly selected based on Indiana records from tax year 2019 and 2018 to create a de-duplicated list of Indiana residents that included those who filed or co-filed taxes and all of their dependents. Updated contact information was then merged from the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles and other state databases. In an effort to address underrepresentation of minorities in statewide testing efforts, each wave also included outreach and open testing to a nonrandom group of racial and ethnic minorities. In each wave, the random sample was stratified by each of the state's 10 public health preparedness districts representing children and adults aged 12 years or older. In all cases, excluded individuals were those that were institutionalized, had an out-of-state address, or did not meet age eligibility (< 12 years of age).",

Importantly, those in poor health status might not have been able to participate in the study resulting in an unknown risk of infection in this population. The use of cigarettes, especially daily, was inversely associated with infection. This finding is biologically plausible given the growing body of evidence that nicotine has an effect on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE 2) [21] . Though the literature is complex and somewhat inconsistent, nicotine may bind with the ACE 2 receptor, which is associated with a reduction in ACE 2 levels in multiple organs. Thus, nicotine may reduce the number of binding sites available to SARS-CoV-2, which also binds to the ACE 2 receptor [20] . Nicotine use may create a cellular response that may increase the number of receptors on a cell surface in the lungs and could be protective against tissue damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection [22] . However, previous research suggests that those who smoke and become infected are more likely to have severe disease and overall poor outcomes as documented in an early study from China, in which more smokers had more severe disease requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation as compared to those who did not smoke [23] . In the same study, smokers were more likely to die as compared to non-smokers [23] . Our findings provide a new view of the relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infections but is consistent with the growing body of evidence that found similar inverse associations between smoking and hospitalization for COVID-19, which has been documented in other countries [23, 24] . As with other studies, we lacked granular data on the duration and/or quantity of nicotine intake underpinning the observed associations. We do however know that comorbid conditions associated with severe disease and death such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, COPD or other lung conditions, kidney disease are all associated with or worsened by smoking [25] . This is the first population-based study to assess behavioral risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection. As previously noted, data on the cumulative quantity and duration of cigarette smoking, and detailed previous nicotine or tobacco history is lacking so it is not possible to identify how much exposure is needed that lead to this inverse association. In addition, because our study did not collect data on individuals that were institutionalized, generalizing to these and other excluded groups should be done with caution.",
