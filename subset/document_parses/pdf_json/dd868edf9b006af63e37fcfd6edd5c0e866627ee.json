The gold standard of virus diagnostics is the real-time PCR that is highly sensitive, specific and quick and can give semi-quantitative results under appropriate conditions [2] [3] . For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 many in-house real-time PCR assays have been published in addition to a plethora of ready-to-use commercially available kits [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Real-time PCR is suitable to be run as highthroughput approach which takes between 3-4 hours for low numbers of specimens including RNA extraction, but can take up to more than a day for high numbers of specimens due to pre-analytical procedural steps. However, a well-appointed laboratory as well as skilled personnel is required for PCR diagnostics.",

Usually these tests are based on lateral flow assays that specifically recognize viral proteins and can be assessed either visually or with a test-specific device [13] . Commonly, these tests take about 15 minutes after sampling but are not well suited for high-throughput applications. Most importantly, when comparing their positivity rates to real-time PCR results, these RDTs have an analytical sensitivity that is significantly lower than that of real-time PCR [10] . Hence, depending on the scenario, the choice of the best diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2 has to balance sensitivity, time to result, throughput and simplicity.",

Wet swabs were kept in transport media, dry swabs were transferred to 1000 \u00b5L of PBS. All swabs were vortexed and spun down prior to extraction of 140 \u00b5l of the specimen, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and QIAcube Connects with the manual lysis protocol. PCR diagnostics was performed as described previously (under review). Remaining specimen volume was stored at -40\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C. In total, 179 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were subjected to the ID NOW COVID-19 test. These specimens covered a range of viral loads from 2.3x10 2 to 7.4x10 8 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies/mL. For specificity testing, 36 clinical specimens negative for SARS-CoV-2, but sampled successfully as demonstrated by the presence of human nucleic acid (c-myc CT values between 26 and 38), were used with a PBS background. Furthermore, 40 swab samples taken from various healthy persons every second day and intermittently positive controls were measured to see whether randomly taken specimens give false-positive results.",

Only one of the 36 clinical specimens with a PBS background resulted in an invalid result, which is likely due to the cloudiness of the specimen (that was not causing problems in the real-time PCR). Clinical specimens containing respiratory viruses as listed above remained negative, resulting in an overall specificity of 100%. For determination of the detection limit of the ID NOW system, in total, 179 clinical specimens positive in the SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR, with CT values between 14.6 (7.4x10 8 genome copies per mL) and 36.4 (2.3x10 2 genome copies per mL), were subjected to the ID NOW COVID-19 test system. One specimen showed an invalid result. Overall, of the remaining 178 specimens, 142 were positive with the ID NOW and 35 specimens were negative (overall sensitivity 80.2%). Considering that according to various studies a patient is infectious with a genome load of >10 6 copies per mL [16] [17] [18] , reflected by a CT value of <24.7 in our system (n=56), the ID NOW has a sensitivity of 100% for potentially infectious specimens. Binary logistic regression revealed a 50% detection probability at CT 32.3 (95% CI 31.7 to 33.0) representing 3.7 x10 3 (95% CI 5.7x10 3 to 2.3x10 3 ) genome copies per mL, with individual specimens detected positive containing only 800 genome copies per mL (figure 1).",

It is small and can be regarded as a mobile test device, even if it is not a classical point of care test based on lateral flow assays. The total run time for a negative result is approximately 13 minutes and less than 10 minutes for a positive result. The sample throughput is low as each device can only process one sample at a time. Apart from this, it shows several advantages compared to common point of care tests. The ID NOW system has an analytical sensitivity which is close to that of real-time PCR systems. Compared to the reference real-time PCR assay used in this study, which can detect down to <200 genome copies per mL specimen, the ID NOW has a 50% detection probability of 3,700 genome copies per mL and can detect down to 800 genome copies in individual specimens. The specificity of the ID NOW system was 100% when SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens were analyzed, as well as specimens containing respiratory viruses including influenza viruses and coronaviruses.",

RNA load was quantified by real-time PCR and variant identity confirmed by sequencing. In total, 12 dilutions (1:2) covering a range of the expected detection limit from 5.5 x 10 5 genomes per mL to 300 genomes per mL were generated and measured in the ID NOW COVID-19 test. When three consecutive dilutions showed negative results, the analysis was stopped. ID NOW COVID-19 testing Testing was performed using the ID NOW \u2122 COVID-19 test (REF 190-000; Abbott Diagnostics Scarborough Inc., Scarborough, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the ID NOW \u2122 Instrument (NAT-024; Abbott). Quality control (QC) testingwas performed prior to sample testing using the positive swab provided Lot:    123496) and a negative patient swab. For sample testing, either 50 \u00b5l or 100 \u00b5l of the respective sample were added directly to the elution buffer of the sample receiver and resuspended carefully.",
