We present the case of a 31-year-old male patient with ataxia-telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome) and a BMI of 20 kg/m 2 , admitted to our intensive care unit for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The patient soon required mechanical ventilation; however, there was very poor respiratory system compliance. Cholecystitis complicated the clinical course, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated as gas exchange deteriorated. Esophageal manometry was introduced and revealed severely increased intrathoracic pressure and chest wall elastance.",

The overall mechanical characteristics are influenced by both the lung and the chest wall [1] . Increased stiffness of the chest wall that surrounds the lung requires higher pressures to ventilate the lung even when the lung itself shows normal mechanical behavior. The pressure that is required for inflation to 1 liter above resting position is defined as elastance. To assess the individual contribution of lung and chest wall to the overall respiratory system elastance, intrathoracic pressures can be obtained by esophageal manometry. The calculated transpulmonary pressures reveal lung and chest wall compliance and can then be used to individualize ventilator settings [2] . Especially in morbidly obese patients, where pleural pressures are elevated due to more weight on the thorax and abdomen, this method has been useful to guide ventilation [3] . However, high chest wall elastance due to stiffness of the thoracic cage or increased intraabdominal pressures can similarly lead to increased pleural pressures [4] , without patients showing obvious clinical characteristics.",

After three days, he was transferred to our intensive care unit due to ARDS of increasing severity. The patient was suffering from ataxia-telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome), a rare neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease, which, in this patient, had resulted in paresis of the torso and arms, as well as plegia of the lower extremities. He had, however, been mobile in an electric wheelchair. He received no medication prior to hospital admission and had a BMI of 20 kg/m 2 . Louis-Bar syndrome has a poor prognosis with a median life expectancy of 19-25 years, although there are cases reaching an age of 40 years [5] . In a case series comprising critically ill patients, three of seven patients survived till intensive care unit discharge. One of seven patients had survived for three years post discharge [6] . However, this patient had exceeded the median life expectancy. Thus, a less severe disease progression was assumed. As no other negative prognostic factors were present, neither mechanical ventilation nor extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was contraindicated.",

Initial empiric positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set to 10 cmH 2 O, following the ARDS network table [7] . A driving pressure (\u0394P aw ) of 25 cmH 2 O was required to achieve sufficient ventilation, resulting in a tidal volume of 230 ml (4.8 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW)) and a plateau pressure (P Plat ) of 35 cmH 2 O. To maintain safer P Plat limits, the PEEP was reduced to 7 cmH 2 O.",

Esophageal manometry can be used to assess chest wall elastance [4] . Measurements in this case clearly indicate high chest wall elastance, probably due to higher chest wall stiffness and increased intraabdominal pressure due to cholecystitis. Adjustment of respirator settings according to calculated transpulmonary pressures resulted in improved gas exchange. Our case highlights the potential of transpulmonary pressure assessment to maintain lung-protective ventilator settings during ECMO therapy. In ARDS, higher airway pressures may be required when high chest wall stiffness, obesity, or increased abdominal pressures are present [1] . When conventional airway pressure safety limits are used, initial PEEP and \u0394P aw can be inadequately low. The resulting de-recruitment poses a direct threat of further lung injury, and hypoventilation can delay the discontinuation of ECMO. Esophageal manometry and transpulmonary pressure calculations can identify optimal airway pressures and thus justify transgression of conventional limits while maintaining, or even improving, lung-protective ventilation.",
