This systematic literature review aims to do just that, following PRISMA guidelines in a review of over 500 English articles that yielded 62 algorithm audit studies. The studies are synthesized and organized primarily by behavior (discrimination, distortion, exploitation, and misjudgement), with codes also provided for domain (e.g. search, vision, advertising, etc.), organization (e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), and audit method (e.g. sock puppet, direct scrape, crowdsourcing, etc.). The review shows how previous audit studies have exposed public-facing algorithms exhibiting problematic behavior, such as search algorithms culpable of distortion and advertising algorithms culpable of discrimination. Based on the studies reviewed, it also suggests some behaviors (e.g. discrimination on the basis of intersectional identities), domains (e.g. advertising algorithms), methods (e.g. code auditing), and organizations (e.g. Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn) that call for future audit attention. The paper concludes by offering the common ingredients of successful audits, and discussing algorithm auditing in the context of broader research working toward algorithmic justice.",

Out of the 62 studies reviewed, most focused on discrimination (N=21) or distortion (N=29). Audit studies also gave more attention to search algorithms (N=25), advertising algorithms (N=12), and recommendation algorithms (N=8), helping to diagnose a range of problematic behaviors on these systems. Taken together, these empirical studies provide substantial evidence that the public harms of algorithmic systems already exist in real-world systems, not merely in hypothetical scenarios. These previous studies also help chart a promising path forward for future audits that can serve as a diagnostic for \"how social problems manifest in technical systems\" [2] .",

In terms of behaviors, future audits should further explore discrimination on the basis of intersectional identity. For example, dynamic pricing algorithms might be audited to directly measure the allocative harms of price discrimination on the basis of intersectional identities pertaining to race, age, sex, gender, and more. This paper joins a growing chorus of calls (e.g. [21, 45, 71, 79, 125, 127] ) for computing research to recognize identity as multi-faceted rather than one-dimensional. In terms of domains that deserve further research attention, advertising algorithms form the economic backbone of large technology companies, and they pose a number of potential allocative and representational harms to the public. Code auditing appears to be underexplored as an audit method, even though a growing number of influential algorithms are opensourced. Finally, the studies we reviewed offered limited insights on some organizations such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and TikTok, even though these organizations operate widely influential algorithmic systems.",

The study uses a conceptual framework for accountability to organize the findings, and concludes with a robust definition for algorithmic accountability: \"Algorithmic accountability concerns a networked account for a socio-technical algorithmic system, following the various stages of the system's lifecycle. \" Building on this review, the current work focuses specifically on audit studies aimed at algorithmic accountability, and synthesizes the types of behavior that require accountability.",

Still, the literature review presented by Dillahunt et al. [46] was instructive for identifying potentially relevant studies. It also posed two clear research questions for SLRs in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, which were used in other SLRs [76, 130] and also served as a model for this review's research questions. The first question is about what has been done and the second is about what is next to do:",

A scoping review is useful \"when what is needed is not detailed answers to specific questions but rather an overview of a broad field\" [118] , and our broad research question aligned with this goal. PRISMA was originally developed for health sciences to systematically asses interventions through meta-analyses, and its evidence-based standards for transparency, comprehensiveness, and bias mitigation have led to usage in a number of other fields. This includes CSCW literature [76, 102] and other computing research [153, 160] . The first two main stages of PRISMA are identification -finding a pool of potentially relevant studies -and screening -manually reviewing article metadata for potential relevance. These first two steps required a definition of an algorithm audit, before moving to the third and fourth stages of eligibility -full-text review -and inclusion -the final analysis and synthesis stage.",

While algorithm auditing can serve many purposes, this literature review focused on audits that provide public accountability as a potential means of positive social change. Abebe et al. [2] recently suggested that one of the major ways computing can play a role in social change is through diagnosing \"how [social problems] manifest in technical systems. \" In this same spirit of social change, Raji and Buolamwini [132] offered the following definition of an algorithm audit: \"An algorithmic audit involves the collection and analysis of outcomes from a fixed algorithm or defined model within a system. Through the stimulation of a mock user population, these audits can uncover problematic patterns in models of interest. \" Social change and public impact have also become important topics not just for auditing researchers, but for computing researchers at large [62] . Rather than \"assume that [computing] research will have a net positive impact on the world, \" [7] , scholars are now grappling with the larger societal implications of technology, especially \"the ways in which power, extraction, and oppression permeate socio-technical systems\" [62] . Because of this growing focus on social change, our definition of an algorithm audit focuses on the potential for algorithm audits to provide meaningful accountability to the public.",

Due to the empirical component of the definition, a boolean key was added to search for papers that included an analysis, experiment, a study, or an audit. Due to its interdisciplinary database, flexible search options, and reproducible results, the Scopus database [52] was used to identify records. Given the various disciplines relevant to algorithm auditing, it was important to search records in fields like economics, journalism, and law, rather than only computing.

Importantly, algorithmic discrimination can happen through allocation or through representation [13] . Discrimination is often thought of in terms of allocation, and especially for \"a narrow set of goods, namely rights, opportunities, and resources\" [79] . However, discrimination can also play out through representational disparities, as evidenced in the work by Noble [123] and Kay et al. [88] and further discussed in 4.2.3. Representational discrimination is sometimes referred to as \"bias, \" however, that word has vastly different connotations and definitions in statistics (e.g. estimator bias), machine learning (e.g. bias term), psychology (e.g. cognitive bias), physics (e.g. tape bias), and other fields related to computing.

[36] showed that protected classes directly affect ad targeting on Google, and later used this evidence to argue that platforms' immunity to Title VII should be reconsidered [35] . Corroborating these findings, Caba\u00f1as et al. [23] showed that some targeting features explicitly rely on protected and/or sensitive personal attributes such as sexual orientation, political preferences, and religious beliefs. Most recently, Asplund et al. [8] conducted a sock-puppet audit which yielded evidence of \"differential treatment in the number and type of housing ads served based on the user's race, as well as bias in property recommendations based on the user's gender. \" For example, sock puppets emulating Caucasians saw more housing-related advertisements, while sock puppets emulating African Americans saw more ads for predatory rentto-own programs [8] . Algorithmic advertising has also been shown to discriminate on the basis of sexual and/or gender identity. Lambrecht and Tucker [98] found that Facebook advertisements for STEM career ads, even with gender-neutral targeting and bidding options, reached fewer women than men. An earlier audit in our review showed an additional way that advertising can discriminate through representational harms, regardless of who is searching. The study, conducted by Sweeney [146] , showed through case studies and a large-scale analysis of 2,184 name searches that \"ads suggesting arrest tend to appear with names associated with blacks, and neutral ads or no ads appear with names associated with whites. \" We discuss this phenomenon further in the search section, in light of audits by Noble [123] . Overall, algorithmic advertising systems often enable harmful discrimination which poses significant risks to users' safety, privacy, and economic opportunity.",

E-commerce websites such as Orbitz, Amazon, and Home Depot sometimes show different prices to different people for the same item -a phenomenon known explicitly as price discrimination. This behavior presents clear potential for harm, by disproportionately burdening some populations while systematically advantaging others. As Jiang et al. [85] point out, ethical pitfalls in price discrimination surface even in random A/B/N tests that do not explicitly discriminate on the basis of race or class, for example. And while price discrimination is often legal, laws in the United States prohibit similar kinds of opportunistic price changes [50] , making algorithmic price discrimination an important behavior to capture and understand through algorithm audits. To this end, Mikians et al. [111] conducted the earliest audit in our review, with similar follow-up studies conducted by Mikians et al. [113] , Hannak et al. [74] , Chen et al. [27] , and Hupperich et al. [81] .",

For example, the audit by Chen et al. [27] focused on proving the existence of dynamic pricing, noting that dynamic price discrimination threatens to disrupt the market, exacerbate inequalities between sellers, and create a confusing shopping experience for customers. In other words, price discrimination causes harms even if it is not definitively on the basis of race, age, sex, gender, location, socioeconomic status, and/or intersectional identity. Still, some audits provide more specific analyses of such discrimination, such as the study by Mikians et al. [111] which found evidence of discrimination on the basis of location and class (e.g. \"affluent customers\" versus \"budget conscious customers\").",

For example, a large-scale experiment found that a search engine led to a 39% increase in the number of subjects \"who indicated that they would vote for the candidate who was favored by their search rankings\" [53] . SEME suggests that search engines exert some degree of influence over voting behavior and democratic outcomes, which appears to have guided search audits to focus on partisanship. After all, experimental evidence for the SEME prompts an urgent question: do real-world search engine results favor certain political candidates?",

One of the earliest studies showing such evidence was a set of case studies by Diakopoulos et al.

Several studies have replicated this small but significant left-leaning partisanship on Google, especially in terms of news items [136, 149] . However, the result is open to many different interpretations. Also, some studies have found conflicting results. For example, while Robertson et al. [136] found news items exhibited a slight left-leaning partisanship, they also found that \"Google's ranking algorithm shifted the average lean of [Search Engine Results Pages] slightly to the right. \" Furthermore, Metaxa et al. [110] observed \"virtually no difference\" in the distribution of source partisanship between queries for Democrats versus Republicans. Shifting the focus beyond just the \"blue links, \" Hu et al.

They found that partisan cues in the snippet text tend to amplify the partisanship of the original web page, an effect that was consistent across query topics, left-and right-leaning queries, and different types of web pages (e.g. social media, news, sports). Even in the absence of partisanship, search algorithms can distort media by limiting exposure diversity, which runs counter to the notion of \"the Web as a public good, \" as argued by Introna and Nissenbaum [84] . This can occur through overall source concentration, and through hyperpersonalization that may create \"echo chambers. \" In terms of overall source concentration, an audit by Trielli and Diakopoulos [149] focused on the \"Top Stories\" carousel of Google's results page, finding a high concentration of sources (the top five sources of impressions per query were CNN, New York Times, The Verge, The Guardian, and Washington Post). The substantial dependence on mainstream media outlets has also been evidenced in studies of medical queries [24] , political queries in Dutch-speaking regions [32] , and political queries in the United States [95, 136] . An audit by Lurie and Mustafaraj [103] provides an exception to this trend in source concentration, suggesting that Google \"uses the 3rd position for exploration, providing users with unfamiliar sources, \" thus promoting lesser-known publishers. More recently, Fischer et al. [59] found that national outlets still dominate Google search results overall, suggesting that the search algorithm \"may be diverting web traffic and desperately needed advertising dollars away from local news\" [59] .",

Similar source concentration occurs on Google News. Echoing early hints from Haim et al.

While these theoretical and methodological explorations are not included in our review, a handful of related papers met the inclusion criteria. Two studies [48, 49] focused on recidivism prediction systems in the state of Minnesota, and detailed methods to improving prediction accuracy. Tolan et al. [148] provide a similar case study, showing that machine learning is more accurate but less fair (in terms of demographic parity and error rate balance) compared to statistical models. Also, in a code audit of a forensic DNA analysis system in New York City, Matthews et al. [106] showed how an allegedly \"minor\" change to the algorithm resulted in substantial data-dropping that led to more inaccurate results: a small change to removal criteria ended up excluding more true contributors and included more non-contributors for the DNA samples analyzed, which led to misjudgments and inaccuracies.",

[154] showed a substantial amount of third-party advertisers' data about users is \"not at all accurate\" (40% of attributes among the 183 users surveyed) -some users labeled as corporate executives were, in fact, unemployed. These inaccuracies also apply to interest-based attributes, as Bashir et al. [15] show in their audit of Facebook, Google, Oracle, and Neilsen. Asking users to review their \"interest profiles\" on these platforms, participants only rated 27% of the interests in their profiles as strongly relevant. Taken in concert, these audits suggest that advertisers who purchase targeted advertisements may often fail to reach their intended audience on platforms like Facebook and Google. While advertisers would find these misjudgements undesirable, notably, the same behavior may be desirable to users, who find it invasive when algorithms infer sensitive attributes without their consent [152, 164] .",

Given this initial evidence, as well as the pervasiveness of targeted advertising algorithms on today's platforms, future audits should further scrutinize these algorithms. In fact, more so than search and recommendation algorithms, advertising algorithms are premised on hyper-personalized content that could create echo chambers, limiting the diversity of sources and content that users encounter. Advertising algorithms may also distort media by disseminating problematic content, such as false information or prohibited advertisements. As early work in this area, Silva et al. [142] found that Facebook's advertising algorithm sometimes misjudged whether an ad was political, and showed how the system would violate political advertising laws in some jurisdictions.",

With a similar focus on partisanship, an audit of comment moderation on YouTube by Jiang et al. [86] dispelled a perception that YouTube's comment moderation practices were politically biased (rather, comments were more likely to be moderated if they were extremist, contained false content, or were posted after a video was fact-checked). But partisanship is not the only potentially distorting behavior, as some language systems can present misleading information. In an audit of Facebook's \"why am I seeing this ad?\" feature, Andreou et al. [6] found that Facebook's linguistic explanations for targeted ads were often incomplete and sometimes misleading (similar to Google's lack of transparency demonstrated by Datta et al. [36] ). Future audits should continue exploring these phenomena -partisan language and misleading language -in algorithms for various types of text summarization and language generation.",

The audits that used crowdsourcing in our review (N=16) did not suffer from this limitation, since crowdsourced audits provide real-world data and can even allow for some causal inferences.

At the same time, there also appears to be a gap in audit attention toward other influential organizations, especially social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. This may be due in part to the legal challenges with scraping these platforms, noted by Sandvig et al. [140] .

Given the growing number of opaque algorithmic systems that are already deployed to the public, audits that focus on these public-facing systems are especially important. In the absence of \"an FDA for algorithms\" [151] , researchers can continue conducting audits to clarify the safety of public-facing algorithms, and help determine if and how they serve the public good.

For example, Costanza-Chock [30] explores some of these frameworks through the lens of Design Justice, D'Ignazio and Klein [45] outline a theory of Data Feminism, and Mohamed et al.

While this review did not include several audits of non-public algorithms (due to the focus on public accountability), these audits can help characterize potential and/or eminent problems with algorithmic systems. Some of these non-public audits found age-related discrimination in sentiment analysis models [44] , gender discrimination in semantic representation algorithms that may be used in hiring [37] , and age-related disparities in landmark detection algorithms often used for facial analysis [147] . Karakasidis and Pitoura [87] found evidence that name matching algorithms may exhibit racial discrimination, and Binns et al. [18] found that models used for language processing can exhibit performance disparities along gendered lines. This early evidence can help inform future audits of public-facing algorithmic systems that rely on or resemble these non-public algorithms.",

As mentioned in the computer vision section, a single imagetagging result (\"Google Mistakenly Tags Black People as 'Gorillas'\" [14] ) led to wide publicity and swift corporate response. Gillespie [66] authored one \"small-scale\" case study that vividly demonstrated the social and political complexity of internet search using just one search term (\"santorum\"). Another salient example is the paper by Noble [123] , which exposed significant problems using a single screenshot of a Google search for \"black girls. \" For these empirical examples, small scale is a strength rather than a weakness, as they provide extremely powerful evidence for diagnosing \"how [social problems] manifest in technical systems\" [2] , especially in terms of representational harms [13] . As framed by Benjamin [17] , case studies may surface a \"glitch\" pointing to a broader representational harm, which could then guide justice-oriented changes or inform larger-scale studies.",

The review shows that algorithm audits have diagnosed a range of problematic machine behaviors, such as discrimination in advertising algorithms and distortion in search algorithms. These studies provide empirical evidence that the public harms of algorithmic systems are not theoretical conjectures, rather, they play out in real-world public systems affecting millions of people. The review also suggests that some areas are ripe for future algorithm audits, including addressing discrimination in terms of intersectional identities, further exploring advertising algorithms which are the economic backbone of large technology companies, and employing under-explored methods such as code auditing. Some organizations (e.g. Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn) also deserve further attention. If future audits continue to examine public-facing algorithms, hone in on specific problematic behavior(s), and use compelling baselines, then the field of algorithm auditing can continue holding algorithmic systems accountable by diagnosing harms they pose to the public.",
