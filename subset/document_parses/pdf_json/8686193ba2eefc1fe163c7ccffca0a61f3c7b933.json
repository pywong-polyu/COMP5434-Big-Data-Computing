By draining one's resources (6, 7) and coping capacity, trauma exposure and PTS symptoms heighten one's sensitivity to stress (8, 9) . One late study in a sample of 976 adults indicated that history of trauma exposure and resultant PTS were associated with an elevated risk for psychological distress following COVID-19 (10) . This finding leads us to suspect that whether individuals who experienced natural disaster (e.g., earthquake) could have greater risks of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Three specific objectives were as follows: (a) to investigate depression and anxiety prevalence rates among 362 earthquake survivors during the pandemic outbreak; (b) to examine the effect of perceived social support in relation to depression and anxiety; and (c) to explore the differences in the relationship between perceived social support and mental health among survivors who suffer from different levels of earthquake exposure severity. It was hypothesized that perceived social support would be negatively associated with depression/anxiety. Earthquake exposure severity would moderate the direct association between perceived social support and mental health. Specifically, people suffering from greater degree of earthquake exposure are more likely to perceive greater social support, leading to fewer mental health problems. To control the quality of the survey responses, exclusion criteria included was that \"missing information >25%\" and \"response time <5 min.\" Finally, 362 participants were included in the subsequent analyses. The chi-square test and t-test were used to compare the participants who participated in the web-based survey during the COVID-19 outbreak with those whose did not in major variables at baseline. There was no significant difference in age (t = \u22121.05, p = 0.292) and earthquake exposure (t = \u22120.79, p = 0.431) between these two groups. Men were less likely to participate (\u03c7 2 = 15.90, p < 0.001), mainly because they were more likely to drop out at school age. Among participants, 93.6% (N = 339) of the survivors lived in Sichuan Province during the survey period, which was a low infection risk area with <1,000 cumulative confirmed cases during the COVID-19 outbreak (24) . Researchers sent the informed consent and a specific web link or quick response (QR) code to participants through their contact information (e.g., QQ, WeChat, or SMS). Participants completed the online survey by clicking the questionnaire link or scanning the QR code of the questionnaire with mobile phones. This study was entirely voluntary; interested participants needed to sign an electronic informed consent form before the survey and could quit at any time. The ethics board of the South China Normal University (SCNU-PSY-2020-01-001) examined and approved the project. Participants were also provided psychological counseling from the School of Psychology, South China Normal University. If needed, participants can also assess free online psychological counseling service (\"Xin-Qing\"Hotline) from the School of Psychology of South China Normal University.",

Pearson correlations were examined among earthquake exposure, MSPSS, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Meanwhile, PROCESS was used to examine the mediation hypotheses, with 5,000 iterations to estimate the effect size of models (34) . Harman's one-factor test was conducted to examine common method variance before regression analysis (35) . The moderation effect was tested: MSPSS score was entered as the predictor, earthquake exposure was entered as the moderator, and PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score was entered as the outcome. Simple slopes were calculated for high, medium, and low levels of earthquake exposure (using the mean score and cutoffs either one standard deviation above or below the mean), to determine the level at which perceived social support starts to have a significant correlation with earthquake exposure. Sample characteristics and pandemic-related factors were also included in the current analyses as covariates. ",

The effect of perceived social support on depression or anxiety significantly differed at varying levels of prior earthquake exposure. Specifically, social support had a stronger protective effect on mental health among survivors who had greater earthquake exposure. Although scholars proposed that trauma was a vital risk factor for individuals' mental health issues (46) , prior trauma exposure might also have salutogenic effects. Recent evidence found that people with high trauma exposure were more likely to experience posttraumatic growth (PTG) (47) , which denoted the tendency to report a positive transformation in the aftermath of a trauma exposure (48) . Scrutinizing the empirical literature also found that participants with higher PTSD symptoms were more likely to grow from the impact of the trauma (49, 50) . Theoretically, PTG might indicate perceived change rather than reflect actual growth (51) . It could also be understood as a motivated positive illusion that served a protective function (52) . We speculated that these improved personal resources and qualities [e.g., resilience (53) ] that precipitated from past adversities acted as active protective factors that could be set in motion as one facing adversities again (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).",

Before the disaster, they were both students of junior and senior school (Grades 7-12). Therefore, generalizations of our findings to sufferers of other traumatic experiences or of different age groups need to be done with caution. Second, there was a high attrition rate in the present study, which may lead to affect the accuracy of results. The time interval between the two surveys was more than 11 years, resulting in a high attrition rate. Although no significant differences were found for earthquake exposure between participants who followed up and those lost to follow-up, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Third, depression and anxiety variables relied on self-report questionnaires, which might cause potential reporting bias in the data collection. Meanwhile, other important factors that might affect the study findings, such as PTG or actual support, were not examined. In addition, depression and anxiety among the current sample needed to be further assessed longitudinally. Mental healthcare should still be provided to those prior trauma survivors at risk in the aftermath of the pandemic.",
