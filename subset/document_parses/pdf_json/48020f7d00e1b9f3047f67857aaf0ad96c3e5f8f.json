            "text": "Background Rituximab and tacrolimus are therapies reserved for patients with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome who have failed conventional steroid-sparing agents. Given their toxicities, demonstrating non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus may enable choice between these medications. Methods This investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label, pilot randomized controlled trial examined the non-inferiority of two doses of intravenous (IV) rituximab given one-week apart to oral therapy with tacrolimus (1:1 allocation), in maintaining sustained remission over 12 months follow-up, in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, defined as frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent disease that had failed \u2265 2 steroid-sparing strategies. Secondary outcomes included frequency of relapses, proportion with frequent relapses, time to relapse and frequent relapses, and adverse events (CTRI/2018/11/016342). Results Baseline characteristics were comparable for 41 patients randomized to receive rituximab (n = 21) or tacrolimus (n = 20). While 55% of patients in each limb were in sustained remission at 1 year, non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus was not demonstrated (mean difference 0%; 95% CI -30.8%, 30.8%; non-inferiority limit -20%; P = 0.50). Frequent relapses were more common in patients administered rituximab compared to tacrolimus (risk difference 30%, 95% CI 7.0, 53.0, P = 0.023). Both groups showed similar reductions in relapse rates and prednisolone use. Common adverse events were infusion-related with rituximab and gastrointestinal symptoms with tacrolimus. Conclusions Therapy with rituximab was not shown to be non-inferior to 12-months treatment with tacrolimus in maintaining remission in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Frequent relapses were more common with rituximab. While effective, both agents require close monitoring for adverse events.",

            "text": "Approximately 40-50% of patients with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome have frequently relapsing or steroiddependent disease. These patients are considered for therapy with steroid-sparing agents because of the morbidities associated with relapses and the risk of corticosteroid toxicity [1] . While the recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines suggest levamisole or cyclophosphamide as preferred agents in patients with frequent relapses, they advise that the choice of the glucocorticoid-sparing agent in steroid dependence should be guided by patient and physician preference, likely adherence to therapy, and adverse effects, costs and availability of the medication [2] . In many regions of the world, patients with frequent relapses or steroid dependence usually receive initial therapy with prednisone on alternate days, cyclophosphamide, levamisole, and/or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), failing which they are considered difficult-to-treat, and managed with either calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) or intravenous (IV) rituximab [1] . Therapy with ciclosporin or tacrolimus sustains satisfactory remission in the majority, but is reserved for later considering the risks of nephrotoxicity and metabolic adverse events [3] . Likewise, while B-lymphocyte depletion enables significant steroid-sparing and sustained remission for 6-15 months, rituximab therapy is associated with the risk of infusion reactions and hypogammaglobulinemia, particularly in young children [3] . Given a choice, physicians and parents prefer rituximab to CNI in patients with difficult-to-treat disease because of its perceived safety and ease of adherence to therapy. Evidence to guide this decision for patients with steroid-sensitive disease is limited to one retrospective series [4] and a single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) [5] on patients with mild disease, and show conflicting results, possibly related to differences in age at therapy and disease severity. Therefore, this pilot RCT was planned to examine the non-inferiority of two doses of IV rituximab to 12 months of therapy with oral tacrolimus in sustaining remission in patients with difficult-to-treat frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.",

The lower end of the two-sided 95% CI of the risk difference in the primary outcome of sustained remission at 12 months was below -20 percentage points; P value for non-inferiority of 0.50 did not meet the prespecified alpha level of P < 0.025. Per the statistical analysis plan, no test for non-inferiority was performed for the secondary outcomes of frequent relapses and treatment failure (composite of frequent relapses, late steroid resistance; CTCAE grade 4-5 adverse events related to intervention or corticosteroids; or occurrence of two or more serious adverse events related to disease or intervention) at 12 months ",

Baseline characteristics show selection of patients with prolonged steroid-dependent or frequently relapsing disease that had failed previous therapies, with significant steroid toxicity. Therapy with both agents enabled significant reduction in relapses and corticosteroid requirement compared to baseline, and improved anthropometric scores and blood pressure. While the proportions of patients with sustained remission were similar, non-inferiority of rituximab was not demonstrated. Although no patient relapsed during rituximab-induced B cell depletion, relapses beyond 6 months of therapy led to treatment failure in one-third of these patients. Relapses in the tacrolimus group were associated with low median trough levels, indicating the need for more frequent monitoring of drug levels and medication adherence using compliance questionnaires. The impact of the study is limited by its small size which led to inability to demonstrate the non-inferiority of rituximab in sustaining remission or claim superiority of tacrolimus in preventing frequent relapses. While the management of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome is challenging, most patients attain satisfactory remission following prolonged therapy with prednisone and/ or corticosteroid-sparing medications such as levamisole, cyclophosphamide, or MMF [17] . Therapy with CNI and rituximab is usually reserved for patients who continue to relapse frequently despite use of these agents, and/or show corticosteroid adverse effects. The reluctance to use these therapies early in the disease course stems from the risk of adverse effects, comprising chiefly nephrotoxicity with use of CNI [18] , and infusion-related reactions, serious infections, and hypogammaglobulinemia with rituximab [3, 19] .",

Conforming to our previous definition, we included patients with frequent relapses or steroid dependence who did not show satisfactory response to at least two strategies [4, 31, 32] . This definition was also endorsed in the revised guidelines of the Indian Society of Pediatric Nephrology [1] . Thus, the study was limited to patients with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome in whom therapy with rituximab or CNI had not been used, so as to objectively examine the safety and efficacy of these two medications. Both groups of patients had received two or more therapies for frequent relapses, chiefly levamisole and cyclophosphamide; the use of MMF was restricted to less than one-third of patients, likely due to outof-pocket costs and uncertain efficacy in absence of access to therapeutic drug monitoring. All patients had significant corticosteroid toxicity, precluding use of milder therapies.

In contrast, in the present study, only 55% patients in either group sustained remission for 1 year, and therapy with rituximab was associated with treatment failure more often than tacrolimus. While patients receiving tacrolimus fared similarly in the two studies, the variable outcomes following therapy with rituximab may be explained by the difference in disease severity. The rates of rituximab-induced sustained remission at 1 year were 25-66% in studies enrolling steroid-and/or CNI-dependent patients [26] [27] [28] 30] , and 87% in a study on patients with low-threshold steroiddependence [29] .",

B lymphocyte subsets, such as memory B cells, and IgG levels were not monitored during therapy with rituximab. While confounding was avoided by stratified randomization, findings on post hoc analysis are limited by the small study size. Despite these limitations, this pilot trial enrolled a homogeneous population with severe disease, with careful attention to aspects of efficacy as well as safety, and reports outcomes using both per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat analysis without any attrition. The comparative efficacy of the two agents requires closer re-evaluation in adequately powered multicenter studies on patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Since the efficacy of rituximab wanes following B cell repopulation, future studies might examine the noninferiority or superiority of a protocol involving redosing with rituximab every 6-12 months to sustain B cell depletion. Assessment of the safety of therapy would require evaluations for nephrotoxicity and hypogammaglobulinemia during 18-24 months follow-up.",
