            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has been a pandemic disease of which the termination is not yet predictable. Currently, researches to develop vaccines and treatments is going on globally to cope with this disastrous disease. Main protease (3CLpro) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the good targets to find antiviral agents before vaccines are available. Some flavonoids are known to inhibit 3CLpro from SARS-CoV which causes SARS. Since their sequence identity is 96%, a similar approach was performed with a flavonoid library. Baicalin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin have been discovered to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. An in silico docking study showed that the binding modes of herbacetin and pectolinarin are similar to those obtained from the catalytic domain of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. However, their binding affinities are different due to the usage of whole SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in this study. Baicalin showed an effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and its docking mode is different from those of herbacetin and pectolinarin. This study suggests important scaffolds to design 3CLpro inhibitors to develop antiviral agents or health-foods and dietary supplements to cope with SARS-CoV-2.",

Like the SARS and MERS-CoV genomes, SARS-CoV-2 includes two open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b, each translated as two viral multi-protein pp1a and pp1ab by host ribosomes. ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3 C-like protease (3CLpro). PLpro cleaves the first three sites at 181-182, 818-819, and 2763-2764 at the Nterminus and 3CLpro cuts at the remaining 11 sites at the C-terminus, and forming 15 non-structural proteins (nsp) 6, 7 . The crystal structure of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2 has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (6LU7) and revealed the homodimeric form almost similar to that of SARS-CoV. They share common 294 same amino acids out of 306 residues and thus their sequence identity is 96%. Except for two amino acids Ser46 and Val86, none is different in the active site pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The putative cleavage sites of 16 nsp of SARS-CoV-2 predicted by bioinformatics contain QS and QA which are the same amino acid sequences found in 16 non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV. It coincides with the conserved active site together with 96% sequence identity of both 3CLpros. Therefore, in the proteolytic site, both 3CLpros may prefer glutamine at P1 position. P2, P3, and P4 positions may require leucine, basic residues, small hydrophobic residues, respectively 8 . At P1 0 , P2 0 , and P3 0 positions, small residues are predicted for the two former sites and no strong preference for the last.",

A synthetic peptide labelled with an EDANS-DABCYL FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair was used to probe SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitory compounds. With the FRET pair, an in-house flavonoid library was screened. For a molecular level study, we performed the proteolytic assay with flavonoids followed by an induced-fit docking experiment with top hits. With the results, we investigated a structural and functional relationship of flavonoids endowing binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

This substrate contains the nsp4/nsp5 cleavage sequence, GVLQ#SG 10 , and works as a generic peptide substrate for many coronaviruses including the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The peptide was dissolved in distilled water and incubated with each protease. A SpectraMax i3x Multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) was used to measure spectral-based fluorescence. The proteolytic activity was determined at 310 K by following the increase in fluorescence (k excitation \u00bc 340 nm, k emission \u00bc 490 nm, bandwidths \u00bc 9, 15 nm, respectively) of EDANS upon peptide hydrolysis as a function of time. Assays were conducted in black, 96-well plates (Nunc) in 300 ll assay buffers containing protease and substrate as follow; For the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay, 2.04 ll of 0.294 mM protease containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 was incubated with 7.5 ll of 0.1 mM substrate at 310 K for 2 h 30 min before measuring Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU). Before the assay, the emission spectra of antiviral agents and some of their adjuvants were surveyed after illuminating at 340 nm to avoid the overlapping with the emission spectrum of EDANS. Every compound was suitable to be tested. The final concentration of the protease, peptide, and chemical used at the assay was 2 mM, 2.5 mM and 80 mM each. At first, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and chemical were mixed and preincubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate and each well was incubated at 310 K for 2 h 30 min. After that, we measured the fluorescence of the mixture on the black 96-well plate using the endpoint mode of SpectraMax i3x where the excitation wavelength was fixed to 340 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 490 nm using 9, 15 nm bandwidth, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Among the first seventy flavonoids (Supplementary Table 1 ), one of them was picked up to further assay at a concentration range of 4 mM $ 240 mM. The IC 50 value which is the value causing 50% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 7.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).",

We applied the library to assay SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Using 70 flavonoids, an inhibitory effect of each compound at 80 mM was tested. Five flavones; orientin (8-b-D-glucopyranosyl-3 0 ,4 0 ,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone), baicalin (7-D-Glucuronic acid-5,6-dihydroxyflavone), pectolinarin (5,7-dihydroxy 4 0 ,6-dimethoxyflavone 7rutinoside), homoplantaginin (6-methoxyapigenin 7-O-glucoside), rhoifolin (apigenin-7-O-rhamnoglucoside) and two flavonols; herbacetin (3,4 0 ,5,7,8-pentahydroxyflavone), rutin (3,3 0 ,4 0 ,5,7-Pentahydroxyflavone-3-rutinoside) were found to have inhibitory activity. Among them, baicalin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin were found to have prominent inhibitory activity. The binding affinity data were plotted as log inhibitor concentration versus percent fluorescence inhibition (Figure 2 ). The compound showed the severely reduced fluorescent intensity and thus represented their SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitory activity. The IC 50 values were calculated from the dose-dependent inhibitory curves of baicalin, herbacetin and pectolinarin. The measured values were 34.71 mM, 53.90 mM and 51.64 mM, respectively. Since flavonoids are known to be aggregated through complexity and thus non-specifically inhibit various proteases, the assay in the presence of Triton X-100 was also performed 15 . Before the examination, we tested the effects of Triton X-100 on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. There was no difference in catalyst activity with or without 0.01% Triton X-100. Therefore, the assay was performed at a concentration of 0.01% Triton X-100.",

Thus, if the tryptophan is properly located in the protein, the change in fluorescence intensity can reflect the binding state of the chemicals and can be used to determine the interaction between the protein and the chemical. The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro contains three tryptophan residues. Therefore, its fluorescence change can reflect the environmental variation of the protein. The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro used in this study displays a fluorescence peak at 340 nm after the tryptophan excitation wavelength of 295 nm. We monitored the change of the fluorescence intensities depending on the presence or absence of all flavonoids. Since each compound in the flavonoid library was almost non-fluorescent under experimental conditions, the change in fluorescence intensity reflects the interaction between the protein and chemical. The decreased emission intensity confirmed the complex formation between the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and the inhibitory compound ( Figure 3 ).",

Currently, some compounds designed for other RNA viruses such as favipiravir, lopinavir, and tenofovir have been used in clinical trials in patients with COVID-19 (http://clinicaltrials.gov). Therefore, designing chemicals targeting directly against specific enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 is very important. As mentioned above 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 is a good target to design inhibitory chemicals since some flavonoids inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro 21 .

However, other four flavonoids (orientin, baicalin, homoplantaginin, and rutin) were also detected though their efficiency was low (data not shown). It is actually expected due to the 96% sequence identity of the two 3CLpro. Interestingly, the affinity of rhoifolin became weaken but the affinity of baicalin became stronger with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The efficiency of two flavonoids (herbacetin and pectolinarin) was still promising. Considering almost the same active site composition of both 3CLpros, the different binding affinity seemed to be a bit strange. However, this difference could be explained by the two factors. At first, the difference may be originated from the different constructs used in both cases. In this study, we used the whole SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro but the catalytic domain of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (amino acids Met1-Thr196) had been used in the previous study. In the crystal structures of both 3CLpros, there is a dimerisation domain influencing proteolytic activity. That domain was not in the previous SARS-CoV 3CLpro study. Nevertheless, a long incubation result showed that the proteolytic function of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro is still present without the dimerisation domain. Second, there are some different residues comprising active site residues. Ser46 and Val86 in SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro are replaced by Ala46 and Leu86 in SARS-CoV 3CLpro, respectively. Though their substitution seems to be minor in amino acid properties, the different residues may clearly contribute different affinities.",
