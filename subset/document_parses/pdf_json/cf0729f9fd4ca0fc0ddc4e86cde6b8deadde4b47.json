Every year countries witness sharp rise in the number of new cases and the efforts to overcome the virus are hampered due to the lack of knowledge of several important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [1] [2] [3] . Thus, there is an urgent need to dissect the host-pathogen interaction and immune response to the virus, and the contributing immune dysregulation in disease severity. As the preliminary pathobiological studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes tissue destruction thus triggering a local immune response to recruit the macrophages and monocytes to withhold the infection at the site by releasing cytokines and prime the T and B cell against SARS-CoV-2 virus [4, 5] .",

In some cases unfortunately, immune dysregulation leads to cytokine storm which leads to severe lung injury which is associated with increased COVID-19 associated mortality [6] . Usually after around one week of onset of infection, both the T and B cell against SARS-CoV-2 are detected in the blood. CD4 ? T cells are essential in priming both CD8 ? T cells and B cells and CD8 ? T cells directly attack and kills the virusinfected cells [4, 7] . The cytokine production is also done by CD4 ? T cells which further drives the immune cell recruitment [8, 9] . Studies have revealed accumulation of T cells in organs like lungs which suggests these cells are driven to the site of infection for control of virus and thereby leading to lymphopenia and reduced functional diversity. The severity of COVID-19 is proportionally related to T cell exhaustion and reduced functional diversity of these cells [10] .",

Such patients manifested a myriad of clinical features including ARDS and multi-organ failure. The pulmonary vasculature showed evidence of endothelial edema with presence of varying degree of thrombo-emboli in light of all these finding, a suspicion of cytokine storm affecting multiple organ systems arose, similar to the pathological course of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which was later on validated by a number of studies [7] . Early investigations [14] . Different studies detected varying degree of abnormal expression of these molecules and were associated with poor outcome in severe forms of the disease [3, 15, 16] .

Since in our study we have only recorded IFN-c at the time admission which was higher in patients with mild COVID-19 in comparison to moderate and severe disease. In our small sample study, no difference in the IFN-c levels between mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. Gadotti et al. demonstrate rise of IFN-c response within ten days of illness in patients with COVID-19 may have better outcome but persistent elevated IFN-c beyond ten days of illness is associated with poor outcome [17] . However, Chinese study by Lui et al. demonstrated in his longitudinal study IFN-c, together with IL-6 and IL-10, increased in patients with a severe COVID-19 in comparison to those with a mild disease [18] . By contrast, another Chinese study reported that lower levels of IFN-c in severe disease compared to those with a moderate disease [19] . A strong initial IFN-c response may lead to decrease in severity of disease and a better outcome in patients with COVID-19 [14] .",

            "text": "Studies have demonstrated an increase in Th2 cytokine level (IL-5, IL-6, and IL-9) in COVID-19 patient [14, [20] [21] [22] . Guo et al. demonstrated 33 cytokines, which were both anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10 and IL-13) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1b, IL-6, IP-10, G-CSF, IL-8, IL-17, and IFN-c) were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients [21] . In our study, these cytokines were found to have increased expression in the COVID-19 patients, however, of which only IL-6 was statistically significant (p = 0.03) when compared with healthy controls. Huan et al. described higher levels of TNF-a, IFN-c, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, CRP in the moderate and severe COVID-19 infection group, however only IL-6, IL-10 showed increased expression along with disease severity [23] . Parimoo et al. described the higher IL-6 levels were significantly associated with an adverse final outcome (p = 0.007) [22] . Studies worldwide have published the association of higher IL-6 level with severe disease and adverse outcomes [15, 16, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Thus, blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway would help in decreasing the progression of the COVID-19 infection to more severe forms, which was amply exemplified by the usage of IL-6/ IL-6R blocking agents in improving the clinical outcomes in the form of improved ventilatory parameters, improved inflammatory markers, and decreased hospital stay [26]. IL-17 is the key cytokine which is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant and neutrophil response regulator [10] . In our study levels of IL-17 increased in moderate and severe cases compared to the mild group and healthy control group. Guo et al. demonstrated pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1b, IL-6, IP-10, G-CSF, IL-8, IL-17, and IFNc) were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients [21] .",
