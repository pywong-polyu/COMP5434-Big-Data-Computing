Insulin treatments prescribed as standard care for the majority of people with T2DM, such as basal human insulin, may not be optimal in the treatment of frail older adults because of the increased demand on health care staff to administer multiple daily injections and monitor the patient. When choosing an insulin regimen for a frail older person with T2DM, predictability of glucose lowering effect, risk of hypoglycaemia, ease of administration, and simplicity and flexibility of dosing are major determining factors. Multiple daily injections may be too complex for older frail adults, whilst providing an unnecessary degree of tight glycaemic control and low doses of once-daily basal insulin analogues such as insulin degludec may be a reasonable option as cognitive decline or functional disability increases. Although insulin degludec has a substantially higher acquisition cost than routinely used basal human insulin, it has a longer, more predictable pharmacological profile and is more amenable to once-daily administration, translating into a reduced burden of care and potential cost savings for insulin-treated frail older adults. Insulin acquisition cost represents only a small proportion of the total cost of treatment, and it is important to consider the value perspective of insulin therapy in frail older adults from all stakeholders in the health care system.",

In addition to the usual complications of diabetes, the older population with diabetes also has a higher risk of other conditions such as falls and fractures, depression, physical disability, pain, polypharmacy due to co-morbidities, and urinary incontinence (Fig. 2) .

            "text": "Whilst the majority of older adults with T2DM are high functioning, medically stable, and able to perform self-care, diabetes can reduce physical functioning [2] . Sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss associated with reduced power) is a newly emerging and high-impact complication of T2DM in older adults [3, 4] , with a prevalence in the range of 7-29% in different populations [5] . Sarcopenia leads to frailty, a condition in which an individual has decreased physical reserves [6] , and is usually defined based on the presence of three or more of the following: unintentional weight loss, selfreported exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity [7] . Furthermore, T2DM has been consistently associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia [8] [9] [10] , and compared to people without diabetes, individuals with diabetes have a greater rate of cognitive decline [11] . As the decline in cognitive function continues, older people with diabetes and dementia are liable to struggle to follow complex treatment regimens. The consequences of a mistake in selfmedication of diabetes treatments can be devastating; missed doses can result in a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state, or diabetic ketoacidosis in those with insulin deficiency, whereas excess dosing can lead to devastating hypoglycaemia. As a result, when cognitive decline ensues, these individuals often require considerable support from both health care and social care practitioners in diabetes management, including treatment administration. Consequently, the treatment of T2DM and its complications in older adults represents a significant cost to the NHS with approximately 61% of all health care costs attributed to T2DM being incurred by people with T2DM who are [ 65 years of age [12] . With this in mind, it is imperative to optimise the clinical and economic value with respect to treatment regimens in the population of frail older adults with T2DM.",

The action profile of human basal insulin peaks within a few hours of administration, translating into a potential increased risk of hypoglycaemia, and in particular nocturnal hypoglycaemia if human insulin is administered in the evening. By contrast, insulin analogues provide slower, more prolonged absorption rates and a relatively constant pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/ PD) 24 h profile [16] , reducing the potential of hypoglycaemia and furthermore offering the potential for more predictable once-daily dosing [17] .",

Reduced risks of hypoglycaemia have been observed with insulin degludec across age groups including older adults. The results of a meta-analysis of pooled patientlevel data in older adults C 65 years from five BEGIN trials involving patients with T2DM [18, 19, [21] [22] [23] demonstrated 24% and 36% lower estimated rates of overall hypoglycaemia and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, respectively, with insulin degludec compared to insulin glargine [24] . The hypoglycaemic benefits demonstrated with insulin degludec in older adults were consistent with those seen in the full adult patient population [25] . A post hoc analysis of data from the SWITCH 2 trial demonstrated that treatment with insulin degludec lowered the rates of overall severe and blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia by 30% and 31% versus insulin glargine in individuals aged [ 65 years and B 65 years, respectively. The reduction in the rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia with insulin degludec versus insulin glargine was 41 and 43%, respectively, in individuals aged [ 65 years and B 65 years [26] . The reduced risk of hypoglycaemia with insulin degludec compared to glargine across the age groups was consistent with post hoc analysis of data from the DEVOTE trial, which also demonstrated that patients randomised to insulin degludec had a lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia and nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared to those randomised to insulin glargine across age groups (50-64 and 65-74 years), although a non-significant trend was demonstrated in patients aged C 75 years [27] . In addition, the cardiovascular safety data of insulin degludec versus glargine were also observed across age groups [27] , which is an important consideration for clinicians managing older adults with T2DM in clinical practice, since this category of patients typically has high cardiovascular risk.",

It has been demonstrated that the occurrence of hypoglycaemia in older adults is associated with a 36% increase in diabetes related expenditure [36] . Whilst some of this is in the direct cost of the hypoglycaemia, a significant proportion of this is based on the increased risk of complications such as stroke, fractures, and increased use of social care [37] . Even non-severe hypoglycaemia can have economic consequences in older patients as they lose confidence and have increased dependency on social support [38] . Insulin analogues, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, may be preferred in frail older adults with T2DM, as the drug acquisition cost has the potential to be offset by the cost saving from reduced hypoglycaemia-related health care resource utilisation.",

Staffing for the community nursing team can be a challenge with the team's core hours between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and there being a high demand for insulin administration around the start and finish of these core hours. This poses two challenges, the first is the logistics of administering the insulin within a short time window and the second is the cost of the visit itself in the setting of limited staffing. This has been exacerbated throughout the Covid-19 pandemic when community staff have been redeployed and the concerns regarding footfall and risk of coronavirus spread. Given that the NHS is currently facing a shortage of resources, in terms of both costs and the availability of health care workers to deliver this care, it is vital to evaluate the economic value, alongside the clinical efficacy, of different treatment regimens, such as insulin degludec, in frail older adults with T2DM.",

However, due to its pharmacological profile, patients using insulin degludec would only require a maximum of one nurse visit per day compared to patients prescribed human insulin, which are likely to require multiple visits to ensure safe and optimal insulin dosing, administration, and monitoring. Furthermore, the biological stability when administered from 8 to 40 h apart increases the flexibility of administration [42] , a notable advantage at times of stress on service, such as weekends, holidays, and times of significant staff pressure such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, the use of a more expensive, longer acting insulin that requires less monitoring and administration may ultimately translate into whole health care system cost savings when the cost of external assistance in included (Fig. 3 ). As the current NHS tariff for a nurse visit is \u00a330 (based on a 15-min visit for a band 7 nurse) [43], costs would be expected to be approximately \u00a3900 per month (30-day month) for degludec visits (once a day) and \u00a31800 per month for human insulin visits (twice a day). Consequently, the estimated cost per month including drug acquisition cost and treatment administration is \u00a3946.60 for insulin degludec compared to \u00a31819.08 for human insulin, resulting in a saving of \u00a3872.48 per patient per month (\u00a310,469.76 per year) associated with nursing visits alone (in addition to the use of fewer needles and test strips).",
