However, since the end of 2020, many SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), such as the Beta and Delta variants, have emerged. These VOCs have shown neutralization resistance to postvaccination sera in humans and animal models and raised concerns over the apparent waning of protective immunity for the first-generation COVID-19 vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. This indeed, casted a shadow over previous expectations. A recent study showed that vaccine efficacy against infections of the Delta variant declined from 93% to 53% at only 4 months post-vaccination in humans [1]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is feared to further mutate into J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Many groups are investigating this rapid mutagenesis phenomenon, by analyzing the impact of such mutants on viral entry and replication, neutralization by antibody or vaccine-induced immune responses, as well as cellular and tissue tropism. Indeed, it is not hard to envision a case where SARS-CoV-2 or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may further evolve into a new clade, SARS-CoV-3 or MERS-CoV-2, respectively, by genetic recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. We know that SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV are concurrently prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula and that genetic recombination can happen upon infection and replication of both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in the same host, given that both viruses can infect the same cell (type-II alveolar) and both use identical transcription regulatory sequences, conserved sequences at upstream of open reading frame that can mediate discontinuous transcription of viral genome [3, 4] . Moreover, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 can putatively bind to dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor--based on bioinformatics analysis combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking [5] . In fact, several cases of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV co-infection have been reported in Saudi Arabia [6] , foreboding the possibility of recombination between these two viruses.",

Following this logic, a novel SARS-CoV-3 could emerge if SARS-CoV-2 obtains a genomic segment from MERS-CoV. In addition, presumably, SARS-CoV-3 might preserve the high transmissibility potential of SARS-CoV-2, but acquire the high case-fatality rate (CFR: 35%) of MERS-CoV whereas the global CFR of SARS-CoV-2 is about 2% based on the information reported by WHO [8] . Similarly, a MERS-CoV-2 might preserve the high CFR of MERS-CoV, while potentially gaining the higher transmissibility rate of SARS-CoV-2. Such hypothesis calls for the urgent development of pan-\u03b2-CoV vaccines that could combat any possible development of future SARS-CoV-3 or MERS-CoV-2.",

One study, for example, reported that mosaic nanoparticles comprising the RBDs of 4 to 8 distinct zoonotic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and some SARSr-CoVs from bat, elicited cross-reactive immune responses against these coronaviruses in mice [9] . Although the RBD of coronaviruses mutates frequently, recent work from our laboratory showed that the neutralizing antibodies According to the protection range of a certain vaccine, we divided the coronavirus vaccines into three levels (Fig. 1) . The vaccines that can protect from infection of all sarbecoviruses, all betacoronaviruses, and all coronaviruses, fall into primary-level, middle-level, and high-level breadth, respectively. We argue that these efforts can result in successful pan-sarbecovirus (primary-level breadth) vaccines. However, as hypothesized above, a pan-\u03b2-CoV vaccine (middle-level breadth) is urgently needed to curtail the potential pandemic tide of a likely SARS-CoV-3 or MERS-CoV-2. Of note, SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + T cells have been detected in the blood of around 35% of unexposed healthy individuals; moreover, in vitro analyses have shown that the numbers of activated CD4 + T cells increase after the incubation of isolated SARS-CoV2-specific CD4 + T cells with peptides derived from the Spike proteins of human endemic coronavirus 229E (belongs to \u03b1-CoV, Fig. 1 ) and OC43 (belongs to \u03b2-CoV), indicating that SARS-CoV2-specific CD4 + T could also respond to coronaviruses from other genera [14] . This study suggests the presence of cross-reactive CD4 + T cells that might be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof induced by other coronaviruses in human blood. However, this does not mean that pancoronavirus vaccine (high-level breadth) could become available based on the induction of cross-reactive CD4 + T cells.",

Second, T-cell immune-based pan-CoV vaccines with low neutralization immunogenicity may induce a suboptimal concentration of NAbs that may enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry [16] , despite the fact that researchers have reported findings in which non-neutralizing antibodies that show ADE in vitro can still protect from SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice [17] .

Moreover, another group demonstrated that the immunization of macaques with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticles elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses against bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [11]. In addition, another study reported the development of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine, formulated with a liposomal adjuvant, that induced highly potent and broad NAb responses against the SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV in nonhuman primates [12]. This SpFN vaccine entered a phase I clinical trial in March 2021 (NCT04784767) i . Furthermore, others have documented the presence of potent cross-clade pan-sarbecovirus NAbs in the sera of SARS-CoV survivors immunized with an mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine [13], indicating that sequential administration of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might be a putative approach to achieving a pansarbecovirus vaccine -a possibility that will require robust assessment.",
