[6] highlight the importance of store traffic forecasting and propose a model for the optimization of store labor schedules based on expected traffic. Their model sets store sales potential as a function of store traffic volume, customer type, and customer response to sales force availability. This model first uses the log-transformation of the traffic variable to induce a constant variance, and then a difference with one week lag is applied to this transformed variable. Finally, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) components are used to adjust for auto-correlations in the residuals. This model was used for a two week ahead forecast and obtained a percentage-forecast error of about 30% on average.",

However, the relevance of these characteristics is different for other kind of products. Arunraj and Ahrens [7] focused on predicting daily food sales; they used a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with external variables (SARIMAX) model, and they concluded that sales forecasts were influenced by external variables, such as day-of-the-week seasonality, month-of-the year seasonality, holidays, festivals, price reductions, and weather. Variations of influence variables among different kinds of products implied that the models should be trained with data dis-aggregated by product or store.",

However, it lacks the modeling of non-linear relationships. Even though it does not perform well in some problems, the ARIMA model is typically used as a baseline model to show the performance of other methods. Cortez et al. [9] used data that were collected in a period of six months from a facial recognition camera to detect the number of daily visitors along with their gender in a sports store. They compared six approaches to predict daily store traffic, using ARIMA as one of their baseline methods, in three different cases. They only detected male visitors, only female and all visitors, forecasting up to a week ahead. Their input vector included the time of the event, special daily event (weekend or holiday; major sports or entertainment event), and weather conditions, such as maximum wind speed, temperature, humidity, and rain. They proposed two metrics to test the performance of the models in this problem: the Average Normalized Mean Absolute Error (ANMAE) and a novel metric named the Average Estimated Store Benefit (AESB). In the AESB metric, the manager of the store executes a forecast for N days ahead. Subsequently, an alternative plan is set with better management (e.g., promotions to bring more traffic). Each daily error is multiplied by an average cost that is related to a missed opportunity. Overall Cortez et al. [9] showed that the Support Vector Regression (SVR) was the best forecasting method, regardless of the visitors' gender and only using time as its input. They used a two-stage approach to obtain optimal performance; first, they used a sensitivity analysis proposed in [22] to discard the least relevant time lag and then they undertook a grid search to find the optimal hyper-parameters.",

A month can span from four to six weeks; in this work, a month will span exactly four-weeks, so the forecasting window will be 28 days. Previous works have found that small time windows (e.g., a week) are often applied in real-world settings [9, 10, 18] ; however, store managers need a longer time window than a week in order to carry out a suitable business plan based on expected number of visitors and sales. The next step was to analyze the available data to determine its quality and reliability, and to identify the need for filtering invalid entries. Subsequently, by studying the state of the art of the regression models, we found out that the most accurate methods were the so called black-box models that do not convey more information than the predicted value. This motivated us to develop a new model that is based on an existing one, called EVREG, in order to improve its accuracy and interpretability. Having the data and model, we proceeded with the definition of the embedding vector, after which we could make the first prediction testings. Their results were analyzed in order to adjust/change the data filtering as well as the model and the data embedding until reaching an acceptable result. The next subsections describe, in more detail, the data acquisition and validation, the development of the regression model, and the data embedding.",

Data on foot traffic are recorded using a three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic camera that is programmed to recognize, follow, and count people in an enclosed area with the purpose of getting exact knowledge of how crowded the physical space is and the flow of people in it. The cameras have an accuracy of approximately 98% and it can be used both in and outdoors. The ones used specifically for this work were installed in closed retail stores. They are placed at the store entrances and strategic spots in order to capture as much visual information as possible. The way that they detect humans from other static or moving objects is by using video analysis software focused on identifying humans easily in a dynamic environment; this is achieved by using stereoscopic cameras that can make a 3D map of the place and objects moving in it. Once a camera detects people, it starts counting and following them. These cameras are all connected to a private network that allows communication among them and not get 'confused' when simultaneously detecting the same person. Data on the number of sales (tickets) and the total amount of sales are obtained directly from the store records. We accessed this data from an Application Programming Interface (API) supplied by Follow Up. The API provides the information on an hourly basis. The obtained data are detailed in Table 1 . It should be noted that data in this field are usually proprietary and a valuable asset for the companies. This is the case with Follow Up, which cannot disclose the raw data.",

It is assumed that, in some stores, the day of the week is highly correlated to the expected number of visitors or sales, e.g., a store that is located near offices is expected to receive high number of visitors during work days. However, the features that were used in Table 2 do not reflect the cyclic quality of time features. For example, the day of the week on the features varies from 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday). The furthest day from Sunday is Monday, whereas, in reality, Sunday and Monday are next to each other. Another feature vector will be tested, including these cycles. The new embedding has two features representing the vertical and horizontal components in each feature with a cyclic behaviour. The vector is detailed in Table 3 . To build this circular representation, we can use the trigonometric functions sin and cos and thenassign an angle from 0 to 2\u03c0 to the values for example 0 for Monday and 6 7 2\u03c0 to Sunday. Note that this transformation effectively captures the cyclical state of these variables, because the distance function previously defined in the model (Equation (9)) is Euclidean and the decomposition into horizontal and vertical components makes contiguous elements have the same distance in the model. Another variant of these vectors will be tested. For each feature vector presented, a sequence of previously observed values will be added, thus obtaining a total of four feature vectors. These new features will be a sequence of previous time steps of the variable commonly used in time series forecasting. Because the forecast is made with a month window, the values need to have a month of distance. For example, if the visitors for August 1st are being predicted, the previous values will consist of July 1st, June 1st, and so on. The number of months N for the feature vector will be set based on the proposed method performance. Table 4 details the new features. ",

This figure also shows the confidence interval that the proposed model is able to provide.

This result illustrates the interpretability that can be obtained from the model, since it is possible to know which attributes are the most important for the prediction and, thus, provide an additional value to the prediction. We also compare our model to previous ones regarding foot traffic, conversion rate, and sales prediction. Table 9 presents the methods to be compared. Observing Table 9 , it is important to note that the various authors use different data to build their methods, so it is incorrect to perform a quantitative analysis on the models since their results are not comparable. However, we present a qualitative three-dimensional analysis (columns 4-6 in Table 9 ): the first dimension is the model accuracy, in which we distinguish three levels: high accuracy when the method has reported less than 15 % error, medium accuracy when the error is between 15% and 30%, and low accuracy if the error is greater than 30%. Interpretability is the second dimension: this column shows whether or not the authors present some type of interpretability of their results.

In particular, the model hardly reaches the extreme values of the prediction. This shortcoming can be explained by the nature of the prediction with KNN; note that, for predicting a 0 value (the minimum in our case), the model requires that all neighbors it observes must also have value 0; if any of them does not have a 0 value, then it \"moves\" the prediction towards the center.",

Additionally, the most important features for predicting foot traffic seem to be the number of visitors observed in previous months.

It seems that the breakdown of cyclic features in horizontal and vertical components enables the methods to create a better comprehension of the variables as we anticipated when we introduced this embedding. In particular, for our method, the circular representation with the sequence of previous months is the one yielding best performance in most predicted variables. Another interesting result is that using circular embedding in other methods also implies better performance, even when these methods are not distance-based, which shows that this representation also eases partitioning the feature space for these methods.",

In addition to the prediction methodology, the main contribution of this work is that the proposed model is transparent, which allows for us to discover and analyze the main features that influence the prediction. This allows store managers to obtain knowledge about which are the main variables that influence the behavior of customers, thus allowing them to react to sudden changes in the scenario, before the model adapts itself. Another important contribution that is not present in most previous works, is that it also gives a confidence interval for the predicted values. This method also produces prediction for the three key performance indicators at the same time. These are important implications for practitioners, since these advances are applicable to the stores operation.",

Although a prediction can be made using less similar scenarios, these predictions tend to have high uncertainty. This explains the restriction of having at least four years of data imposed in our study, as explained in Section 3.1. This limitation makes the model unsuitable to operate with new stores that do not have a substantial data history. Another limitation occurs when the model predicts stores located in tourist places. This type of stores drastically change their behavior during vacation periods when compared to the rest of the year. Thus, during regular periods, they have low values and are almost always 0 for the indicators. When the holiday period begins, these indicators increase, sometimes even exceeding those of stores in large cities. We have observed that our model is not capable of predicting this type of behavior, even when the store complies with the constraint of having four years of data.",

A model, like the proposed one, and probably all models based on historical data, cannot predict this behavior that is generated by external causes. Instead, our model can predict the expected sales for the period of time the store was closed and, thus, these values can be used to estimate the losses that are generated during the period of closure.",

For instance, it may be possible to build a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of a promotion or another tool suggesting the optimal changes to make to the key indicators in order to achieve a sales goal that is based on the model predictions. Regarding the model itself, future research may study a possible improvement to make the model operate correctly with little data to make it suitable for new stores; a tentative strategy for this purpose may be to cluster similar stores in the training phase and use the ones with the longest history to fulfill the history of new stores. Related to the above, how the different embeddings affect the results when there is little data could also be tested. An embedding that, instead of creating many features, only generates a few ones may perhaps work better for stores with little data. Lastly, another line of future research is to try to improve the interpretability of the model even more. Currently the model elaborates an importance ranking for the features in the prediction; however, it does not report whether these features positively or negatively affect the output. An example of this hypothetical interpretability would be the method showing that sales increase between 14:00 and 18:00 hours, or that foot traffic decreases on Wednesdays.",
