We evaluated potency of gallinamide A and 23 synthetic analogs against intracellular Trypanosoma cruzi amastigotes and the cysteine protease, cruzain. We determined the co-crystal structures of cruzain with gallinamide A and two synthetic analogs at ~2\u00c5. SAR data revealed that the N-terminal end of gallinamide A is loosely bound and weakly contributes in drug-target interactions. At the C-terminus, the intramolecular \uf070\uf02d\uf070 stacking interactions between the aromatic substituents at P1\u02b9 and P1 restrict the bioactive conformation of the inhibitors, thus minimizing the entropic loss associated with target binding. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the absence of an aromatic group at P1, the substituent at P1\u02b9 interacts with tryptophan-184. The P1-P1\u02b9 interactions had no effect on anti-cruzain activity whereas anti-T. cruzi potency increased by ~5-fold, likely due to an increase in solubility/permeability of the analogs.",

In Latin America, Chagas disease is endemic, and about 8 million people are estimated to be infected worldwide 1-4 . The global healthcare and economic burden of Chagas disease is substantial [5] [6] [7] , while the clinically available treatments are limited to two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both drugs have been recently FDA-approved for use in children of 2 to 12 years old (benznidazole) and from birth to 18 years old (nifurtimox) [8] [9] [10] , however, neither has been approved for adults. While benznidazole and nifurtimox have significant efficacy in the acute phase, both drugs suffer from the liabilities of low efficacy in chronically infected patients and adults and may cause serious adverse reactions leading to premature termination of treatment 11 . Thus, development of new anti-Chagas drugs with improved efficacy and less toxicity is a priority.",

            "text": "The goal of developing safer and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease led to an investigation of natural secondary metabolites from plants and cyanobacteria for activity against T. cruzi [12] [13] [14] . Cyanobacteria produce a large variety of bioactive molecules attractive for pharmaceutical applications in various fields of antiinfective drug discovery, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal agents [15] [16] [17] . Tropical filamentous marine cyanobacteria have emerged as an important source of biologically active secondary metabolites 18 . The natural product gallinamide A, isolated from marine cyanobacteria discovered at a tropical reef near Piedras Gallinas on the Caribbean coast of Panama, was first identified as an inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum growth 19 . Additional studies showed that the mechanism of action for this compound was due to inhibition of the food vacuole cysteine proteases that are collectively known as falcipains 20, 21 . P. falciparum falcipain enzymes are cathepsin L-like proteases and therefore additional studies showed that gallinamide A is also a potent and highly selective inhibitor of human cathepsin L 22 . The unique linear lipopeptide structure, and potential applicability to proteases of medical relevance, provoked interest in establishing chemical syntheses of gallinamide A and structural analogs 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Indeed, gallinamide A has become an attractive starting point for developing selective inhibitors targeting human cathepsin L and other Clan CA cysteine proteases in human pathogens 21, 23, 24, 27 . Based on comparison of the protein sequence alignment and substrate specificity, cathepsin L is similar to cysteine proteases from unicellular parasites that are responsible for neglected tropical diseases, such as falcipains from P. falciparum and cruzain from T. cruzi [28] [29] [30] . The cysteine protease cruzain is a promising drug target because this enzyme is essential in T. cruzi at all stages of the life cycle [31] [32] [33] .",

This orientation places the enone pharmacophore in close proximity to the thiol group of the acid-base-nucleophile triad C25-H162-N182 favoring formation of the irreversible covalent bond between C25 and gallinamide A via a Michael-addition-like reaction 35 . The electron density for the MMP is well defined with the exception of the 3-methoxy group due to conformational ambiguity of the latter (Fig. 2A) . M145 in proximity of the 3-methoxy substituent of the MMP also adopts multiple conformations, suggesting a loose contact with MMP. The P2 and P3 leucine moieties of gallinamide A bind in the S2 and S3 pockets, while the N,Ndimethylisoleucine moiety (N,N-Me2-L-Ile) at P4 is exposed to the bulk solvent (Figs. 1D,  2A) .

In the cruzain-gallinamide A X-ray structure, N,N-Me2-L-Ile is exposed to the bulk solvent instead of binding in the S3 pocket, as it was predicted by molecular docking in cathepsin L (compare cyan and yellow poses in Fig. 3A, B) 22, 23 . While there is a possibility of having artifacts from docking, this discrepancy may also be a result of structural differences between cathepsin L and cruzain. Despite the high sequence identity (46%) and structural similarity between cathepsin L and cruzain, there are a few non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the substrate-binding site. The S3 pocket harbors three major substitutions, D60\uf0aeN, S61\uf0aeE and N70\uf0aeY, that distinguish the substrate binding sites of cathepsin L from cruzain (Fig. 3C) . Three other substitutions, Q159\uf0aeD, M145\uf0aeL and L160\uf0aeM are located in S1\u02b9 and S2 pockets. In addition, a pair of consecutive glutamate residues, E207 and E208, is absent in cathepsin L, and the equivalent positions are occupied by serine and alanine, respectively. ",

CH2-cyclohexyl was tolerated in both positions with the most potent configuration achieved in 14, where R2=Lleucine and R3=CH2-cyclohexyl. A bulky aromatic substituent CH2CH2-Ph was introduced in 23 at P1 where it replaced L-alanine of the parental scaffold. In 23, R1=CH2CH2-Ph was combined with R2=R3=L-leucine that did not affect activity against the cruzain target (compared to 11) but enhanced approximately 5-fold the potency of 23 against T. cruzi amastigotes. Interestingly, the same CH2CH2-Ph group at P2 or P3 positions reduced activity against T. cruzi amastigotes (compounds 15, 19 and 21).

While CH2CH2-Ph made surface contacts with the backbone atoms of G23, C22, C63, S64 and G65 (shown in green in Fig. 2C, D) , neither indolyl nor biaryl moieties interacted with the protein. Intramolecular interactions of the CH2CH2-Ph at P1 with the indolyl or biaryl moieties at P1\u02b9 may reduce the hydrophobic surface, increase solubility in aqueous medium, and positively impact permeability and potency of 23 and 24. Furthermore, these intramolecular interactions may also stabilize the biologically active conformation and reduce the entropic loss associated with the binding to the target. We speculate that the role of the aromatic MMP substituents is responsible for restricting the flexibility of the analogs to lock them into their biologically active conformation. Given that no amino acid side chains are involved, these intramolecular interactions are expected to broadly enhance activity against Clan CA cysteine proteases. The 23 and 24 co-crystal structures were determined in different space groups that minimize any impact of crystal packing interactions on the inhibitor binding poses.",

            "text": "To explore dynamics of cruzain-ligand interactions in silico, we performed MD simulations for the top hits of the 2-indolyl-MMP series, compounds 14, 17 and 23, for which cruzain inhibitory activity exceeded 15-fold that of gallinamide A. A critical structural difference that distinguishes 14 and 17 from 23 is the absence of the CH2CH2-Ph moiety at P1 that excludes the stabilizing effect of the intramolecular interactions between the indolyl and CH2CH2-Ph moieties in 14 and 17. We also calculated the per-residue free energy decomposition (\u0394Gres) employing the structure ensemble generated for each complex simulation. As shown in Fig. 4 , residues W184, L160 and L67 established non-polar interactions with the 2-indolyl-MMP, L-leucine, CH2-cyclohexyl and N,N-Me2-L-Val moieties at P1\u02b9, P2, P3 and P4 positions, respectively. In resemblance to the conformation adopted by the L-leucine at P3 of gallinamide A, the CH2-cyclohexyl moiety of 14 and 17 project towards and interact with L67. The MD simulations showed that residues Q19, G66 and D161 are establishing H-bonds with the backbone of the gallinamide A analogs, which is in agreement with the interactions observed from the X-ray crystal structures [36] [37] [38] . As the electron density corresponding to the P4 moiety of gallinamide A and the analogs was not well-defined (Fig. 3) , we computationally assessed the dynamics of the P4 fragment along the course of the MD simulations. Note that compounds 14 and 23 have the N,N-Me2-L-Val group at P4 site while compound 17 contains the 4-(N-Me)piperidine group at this position. To describe the changes in the orientation of the P4 moiety within the cruzain binding site, we monitored over time the dihedral angle \u03c8 (between the equivalent C and CA atoms) of the P4-P3 linkage calculated for each of the three complexes. We observed that the cyclohexyl ring at P3 established more stable interactions with S3 when the P4 position was occupied by N,N-Me2-L-Val (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, with 4-(N-Me)piperidine at P4, two well-defined populations of the cyclohexyl ring at P3 sampled by \u03c8 angle were observed. One population bound within S3 while the other one was exposed to the solvent (Fig. 5B) . These results suggest that the 4-(N-Me)piperidine group placed in the P4 position may destabilize interactions of cyclohexyl moiety at S3. The MD simulations showed that the predicted interactions of the indolyl substituent in 14 and 17 differ from those observed in the co-crystal structure of the 23-cruzain complex (compare Fig. 4A and 4B with Fig. 2C ). In the absence of the CH2CH2-Ph group at P1, the indole ring of 14 and 17 mainly interacts with W184 (Fig. 5C ) that is consistent with the critical role of W184 in the interactions with these analogs (see energy values of W184 in Fig. 4) . Molecular dynamic simulations of the 23-cruzain complex showed that the indole group of 23 may occur in both conformations: (1) interacting with W184 and (2) establishing intramolecular \uf070\uf02d\uf070 stacking interactions with the CH2CH2-Ph moiety at P1 (Fig. 5D) . When free in solution, 23 is mostly forming intramolecular \uf070\uf02d\uf070 stacking interactions as observed in the co-crystal structure of the 23-cruzain complex (Fig. 5D) .",

The thermodynamic cycle involving the alchemical transformations of the inhibitor free in solution and covalently bound to the enzyme is shown in Fig. 6 . The results of computation are shown in Table 4 , where positive values indicate that the native complex possesses higher affinity. We conclude that the individual inclusion of CH2-cyclohexyl at R3, and CH2CH2-Ph at R2 significantly enhanced affinity for cruzain. Addition of the indole ring at R\u02b9 also increased the compound affinity, albeit not as much as the aforementioned modifications. ",

The structures demonstrated that the N-terminal P4 moiety makes loose contacts with cruzain and may be used to improve solubility and permeability of the next generation of the anti-Chagas gallinamide A analogs. Exposure of the P4 moiety in cruzain contrasts to its proposed binding in the S3 pocket of cathepsin L as predicted by molecular docking 23 . The discrepancy between the docking and crystallographic poses may be a docking artifact or the result of non-conservative amino acid substitutions in S3 of cathepsin L affecting pocket shape and electronic properties.

Neither indolyl nor biaryl moieties contact the protein target, suggesting that in the context of 23 and 24 their role is in restricting the flexible inhibitor into its bioactive conformation and minimizing the entropic loss associated with binding to the target. The conformational restriction (rigidification) of a flexible ligand is a commonly used strategy in drug design that enhances potency, improves selectivity and reduces drug metabolism 46 . The same rigidification principle, either via non-covalent intramolecular interactions or via introducing a covalent linkage, may be explored in designing peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting cathepsin L-like proteases. The gallinamide A and analogs co-crystal structures determined in this work will also have utility in assessing the contributions of the individual substituents for the binding affinity of gallinamide A analogs to Clan CA cysteine proteases. Combining this structural data with the per-residue free energy decomposition approach provides the possibility of validation of new chemical modifications computationally prior to chemical synthesis of future gallinamide A analogs.",

Importantly, the potent activity against the cruzain target by the analogs carrying the 4-(N-Me)piperidine substituent (16, 17, 18 and 20) is consistent with exposure of the N-terminal moiety observed in the crystal structures.",

These results are in agreement with the X-ray structures showing ambiguous N,N-Me2-L-Val binding(Fig. 3C, D)and experimental IC50 values shown inTables 2 and 3.
