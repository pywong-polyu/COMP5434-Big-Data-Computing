There are many ongoing studies investigating drug(s) suitable for preventing and/or treating this pandemic; however, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 as of today. Methods: Fifty-eight fragrance materials, which are classified as allergen fragrance molecules, were selected and used in this study. Docking simulations were carried out using four functional proteins; the Covid19 Main Protase (MPro), Receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, Nucleocapsid, and host Bromodomain protein (BRD2), as target macromolecules. Three different software, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina (Vina), and Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD), running a total of four different docking protocol with optimized energy functions were used. Results were compared with the five molecules reported in the literature as potential drugs against COVID-19. Virtual screening was carried out using Vina, molecules satisfying our cut-off (\u2212 6.5 kcal/mol) binding affinity was confirmed by MVD. Selected molecules were analyzed using the flexible docking protocol of Vina and AutoDock default settings. Results: Ten out of 58 allergen fragrance molecules were selected for further docking studies. MPro and BRD2 are potential targets for the tested allergen fragrance molecules, while RBD and Nucleocapsid showed weak binding energies. According to AutoDock results, three molecules, Benzyl Cinnamate, Dihydroambrettolide, and Galaxolide, had good binding affinities to BRD2. While Dihydroambrettolide and Galaxolide showed the potential to bind to MPro, Sclareol and Vertofix had the best calculated binding affinities to this target. When the flexible docking results analyzed, all the molecules tested had better calculated binding affinities as expected. Benzyl Benzoate and Benzyl Salicylate showed good binding affinities to BRD2. In the case of MPro, Sclareol had the lowest binding affinity among all the tested allergen fragrance molecules.",

These viruses generally contain large (~20 nm), surface projections called \"spikes,\" which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, thus giving the name to the family. CoVs commonly cause respiratory problems but can also disrupt the digestive system or lead to systemic problems in mammals, birds, and reptiles. In humans, they can cause very severe respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [1] . The latest coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, discovered in China, affected millions of people and killed hundreds of thousands worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced \"COVID-19\" as the name of this new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 [2] . The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 threat that emerged in China has rapidly spread Worldwide and continuing to spread. Thus, many efforts directed to investigate drug(s) suitable for preventing and/ or treating human SARS-CoV-2.",

According to binding free energy calculations, using the molecular mechanics, Xu et al. indicated that among four tested drugs (nelfinavir, pitavastatin, perampanel, and praziquantel) nelfinavir was identified as the most potent inhibitor against COVID-19 MPro [10] . Besides, alternative traditional Chinese medicine implementations have been reported [3, 4, 11, 12] . Although results from these preliminary studies remain unapproved for therapeutic use in clinical settings, they are still precious for drug studies against the current pandemic. To speed up possible clinical trials and drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2, many compounds that are being used as drugs or supplements for humans are started to be tested as potential lead molecules. Molecules that are going to be implemented as anti-viral treatment and protection have several requirements: First of all, stock of the drug must be sufficient and readily available; the safety of the procedure, treatment should be tolerated by the patients, and finally, the cost should be as low as possible. In this respect, we investigate selected fragrance materials, which are classified as allergen fragrance molecules according to the 7th amendment of the 76/768/ EEC Directive (European Economic Community Cosmetics Directive), as mentioned at Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) [13] .",

These proteins are known to regulate the expression of~1450 genes. Early reports from the cell mapping initiative at Quantitative Biosciences Institute Coronavirus Research Group indicate that BRD2, a member of the bromodomain protein family, may interact with SARS-CoV-2 envelope proteins. The bromodomain proteins recognize and bind to acetylated histones and play a critical role in the host's hype-immune response. COVID-19 virus protein E mimics acetylated histones and could bind to the same site on BRD-2 [31] . Inhibitors targeting the bromodomain proteins are already being used in the clinic, such as Resverlogix's apabetalone, in phase 3 trials for cancer and phase 1 for pulmonary arterial hypertension; AbbVie's ABBV-744, in phase 1 for cancer; and Constellation Pharmaceuticals' CPI-0610, in phase 2 for cancer, suggesting that BRD2 inhibitors can be used as drug candidates. Similarly, it has been suggested that BRD2 inhibitors can potentially block where COVID-19 envelop protein E binds and could be used as drug targets for COVID-19.

Amino acids that were identified as contact residues in crystal structures picked as flexible sites. Generated flexible and rigid .pdbqt files for BRD2 and MPro proteins were used in Vina.

Besides the potential protective effect of a possible vaccine, it has limited applications for current COVID-19 patients. Thus, many efforts have been directed to investigate a drug suitable for preventing and/or treating human SARS-CoV-2. The implementation of anti-viral treatment and protection has several requirements: First of all, the stock of the drug must be sufficient and readily available; secondly, the safety of therapy should be tolerated, and finally, the cost should be affordable. As the fourth requirement under a pandemic situation, the drug needs to be discovered in a short period of time.

These oils have been theorized to evolve with viruses, bacteria, and fungi to protect plants and trees from viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Thus, if we look up the anti-viral behavior of plants, we can easily see that the defense mechanism is based on essential oils. The viricidal activity of essential oils, which are lipophilic by nature, is due to disruption of the viral membrane or interference with viral envelope proteins involved in host cell attachment. Consequently, many of these essential oils have been used in various cultures for medicinal and health purposes, food preservation, pharmaceuticals, alternative medicine, and natural therapies for centuries. Under physiological stresses, pathogen attacks, and ecological factors, plants produce essential oils and gums. In addition, oils can be obtained by expression, fermentation, extraction, and distillation. Some of these essential oils have antibacterial, antifungal, anti-viral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties [41, 42] . They have been used in cancer treatment [43] , in food preservation [44] , aromatherapy [45] , and fragrance industries [46] .

Results indicate that at correct doses, these molecules could have significant health benefits through inhalation. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies could help us develop potential lead compounds as an antiviral drug in respiratory applications against COVID-19.",
