            "text": "There is an urgent need for a vaccine with efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4 + T cell, and CD8 + T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.",

Similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, found on the surface of human nasopharyngeal, lung, and gut mucosa 4 . Production of neutralizing antibodies targeting the RBD or other functional domains is thought to be critical for vaccine efficacy. Generation of non-neutralizing antibody responses may be associated with vaccine failure, and in the worst case scenario enhanced disease upon viral exposure, either through the induction of enhanced pulmonary inflammation 5 , or Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 6 . While anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been identified in COVID-19 patients, it is unknown which of these antibodies drive viral neutralization, ADE, or both. Thus, vaccine efficacy and safety will be optimized by approaches that maximize generation of neutralizing antibodies while minimizing ADE or pulmonary immune pathology.",

Prior studies in SARS-CoV-1 have demonstrated T cell responses against viral epitopes, with strong T cell responses correlated with generation of higher neutralizing antibody titers 9 . Unlike antibody epitopes, T cell epitopes need not be limited to accessible regions of surface proteins. In SARS-CoV-1, concurrent CD4 + and CD8 + activation and central memory T cell generation were induced in exposed patients; however, increased Th2 cytokine polarization was observed in patients with fatal disease 9 . Thus, vaccines targeting humoral (B cells) and cytotoxic arms (CD8 + T cells) with concurrent helper signalling (CD4 + T cells), delivered with adjuvants promoting Th1 polarization, may provide optimal immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",

Many of these strategies are attractive for eliciting antibody responses against conformational epitopes. Multi-epitope peptide vaccines are an alternative approach which has a history of safe administration, may be developed and updated rapidly, and may be less likely to elicit non-neutralizing antibodies that contribute to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [14] [15] [16] .",

To generate these nested HLA ligands, each predicted HLA-I ligand was paired with an HLA-II ligand with full sequence overlap, selecting for the HLA-II ligand(s) with highest population coverage ( Figure 2C Notably, while SARS-CoV-1 T cell epitopes previously described in the literature were primarily located in the surface glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N) ( Table S3 ) 9,25-50 , we observed a paucity of predicted MHC ligands in the nucleocapsid protein (N).

Tetramer data was selected for the response variable because it provides unambiguous association between a peptide and its bound MHC, and additionally tests which specific peptide/MHC is capable of eliciting a T cell response . Each unique peptide-MHC was encoded with features derived from epitope prediction tools as well as features relating to amino acid content (See Methods: Immunogenicity modeling ). Model performance in 5-fold cross validation demonstrated AUC values of approximately 0.7 and 0.9 for HLA-I and -II, respectively, in both training and test sets ( Figure S2A -B ). Models demonstrated cleaner separation of tetramer positive and negative groups for CD4 + epitopes compared to HLA-I ( Figure S2C -D ). To determine a cause for this difference in model performance, we examined predicted binding affinity scores between tetramer positive and negative epitopes, which demonstrated significantly better separation for CD4 + epitopes than CD8 + epitopes ( Figure S2E -F ). In accordance with this difference in binding affinity distribution, the HLA-II model showed strong association between lower binding affinity and lower predicted tetramer positivity, while the HLA-I model showed a weaker inverse association ( Figure S3 ). Due to these binding affinity distribution differences between IEDB HLA-I and HLA-II tetramer sets, a performance-based cutoff did not allow for equal filtering of CD4 + and CD8 + epitopes. Therefore, we filtered by GLM scores above the median in each HLA-I/II SARS-CoV-2 epitope group, which provided balanced selection while removing predicted low-immunogenicity epitopes ( Figure S4 ).",

Exclude regions with significant polymorphism between SARS-CoV-2 strains 4. Keep candidate epitopes within or adjacent to functional domains with evidence of antibody-mediated viral neutralization (RBD, FP, HR1, and HR2) 5. Exclude any candidates shorter than four amino acids We used SARS-CoV-2 S protein accessibility data from Grant et. al 60 , which resulted in 19 remaining regions after filtering for contiguous stretches with mean accessibility of 35%, minimum accessibility of 15%, requiring at least one residue to have accessibility greater than 50%, and the ends of a region to have at least 25% accessibility. Since many epitopes occur in multiple sources, we combined overlapping epitope candidates into 14 unique sequences. After filtering out epitopes containing glycosites, which may alter antibody binding characteristics 61,62 , 11 non-glycosylated regions remained. Two additional regions were removed because they contained polymorphic sites, defined by mutation frequency > 0.1% from Nextstain SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences. Of the remaining 9 regions, only 4 were close to functional domains which in the closely related virus SARS have evidence of antibody-mediated viral neutralization: the receptor binding domain (RBD), fusion protein (FP), and heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1/HR2) [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . Adjacency to a functional region was defined as within 15 aa of either side of FP, HR1, and HR2, and within 50 aa of the RBD. A broader window was used for the receptor binding domain due to the known presence of neutralizing antibody epitopes in S1 of SARS outside of the RBD 69 . This filtering resulted in four remaining regions, of which our final criteria removed one which had length less than four residues ( Figure 4B ). This filtering criteria precluded the vast majority of total spike protein regions ( Figure 4C ), with three predicted antibody binding regions (residue lengths 18, 4, and 4) remaining ( Figure 4D ). All three epitope candidate regions were present on solvent-exposed surfaces of the S protein trimer 3D structure ( Figure 4E ). It is worth noting that the largest region, residues 456-473 within the receptor binding motif (RBM) loop is only accessible when the RBD is in the \"open\" conformation. Selection of human and murine SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides With the above filters applied to predicted T and B cell epitope candidates, we sought to derive a collection of minimal recommended peptide sets for all combinations of the following vaccine criteria: optimization for CD4 + responses, CD8 + responses, and coverage of predicted B cell epitopes. We derived 27mer sequences for these vaccine peptide sets, determining peptide combinations which maximized population coverage of T cell epitopes, with or without additional coverage for murine H2-b, H2-d, or both haplotypes ( Figure 5A-B ). If population coverage was identical for multiple candidates, peptides were also optimized based on a manufacturability difficulty scoring system ( Figure S7 ). Optimizing for CD4 + epitope population coverage demonstrated 88.5% population frequency encompassed by three 27mer peptides ( Figure 5B : 1, 9, and 15), while CD8 + epitope optimization provided 95.8% population frequency coverage by three 27mer peptides ( Figure 5B: 1, 4, and 14 ). CD4 + /CD8 + co-optimization provided the best overall population coverage at 81.6% population frequency with four 27mer peptides ( Figure 5B : 1, 6, 9, 13) . While B cell epitope optimization provided CD8 + coverage above 85%, CD4 + coverage was only 52.8%, suggesting the design of a combination B cell/CD4 + T cell vaccine requires use of non-spatially overlapping sequences. Overall, selection of peptides which also provided both H2-b and H2-d epitope coverage did not greatly impact population coverage, suggesting these murine-encompassing sets may allow for vaccine studies in animal models whilst preserving human relevance. Across the different selection criteria for minimal vaccine peptide sets there was significant redundancy. Collapsing the set of vaccine peptides by unique sequences results in a final set of 22 27mer vaccine peptides ( Figure 5B ). In addition to 27mer peptides, all individual T/B cell epitopes (S, M, and N: Table S5 ; all proteins: Table S6 ) as well as 15mer ( Figure S8 ) and 21mer ( Figure S9 ) optimized peptide sets are also available.

It is possible that vaccines that elicit a vigorous cytotoxic T cell response will drive early killing of infected cells and mitigate the toxicity associated with ADE. In addition, CD4 + T cells provide help to B cells to support class switching, maturation, and antibody production, as well as promoting CD8 + T cell activation, maturation, and effector function. In light of this, we searched for vaccine peptide sequences which include both B cell epitopes as well MHC ligands predicted to drive CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses at high population frequencies. Our current efforts are focused on testing the immunogenicity of these peptides in murine models, comparing those which contain overlapping and non-overlapping T and B cell epitopes. Results from such preclinical testing will inform an envisioned phase I clinical trial using a condensed peptide set targeting B cell epitopes with known viral neutralization plus optimal T cell epitopes.",

Grifoni et al. reported predicted T and B cell epitopes based on cross-referencing of known SARS epitopes with sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2 against SARS-CoV-2-specific parallel computational prediction 79 . However, this study did not consider epitope mapping of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent antibody repertoires, which may be important to achieve high specificity of B cell epitope predictions. Ahmed et al. reported a set of predicted T and B cell SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with associated assay confirmation within the NIAID ViPR database. However, these predicted epitopes were largely limited to those with sequence homology between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, given the paucity of available SARS-CoV-2 assay data. Several studies have identified linear B cell epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein from sera of viral exposed patients using peptide arrays [56] [57] [58] as well as phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) 59 . These studies are an important source of information but their results may include many epitopes from degraded proteins and thus would not be able to promote viral neutralization in vivo due to a lack of surface exposure . Our work adds to this important emerging field by analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 HLA ligand landscape through binding affinity filters derived from validated IEDB HLA ligands, as well as deriving T and B cell vaccine candidates through rational filtering criteria grounded in SARS-CoV-2 biology, including predicted immunogenicity, epitope location, glycosylation sites, and polymorphic sites. No other study to date has considered all such features in their epitope selection process. Additionally, inclusion of corresponding murine epitopes allows for future studies to be performed in animal models of SARS-CoV-2. We expect the application of these filters will improve specificity of antiviral response. As such, future studies testing the immunogenicity and efficacy of these filtered vaccine candidates in murine models will provide information critical in the design of a rationally optimized human SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

As the role of T cell epitope vaccines has not yet been clearly studied in SARS-CoV-2, we furthermore cross-referenced human and murine T cell epitopes to allow for murine vaccine studies using human-relevant peptides in H2-b and H2-d haplotypes. We hypothesize that inclusion of CD8 + epitopes may allow for clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from infected cells, and the inclusion of CD4 + epitopes may allow for greater activation of both cytotoxic and humoral antiviral responses. While overlapping CD4 + and CD8 + epitopes allowed for selection of peptide candidates covering a large proportion of the population, B/T cell overlapping epitope regions were more sparse due to the paucity of predicted B cell candidates. Thus, we expect the inclusion of overlapping CD4 + /CD8 + optimized peptides alongside B cell optimized peptides to provide the most robust and broad antiviral adaptive immune coverage.",

Reassuringly, the two extant studies examining T cell responses in COVID-19 patients have identified recurrent T cell epitopes which overlap with the vaccine peptides presented here. Le Bert et al. looked for T cell epitopes within the nucleocapsid (N), NSP-7 and NSP-13 proteins in PBMCs of recovered COVID-19 patients using an IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay 87 . They identified two recurrent epitope regions (N101-120, N321-340) which overlap with multiple 27mer vaccine peptides in this paper ( Figure 5B , peptides 4-8) . Shomuradova et al. also identified COVID-19 patient T cell epitopes, but using A*02:01 tetramers loaded with 13 distinct peptides from the surface glycoprotein (S) 88 . Two of these 13 peptides showed recurrent reactivity across 14 A*02:01 positive patients (S269-277 and S1000-1008).

Our B cell epitope analyses start with only 58 identified linear antibody epitopes on the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, while it is likely that many other epitopes are possible. Second, these linear epitope mappings do not allow for identification of antibodies which bind tertiary/quaternary protein structures. Lastly, identification of epitopes via array studies depended on differences in antibody binding to potential linear epitopes between uninfected and infected persons. There may be some cross-reactivity between antibodies generated against other coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, which if present might show reactivity in our screening assay. If true, our strategy would not identify these epitopes as specific for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, we excluded viral regions with significant polymorphism across the viral population. As polymorphic regions may be under selection pressure, at least some of which may be due to antiviral immunity, these regions may prove to be better epitope targets in patients infected by the relevant viral strains. We have avoided these in the current study, however, as we have focused here on conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 to identify epitopes that would be most broadly targetable in the human population. For these reasons, we do not present our antibody data as describing the complete set of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.",

However, we emphasize that epitope selection is only one aspect of the problem, and a key question is whether a peptide vaccine can be sufficiently immunogenic. Adjuvant selection, conjugation to carriers such as KLH 89 or rTTHC 90 , and prime/boost approaches using orthogonal platforms are all potential avenues to explore.
