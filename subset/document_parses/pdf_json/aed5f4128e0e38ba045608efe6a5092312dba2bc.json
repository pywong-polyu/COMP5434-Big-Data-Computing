Plants secret anti-metabolites to retard growth of soil and water bacteria and are ideal source of antibiotics. Purpose: Purpose of the study is to discover an alternate phyto-drug from medicinal plants of India that selectively kills MDR bacteria. Methods: MDR bacteria isolated from Ganga river water, milk, chicken meat and human hair for testing phytoextracts. Eighty medicinal plants were searched and six phyto-extracts were selected having good antibacterial activities as demonstrated by agar-hole assays giving 15 mm or greater lysis zone. Phyto-extracts were made in ethanol or methanol (1:5 w/v) for overnight and were concentrated. Preparative TLC and HPLC were performed to purify phytochemical. MASS, NMR, FTIR methods were used for chemical analysis of CU1. In vitro RNA polymerase and DNA polymerase assays were performed for target identification. Results: CU1 belongs to a saponin bromo-polyphenol compound with a large structure that purified on HPLC C 18 column at 3min. CU1 is bacteriocidal but three times less active than rifampicin in Agar-hole assay. While in LB medium it shows greater than fifteen times poor inhibitor due to solubility problem. CU1 inhibited transcription from Escherichia coli as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA Polymerases. Gel shift assays demonstrated that CU1 interferes at the open promoter complex formation step. On the other hand CU1 did not inhibit DNA polymerase. Conclusion: Phyto-chemicals from Cassia fistula bark are abundant, less toxic, target specific and may be a safer low cost drug against MDR bacterial diseases.",

AMR disease is a potential threat to life as most common antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, etc) are not able to kill bacteria due to the presence of mdr genes (bla, amp, cat, acc, aad, str, aph, sul, mcr, erm, cfr, dhfr) in plasmids followed by chromosomal mutations (gyrAB, porB, L4, and rRNA) (McArthur et al., 2013; Chakraborty, 2016a,b,c) . Few dozens mdr genes were isolated and sequenced, and many other mutations with potential higher drug inactivating capabilities were documented, causing human infections by Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Bacillus, and Escherichia species (Bush et al., 1995; Chakraborty., 2016a,b) . Importantly, small R-plasmids with 1-3 mdr genes have combined with F 0 -conjugative plasmid (62.5 kb)",

A 3.5KD small protease inhibitor (Fistulin) was purified from leaves of Cassia fistula having anti-microbial activities (Rajagopal et al., 2010) . Many chemical constituents have been analyzed from Cassia bean and tree parts (Sircar et al., 1970; Ginde et al., 1970; Arulpandi et al., 2012; Vaishnav et al., 1993; Bahorun et al., 2005; Bhandari et al., 2013) .

While in LB media the CU1 appeared less effective drug killing E. coli KT-1 as well as E.coli DH5a due to insolubility of CU1 in water (Fig. 2B) . Hence, the MIC determination was not reasonable which appeared much higher than rifampicin (10 \u03bcg/ml vs. 150 \u03bcg/ml)! We hope specific addition of -COOH or -NO2 group to triterpine moity may increase the solubility of drug in water and will lower the MIC.

We pinpointed in previous papers that Suregada multiflora and Cassia fistula organic extracts were potential source of anti-bacterial phytochemicals (Chakraborty., 2015; Chakraborty et al., 2018) . In this communication, We proved that one abundant Cassia fistula photo-chemical (CU1) has RNA Polymerase target and we substantially gave UV-Vis, MASS, NMR and FTIR evidences for structure prediction of the photo-chemical as terpentine linked to polybromophenols. MDR-TB is increasing in India and drug resistant mechanism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is complex. We have showed that Mycobacterium RNA polymerase was the target of CU1 with IC50 20-30 \u03bcg/ml. Interestingly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis plasmids were rare and TB-specific drugs were different supporting authentic RNA polymerase inhibition by CU1 phyto-chemical led to a new drug discovery against TB.

In truth, heterogeneous phyto-chemicals will be a new treatment method to conquer MDR pathogenesis and the herbal drugs are non-toxic. Due to multi-resistance and worldwide contamination of MDR bacteria in water and air, WHO predicted a GDP loss of 3% worldwide in the coming decade. In such scenario, Corona infections have created panic worldwide claiming 600 million infections and >2800000 deaths (Vaillancourt et al., 2020; Cant on et al., 2020) .

Thus, the need of MDR-Cure herbal drug against MDR pathogenesis is necessary and timing. We have characterized Cassia fistula (golden shower) CU1 phytochemical as complex structure of turpentine linked to bromopolyphenol but complete structure yet to determine. We are in process of characterizing other phyto-chemicals from Suregada multiflora, Jatropha gossipiifolia and Shorea robusta. Such bark is available in large amount from a medium sized tree which can grow in unfertile land and no water treatment was found necessary during summer. Recently, taxol, artiminisin, and quinine type of phyto-drugs have used as 95% pure similar to antibiotics. Thus, our approached to purify and characterize the CU1 phyto-chemical in detail to formulate as MDR-Cure drug is justified. Pure TLC purified CU1 was very active and such drug could be obtained at low cost. We have selected five plants and spices to make MDR-Cure and such drugs in combination will be effective against pan drug resistant bacteria. Abundant CU1 antibiotic is novel but less water soluble and will also help to understand the molecular mechanism of RNA synthesis in bacteria as there are very few drugs available today for RNA polymerase inhibition study and drug design against MDR bacteria. Our present goal to make a water soluble derivative of CU1 so that we can determine MIC carefully and such drug will be much better and more comparable to rifampicin. Moreover, we want to discover the target of CU3 and Cassia fistula bark crude ethanol extract is a good ayurvedic drug for MDR bacteria.",
