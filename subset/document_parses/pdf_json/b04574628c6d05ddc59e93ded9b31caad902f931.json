Design: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-country online survey between May and July 2020. We used a study-specific questionnaire mainly based on the adaptation of questions to assess food security and coping strategies from the World Food Programme's 'Emergency Food Security Assessment' and 'The Coping Strategy Index'. Setting: The questionnaire was hosted online using Google Forms and shared using social media platforms. Participants: A total of 1075 adult participants from eighty-two countries completed the questionnaire. Results: As a prelude to COVID-19 lockdowns, 62\u00b77 % of the participants reported to have stockpiled food, mainly cereals (59\u00b75 % of the respondents) and legumes (48\u00b78 %). An increase in the prices of staples, such as cereals and legumes, was widely reported. Price increases have been identified as an obstacle to food acquisition by 32\u00b77 % of participants. Participants reported having lesser variety (50\u00b74 %), quality (30\u00b72 %) and quantity (39\u00b72 %) of foods, with disparities across regions. Vulnerable groups were reported to be facing some struggle to acquire adequate food, especially people with chronic diseases (20\u00b72 %), the elderly (17\u00b73 %) and children (14\u00b75 %). To cope with the situation, participants mostly relied on less preferred foods (49 %), reduced portion sizes (30 %) and/or reduced the number of meals (25\u00b77 %). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted food accessibility and availability, altered dietary practices and worsened the food insecurity situation, particularly in the most fragile regions.",

Lockdowns have been slowing harvest and impacting food industries, including the closure of businesses, burying perishable food products or dumping milk by farmers (16) . As a result of the supply chain disruption and the increasing consumer demand, the prices of basic foods have begun to rise (16) , which could negatively affect people's access to healthy foods and contribute to food insecurity and malnutrition (16) . Furthermore, the unavailability or reduced affordability of healthy foods might lead to greater consumption of ultra-processed and canned foods, which, combined with reduced physical activity, could worsen obesity and other diet-related noncommunicable disease.",

Additionally, post-harvest loss, market price increases and urban demand for nutritious commodities declined during the early days of the pandemic (20) . Consequently, dietary diversity declined.

Emergency livelihoods is an adaptation of livelihood intervention to respond to the immediate need of the most vulnerable populations in times of crisis. Examples of interventions include emergency short-term employment/cash-for-work tailored to COVID-19 prevention measures such as building and rehabilitating sanitation of public areas, disinfection and cleaning of public buildings, provision of food assistance and financial grants for the most vulnerable households. COVID-19 has created new vulnerable groups such as casual workers, small business owners and private sector employees who lost their jobs and income. The list of beneficiaries of food and social assistance programmes should be adjusted to include these new vulnerable groups. The changes in food prices affect these new vulnerable groups; therefore, policies to improve access to nutritious foods are important. Additionally, as the COVID-19 pandemic persists, the provision of food assistance may not be sustainable. It is, therefore, important to promote long-term livelihood and resilience building solutions that will help the vulnerable to start economic activities and to sustain livelihoods and be self-sufficient. Sustained progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals may help combat current and future crises (30) . The ongoing global agenda for food systems transformation, which aims to accelerate the achievement of sustainable development goals, should consider policy measures that facilitate immediate access to food for the most vulnerable and provide social protection programmes together with efficient food distribution in time of crisis. Governments should promote and develop capacities for innovative food distribution approaches such as the establishment of food hubs, mobile sales and e-commerce platforms or informal networks.",

Access to accurate food price information should be prioritised as a policy response, in addition to instituting price control measures that aim to reduce the burden on the most affected. Further, governments should enhance food price monitoring and strengthen enforcement of violation of food price regulations. Food production, distribution and marketing should be monitored using rapid and repeated assessment tools in order to provide real-time information to evaluate the impacts on food security and inform post-COVID-19 recovery and management of future crises. The information can be disseminated through different channels including radio and social media. Such information provides opportunities for awareness campaigns on good food hygiene practices and nutritive value of different foods together with COVID-19 preventive measures.",

Nevertheless, the main limitation of our study is that our sample included mainly respondents with Internet access, high degrees and jobs, criteria that would somewhat constitute a middle class. Therefore, our results cannot be widely extrapolated beyond the scope of the current study. Interestingly, for some countries and regions, the fact that we observed high levels of food insecurity as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns among those in the population who are employed might be considered an indicator that the situation is probably worse in the lower economic strata of these populations. Also, it is likely that the food classifications used in the current study might not have the same definitions across countries. It is possible that the selection by the respondents of food items such as sweets or dairy may relate to diverse food items across countries. Likewise, other terms such as rural and urban may have different definitions across countries. Additionally, the country and regional differences in lockdown measures and food systems may mean populations may not experience these measures in the same manner and the coping mechanisms may also vary.",

Alongside reduced physical activity due to home confinement and unemployment, there is a great risk that the repercussions might include an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases and malnutrition. The data presented in the current study highlight the fragility of global food systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to rethink how we produce, process, market and consume our food to create more sustainable and resilient food systems that protect livelihoods in the face of vulnerabilities and crises, which may impact people's ability to have access to healthier diets. Subsequent surveys should also be planned in all countries in order to assess the impact of all the circumstances related to COVID-19 on populations' health and nutritional status.",
