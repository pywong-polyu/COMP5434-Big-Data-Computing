A total of 18 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed from the 18 th of March until the 4 th of April, among those, 14 imported cases, 2 flight attendants and 2 close contacts (1 bus driver and 1 husband of a COVID-19 patient). The median age of the patients was 48 years old, the youngest had 19 and the oldest 71 years old. Among the patients 11 were males and 7 females with a Sex Ratio Male/Female of 1.57. One female patient was admitted to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation for 13 days with a good post discharged outcome. This 52 years old lady has a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Among the patients, 6 had a specific treatment due to the presence of mild or extended pneumonia on CT-scanner, 3 under Hydroxychloroquine and 3 under Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. During this period no death susceptible to be linked to a COVID-19 infection was registered.",
