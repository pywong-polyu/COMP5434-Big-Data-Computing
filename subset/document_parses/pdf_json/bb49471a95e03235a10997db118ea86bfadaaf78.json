            "text": "In this study, researchers implemented a brief training plus coaching program in naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention with three participant triads. Each triad consisted of an early intervention provider, an English-speaking Latinx parent, and that parent's young child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or early signs of ASD who had limited vocal speech. The effects a single training session, plus two researcher coaching sessions were evaluated using a nonconcurrent multiple probes across participants design. Primary dependent variables included (a) the number of completed targeted communication turns between the parent and child and (b) the number of child independent target communication responses (gestures and manual signs) during family-selected routines. Additional measures examined whether parents used strategies taught to them during training, and whether early intervention providers addressed strategies taught via coaching. A social validity measure was used to determine parent and provider views of the training. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, training and post-training sessions were delivered via telehealth for two triads. While data trends and variability differed across triads, following training, all three families increased the number of completed target communication turns and all three children showed higher rates of independent communication responses. Parents and providers implemented strategies taught and reported positive effects of the program. Implications regarding the use of naturalistic intervention methods for Latinx families, the utility of brief training models to meet the needs of under-resourced early intervention programs, and potential uses of telehealth are discussed.",

Latinx families may be more likely to access state-run early intervention programs rather than more intensive autism-specific services due to culturallinguistic or economic barriers, mismatches between intensive services and culturalfamilial values, and the lack of specialty services in Latinx communities (Maga\u00f1a et al., 2013 (Maga\u00f1a et al., , 2016 . The state-run early intervention program in New Mexico does not include intensive autism-specific services, but NDBIs can be incorporated into less intensive community programs (Schreibman et al., 2015) . The ability to center intervention on family routines may also make naturalistic approaches a good fit for Latinx families (DuBay, 2018) .",

Traditionally, federally and state-funded early intervention programs make use of coaching models which involve both parents and clinicians. Early intervention coaching involves components such as (a) modeling and discussing target communication behaviors and strategies, (b) observing caregiver-child interactions during routines, (c) assisting caregivers with strategies, (d) providing praise and corrective feedback, and (e) allowing parents to reflect and ask questions (Friedman et al., 2012; Meadan et al., 2020) .

Instead, developmental specialists, who are early intervention generalists with varying educational backgrounds, provide more regular services to families. A recent survey found that New Mexico developmental specialists' knowledge of evidence-based strategies for ASD was significantly lower than SLPs, and the majority of developmental specialists had a knowledge gap in the area of naturalistic intervention (Author et al., 2018) . Developmental specialists also reported that working with parents was a primary barrier to serving children with ASD, and noted that they desired training in parent collaboration.",

For instance, if SLPs or behavior analysts with knowledge of NDBI approaches could provide consultative training and coaching to developmental specialists and families (in-situ or via telehealth), developmental specialists could continue to coach families during weekly visits. Exploring such approaches with Latinx families is critical in New Mexico and other states. Thus, the primary purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of a brief training/coaching program (focused on NDBI strategies) for developmental specialists and Latinx families with children with ASD or early signs of ASD. As the completion of turns using early communication forms (e.g., gestures) may be related to the development of further language skills (Dubin & Lieberman-Betz, 2020; Swanson et al., 2019) the primary outcome measures in this study were the number of completed target communication turns between a parent and child, and the number of child independent target communication responses. Although the training/ coaching program was designed to be implemented in-situ, following orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19, methods were modified to allow for training/coaching, and post-training sessions to occur via telehealth for two of the three families.

Participant triads (developmental specialist, parent, and child) were recruited from a New Mexico agency that provides free early intervention (birth-three) services to families from low-income backgrounds living in or around a mid-sized city. A majority of families served are Latinx. The lead researcher asked the agency's staff to recommend a pilot family receiving services from a developmental specialist that met the following criteria (a) at least one parent was proficient in English, (b) child receiving services had an ASD diagnosis, or screened as high risk for ASD (scores 8-20) on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers Revised with Follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F), and (c) child had minimal vocal speech (less than 15 words). The M-CHAT-R/F is a validated autism screener for children ages 16-30 months (Robins et al., 2014) that is administered to all children in New Mexico's early intervention program. A diagnosis of ASD was not used for inclusion due to long waitlists for ASD assessment in New Mexico. Supervisors recommended a family, and after obtaining informed consent, a pilot study was conducted. Following the pilot, the researcher asked supervisors to recommend three additional families who met criteria. The researcher met with each provider and parent to obtain informed consent. Parents consented for children's participation, and measures of child-assent were described. Table 1 provides demographic and assessment information for the three participating triads. Ethnicity was self-reported. All child participants were Latinx males between 1.9 and 2.9 years-old. Children 1 and 2 scored as high risk for ASD on the M-CHAT-R/F and were on evaluation waitlists. Child 3 had an ASD diagnosis. Parents 1 and 2 were Latinx fathers. Parent 3 was a Latinx mother with a learning disability. Parent 1 was bilingual (English/Spanish), while Parents 2 and 3 primarily spoke English. Developmental specialists were female (Caucasian, Latinx, and bi-racial).

In the baseline training video the lead researcher interacted with a 3-year-old boy with ASD (not a study participant) by playing with the child and providing verbal descriptions of his play (e.g., labeling items he interacted with), but did not use any other NDBI strategies. In the intervention training video the researcher continued to verbally comment on play, and modeled the following strategies with the child: (a) creating and capturing communication opportunities (via environmental arrangements and following the child's lead), (b) waiting for a response, (c) prompting with models and partial or full physical prompts, (d) responding to communication by giving items and doing actions, and (e) pairing vocal models related to targeted communication responses (e.g., saying up when child put arms in air). Methods for creating and capturing opportunities included giving the child items that required assistance, using items with multiple pieces, starting and then stopping a routine (like picking child up) to require a response, placing items slightly out of reach (e.g., held up or on shelf), following the child's lead (e.g., offering items the child walked towards), and taking turns with/modeling how to play with items. For waiting/prompting, the video provided examples of when to wait longer and use model prompts for partially known skills, or wait less and consider physical prompts for lesser-known skills. The video also reviewed ways to increase play engagement (e.g., model a funny or different way to play). A visual support that listed the strategies described in the video was created. Finally, in a coaching video the researcher coached the model child's mother to use the strategies from the previous video by providing direct assistance (e.g., helping to prompt the child, or handing the parent items to use for a communication opportunity), giving verbal suggestions or feedback, and praising strategy use. A visual support describing these coaching methods was created. A blank activity planner was also created for training. The planner allowed participants and the researcher to collectively fill in target communication behaviors, potential activities/items that may help elicit those behaviors, strategies to create/capture opportunities, and how to wait/prompt those behaviors.",

After transitioning to telehealth, direct assistance was no longer possible and it appeared that verbal suggestions/feedback were given less intermittently. Instead, providers gave feedback/suggestions only after parents' speech/ interactions had clearly paused for a period of time (likely impacted by the nature of Zoom). Thus, rather than use a frequency measure to examine how often each strategy was addressed, and with what coaching approach (direct assistance, verbal suggestions/ feedback, or praise), the researchers created a binary addressed/not addressed measure to indicate whether the developmental specialist provided coaching in creating opportunities, waiting, prompting, responding or verbal pairing, with ANY of the coaching methods (i.e., direct assistance for Triad 1 only, or via verbal suggestions/feedback, or praise for all Triads) during a session. A binary used/not used code for general praise of parents' overall use of strategies (i.e., praising implementation of a full sequence of create, wait, prompt and respond rather than giving praise for a discrete strategy) was also created.",

Triad 2 showed an immediate increase in the total completed targeted turns during the first post-training session. The most completed turns occurred during the third posttraining session with researcher coaching (20 completed turns). There was variability in the number of completed turns when researcher coaching was faded, however, rates maintained at levels above baseline during remaining post-training sessions with and without developmental specialist support (8-16 completed turns). Child 2 used one independent response during the first two post-trainings, and increased to eight independent responses by the third session. He maintained high rates of independent responding during remaining post-training sessions with provider support (9-11 responses), and decreased slightly when provider support was faded (5-9 responses).",

            "text": "This study was designed to meet the \"real world\" needs of under-resourced community-based early intervention programs. While more intensive training programs delivered by clinicians/researchers to parents alone are common in the research (Trembath et al., 2019) , findings from this study demonstrate that brief consultative training and coaching with parents and community-based providers may also lead to positive outcomes. While this study did not measure long-term outcomes or address a wide range of adaptative or communicative skills, there were still immediate changes to parent behavior, and gradual changes to children's communication skills. Notably, these changes involved increases in communicative turns, and children's independent use of early communication behaviors; factors correlated with further development of language and social skills (Medeiros & Winsler, 2014; \u00d6z\u00e7al\u0131\u015fkan et al., 2016; Swanson et al., 2019) . Although the direct effects of providers' coaching after researcher support was faded cannot be determined, the fact that developmental specialists continued to address intervention strategies is promising. Providers may have appropriately faded the number of strategies they addressed over time as parents became more proficient. Community-based agencies who do not have enough highly-trained therapists (e.g., behavior analysts, SLPs) to deliver direct services to families should consider adapting therapists' roles so that they can provide training and coaching during co-sessions with developmental specialists or other generalists. Therapists could design a series of trainings addressing other intervention strategies (e.g., responsive interactions) and provide intermittent follow-up coaching sessions. In addition to addressing the needs of under-resourced programs, this study supports prior research reporting positive outcomes for telehealth (Sutherland et al., 2018) . Although the family who completed training and post-training in-situ had the highest levels of responding, the two triads that participated via telehealth still showed increases in the primary dependent variables. It is unclear whether direct access to the researcher or developmental specialist impacted results, however, Provider 1 was able to consistently assist Parent 1 with prompting, creating opportunities, and reengaging the child. Such direct assistance may have been helpful for Triad 3, as Child 3 was most likely to become disengaged, and Parent 3 (who had a learning disability) experienced some challenges delivering prompts and managing materials. Thus, while telehealth may lead to improvements across parent and child outcomes, practitioners may also consider when, if possible, supplemental in-situ sessions may be appropriate. Prior qualitative research has, in fact, indicated that families of children with ASD who report positive aspects of telehealth, also suggest that they would benefit from some inperson sessions (Ashburner et al., 2016) . Telehealth implications extend beyond the pandemic as many under-resourced early intervention agencies are based in rural areas with even greater disparities in access to specialized therapists. The fact that the current training model was easily adapted to telehealth may provide support for hybrid inperson + telehealth models (e.g., where trainer is remote, and provider is present). Future research could compare in-situ, telehealth, and hybrid models.",

All parents in this study indicated that the training went well, that their children made improvements in communication, and that they would continue to use methods across routines. Minimal challenges (e.g., adjusting expectations, waiting for child to communicate) were reported and parents did not have suggestions to improve the training. Acceptance of intervention methods may have been impacted by the rationale building and inclusive team approach that occurred during training. While involving families and community providers in goal selection may help ensure cultural and familial relevancy, adaptations may still be needed. For instance, given prior research indicating that Latinx parents might express concern with strategies that appear to frustrate the child (DuBay, 2018), during coaching sessions the researcher provided suggestions to reduce any observed child frustrations. As an example, the researcher noted that Child 1 became frustrated when he was required to point to toy cars to request, but did not show frustration pointing to other items such as bubbles or balloons. The researcher recommended that the family allow free access to cars, while developing pointing with other items. Similarly, when Child 3 showed an aversion to physical prompts to point, the researcher recommended that his mother respond to reaches to initiate requesting. The researcher also addressed Parent 3's concerns that, on some days, her son wasn't in the \"best mood\" by explaining that adjusting expectations and strategy use on a daily basis was appropriate (e.g., creating fewer opportunities on days with lower motivation, but using play engagement strategies to look for ways to increase motivation and interest). Clinicians should collaboratively determine goals, discuss rationales, and adapt methods to meet the needs of individual children and families. Adapting strategies based on children's responses (e.g., engagement versus challenging behaviors) also provides a method for ensuring child assent.",

            "text": "Although experimental control was established, there are design limitations of this study. However, these limitations may be a by-product of conducting research in lesscontrolled naturalistic contexts. First, a non-concurrent multiple probe design is not as strong as a concurrent multiple baseline design and the researchers were unable to fully randomize assignment of baseline lengths due to the fact that one participant was going to age out of early intervention. However, the primary advantage of non-concurrent designs is that they are better suited to community-based educational contexts as scheduling can present challenges for concurrent designs (Harvey et al., 2004) . Similarly, while disruptions and modifications related to staff changes, and the pandemic (e.g., missing final baseline probe for Triad 3 due to COVID-19 restrictions prior to the transition to telehealth) may limit control, unexpected events and adaptations to service delivery are common in early intervention contexts. Conducting research only in ideal, controlled contexts would limit external validity. Additionally, while variability in the data could be considered a threat to internal validity, fluctuations in responding might be expected outcomes of naturalistic intervention. For instance, variability might have been affected by naturally occurring events such as a child not having a good night sleep (reported by Parent 3) or parents offering different play items. Additionally, while three target responses were selected so that parents could focus on different communicative behaviors based on the child's interests on a particular day, differences in proficiency with targets may have led to variability. For example, Child 1 initially showed higher rates of independence on days when he was more interested in items that required him to ask for assistance, as he was most proficient with the response form (handing item to parent) for this function. He did increase independent use of other targets, but rates of independent responding were influenced by daily interests. Overall, while there are control limitations of this study that were impacted by the focus on conducting research in a less-controlled community context, the consistent findings and strong effects observed provide preliminary support for the use of a brief NDBI training with early intervention providers and Latinx parents. While future research studies can consider ways to increase internal validity in natural contexts, this should not be done at the expense of external validity.",

For instance, while parents were instructed to increase wait time and use lower-level prompts as children became more proficient with target behaviors, the researchers did not establish an objective way of measuring the appropriate application of this technique. Anecdotally, it appeared that Parent 3 frequently began with prompts rather than using wait time and Provider 3 did not provide feedback on wait time. Future studies could attempt to operationalize appropriate use of wait time and prompt fading, and provide both parents and providers a more concrete decision-making process. With regard to children's outcomes, this study did not examine long-term maintenance or effects on vocal speech development. Anecdotally, Child 3 (who was reported to have some vocal approximations prior to this study), was observed to pair vocal approximations with target responses (e.g., saying o when signing OPEN and ju when pointing or reaching to juice). These outcomes could be assessed in future studies and children could be followed over time. Additional outcomes for provider behaviors could also be assessed. For instance, future studies could directly measure whether providers generalize strategies to other families (which developmental specialists in the current study selfreported). Due to the COVID-19 modifications (when the types of coaching strategies that could be use changed), the researchers did not measure the overall frequency of coaching behaviors. Anecdotally, although providers 2 and 3 gave suggestions and feedback over video, provider 1 provided more regular assistance/feedback throughout in-person sessions. Although it may be beneficial for clinicians to first observe (via video or in-person) routines and then provide feedback, in-the-moment assistance or suggestions could also be advantageous in some cases. Future studies could provide clear guidelines of when to coach during a session. For example, providers could give suggestions in the moment if a parent appeared to struggle with applying a strategy or had not created an opportunity in a long time. At the end of the session, providers could use a checklist to mark strategies already addressed, and provide feedback or praise for other strategies. Less distracting methods for telehealth (e.g., bug-in-ear devices) could also be further explored.",

Although it has not been evaluated experimentally, it has been suggested that children with ASD who are taught MORE as a first sign may overgeneralize this response and experience communication breakdowns when they attempt to initiate first requests with MORE (Vail & Forbes, 2016) . In this study, MORE was a target because it had already been introduced to children 2 and 3. The researcher discussed issues with over-generalization with both triads, and reiterated that each child's pointing or reaching responses should be used to request items the first time or when making choices, and MORE should only be used when the child desired more of an action, or had already initially requested an item (e.g., with a point) and wanted additional pieces. Future research could, however, explore whether teaching MORE first effects the development of additional signs. Additionally, although parents 2 and 3 indicated a desire to continue using signs (and both child 2 and 3 were observed to imitate the sign MORE at least once during baseline), there was no assessment of children's modality preference or proficiency (e.g., comparing signs or gestures to aided augmentative or alternative communication systems).

Although similar methods appeared to be effective with a female participant during the pilot, replication is required. Study methods could also be replicated across rural families, families from other underrepresented groups (e.g., Native Americans), and across Spanish-speaking Latinx families. Families in this study were required to be proficient in English primarily because the lead researcher is not fluent in Spanish, and the cooperating agency has a limited number of bilingual providers. Parent 1 was bilingual and expressed that he and his wife often spoke Spanish to their child. The researcher encouraged Parent 1 to provide vocal models in both English and Spanish, but he was primarily observed to use English during sessions. It is possible his tendency to speak in English was influenced by the fact that neither the developmental specialist nor researcher were fluent Spanish speakers. As shortages of trained bilingual specialists is a real-world concern in early intervention, future studies could explore whether trainings involving bilingual providers are effective for bilingual or monolingual Spanish-speaking families. Alternatively, research could explore barriers to bilingual service providers seeking additional, specialized certifications.",
