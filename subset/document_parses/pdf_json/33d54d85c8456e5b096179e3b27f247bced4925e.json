Initial costs related to setup of a new scanner include siting of the physical location, purchase of scanner equipment, and construction [1] . Once a scanner is set up, ongoing costs include salary support for MRI staff including technologists, physicists and radiologists; service and maintenance expenses; and any costs associated with physical space and equipment leasing, as well as periodic upgrades of software and coils. Because of the high costs associated with new MR scanners, equipment purchases might not fit into the annual radiology department operating budget and might require a separate capital planning process [2] . New MR equipment can be leased rather than purchased, which offers the advantages of lower annual expenditures and the opportunity to upgrade older scanners in a timelier fashion compared with traditional equipment purchasing. Because of the high level of technological innovation in pediatric MRI [3] , MR equipment should be upgraded every few years, so financial planning for an MRI service should include planning for the immediate (1year), medium (5-year) and long-term (10-year) horizons.",

One such list of MRI hardware and technical specifications was created by the Royal College of Radiologists for MRI equipment planning for the United Kingdom National Health Service [5] . A grade or score is issued for each existing scanner in an MR inventory to help identify areas of need and objectively track scanner performance longitudinally. Based on grade trends, specific features can be targeted for upgrade and a timeline for upgrade or replacement can be derived, which further aids in prioritizing current and future capital planning.",

Multiple MR vendors offer limited upgrade options that keep the existing magnet in place while replacing the surrounding equipment including electronics, gradients and workstation (e.g., Fit, Siemens, Malvern, PA; Lift, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). This option offers reductions in cost and construction downtime compared with a full scanner replacement. Less costly upgrade options ($10,000-$100,000 USD) include software, application and gradient coil replacements that can improve scanning time, image quality and data transmission efficiency. Many additional factors must be considered when replacing existing magnets, as well, that influence capital planning. In some cases, magnetic shielding also requires concurrent updating because these generally deteriorate over 15-20 years, and power sources might need to be modified to provide sufficient voltage to support the upgraded equipment. Finally, physical requirements for adequate swing space and decanting volume during construction need to be factored, and this can also influence the decision to upgrade existing equipment or install new MR scanners.",

There are advantages and disadvantages to single or multiple vendor relationships (Table 1) . For example, working with a single vendor can streamline technologist training and equipment service, as well as provide long-term savings with a bundled service contract. However, a competitive market allows a multi-vendor model to provide competitive purchase prices and scanner-specific customization. Of course, it is acknowledged that choice of vendor for a clinical MRI service might be driven primarily by financial and other institution-specific factors (e.g., a common vendor for MR and CT or US), so this relationship is likely to be fixed for a given radiology department.",

Quality control ensures that study images are of diagnostic quality; quality assurance involves ongoing review to ensure quality standards are consistently met; and quality improvement is a data-driven process by which process improvement strategies are identified and implemented. Discussion of image quality should also extend to equipment outside the MR scanner itself to include the required volume of surface coils and other ancillary equipment. It is important to note that having the best MRI equipment does not guarantee improvement in an MRI clinical service. For example, mean scan times for a given MR scanner are influenced greatly by patient type and study complexity, which can far outweigh equipment-specific factors. Scanners that accommodate a mixed patient population, including inpatients and sedation cases, will naturally have slower throughput and room turnover compared with scanners in outpatient locations. In addition, certain body parts (e.g., brain, knee) have shorter protocols compared with others (e.g., abdomen, whole body) and might require less real-time radiologist monitoring, implying that the referral base and exam mix of a given scanner will impact clinical volume and scheduled timeslot duration.",

Addressing safety considerations also requires advanced training in MRI safety for non-radiology care team members who accompany the patient during the study, restricted access to MRI safety zones for non-clinical personnel such as security and facility maintenance staff, and a rigorous process for screening for external and internal metal implants and metallic foreign bodies. Additionally, a protocol for performing MRI in children with implanted devices such as nerve stimulators and cardiac electronic devices must also be established, often in conjunction with the cardiology or electrophysiology service or device vendors [9] .

Therefore, there are additional considerations unique to establishing a pediatric anesthesia MRI service from an operational perspective. These considerations include ensuring adequate staffing and scheduling of nurses and anesthetists, which is often a collaborative effort between radiology and anesthesiology departments [10] . Because of the fasting requirement for patients prior to sedation, early morning start times are preferable for many young children to avoid prolonged times without nutrition. Space and staff must be available to ensure post-anesthesia recovery of patients [11] . In addition, for many children with neurologic conditions or developmental delay, the anesthesia MRI event is an opportunity to perform additional medical or preventative procedures while the child is under sedation, such as lumbar punctures and dental exams. An anesthesia MRI service should establish what, if any, ancillary procedures can be performed after anesthesia MRI as well as a standardized process for requesting and accommodating them.",

Each MRI protocol involves creation of standardized planes, sequences, policies for contrast use, and technical parameters for specific MR exam types. Each radiology department should create its own set of standardized MR protocols as well as a standardized workflow for protocoling MRI exams in advance to minimize errors in image acquisition and scheduling of patients to incorrect resources (e.g., 3-T scanner, anesthesia timeslot, etc.). Ideally, MRI studies should be protocoled in advance because decisions such as scanner assignment, total image acquisition time, and need for general anesthesia depend on protocol type and length. MR protocoling should also ideally be harmonized with any payer authorization documentation in children with medical insurance to ensure that the MRI exam performed matches the study authorized by the insurance carrier. Further optimization can be achieved with recent advancements in auto-protocoling \u2022 Scanner-specific protocols and works in progress sequences",

Radiology information systems often provide a real-time view of MR scans that are scheduled and in progress (Fig. 1) that can serve as a real-time MRI workflow dashboard. This allows MR technologists and operations managers to monitor scanner progress and conduct daily resource allocation while scheduling addon cases. Resource allocation for inpatient studies is particularly challenging; they are often time-sensitive and cannot be scheduled in advance and must conform to the clinical patient care routine. For these reasons, inpatient and emergent studies are uniquely demanding and must be prioritized based on acuity and wait time. The successful MRI service must decide how to prioritize acute patients referred from different clinical services and determine the weight of point of service, for example whether the child is based in the emergency room, inpatient floor, stepdown or intensive care unit, and its impact on queue positioning. These decisions require clear communication among technologists and radiologists, especially between shifts, and necessitate capabilities in real-time examination tracking, image checks and communication. For example, integrated instant messaging is strongly recommended. One consideration in the case of nonscheduled, emergent indications requiring prioritization, such as appendicitis, is to install MR equipment for dedicated use in the emergency department where resources allow.",

Radiology departments will likely need to find solutions to increase MRI capacity, through some combination of shortening MRI protocols and scan times, lengthening hours of operation, and installing new equipment. Data analytics are likely to play a crucial role in helping anticipate changes in pediatric MRI demand.

Each bar represents a week's worth of total exam volume. Blue bars indicate actual volume as a percentage of pre-COVID studies prior to introduction of reopening measures. Predicted volume corresponding to subsequent introduction of reopening measures is indicated by orange for phase 1, gray for phase 2 and yellow for phase 3 in order of decreased restrictions due to relaxing of COVID-19 safety protocols. Predicted decrease in volume during weeks 29-36 corresponds to potential rollback in reopening measures. Data provided by Steven Guitron, Massachusetts General Hospital Medical Analytics Group",
