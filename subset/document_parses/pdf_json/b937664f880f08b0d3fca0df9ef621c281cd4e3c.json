These findings have also been confirmed with the modelled structure of monomeric and dimeric nucleocapsid protein via HHPred software and its solvent accessible surface area, which indicates higher stability and antigenicity of the dimeric type as compared to the monomeric form. It is evident that use of the dimeric form will increase the sensitivity of the current nucleocapsid dependent ELISA for rapid COVID-19 diagnostic. Further, the results indicate that monitoring and maintaining of the monomerdimer composition is critical for accurate and robust diagnostics.",

SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a ~45.6 kDa phosphoprotein, comprising of a N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by a loosely structured linkage region containing a serine/arginine-rich (SR) domain 7, 8 . The residues from 45 to 181 of the NTD are responsible for the binding of viral RNA to the N protein. SR area linking the NTD and CTD is the site of phosphorylation which is assumed to control N protein performance 9 . Hydrophobic CTD of the N protein contains residues responsible for the homodimerization of the N protein [10] [11] [12] [13] . Homodimers of N protein are recorded to self-assemble into higher-order oligomeric complexes, possibly through cooperative interactions of homodimers 14 . Development of higher-order oligomeric complexes requires both dimerization domain and the expanded asymmetric moiety of the CTD 7, 15, 16 .",

This is the reason why the N protein is being widely used in vaccine development and serological assays [17] [18] [19] . It has been shown for SARS-CoV that the C-terminal region of the N protein is crucial for eliciting antibodies in immunological process 20 . Most diagnostic assays are based on the antigenic proteins, either N or S protein, of the SARS-CoV-2 [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .

As a result, minimal information exists on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein monomer and its assembly into higher-order complexes. In this study, full-length protein of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as aggregated inclusion bodies. Two major peaks of the N protein were identified as a monomeric and dimeric conformation via size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle static light scattering (MALS), circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Further, the antigenicity of these conformations was compared through a highly sensitive and precise ELISA-based antibody test. The epitope and solvent accessibility of the monomer and dimer forms of the N protein was also predicted using bioinformatics tools to study the structural stability and antigenicity of these conformations. It is evident that use of the dimeric form will increase the sensitivity of the current nucleocapsid dependent ELISA for rapid COVID-19 diagnostic. Further, the results indicate that monitoring and maintaining of the monomer-dimer composition is critical for accurate and robust diagnostics.

Antigenic response of the monomeric and dimeric form of the N protein was evaluated through indirect ELISA using monoclonal antibody targeted against nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2. In order to improve the assay performance, a systemic perusal of each step of the ELISA was performed. Variables such as antigen-coating concentration and primary antibody dilution were optimized. Four concentrations of N protein monomer and dimer fractions (50-200 ng well -1 ) were coated on the 96-well polystyrene plate. As illustrated inFigure 10b, at a protein concentration of 150 ng well -1 , dimeric fraction of the N protein was clearly superior for anti-N IgG detection. Following antigen-coating, an ideal primary antibody dilution was tested. Six-two-fold dilutions of primary antibody were generated for the detection of coated N-protein monomer and dimer.Initially, antigen detection was increased with the increase in primary antibody dilution. The detectability saturated at a dilution of 1:3000 dilution and upon further increase in the dilution of the primary antibody, the detection worsened as shown inFigure 10a. Owing to the superior antigenicity of the dimeric form of the N protein, impact of increasing percentage of dimer in the solution on its immunogenicity was further examined. Samples containing different percentages of N protein dimers (10-75%) were coated on the polystyrene plate and were detected by primary antibody (anti-N IgG, 1:3000). It can be inferred fromFigure.",

Additionally, 3D epitopes were predicted to find the potential of binding of the monomeric and the dimeric species with the antibody. Dimer species exhibited double the number of epitopes compared to the monomer, thereby enhancing the chances to interact with the antibody, an observation supported by experimental data. This is the first of its kind study, elucidating the impact of dimerization of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein on sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based diagnostics of COVID-19. The optical density calculation in the ELISA assay improved 1 when a high proportion of the dimeric fraction was used as antigen. Thus, further modification of existing assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and use of a high proportion of full-length nucleocapsid fragment dimer can further enhance the sensitivity of the existing rapid kit and ELISA assay.MethodsConstruct and expression of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) purchased from Novagen -Merck Life Science Private Limited, India (Cat. No.69450-4), was used in the current study. The expression construct of SARS-CoV-2 N protein was commercially procured through Addgene in a pGBW-m4046785 vector with N protein gene insert of 1253 bp under the control of T7 promoter. The expression construct was transformed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain and bacterial culture was grown in terrific broth at 37.0 \u00b0C in the presence of 25 \u00b5g mL -1 chloramphenicol. When the O.D. at 600 of primary culture reached up to 1.0 \u00b1 0.2, the secondary culture (100.0 ml) was inoculated with 5.0 ml of primary seed culture. Bacterial cultivations were carried out at 37.0 \u00b0C. 1.0 mM isopropyl \u03b2 D 1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to induce the secondary culture in the midlog phase. Cells were harvested after 12 hours of induction and subjected to primary downstream processing steps to confirm protein expression. Production of SARS-CoV-2 N protein in bioreactor. Protein expression was scaled-up in a 1.3 L bioreactor (Eppendorf, USA) with 0.5 L initial volume. Gas flow rate was maintained between 0.5-1.5 vvm (0.5-0.6 Lmin -1 ) by the mass flow controller. The pH of the media was monitored by a pH probe and maintained at 7.0\u00b10.2 by using 3 N phosphoric acid and 12.5% ammonia. Temperature was maintained at 37.0 \u00b0C. Dissolved oxygen of the batch was controlled at 30% saturation by cascading the stirrer speed between 300-900 rpm. Bioreactor was monitored and controlled by the Biocommand software (Eppendorf, USA). Fed batch media containing glycerol (200 g L -1 , v/v) and yeast extract (1%, w/v) was continuously fed to the bacterial culture to enhance the biomass. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 8 h and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min. Cell pellet was washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), lysed using an Ultrasonicator system (Oscar Ultrsonics Pvt., Ltd., India) for 30 min with 30s on/off (50% duty cycle). Lysed cells were then centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, supernatant was discarded, and the obtained IBs were washed twice with saline. Protein expression was analysed through SDS-PAGE. Purification of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. IBs were solubilized in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 6 M urea (pH 8.0) for 2 hours. The solution was then centrifuged and supernatant was collected. To prepare CEX load, the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using acetic acid and conductivity was adjusted to <3.0 mS/cm using deionised water. The CEX column (SP Sepharose FF, Cytiva USA) was equilibrated with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and the load was pumped on the CEX column at 5 min retention time. The bound N protein was eluted using 1 M NaCl in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). This purification step also doubled as an on-column refolding step for the N protein. The elute contained a mixture of monomer and dimer of the protein which was separated using preparative SEC (Superdex 200, Cytiva USA). Phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) with 10% glycerol (v/v) was used to equilibrate the SEC column and CEX elute (1% of column volume) was injected at 45 min retention time. The SEC output was fractionated, and each fraction was analysed using analytical SEC. Purified monomer and dimer fractions were used for further analysis. Immunoblotting. Purified SARS-CoV-2 N protein was electrophoresed on 4-10% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (CBBG-250). For the detection of N protein through immunoblotting, the obtained protein bands were transferred onto a 0.22 \u03bc m nitrocellulose membrane (MDI) using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in Tris buffered saline-0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST) under gentle shaking at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed thrice with 1X-TBST and incubated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibodies (catalogue No. ab272852, Abcam, 1:1000) in TBST with BSA (2%, w/v). The membrane was then washed thrice with 1X-TBST. Immunoblot was then incubated with HRP conjugated-goat anti-human IgG secondary antibodies (Millipore, AP309P) in a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h. The immunoblot was washed thrice with 1X TBST and was visualized on SuperSignal\u2122 West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fischer Scientific), and chemiluminescent signals were captured using ImageQuant LAS 500 instrument (GE Healthcare). Peptide mass fingerprinting. In-gel digestion with trypsin protocol was followed for mapping of purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein 33 . Gel band of interest was excised and transferred into microcentrifuge tube and destained by incubating for 30 minutes in 100 \u03bc L of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) with vertexing. Then the gel pieces were incubated and vortexed in 200 \u03bc L of acetonitrile. Trypsin (Agilent Technologies, California, USA) was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 12-14 hrs. Peptides were extracted by adding 100 \u03bc L of 1:2 solution of 5% formic acid and acetonitrile and incubated for 15 mins in a shaker at 37 \u00b0C. The liquid obtained was evaporated by Speed-Vac vacuum centrifuge and was reconstituted in the 0.1% formic acid for the LC-MS. Digested peptides were separated on a C18 column (Advance Bio Peptide mapping Plus C18, 1260 HPLC with detector at 214 nm. Column temperature was maintained at 55 \u00b0C. The column was equilibrated with 98% solvent A (0.1% TFA in water) and 2% solvent B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) for 10 min with a flow rate of 0.5 mlmin -1 . Elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 2-45% B for 45 min followed by 45-60% B for 10 min, then linear gradient to 100% B for 10 min. Column was cleaned with 100% B for 10 min followed by equilibration with 98% A for 10 min. LC was coupled with ESI-TOF (Agilent Technologies, California USA) and TIC were recorded for m/z 100-3200. The capillary was set at a temperature of 300 \u00b0C with a gas flow rate of 8 L/min and nebulizer at 35 psig in positive ion mode. MS spectrum was analysed with Agilent MassHunter Qualitative analysis software (B.07.00). Molecular mass identification of monomer and dimer form of N protein. SEC was performed on Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with Superdex 200 (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA) maintained at 25\u00b0C. The column was equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6.8, 300 mM NaCl salt concentration and 0.02% sodium azide at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Both the fractions of the purified N protein were injected and run for 50 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and detected at 280 nm. SEC was coupled with MALS from Wyatt technologies, CA, USA, to confirm the molecular mass of the monomer and dimer fractions. All the buffers were filtered through a Pall Life Sciences, NY, USA).Circular dichroism spectroscopy. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-1500 spectrophotometer (Jasco Inc., Maryland, U.S). Secondary structure was measured in the Far-UV range from 195-250 nm with a 1 nm step size. Data were normalized by subtracting the baseline with the buffer and smoothed with Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter.",

Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on a Cary EclipseFluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, United States) using Costar 96-well black polystyrene plate. The tryptophan fluorescence was recorded with excitation at 285 nm and emission between 300-500 nm. Slits for both excitation and emission were 5 nm.Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The fraction of dimeric form of purified N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was diluted at 10 ng\u00b5L -1 in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Thediluted protein was coated in an increasing gradient (25-200 ng well -1 ) on a 96-microtiter ELISA plate (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific) overnight at 4 o C. On the subsequent day, unbound protein was removed, and wells were washed thrice with 1X TBST buffer. Wells were then blocked with 4% (w/v) skimmed milk prepared in 1X TBST buffer and incubated at 37 o C for 1 h. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibodies (Abcam) were diluted in 1X TBST and 100 \u03bc L of the diluted antibodies were allowed to interact with the coated N protein in the ELISA wells at 37 o C for 1 h. Wells were then washed with 200 \u03bc L of 1X TBST buffer three times followed by incubation with 100 \u03bc L of goat IgG-HRP antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prepared in 1X TBST buffer. The wells were then washed three times with 200 \u03bc L of 1X TBST buffer. One hundred microlitre 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each well and incubated for 10-15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bc L of 0.18 M sulphuric acid and the optical densities of the plate wells were measured using Biotek plate reader at 450 nm. Monomeric/dimeric structure modelling. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 N protein was collected from Uniprot 33 database with uniport ID: PODTC9. Multi template approach was used to build the model of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Modeling of the structure was performed using the online version of the HHpred tool 34 . This identified the most promising template for building the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Final template-based modeling was performed using the modeller tool",
