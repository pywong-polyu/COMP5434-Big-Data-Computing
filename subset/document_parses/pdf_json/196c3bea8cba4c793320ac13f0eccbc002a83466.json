Relationship status was indirectly associated with past-year suicide ideation via the mediators of depression and burdensomeness, and was associated with past-year attempts via its effect on ideation.

            "text": "Recent years have seen attempts to tether knowledge about suicide in autistic people to existing models about suicide in the general population, which might afford deeper understanding and predictive utility. Particular attention has been paid to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) [14] , which holds that \"people die by suicide because they can and because they want to\" (p. 583, italics added). Importantly, this distinguishes suicidal ideation and attempts as distinct phenomena with shared and unique correlates, and highlights that only a small percentage who experience the former progress to the latter. With reference to suicide ideation, the ITS asserts the importance of thwarted belongingness, a state of social disconnection, and perceived burdensomeness (henceforth 'burdensomeness'), wherein the individual feels so irredeemably flawed or worthless such as to be a liability to those around them. While either can produce a passive wish for death, the combination of both together invokes strong and active feelings of suicide ideation. For suicide ideation to progress to attempts, the theory asserts the need for an individual to acquire 'capability' for suicide, typically via exposure to physically painful and/or emotionally provocative events, including self-injury, which habituate them to pain and reduce the evolutionary fear of pain and dying.",

It also seems likely that autistic people might accrue capability for suicide at higher rates than nonautistic people, given the greater frequency of self-injury [25, 26] , abuse and assault [17, 27, 28] in autistic children and adults. Differences in the rate at which autistic people acquire capability for suicide might also be posited, since capability for suicide can also be related to genetic or dispositional attributes (such as differences in pain sensitivity, squeamishness and harm avoidance) [29] . Accordingly, differences in the way that autistic people experience pain, their own and that observed in other people [30] [31] [32] , may also be relevant to the ease and speed at which they might progress from suicide ideation to attempts.",

Pelton and colleagues [9] examined thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness, and their interaction as predictors of suicide ideation, and burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, acquired capability and their interaction term as predictors of suicide attempts. They found that although thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness were higher in autistic participants, these constructs explained less of the variance in suicide ideation and attempts than in the nonautistic comparison group. Whilst in non-autistic people suicide ideation was predicted by thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness, and their interaction, this interaction was a non-significant predictor of suicide ideation in autistic people. In this group, both thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness individually predicted suicide attempts, leading the authors to suggest the progression from ideation to attempts might be faster in autistic individuals. Acquired capability predicted suicide attempts in both populations, but was no greater in autistic than non-autistic participants. Dow et al. [33] examined relationships, in autistic adults, between depression, suicide ideation, suicide attempts and a subset of items, taken from standardised scales, which reflected thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness, and acquired capability. They reported a significant relationship between acquired capability and suicide attempts, and a relationship between burdensomeness and suicide attempts. Both thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness, in this study, predicted suicide ideation; furthermore, both were associated with lifetime history of depression.",

            "text": "While both studies reflect important investigations into the relevance of ITS constructs to autistic people, there is need for further investigation on several fronts. Firstly, neither of these previous studies were able to examine a fundamental argument of the ITS: that thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness, albeit closely related to depression and anxiety, are separate, distinct predictors and necessary antecedents of suicide ideation [14, 34, 35] . As these previous studies did not model depression and anxiety independently, any distinct relevance of ITS constructs in autistic people could not be established. Secondly, only Pelton and colleagues addressed another central tenet of the ITS: that the interaction of co-occurring thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness is critical for suicide ideation, over and above main effects of these variables; and, similarly, that the interaction of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness, co-occurring with a state of acquired capability, is crucial for suicide attempts. The unique importance of these interactions between constructs was not supported in their sample of autistic adults, but this finding requires replication, especially as the authors employed a narrow conceptualization of acquired capability. While they focused solely on reduced fear of death, more recent approaches suggest a three-faceted construct including mental rehearsal of suicidal actions alongside reduced fear of death and greater pain tolerance. Engaging in mental rehearsal, according to George et al. [36] , \"inject[s] [thoughts of suicide behaviours] with an active, volitional quality\" (p. 1460), which crystallizes intent and amplifies ideation in addition to building capability for execution of these actions. There is, as such, a need to examine this variable in greater depth and to reconsider its associations with both suicide ideation and suicide attempts.",

Two such features were chosen for investigation here: relationship status and age at diagnosis. In relation to the former, lower rates of suicide attempts and suicide deaths have been observed in autistic people who were in relationships (married or cohabiting) than in those who were single [4] . Given the centrality of social connectedness and reciprocity in the ITS, the 'living situation' of participants was indeed formerly highlighted by Pelton et al. [9] as a variable of potential import. Satisfactory intimate relationships can be a source of social connectedness and support [37] , and while being in a healthy relationship can support self-esteem, having ever begun a relationship is also associated with greater feelings of self-worth [38] . It follows naturally from this that satisfactory relationships might be associated with lower likelihood of states characterised by thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness, and that this mechanism might explain the association observed in the general population between satisfactory relationships and reduced risk of suicide ideation [39] .",

While not all studies support this association [6] , it is consistent with findings of greater incidence of psychiatric illnesses (including depression, anxiety, OCD and eating disorders), selfinjury, behavioural and social difficulties in late-diagnosed children and adolescents [40] [41] [42] . In adults, one study corroborated that a lifetime history of depression was predictive of older age at diagnosis [43] . Reflecting on their findings, Hosozawa et al. [40] suggested that individuals diagnosed later in childhood are less likely to receive evidence-based interventions and support, and are potentially at greater risk of being bullied. Qualitative work indeed suggests that bullying and victimization is commonly experienced by late-diagnosed autistic adults, who often perceive themselves as inadequate and as outcasts [44] [45] [46] . Another potential link between late diagnosis, mental ill-health and suicidality lies in the probability that these individuals may be more adept at camouflaging their difficulties [47] , a correlate of older age at diagnosis which is independent of the sex of participants [48] . Camouflaging has previously been associated with suicidality [6] , and in non-autistic people, at least, thwarted belongingness mediates this link [49] .",

Firstly, from June to December of 2020, advertisements for the study were posted on social media (Facebook and Twitter communities run by and for autistic people) and distributed to the Cambridge Autism Research Database (CARD: approximately 34.7% of the final sample). During the same period, we also contacted participants from prior studies [8, 21] who had consented to receive news of any future research by our group (22.6% of the final sample). In January 2021, we distributed our advertisement to the volunteer panel of Autistica's research network (42.7% of the final sample). Altogether, the sample comprised 314 autistic adults, whose demographic details can be seen in Table 1 . A formal diagnosis is necessary for inclusion on the CARD database, but this is not a prerequisite for Autistica research volunteers. Although we did not independently verify diagnoses, all participants provided the date and place of their diagnostic assessment and some also reported the precise diagnosis given (if relevant). The majority of participants (95.8%) lived in the UK; a small minority were based in the USA (1.3%) and the remainder hailed from countries within the European Union and South America.",

Aside from participants who received a 0 indicating no suicide ideation within the past year, scores on this composite could range from 2 to 12.

To examine this, we performed a set of three regressions, correcting alphas level to p = 0.016 and setting confidence intervals at 95% in each case. Two of these analyses were linear regressions, one for past-year suicide ideation (using our composite measure) and one for lifetime suicide attempts. In the regression for suicide ideation, the Enter method was used to model depression and anxiety in the first block of the model, to disentangle their effects as covariates. Given the hypothesised centrality of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness for suicide ideation [14] , and the proposed contributions of mental rehearsal to strengthening suicide ideation while building capability [36] , these variables were entered in the second block of the model. To test the hypothesis that the interaction of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness would explain greater variance than either variable alone [14] , the interaction term of these variables was entered in the third block of the model, as per Pelton and colleagues [9] . This approach has been used widely [64, 65] to create a proxy for states where these ITS constructs co-occur at high levels. The second linear regression, for lifetime suicide attempts, modelled depression and anxiety in the first block; all factors of acquired capability, thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness (given their unexpected relevance to suicide attempts in Pelton et al.) in the second block; then, as before, the interaction term of thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness and acquired capability (total ACWRSS score) in the third block of the model.",

We also examined their associations with age and sex, variables of relevance with respect to suicide. Greater age at diagnosis, in particular, was strongly associated with older age generally (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). As these variables could influence relationships between factors of interest, they were controlled for as covariates in each mediation analysis.

For suicide ideation, it asserts the relevance of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness, with recent suggestions that mental rehearsal, a facet of acquired capability, may also contribute unique variance [36] ; for suicide attempts, it purports the especial relevance of acquired capability for suicide. Statistically, the relevance of these factors should be reflected in main effects of each predictor on these outcome variables, main effects which should, importantly, be independent of any contributions of depression and anxiety [35] . An additional, important tenet of the ITS posits that the interaction (combination) of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness is necessary to transform 'passive' to 'active' suicide ideation, and that likewise, that suicide attempts will only occur in the presence of active suicide ideation (thwarted belongingness + burdensomeness) and capability for suicide. Statistically, this suggests that interaction terms reflecting co-occurring levels of each state should explain unique variance in models of suicide ideation and suicide attempts.

The relevance of burdensomeness for suicide ideation and furthermore attempts in our sample, even while their average score (17.1) fell below the cut-off [22] proposed for optimal sensitivity and specificity in the general population [71] , suggests it may be a potent contributor to suicidality. At the same time, given that our participants scored well above the suggested clinical cut-off [31] for thwarted belongingness, our findings cast doubt on the relevance of this variable, which not only failed to predict suicide ideation (or attempts) but failed to differentiate non-suicidal participants from those who had experienced suicide ideation and attempts. Though they did observe relationships between thwarted belongingness, suicide ideation and attempts [9] , Pelton and colleagues suggest that feelings of thwarted belongingness may be far more \"typical\" of social experiences in autistic people and more reflective of pathological social disconnection in non-autistic people [72] . It is possible that in our study, items of the INQ-15 failed to capture the more noxious forms of these experiences and feelings in autistic people; previous research does suggest that autistic and non-autistic respondents interpret these items differently [72] . Accordingly, abandonment of this construct as a suicidogenic factor would be premature, especially given the recognised contributions of loneliness to mental illness, self-injury and suicidality in autistic people [6, 73] .",

In this aspect, our findings corroborated those of Pelton and colleagues [9] in opposing this particular hypothesis as it pertains to autistic adults. Both studies computed interaction terms which were assumed to mark out participants who were experiencing strong feelings of both thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness. The multicollinearity induced by addition of the interaction term obscures any estimation of the unique variance apportioned to it, but the fact that there was no significant change in the variance explained by the model suggests that the combination of these two factors was no more potent than that of either construct alone. This is in fact not inconsistent with extant literature from the general population, as most studies fail to support the interaction hypotheses of the ITS [64, 65] . The emergence of relationships between ITS constructs and indices of suicidality is notoriously sensitive to the operationalisation of the variables in question [65] , and the interaction hypotheses are particularly difficult to test in that they concern the alignment of dynamic, fluctuating states. We suspect that rather than constituting valid evidence against this particular ITS hypothesis, the statistical interactions computed in the present study and by Pelton et al. were simply unrepresentative of real, dynamic \"interactions\", in the non-statistical sense of the word, between cooccurring thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. With both cross-sectional in design, it is likely that neither was temporally precise enough to capture the theorised contingency between these fluctuating states and suicidal outcomes. In addition, neither were we able to make the fine-grained distinction asserted by the ITS wherein the combination of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness transforms passive wish for death (the result of either of these variables alone) into active suicide ideation.",

Where both studies agree, however, is that the trajectory of suicide ideation to attempts, in autistic people, might differ to that described by the ITS. Given that perceived burdensomeness contributed to both suicide ideation and suicide attempts in both studies, this casts doubt on the separability of factors involved in the two phenomena and suggests that constructs canonically understood to predict suicide ideation might, in fact, be sufficient to motivate the transition to suicide attempts in autistic people. In relation to suicide attempts, we turn now to the least researched and most debated construct of the ITS [29, 64, 74, 75] : acquired capability for suicide.",

Our scale, the ACWRSS, is based on a three-factor model comprising heightened pain tolerance, reduced fear of death, and mental rehearsal of suicide plans [36] . While acquired capability is generally associated with suicide attempts over ideation, this approach suggests that mental rehearsal of suicide plans accrues capability for suicide while also strengthening the desire for death [36] -consistent with its main effects on both suicide ideation and lifetime suicide attempts in our sample. Mental rehearsal may be partially synonymous with \"suicide-specific rumination\" [76, 77] , which in recent publications appears similar in respect to contributing to both ideation and action. In our multinomial regression, scores in mental rehearsal could differentiate non-suicidal participants from those who had attempted suicide in the past year, but could not differentiate participants with past-year experience of suicide ideation from those with experience of suicide attempts.",

Reduced fear was associated with more numerous lifetime suicide attempts, and differentiated those who had attempted suicide in the past year from those who were non-suicidal and those who had experienced past-year suicide ideation. This is somewhat comparable to Pelton et al. [9] , who, using the ACSS-FAD, observed reduced fear in autistic and non-autistic individuals with at least one historical suicide attempt. These authors also observed an impact of lifetime trauma on suicidality via reduced fear of death (though this relationship was attenuated in autistic individuals). While this is in apparent support for the ITS, we cannot establish causal primacy of reduced fear of death over suicide attempts. This serves as a poignant reminder of an inherent experimental limitation of conducting research in this sphere: that we can only include people who have survived suicide attempts in research, who might subsequently, or consequently, have reduced fear of dying. Prospective longitudinal studies with large samples (given that suicide occurrences are, thankfully, still comparatively rare) are required to explore whether reduced fear of death indeed creates capability for suicide attempts in the manner suggested by the ITS.",

This may be due to limitations of the ACWRSS, which includes only 2 items for pain tolerance. To date, there is no clear consensus as regards the assessment of acquired capability and, relatedly, its factor structure [75] ; the ACWRSS was flagged as an alternative to earlier scales with weaker psychometric properties [74] , but has not received vigorous psychometric scrutiny beyond the claims of the original authors, who asserted its \"excellent fit\" in two independent non-autistic samples [36] . Although the scale itself might be at fault, an alternative interpretation is that the scale, and/or this facet of acquired capability, simply functions differently in autistic people. Pain tolerance may be less relevant for suicidality, as might be expected if pain perception is atypical [78] -indeed, even in the general population the importance of this facet has been queried [75] . A broader view of \"suicide capability\", one that might encapsulate additional factors, such as dispositional features, practical knowledge and means [75] , may be valuable in autism. While the static snapshots provided by these cross-sectional studies suggest the significance of mental rehearsal of suicide plans and reduced fear of death, future longitudinal investigation should also consider the likely disparities in temporal stability within the facets comprising suicide capability [79, 80] , along with the proximal factors which evoke suicidal desire and intent in individuals with the means to enact them.",

As such, to further explore the relevance of ITS constructs in autistic people, we examined the role of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness as mediators of suicide risk associated with certain factors. (Acquired capability did not appear theoretically relevant to the factors in question, hence its exclusion from this set of analyses). Since the literature in autism has highlighted relationships between suicidality, loneliness and lack of social and practical support [6, 7] , we first focused on (romantic) relationship status. Given that intimate relationships are often a key source of emotional, social and practical support [37] , the attenuation of suicide risk in autistic individuals who were married or cohabiting [4] appears intuitively logical-and, we hypothesised, might be underpinned by reduced feelings of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness. Relationship status (being in a relationship) was indeed associated with lower likelihood of past-year suicide ideation indirectly via reduced feelings of burdensomeness and depression, and was associated with lower likelihood of past-year suicide attempts via this reduced likelihood of suicide ideation. As burdensomeness (as conceptualised by the ITS) incorporates both \"affectively-laden cognitions\" of self-hate, and feelings of being a burden or liability to others, it is conceivable that relationship status provides affirmations of worth which (to some degree) ameliorate self-hate.",

As a construct, thwarted belongingness encapsulates loneliness and social isolation but extends in a wider sense to \"the need to belong\", to care for others and feel cared about [14] . Unconditional regard or acceptance of an individual's authentic self would seem an inherent element of such care, which may explain why some studies report associations between thwarted belongingness and minority status [82, 83] , and why camouflaging autistic traits is associated with suicide ideation via thwarted belongingness [84] .",

Given the discord between the present findings and those seen in teenagers and children [40, 41] , it is possible that effects of late (or missed) diagnosis are more influential at some parts of the lifespan than others, and at this point, dimensional effects of late diagnosis are not prominent given how common mental health problems are in the adult autistic community.

Thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness and acquired capability are conceptualised as dynamic, fluctuating states, and suicidal behaviour, according to the ITS, is contingent on the alignment of proximal factors (thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness) with presently high capability: the suicide wish and the ability to act on it [14, 64] . Though we purported to examine the interaction hypotheses of the ITS, we suggest it highly probable that the present study failed to adequately operationalise this aspect of our investigation. The practical and ethical challenges of experimental research in suicidality are substantial [86] , but it is important that research on suicide in autism recognise limits to the implications which can be drawn from our work, particularly when drawing associations between measurements of present-day states and indices of lifetime suicidality. The present study operationalised an index of past-year ideation and past-year attempts in order to, as closely as possible, match present mental states with recent suicidal behaviour. We are able to report statistical associations suggesting that burdensomeness, mental rehearsal of suicide plans and reduced fear of death may be especially relevant to past-year suicide ideation and attempts, but further than this, cross-sectional designs are inadequate for testing dynamic interactions between suicidogenic risk factors as per the ITS. This is additionally true because we cannot establish causality or directionality in any of the associations observed. For instance, given that depression generates interpersonal problems [87] and thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness mediate this relationship [88] , it is possible that by extension, suicide ideation and attempts were deleterious to the close relationships of our participants, preceding or at least strengthening the development of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness. Depression and anxiety were treated as covariates in our primary analysis due to their purported subordinance to thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness [14] ; this statistical approach is common in ITS studies [35] but not beyond scepticism, given its assumption that thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness are the mediators between depression and suicide ideation as opposed to the other way around [89] .",

We cannot presently ascertain with certainty whether ITS constructs are more or less relevant in autism or simply insufficiently operationalised, and as such support the assertions of Pelton and colleagues [72] around the need for in-depth and mixed methodological scrutiny of these constructs, their meaning, interpretation and relevance, in autism.",

Cognitive abilities intersect with language abilities, but given that there are many other reasons why some autistic people are non-speaking or use minimal spoken language [94] , the present study failed to ascertain whether all participants used verbal communication. This, too, may have been an important moderator of an individual's social world, and particularly relevant to the ITS.

As in Pelton et al. [9] , our sample was heavily skewed towards autistic women, who we have previously speculated [8] may be more willing than autistic men to take part in studies about mental health, just like their neurotypical counterparts. We chose to control for effects of sex and age, but it is entirely possible, as in normative populations [65, 95] , that these features moderate the strength and significance of relationships between ITS constructs and suicidality. Other variables of potential relevance include broader psychopathological symptoms (e.g. of PTSD, OCD and alcohol abuse disorder), which may contribute additional explanatory power when modelled alongside ITS constructs [96] . The relationship between marginalised gender identities and mental health is a community priority [91] and the intersectionality of gender non-conformity and autism would also be expected to bear relevance to ITS constructs [82, 83] .",

Future studies should also consider factors which, if nurtured, might ameliorate suicide risk, such as belief in coping ability [97] or connectedness with family and friends [98] . Individual-level interventions must, however, be auxiliary to societal efforts to reduce prejudice and discrimination suffered by autistic people, given the role of autism-related stigma in camouflage [99] and poor mental health [22] , and the association between marginalisation and suicide seen in other groups [82, 100] .",

Fluid vulnerability theory [101] suggests that suicide risk is non-linear, with individuals liable to influences from static, historic or largely stable risk factors (e.g. race, genetics, gender, disposition) and state-based, acute ones influenced by the present environment (e.g. mood, life stress, hopelessness). The theory suggests that the presence of numerous stable factors creates a higher baseline risk level from which individuals can move rapidly into suicide crises, more likely to be triggered by a wider number of stressors in the environment. Although uninvestigated in autism, a foundational assumption that autistic individuals may be at higher baseline risk appears consistent with higher rates of suicidality and may be a useful base point for future studies.",

Our analyses indicate that these associations may underpin some of the increased risk associated with variables like relationship status, which justifies further investigation of how ITS constructs are conceptualised and how they should be measured in autism. In collaboration with the autistic community, further research must devise safe and scientifically rigorous methods to examine these associations in longitudinal, time-sensitive designs.",

            "text": "The full model for past-year suicide ideation (including depression and anxiety [first block], thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness and mental rehearsal [second block], and the thwarted belongingness * burdensomeness interaction term [third block]) explained 53% of the variance in this outcome (R 2 = 0.53, F [6, 313] = 57.10, p < 0.001). The addition of second-block variables significantly increased the explanatory power of the model, which had formerly explained only 36% of the variance in suicide ideation (R 2 = 0.36, F [2, 313] = 88.94, p < 0.001; R 2 change = 0.16, F change = 35., p < 0.001); addition of the interaction term, in the third step of the model, did not however explain a significantly greater amount of the variance than that associated with second-block variables (R 2 = 0.53, F [5, 313] = 68.43, p < 0.001; R 2 change = 0.001, F change = 0.75, p = 0.387). While anxiety did not significantly contribute to predicting suicide ideation in any model, depression remained a distinct contributor to the variance in suicide ideation in the second (B = 0.15, p < 0.001; CI 0.09, 0.21; r 2 part = 0.03) and full model (B = 0.14, p < 0.001; CI 0.08, 0.20; r 2 part = 0.03). The second stage of the model also included significant contributions from burdensomeness (B = 0.10, p < 0.001; CI 0.07, 0.14; r 2 part = 0.05) and mental rehearsal (B = 0.14, p < 0.001; CI 0.10, 0.18; r 2 part = 0.08); the latter remained significant in the third stage of the model (B = 0.14, p < 0.001; CI 0.10, 0.18; r 2 part = 0.08). Individual effect sizes (f 2 ) for each of these significant predictors, calculated on the basis of their squared semipartial (\"part\") correlations, were all small (< 0.10).For lifetime suicide attempts, the inclusion of ITS constructs (thwarted belongingness, burdensomeness and acquired capability facets) in the second step of the model explained 20% of the variance in number of lifetime suicide attempts (R 2 = 0.20, F [7, 313] = 10.80, p < 0.001), a significantly greater proportion than that explained by depression and anxiety alone (R 2 = 0.05, F [2, 313] = 8.30, p < 0.001; R 2 change = 0.15, F change = 11.25, p < 0.001). The addition of the three-way interaction term (thwarted belongingness * burdensomeness * acquired capability total score) in the third block did not significantly contribute to the variance explained by the model (Note. Frequency of responses to the two items assessing past-year suicide ideation (top row). On the bottom row are displayed the frequency of scores in the suicide ideation composite and the number of lifetime suicide attempts endorsed by participants change = 0.001, F change = 0.30, p = 0.588; R 2 = 0.20, F [8, 313] = 9.46, p < 0.001). Although depression predicted suicide attempts in the first step of the model (B = 0.05, p = 0.005; CI 0.01, 0.08; r 2 part = 0.02), it and anxiety were non-significant predictors after the addition of secondblock variables. At this stage, predictors which significantly contributed to more numerous suicide attempts, albeit with small effect sizes (f 2 < 0.08), were burdensomeness (B = 0.03, p = 0.004; CI 0.01, 0.05; r 2 part = 0.02), reduced fear of death (B = 0.05, p = 0.001; CI 0.02, 0.08; r 2 part = 0.03) and mental rehearsal of suicide (just over the adjusted alpha level at B = 0.03, p = 0.019; CI 0.00, 0.05; r 2 part = 0.01). The three-way interaction, in the third step, did not significantly predict lifetime suicide attempts, though associations with reduced fear of death (B = 0.05, p = 0.005, CI 0.02, 0.08; r 2 part = 0.02) remained significant (a contribution of mental rehearsal remained above the adjusted alpha level at p = 0.035).",

The model predicting suicide ideation (R 2 = 0.49, F (7, 296) = 40.56, p < 0.001) was contributed to by depression (B = 0.22 (SE 0.03), p < 0.001, CI 0.15, 0.28), burdensomeness (B = 0.13 (SE 0.02), p < 0.001, CI 0.09, 0.16), and by the covariate of sex (where being male was associated with lower suicide ideation: B = \u2212 0.86 (SE 0.33), p = 0.0085, CI \u2212 1.51, \u2212 0.22). The direct effect of relationship status on suicide ideation was nonsignificant (B = \u2212 0.56 (SE 0.29), p = 0.0525, CI \u2212 1.13, 0.01), but it was indirectly associated with suicide ideation via the mediators of depression (B = \u2212 0.38 (bootSE 0.19), bootstrapped CI \u2212 0.78, \u2212 0.04) and burdensomeness (B = \u2212 0.34 (bootSE 0.14), bootstrapped CI \u2212 0.64, \u2212 0.07).
