            "text": "In this paper, we present two metaheuristic evolutionary algorithms-based approaches to position the customer order decoupling point (CODP) in smart mass customization (SMC). SMC tries to autonomously mass customize and produce products per customer needs in Industry 4.0. SMC shown here is from the perspective of arriving at a CODP during manufacturing process flow designs meant for fast moving and complex product variants. Learning generally needs several repetitive cycles to break the complexity barrier. We make use of fruit fly and particle swarm optimization (PSO) evolutionary algorithms with the help of MATLAB programming to constantly search better fitting consecutive process modules in manufacturing chain. CODP is optimized by increasing modularity and reducing complexity through evolutionary concept. Learning-based PSO iterations are performed. The methods shown here are recommended for process flow design in a learning-oriented supply chain organization which can involve in-house and outsourced manufacturing steps. Finally, a complexity reduction model is presented which can aid in deploying this concept in design of supply chain and manufacturing flows.",

Slow in-house evolution of technical knowhow could mean lost opportunities in a rapidly changing market. Rapid improvements in customer order decoupling point (CODP) positioning would mean quicker standardization and maturity of designed process flows. CODP is the point in the manufacturing process flow which differentiates the standardized production flow from the customized production flows. This would constantly simplify the process for fulfillment of customer needs in a much faster and effective manner without compromising the customization requirements. This paper proposes smart deployment of best fit opportunities in manufacturing process flow design by selecting solutions from a wider set of choices (both external and internal). Best fit opportunities mean easier access to create new custom products without having to start from the concept stage, by exploiting existing modular sub-assemblies which are readily available. And is particularly suited for designing process flow for complex and custom products in smart manufacturing. We also demonstrate some learning models and complexity reduction methods in the end of the paper to facilitate this.",

McCall [10] mentioned that GA are easy to implement in a variety of techniques due to their modular nature. This property of the GA is exploited in our paper to optimize the CODP position by reducing complexity while increasing modularity of the manufacturing process flow. CODP position is determined in the manufacturing process flow through optimization which is achieved with the iterations in the population involved and the fitness function which is made use of. However, we make use of metaheuristic EA techniques, namely fruit fly (FF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, to reduce the time lag of process design by selection of closest solution during the process development. It is different from conventional cross-over chromosomal evolution used in GA method and uses a direct best fit search instead. The EA algorithms used here target and select entities in the supply chain to evolve the best feasible manufacturing process flow. Moving CODP towards right on a process line improves process standardization and execution in the left side of the line. Moving CODP towards the left helps supports flexibility. Hence modularity-based opportunities are deployed to mature the processes and improve standardization while leaving some optimum space based on the flexibility required to break the complexity barrier.",

This is highlighted with the dotted portion in Fig. 2 . Process flow design for this portion in SMC would need sourcing of best fit modules that can be assembled together for getting final product. For this product line, one or more major specifications of the module can be decided in terms of size, geometry, material, color, reliability, fit, functionality, etc., that can be used as matching criteria in real-world for doing the search of the best fit. We make use of two algorithms here to solve the problem, namely FF and PSO. The reason for choosing FF and PSO here is their relatively simpler possibilities in application into generic problem solving with fast computing and near optimal results that can be generated on commonly available computing platform as explained above. FF technique is used to address simpler modularity search problems, while the PSO technique is used for addressing slightly more complex applications which involve multiple search criteria for matching modularity needs. Although we begin with unidimensional portion in a two-dimensional search space for FF algorithm, in the later stage (in Sect. 4) we use PSO algorithm in a ten-dimensional search space with the aim to target multiple characteristics and to standardize or unify multiple CODPs to a possible extent.

This can make it less efficient from manufacturing perspective as compared to the scenario explained in the previous paragraph. This issue can be helped by SMC because outsourcing or finding alternate options internally through smart enabled planning can mitigate such risks. The modularity parameter 'Modularity(i)' considered here is analogous to smell parameter which influences fruit fly's foraging behavior. Like the fruit fly's movement towards source of greater smell, the algorithm searches better source of finding a best fit module for next manufacturing step in the chain. The goal here is to lessen the effort in designing and executing the manufacturing process steps by smart enabled algorithm through IoT. Wireless fidelity (WIFI) and IoT enabled inputs to the Internet can help in selecting the best fit modular steps until the optimum CODP position is achieved.

Later, in treatment 3 we illustrate and explain CODP optimization through a modified MATLAB code. In treatments 1 and 2, the modularity isn't limited with any upper complexity bound unlike the FF model. The benefit of this model is that modularity keeps evolving with higher values of maximized modularity, to evolve into higher levels of evolution. This is explained later with its realworld applications. FF algorithm was used by us to explain the complexity simplified in one dimension, but in PSO the coding has been performed for multi-dimensional match of product and process modules. In treatment 3, we placed an upper bound for complexity and optimized CODP while maximizing modularity. In this code, we find that higher levels and values of complexity can be simulated to optimize the CODP which could be closer to real-world manufacturing problems like semiconductor and automobiles.

In this run, we did 10,000 iterations for higher modularity achievement and the run time was 539.86 s with maximum modularity of 445. Reduced iteration of 1000 produced smaller modularity value of 43.82 in run time of 5.19 s. The complexity value was set to aid as a reference for the modularity improvements to be made (refer to Fig. 7 for modularity maximization) with each iteration, to arrive at the CODP.

We did sensitivity analysis with various changes in iterations and complexity values, but the results were found similar as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The modularity gets maximized to a value closer to the complexity value which was assumed at the initialization of the algorithm. We made use of different values like 5 (treatment 1), 1 (treatment 2) and 10 (treatment 3) to set a reference value for the product cum process complexity.

One of the practical examples of this application is Moore's law which stated that the number of transistors in a chip doubles in a short period of a few years [58] . This illustrates the evolution of modularity as more complex product requirements come up in time. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the maximization of modularity.

Complexity of a step level advancement in technology is high or beyond reach due to knowledge barrier, time and cost. So, complexity barrier can also be linked to the cost of learning. However, since we perform the PSO optimization using quantified features which are looked up from search matrices of supplier's offering, we assume learning as a delay in picking up and matching some features in achieving modularity instead of the cost in this iteration. Learning can act as an important factor in complexity reduction by lowering the engineering hours needed, to speed up production. This can reduce the value of numerator in the complexity expression of Willner et al. [60] , which typically focuses on higher denominator of pieces produced or demand, for complexity reduction. However, a lag or delay in learning can slow this process. We make use of a planned learning function and an actual learning measurement.

Also, actual learning varied from 0.056 to 1.0032 didn't have any significant impact.

Through MATLAB coding, we created a solution for reducing complexity with increasing modularity which evolves into finding an optimum CODP position. Figure 1 shows evolution of CODP research and the directions it took in the past four decades starting from its inception to the emerging era of smart manufacturing. Figures 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 show the different combinations of influencing parameters and results of maximizing modularity, while also optimizing CODP position using FF method. The FFbased method is a simpler technique for sourcing modules in one dimensional search space internally and externally.

A poorly selected modularity may leave CODP at the leftmost point of the supply chain causing huge variety of incoming inventory at raw material and wip stage. It's because there can be highest level of uncertainty and lack of standardization due to the lack of knowledge and poor clarity on fitness to use of the raw material and wip inventory. On the contrary, if higher standardization is not accepted in terms of customization options by the consumer, it could lead to high unsold finished goods inventory. MC involves limited solution space (by definition); hence, in a universal search space, the manufacturing flow line can have CODP move towards an optimum downstream position to achieve ideal goal. This could lead production machines till downstream steps to get more standardized. At the same time, efficient SMC would mean efficient processes which could convert one product or base part to other. The inventory-based supply should be more on certain variant which has stable demand with options of customizing it to the variants. So, inventory risk on variants should ideally get reduced. This needs to be coded as a SMC objective into this problem. Thus, an efficient MC would mean a robust product towards right of CODP which could then be customized to final step by just a single process change. The methodology needs to be further expanded for autonomous decision making while identifying and selecting suitable modules as proposed by Ma et al. [68] .

Also, the shift of CODP needs to be researched from the perspective of horizontal and vertical integration during merger and acquisitions.",
