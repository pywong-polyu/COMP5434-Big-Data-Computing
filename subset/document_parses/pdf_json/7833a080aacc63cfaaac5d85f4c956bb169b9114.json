However, linking these disruptions to effects on health outcomes has been difficult due to the lack of reliable, up-to-date health outcomes data. We identified all dialysis patients under a statewide health insurance program in Rajasthan, India (N = 2110), and conducted surveys to examine the effects of the lockdown on non-COVID care access and health outcomes. Post-lockdown mortality was our primary outcome and morbidity and hospitalization were secondary outcomes. 63% of patients experienced a disruption to their care. Transport barriers, hospital service disruptions, and difficulty obtaining medicines were the most common causes. We compared monthly mortality in the four months after the lockdown with pre-lockdown mortality trends, as well as with mortality trends for a similar cohort in the previous year. Mortality in May 2020, after a month of exposure to the lockdown, was 1.70 percentage points (95% CI 0.01-0.03) or 64% higher than in March 2020 and total excess mortality between April and July was estimated to be 22%. A 1SD increase in an index of care disruptions was associated with a 0.17SD (95% CI 0.13-0.22) increase in a morbidity index, a 3.1 percentage point (95% CI 0.012-0.051) increase in hospitalization, and a 2.1 percentage point (95% CI 0.00-0.04) increase in probability of death between May and July. Females, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and patients living far from the health system faced worse outcomes. The results highlight the unintended consequences of the lockdown on critical, life-saving non-COVID health services that must be taken into account in the implementation of future policy efforts to control the spread of pandemics.",

Recent research suggests India's 2020 lockdown reduced the growth in COVID-19 incidence, largely by restricting mobility (Thayer et al., 2021) . However, the indirect costs of restricting mobility and economic activity may be sizeable (Douglas et al., 2020; Haug et al., 2020) . In India, these costs were exacerbated by the hasty imposition of the lockdown, which gave the health system and households little time to prepare (The Lancet, 2020; Cash and Patel, 2020) . People with chronic health conditions are particularly vulnerable to pandemic-related care disruptions (Modesti et al., 2020) . Largescale, quantitative vidence of disruptions to non-COVID health care during the 2020 lockdown is now emerging from around the country, particularly for chronic conditions like cancer, kidney disease, diabetes, and tuberculosis, but their health impacts have not been measured (Cilloni et al., 2020; Jain et al, 2021; Kusuma et al., 2021; Ranganathan et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021) . Careful measurement of the indirect morbidity and mortality effects of the lockdown is critical to understanding the full consequences of the pandemic and how to prepare health systems better for future disease outbreaks (Beaney et al., 2020; Kiang et al., 2020; Setel et al., 2020) .",

The vast majority of deaths in India occur at home, rather than at health facilities, are not included in the national Civil Registration System, and have no certified cause of death (Jha et al., 2005) . While government health insurance programs collect real-time data on hospital services provided, they record no details on patient morbidity or mortality. The HMIS data are typically of low quality, underrepresent care in the private sector, and do not provide complete morbidity or mortality outcomes (Sharma et al., 2016) .

Given the dearth of reliable, updated, and publicly available data on health outcomes in India, evaluating the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on non-elective health services requires the identification of patients in need of such care and the collection of primary data. We used insurance claims filed under a largescale government health insurance program to identify patients requiring dialysis, a form of non-elective chronic care, during the lockdown. We conducted phone surveys with their households to estimate the effects of the lockdown on health care access and on morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in the four months following its imposition. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to measure the effects of India's 2020 COVID-19 lockdown on excess mortality from a non-COVID health condition. Quantifying the trade-off between averted COVID-19 mortality and the non-COVID-19 costs of the lockdown is beyond the scope of this paper.",

CKD is the 12th leading cause of deaths globally and 8th in India (Bikbov et al., 2020) . Although access to dialysis treatment is relatively low, the expansion of government health insurance has increased its reach. Dialysis removes waste, salts, and excess water to prevent their build up in the body; regulates levels of potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate in the blood; and controls blood pressure. The typical patient requires three-to 4-h sessions, two to four times each week for the duration of their life or until they get a kidney transplant. Disruptions to dialysis treatment result in the accumulation of fluids and toxins in the body, and can cause extreme swelling, nausea and vomiting, difficulty in breathing and urinating, and other symptoms. Missing dialysis visits or shortening their duration is associated with large increases in hospitalization and mortality (Anderson et al., 2009; Abdel-Kader and Unruh, 2009; Saran et al., 2003; Zoraster et al., 2007) .

We also embedded open-ended questions into the surveys to collect qualitative descriptions from patients about care disruptions faced. The survey instrument was extensively piloted and surveys were conducted by surveyors experienced in phone-based data collection and employed by JPAL South Asia, which also coordinated all local operations. We completed the first round of surveys between late May 2020 and mid-June 2020, and follow-up surveys in July and August with all patients alive at the time of the first survey to track complete mortality through July. To help put survey results into context, the field research team also conducted phone-based structured interviews with staff at 15 hospitals. The respondents were typically medical staff with a management role. A mix of public and private hospitals from central and remote locations in 10 of Rajasthan's 33 districts were selected. Interviews collected information on disruptions faced by the hospital due to the lockdown to corroborate and supplement patient reports of disruptions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the Institute for Financial Management and Research (IFMR) in India and Stanford University in the United States.",

Reported dialysis visits were used to create an indicator for any decrease in visits between the month before and after the lockdown. These measures were selected based on the most common disruptions to dialysis treatment reported by patients in pre-study pilot interviews. Each disruption may affect outcomes in multiple, overlapping ways that would not be captured in a single measure. For example, having to switch hospitals may not result in missed visits but could affect care quality. To combine these into a single measure for analytical purposes, we created an individual care disruptions index using the first component of a principal-components analysis (PCA) of all of these indicators, and standardized it over the study sample for ease of interpretation. The PCA is a standard method for reducing data dimensionality while preserving as much of the underlying variation in the data as possible.",

We did not conduct complete autopsies, but did ask households whether the cause of death was related to a health condition, symptoms prior to death (the same questions used to measure morbidity in alive patients), and whether the patient or anyone in the household had tested COVID positive. This allowed us to ensure we were not counting entirely unrelated deaths, for example from accidents, to separate out COVID deaths, and to confirm that the included deaths are highly likely to be related to dialysis. Monthly mortality, or the likelihood of death, was calculated as the number of deaths each month as a share of people alive at the beginning of that month.",

In addition, we constructed a historical comparison cohort to allow us to account for potential seasonal trends or monthly fluctuations in mortality and to examine whether 2020 mortality follows historical trends. As discussed above, to create our main sample we used administrative insurance claims data to identify patients on dialysis between August and October 2019 and follow them through July 2020. To create the comparison cohort, we used the same claims data to identify all patients on dialysis under insurance between August and October 2018 and followed them through July 2019.

We have previously validated this measure of mortality. In mid-2018, we sampled 663 that had dropped out of the claims data (no claim for two months) and conducted phone surveys with their households to confirm the cause of dropout. Surveys confirmed that 20% were alive and had dropped out for reasons besides death (exiting the insurance program, out of state migration, kidney transplant, or discontinuation of treatment for financial reasons) and the remaining were dead. This analysis confirms that dropouts in the claims data are highly predictive of death and may be a reasonable proxy measure. Monthly mortality in the historical cohort was, therefore, calculated as the 80% of the share of all patients on dialysis each month that dropped out of treatment in that month. One concern is that the 80% death rate in the validation study may not apply many months later. Because the purpose of the analysis is to compare trends, rather than levels, across the two cohorts to see if the seasonal fluctuations rather than the lockdown are driving mortality increase, our results are not sensitive to what share of dropouts we count as deaths. As a check on this, we tested whether the difference between mortality March and May in 2020 was statistically different from the difference between proxy mortality in March and May in 2019. We also show the proxy mortality trend without the 20% adjustment in the supplement (Fig. S3) . We also create a second comparison cohort using claims data and the same methods, but going back another year to check whether trends are stable as a robustness check. It remains possible that the true death rate in the comparison cohort fluctuated between December and July 2019 and our proxy is not capturing this. We discuss the limitations of this approach in the Discussion section.",

In supplementary analysis, the trend in the second comparison cohort one year further back, between December 2017 and July 2018, is almost identical to the 2018-2019 cohort, with no uptick in May, suggesting the trend in the comparison cohort is reliable (Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Comparison of trends in the study and historical cohorts suggests that the sharp increase in May 2020 is not explained by monthly or seasonal fluctuations and that, absent the lockdown, monthly mortality would have remained similar to or slightly below March levels in 2020, as it did in 2019.",

Being lower caste, poorer, and living further away from a city or a dialysis hospital had large and significant positive associations with the likelihood of facing any care disruption (Table 3) . Poverty had the strongest relationship and remained significant in multivariate regressions controlling for other socioeconomic characteristics and dialysis history. Fig. 3 presents the change in mortality in May, relative to March, by subgroup. Underlying data are presented in Supplemental Table S6 . The increase in mortality was largest and significant for females (3.56pp, 95% CI 0.51-6.60), patients 45 years or younger (2.94pp, 95% CI 0.85-5.05), poorer patients (2.81pp, 95% CI 0.45-5.18), those living further from a city (3.51pp, 95% CI 0.75-6.28) and those living further from a dialysis hospital (5.64pp, 95% CI 0.52-10.77). The associations between the care disruptions index and morbidity, hospitalization, and death were also stronger for these subgroups (supplement Fig. S3 ). The greater disruptions to care faced by poorer and remote patients noted above could partly explain their worse outcomes, but we find no evidence that females experienced greater disruptions. An alternate explanation for high female mortality may be lower care-seeking by households, consistent with prior literature on gender bias in health care in India (Dupas and Jain, 2020; Kapoor et al., 2019; Shaikh et al., 2018) . Females had fewer monthly dialysis visits at baseline (4.8 visits) relative to males (5.1 visits, p = 0.062), which could contribute to worse health prior to the lockdown. Additionally, care disruptions were associated with increased morbidity for both males and females, but with increased hospitalization only for males, and larger increases in mortality for females, suggesting that households may have been less likely to seek hospital care for females that faced complications (supplement Fig. S3 ).",

The table presents linear regressions of health outcomes between May and July 2020 on a standardized index of lockdown-related disruptions to dialysis care. The sample is patients alive at the end of April and, therefore, exposed to at least one full month of the lockdown (N=1489). Morbidity is a standardized index of symptoms known to follow disruptions to dialysis. Hospitalization and death are binary outcomes. Covariates in adjusted regression models include age, sex, caste group, month of dialysis initiation, and lifetime dialysis visits at baseline. As a result, 23% of patients switched away from their primary hospital, 22% experienced a decrease in monthly dialysis visits, and 11% faced increased treatment charges. Lockdown-related disruptions to dialysis care were significantly positively associated with morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality in the months just after its imposition. After declining steadily from December, mortality in May 2020, after a month of exposure to the lockdown, increased sharply and was 1.70pp (63.60%) higher than in March 2020. Mortality for a similar cohort over the same months in the previous year, proxied by permanent dropout from dialysis care, followed a steady downward trend between December and July. The timing and size of the increase in mortality in May 2020 relative to pre-lockdown trends in 2020, as well as to trends in estimated mortality in the previous year, strongly suggest that it was due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. Estimated overall excess mortality in the four months after imposition of the lockdown was 22%. The excess mortality we measure is unlikely to be due to COVID-19 infections. Although patients on dialysis are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and complications and excess mortality among dialysis patients infected with COVID-19 in India has been documented, if this were driving mortality in our setting, we would expect deaths to increase over time as the virus spread and to affect older patients more (Gansevoort and Hilbrands, 2020; Kakkanattu et al., 2021) . However, the increase in mortality was largest in May, soon after the lockdown and before the virus had spread widely, and was greater among patients under age 45 than among older patients who have higher COVID-19 mortality risk. Therefore, we believe our estimates are capturing the indirect effects of the pandemic through lockdown related disruptions to care. Nevertheless, given that COVID-19 testing rates in India were relatively low at the time of the study, we cannot rule out the possibility that it contributed to the deaths we measured.",

These results indicate that a universal lockdown policy is likely to have larger adverse effects on already vulnerable subpopulations, consistent with the literature on the unequal distribution of both direct and indirect effects of the pandemic (Bambra et al., 2020; Cash and Patel, 2020; Marmot and Allen, 2020) . Women also experience a larger increase in mortality than males do (though the comparison is not statistically significant), which may be because they receive worse care. It is critical that future pandemic control efforts take these distributional consequences into account and put in place extra protections for populations that have limited financial and geographic access to health services. Broader efforts to strengthen the health system so that it is responsive to the health needs of vulnerable populations is important for ensuring they do not disproportionately bear the burden of future pandemics.",

            "text": "Our study population is all dialysis patients in the AB-MGRSBY government health insurance program. Given that the poorest half of Rajasthan's population is enrolled in AB-MGRSBY, our study is representative of close to all low-income dialysis patients in the state. Total mortality in the study through March, largely before the pandemic, was 27.4% and through July was 34.7% (Supplemental Table S3 ). In comparison, another study of dialysis patients in India reports a substantially lower two-year mortality rate of 19.8% (Chandrashekar et al., 2014) . While our analysis is restricted to one type of critical chronic care in one state, our findings are likely to be indicative of the serious but largely undocumented health effects of severe disruptions to dialysis and a range of similar critical chronic care services in other states in India. A 2019 study estimated that there are approximately 175,000 patients on chronic dialysis across India and recent research suggests that a large share of these patients suffered severe disruptions to their care, similar to those we document (Jha et al., 2019; Ramachandran and Jha, 2020) . A large multicenter study reported that 28% of patients had missed one or more dialysis visits, and that both outpatient and inpatient services were reduced due to the lockdown (Prasad et al., 2020) . A nationwide analysis of dialysis patients under government health insurance programs targeting low-income households, a population very comparable to the one we study, finds a 6% reduction in dialysis visits, very similar to our results . One study of COVID-19 mortality among dialysis patients also finds evidence of increased mortality among COVID-19-negative patients, which may be attributable to care disruptions very similar to those reported in this study (Kakkanattu et al., 2021) . Evidence is also emerging of disruptions to critical care for other conditions, such as cancers, cardiovascular emergencies, and TB in India (Cilloni et al., 2020; Kusuma et al., 2021; Ranganathan et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021) . For example, the same analysis of government health insurance programs finds a 64% decline in oncology care and an 80% decrease in critical cardiovascular surgeries . While the precise magnitude of health effects of care disruptions may vary by condition, our results suggest they may go undetected without careful research tracking cause-specific morbidity and mortality. Broader efforts to increase death registration rates, improve the timeliness and quality of mortality survey data, and ensure cause of death is better recorded will be important for better and earlier tracking of mortality in future. A strength of this study is the use of existing administrative government health insurance claims data to rapidly identify and remotely survey a large sample of poor dialysis patients in need of critical care during the lockdown. A limitation of this approach is the substantial attrition between identified dialysis patients and those reached for survey by phone due to patient phone numbers entered incorrectly in the claims data, households switching phone numbers, and unused numbers being deactivated. However, attrition rates are similar to those in other phone surveys and surveyed patients were statistically similar to those not reached, increasing confidence that attrition did not bias our study sample (Singh et al., 2021) . Furthermore, these issues are most likely to affect patients that died soon after October 2019 and cannot explain the increased mortality in May 2020. Another limitation is that our outcomes are based on self-reported data and not clinical measures, which were infeasible due to the pandemic. However, our primary outcome is mortality, which is likely to be reliably reported, and the recall period for all outcomes was relatively short. However, to create a comparison cohort unaffected by the lockdown we use 80% of dropouts from the claims data as a proxy measure for mortality. We have validated this measure and found that it is highly predictive of death, and the comparison and main cohort trends pre-lockdown are very similar, suggesting the measure is not way off, but it may not measure mortality levels and fluctuations precisely. However, the steady pre-lockdown declining trend, the specific timing of the 2020 uptick, exactly a month after the lockdown, and the strong association between care disruptions and mortality, hospitalization, and morbidity strongly suggest that the effects we observe in 2020, even setting aside the comparison cohort, are due to the lockdown and not other fluctuations. Finally, as we only measure mortality through July, our estimates may be a lower bound on the full health costs of the lockdown. We found that disruptions to dialysis were lower but persistent in July and August, after the lockdown was eased, suggesting that adverse health effects may have continued to unfold past the study period (supplement Fig. S4 ).",

Although there has been no national lockdown, reports suggest access to non-COVID care has been severely affected because health facilities are heavily focused on COVID-19 care or refuse to provide critical chronic care to COVID-19-positive patients (Aljazeera, 2021; The Guardian, 2021) . Our results from the first wave provide strong reason to think that the second wave will have sizeable impacts on non-COVID morbidity and mortality among patients needing critical care, adding to the heavy toll of the pandemic. It is critical that these effects be carefully measured. Our study demonstrates that phone surveys combined with administrative data from existing government health programs provide a powerful way of measuring health impacts.",

However, they have substantial indirect health and economic costs that may outweigh their benefits relative to other pandemic control strategies in some contexts (Cash and Patel, 2020; Douglas et al., 2020; Haug et al., 2020; Modesti et al., 2020) . The tradeoffs are complex and the optimal policy, as well as the full range of costs and benefits, will depend on local conditions (The Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force, 2021). Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of India's lockdown on critical non-COVID health services that must be taken into account in the implementation of future policy efforts to control the spread of pandemics and the importance of preparing health systems betterAbdel-Kader and Unruh, 2009 for future disasters or outbreaks.

Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The dashed line presents the monthly hazard for the comparison cohort of patients on dialysis in August-October 2018 from a similar model with indicators for each month from December 2018 through July 2019.
