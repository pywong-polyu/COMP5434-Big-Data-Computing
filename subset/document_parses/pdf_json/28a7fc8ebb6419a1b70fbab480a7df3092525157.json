            "text": "Long-COVID is a new emerging syndrome worldwide that is characterized by the persistence of unresolved signs and symptoms of COVID-19 more than 4 weeks after the infection and even after more than 12 weeks. The underlying mechanisms for Long-COVID are still undefined, but a sustained inflammatory response caused by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in organ and tissue sanctuaries or resemblance with an autoimmune disease are within the most considered hypotheses. In this study, we analyzed the usefulness of several demographic, clinical, and immunological parameters as diagnostic biomarkers of Long-COVID in one cohort of Spanish individuals who presented signs and symptoms of this syndrome after 49 weeks postinfection, in comparison with individuals who recovered completely in the first 12 weeks after the infection. We determined that individuals with Long-COVID showed significantly increased levels of functional memory cells with high antiviral cytotoxic activity such as CD8 + TEMRA cells, CD8 \u00b1 TCRgd + cells, and NK cells with CD56 + CD57 + NKG2C + phenotype. The persistence of these long-lasting cytotoxic populations was supported by enhanced levels of CD4 + Tregs and the expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1 on the surface of CD3 + T lymphocytes. With the use of these immune parameters and significant clinical features such as lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, and dermatological injuries, as well as demographic factors such as female gender and O + blood type, a Random Forest algorithm predicted the assignment of the participants in the Long-COVID group with 100% accuracy. The definition of the most accurate diagnostic biomarkers could be helpful to detect the development of Long-COVID and to improve the clinical management of these patients.",

This variability is mostly dependent on how the immune system reacts during the primary infection, due to an exacerbated systemic inflammatory response that has been described in the most severe and critical forms of the disease that may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (3) (4) (5) . Those patients who develop severe or critical COVID-19 usually present bilateral pneumonia, respiratory failure with low blood oxygenation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6) . Other organs may also be compromised, leading to nervous and cardiac system injuries that cause severe complications such as ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, olfactory dysfunction, blood hypercoagulability, or cardiomyopathy (7) . The median hospital length of stay for patients with severe forms of COVID-19 ranges from less than 1 week to nearly 2 months, whereas the median stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) for those patients with critical COVID-19 varies from 1 to 3 weeks, being shorter for those patients who die from the disease (8) . Those hospitalized patients who recover from the most severe forms of the disease may suffer permanent sequelae (9, 10) .",

However, there is an increasing proportion of patients with mild COVID-19 in which the symptoms do not resolve completely after 4 weeks and may last up to 12 weeks after the clinical onset, then termed Ongoing Symptomatic COVID-19, or even more than 12 weeks, then termed Post-COVID- 19 Syndrome (12) .

Long-COVID may be developed by 1 in 10 patients who passed COVID-19 (15) , and it includes both general and neuropsychiatric persistent symptoms such as cough, fatigue, muscle, and joint pains, insomnia, breathlessness, myalgia, or diarrhea. Other relevant symptoms may compromise the cardiopulmonary system, such as dyspnea, pericarditis, or heart failure (13, 16, 17) . Long-COVID may be developed not only by patients who were admitted at the ICU due to critical COVID-19 and now present long-term respiratory sequelae but also by patients with mild COVID-19 who did not require hospitalization.",

            "text": "The causes of Long-COVID are still uncertain, and in most cases, no clear evidence of organ damage is usually found (17) . However, some host factors such as gender and age have been related to a higher susceptibility to develop this prolonged syndrome. Women under 50 years of age seem to be more susceptible to present unresolved COVID-19 (18) , which indicates a potential role of sex hormones in Long-COVID (19) . Another plausible hypothesis could be viral persistence. Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle is different, viral persistence is known to occur in other RNA viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), which may produce chronic infection with sustained activation of the immune system (20) . Accordingly, prolonged viral shedding has been found in feces from patients with acute COVID-19 after negative PCR in respiratory specimens, suggesting that not only RNA of SARS-CoV-2 but also virions may persist in cells from the gastrointestinal tract (21, 22) , likely in enterocytes and small vessels, as was described for the first SARS-CoV (23) . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal mucosa could cause intestinal damage that, along with systemic inflammation, may increase bacterial translocation, which would play an essential role in the sustained immune activation and cytokine release syndrome characteristic of COVID-19 (24) . On the other hand, several symptoms described in individuals with Long-COVID are quite similar to those developed during autoimmune diseases such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome, which are also linked to persistent inflammation and exacerbated immune responses (25) . Individuals with COVID-19 may develop autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens and immunomodulatory proteins, both soluble such as interferon (IFN) type I or bound to the surface of the immune cells, which would also promote the persistence of the symptoms (26, 27) .",

They were assigned to the Long-COVID group if they showed persistent clinical signs and symptoms from 4 to more than 12 weeks after diagnosis (n = 30), or to the Recovered group if they had resolved all signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in the first 4 weeks after diagnosis. The main demographic and clinical characteristics of all participants are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and detailed in  Supplementary Tables 1, 2 . Most individuals in the Long-COVID group (86.6%) were female, whereas 55% of the participants in the Recovered group were female (p = 0.0205). Median age at SARS-CoV-2 acute infection in the Long-COVID and Recovered groups was 42 (interquartile range (IQR) 37-46) and 45 years (IQR 28-57), respectively. Median time from the clinical onset to sampling was 49.7 weeks or 348 days (IQR 150-369 days) in the Long-COVID group versus 11.8 weeks or 83 days (IQR 73-99 days) in the Recovered group. Median length with signs and symptoms compatible with Long-COVID at sampling was 49.7 weeks or 348 days (IQR 150-369 days) and 1.8 weeks or 13 days (IQR 0-49 days), respectively. The most frequent Rh blood group was A + in both cohorts, whereas O + was present in 36.6% of the individuals from the Long-COVID-19 group and 5% from the Recovered group (p = 0.0160). During COVID-19, individuals from the Long-COVID group reported 38.2\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.66) of recurrent peaks of fever, in comparison with 37.7\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.18) of peak fever during the first 10 days postinfection in participants from the Recovered group (p = 0.0156). Dyspnea was developed by the majority of participants from the Long-COVID group (86.6%) and 35% of individuals from the Recovered group (p = 0.0002), whereas pleuritic chest pain was present in 76.6% and 25% of the individuals, respectively (p = 0.0005). Additional signs and symptoms with statistical significance reported by individuals from the Long-COVID group, in comparison with individuals from the Recovered group, were lethargy (80%, p < 0.0001), diarrhea (73.3%, p = 0.0037), dermatological injuries (63.3%, p = 0.0003), and conjunctivitis (30%, p = 0.0073). Most participants from the Recovered group did not receive any drug for the treatment of COVID-19, whereas individuals from the Long-COVID group mostly received antibiotics (70%, p = 0.0012), corticosteroids (50%, p < 0.0001), and/or cholecalciferol/vitamin D (40%, p < 0.0001).

Several host and viral factors may be involved in the development of Long-COVID, although the underlying basic mechanisms are still unknown. To determine the most important host factors that could be used as diagnostic parameters to evaluate the development of Long-COVID, we collected and analyzed essential demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics in a Spanish cohort of individuals with signs and symptoms compatible with Long-COVID in comparison with individuals who recovered completely before 4 weeks after the infection. A Random Forest algorithm was applied to identify the most important variables to predict the susceptibility to develop Long-COVID.",

            "text": "Regarding the host factors that might be related to Long-COVID, some demographic characteristics such as age and gender have been appointed as contributing host factors for an increased susceptibility (11, 19, 38) . Before the general vaccination against COVID-19, most patients admitted to the ICU due to a critical form of the disease were usually men over 65 years old (39) . In contrast, most participants in our cohort of Long-COVID were women under 45 years old, which is in accordance with previous studies (18, 40) . Rh blood O + type was also significantly more frequent in the individuals of the Long-COVID group, but we cannot rule out that most Spanish populations present this blood type (41) . Although it has been reported that individuals with Rh \u2212 blood type may be at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of severe illness or death by COVID-19 (42, 43) , other studies did not find a significant impact of Rh on COVID-19 severity (44, 45) . In our study, according to the Random Forest analysis, both female gender and Rh blood type were within the less important possible diagnostic factors for Long-COVID. However, clinical signs and symptoms such as persistent lethargy, pleuritic chest pain, and recurrent dermatological injuries showed more relative importance for the prediction of higher susceptibility to Long-COVID. Considering the potential viral factors that might be involved in the development of Long-COVID, one hypothesis that should be taken into account is that SARS-CoV-2 might find mechanisms to persist in the organism after the acute infection. In this case, Long-COVID syndrome would be a consequence of an unresolved SARS-CoV-2 infection (46) . A prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in feces has been described several months after the COVID-19 diagnosis (21, 47) . This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in sanctuaries such as the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract or the tissue macrophages in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (48, 49) , which would explain not only the continuous viral shedding but also the gastrointestinal symptoms developed by individuals with Long-COVID (50) . In fact, alterations in the gut microbiota have been described in individuals with Long-COVID even 6 months after the infection (51) . We cannot rule out this possibility in our cohort, as at least 70% of individuals with Long-COVID had been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, SARS-CoV-2 could also persist in other anatomical sanctuary organs with immune privilege such as the central nervous system (CNS) (52) or in other organs and cells in which ACE2 receptor is highly expressed such as the intestine, kidneys, cardiac tissue, reproductive system, thyroid, gallbladder, and nasal mucosa (53, 54) , which would also explicate the highly variable signs and symptoms that are associated with Long-COVID (55) . The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the organism Total levels of NK cell subpopulation CD56 + CD16 + over CD3 \u2212 population or with the degranulation marker CD107a over this population CD3 \u2212 CD56 + CD16 + (C) and total levels of NK cell subpopulation CD56 + CD16 \u2212 over CD3 \u2212 population or with the degranulation marker CD107a over this population CD3 \u2212 CD56 + CD16 \u2212 (D) were also analyzed by flow cytometry. Analysis by flow cytometry of the total levels of NKT cell subpopulation CD56 + CD16 + over CD3 + population or with the degranulation marker CD107a over this population CD3 + CD56 + CD16 + (E) and total levels of NKT cell subpopulation CD56 + CD16 \u2212 over CD3 + population or with the degranulation marker CD107a over this population CD3 + CD56 + CD16 \u2212 (F). Each dot in the graphs corresponds to one sample, and lines represent mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was calculated using nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. would also correlate with the recurrent peaks of fever reported by the participants from the Long-COVID group, which was significantly increased at 0.5\u00b0C in comparison with the individuals from the Recovered group, in which the fever stopped once the infection was resolved. Although more studies will be necessary to determine whether the virus may be found in the feces of these individuals, low SARS-CoV-2 viremia was detected in one participant from the Long-COVID group (Patient ID 26). This participant was a 44-year-old woman, A + , with previous history of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was treated with azithromycin during the first days after COVID-19 diagnosis, had signs and symptoms compatible with Long-COVID at the time of sampling (21.4 weeks post-infection), and did not report a subsequent re-infection after the first exposure to SARS-CoV-2. She informed about persistent neurological symptoms and diarrhea, which would support the possibility of a viral persistence in the CNS or in the GALT, with occasional viremia. The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 or its viral products in the organism would then contribute to the increased antiviral, cytotoxic activity detected in individuals from the Long-COVID group, along with the associated gastrointestinal symptoms, which were likely also due to the presence of activated immune cells in the GALT (56) . Persistent epithelial damage due to a chronic inflammatory response has been appointed as a possible cause of Long-COVID (57) . It is noteworthy that patients with critical COVID-19 who are admitted to the ICU usually present CD4 + cytopenia (4, 58) , which makes it difficult to develop a complete, effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2. However, the individuals from the Long-COVID group in our study showed not only normal levels of CD4 + T cells in peripheral blood but also CD8 + lymphocytosis with an increased proportion of TEMRA cells, which are highly differentiated effector cells essential for CD8 + function (59) . This enhanced terminal differentiation of memory CD8 + T cells pointed at the presence of a potent antiviral immune response that was supported by the presence of increased levels of highly cytotoxic populations of CD8 \u00b1 T lymphocytes expressing TCRgd. These cells have been related to a potent antiviral and antineoplastic response, and therefore, they are currently the target of different strategies to reprogram their cytotoxic potential against specific targets such as viruses or cancerous cells (60, 61) . Although the capacity of CD8 + T cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and GZB was not significantly different between individuals with Long-COVID and those who completely recovered, the sustained presence of these cytotoxic cell populations from the adaptive immune system indicated that the participants from the Long-COVID group had developed a potent memory response against SARS-CoV-2 that was still fully active after more than 49 weeks postinfection, whereas this response had waned in the Recovered group once the infection was cleared. The increased expression of exhaustion markers such as PD-1 in CD3 + T lymphocytes from these individuals of the Long-COVID group could be a consequence of the continuous activation of the immune system. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is upregulated during acute viral infection and after infection with persistent RNA viruses such as HIV and HCV, and it has been related to viral evasion of the immune system and prolonged inflammatory responses (62) . Moreover, the significant increase of Tregs observed in PBMCs from individuals of the Long-COVID group may indicate the failed attempt of the immune system to control this persistent immune response.",

The link between the development of autoimmunity and a previous infection is not always clear, as occurs with common autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the discovery of autoantibodies in individuals with Long-COVID may link this syndrome not only to a persistent viral infection but also to an immune dysregulation that would lead to a sustained targeting of own cells (26, 64) . The detection of high levels of functional cytotoxic memory cells in peripheral blood of the participants from the Long-COVID group may explain why several signs and symptoms of this syndrome resembled those of an autoimmune disease. Some previous predisposition may be then contributing since the most prevalent comorbidities showed by these individuals were autoimmune diseases, although they were not considered within the most accurate diagnostic biomarkers for Long-COVID in our Random Forest model. However, the hypothesis that a persistent memory cytotoxic response against SARS-CoV-2 could be the cause for the development of Long-COVID was supported in our cohort by the presence not only of high levels of CD8 + TEMRA cells but also of NK cells expressing both memory (CD57) and activation (NKG2C) markers that did not waste and wane after SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared, despite the presence of high levels of Tregs. Moreover, these immunological factors were considered the most important variables for the prediction of a higher susceptibility to develop Long-COVID in our Random Forest model.",

However, all participants were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the same period of time that was the first pandemic peak in Spain (March to April 2020), and whereas all signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were completely resolved at the time of sampling (12 weeks postinfection) in all participants of the Recovered group, the individuals of the Long-COVID group still presented recurrent signs and symptoms of the disease more than 49 weeks post-infection. Therefore, all inclusion criteria were met in both groups.",

However, we also have to consider that Long-COVID shows characteristics of autoimmune disease and that infected individuals may be more susceptible to developing this syndrome due to the activation of an exacerbated memory immune response that cannot be adequately controlled by homeostatic mechanisms once the infection was cleared. Having a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of Long-COVID could be helpful to prevent the development of this syndrome and to improve the clinical management of these patients. According to our Random Forest model, 100% of the participants included in the Long-COVID group were correctly assigned to this group using parameters related to long-lasting cytotoxicity, which proved their validity as biomarkers to diagnose the development of this syndrome.
