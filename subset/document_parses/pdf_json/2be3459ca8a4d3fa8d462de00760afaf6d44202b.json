            "text": "In recent years, aged care living has drawn attention because of population aging and extension of average lifespan. Moreover, the rapid development of information communication technology and the internet of things lay the foundation for the application of sensor networks and cloud computing on medical care. Most elderly often suffer from chronic diseases due to weaker immunity causing a higher infection risk. The problem of infection controlling is an essential issue for residences living in aged care facilities. In the past, for infection control, medical personnel use the manual method of tracking, investigating, and interviewing patients to obtain patient contact list. This method cannot identify residents who have a high risk of infection, distinguish the distance between patients and other residents, and evaluate the risk of infection. To isolate all the residents who contact patients is the only solution that does not only cause repulsion of other residents but also waste medical resources. This study proposes a visual infection control positioning system for aged care facilities using the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology and IoT technology. It can calculate the distance between users and reduce the positioning error. The system combines location fingerprinting with the K-nearest neighbor algorithm to fix errors caused by signal fluctuation of RFID to improve the positioning accuracy. The system records the indoor movement path of the residents in a real-time manner through the positioning function. When infectious diseases spread in aged care living residences, to help medical personnel, the system can screen out residents with a high risk of infection who closely contact with patients according to the movement path of the patients and other residents, and visually display them. For some infectious diseases, residents who live together with patients may be infected even if they do not have contact with the patients closely. This system can also identify the residents whose cumulative contact time exceeds the limit according to the medical definition of various infectious diseases and input time value.",

The statistic data released by the United Nations showed the people aged above 50 in most of the developed regions increased by 1% annually, and the population grew from 287 million to 417 million. The aging population will increase by about 50% [1] . Due to the growth of the aging population, long-term care of the elderly is a concern [2] . How to provide a better care environment is an important issue for modern scientific research. In general, international long-term care facilities can be divided into the nursing facilities and residential care facilities. In Taiwan, there are nursing facilities, long-term care facilities, and elderly dwelling. The aged care living residences are a type of elderly dwelling [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The nursing facilities and long-term care facilities serve the elderly with mental and physical diseases. The aged care living residences provide service for the elderly who can live independently. As compared to other care facilities, the aged care living residences offer a concentrated residential environment which is like common dwellings and are different from hospital-type long-term care facilities. The residents in the aged care living residences can move freely and enjoy the unrestricted living environment. The free residential environment can improve life quality, but they cannot effectively control infection.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases have many channels of infection. For example, TB (tuberculosis) can spread through droplet, droplet nuclei, and dust. The residents who have close contacts with the patients may inhale droplet when TB patients a cough. Thus, they have a higher infection risk. The residents who live with patients in one house or contact the patients for 8 h or are exposed to the patients over 40 h may inhale droplet nuclei of patients. In addition to TB, for many infectious diseases, the distance between patients and other residents and the cumulative exposure time can affect the infection risk. In the past infection control process, if medical personnel find TB patient, they would check the residents who contact the patient and conduct the manual method of tracking and investigating, and isolate the residents to avoid the spread of the disease. This manual method can neither correctly record the patient contact list and cumulative contact time, nor identify the residents who closely contact patients. Medical personnel only interviewed the patient, so the control effect is limited. Those residents with high infection risk cannot be identified in a real-time manner, and the medical resources cannot be effectively allocated. As the elderly come to the hospital frequently, cluster infection in the hospital may occur. In recent years, increasing attention has paid to the infection control in the nursing facilities and long-term care facilities, and the government has announced measures for the control [9, 10] . However, the traditional infection control using manual method neither solves the problem nor satisfies the needs of modern care. To solve this problem, researchers have explored the possible application method to create a better care environment, and input many information technologies for support, hoping to make the infection control in long-term care achieve twice the result with half the effort. This study applies IT to infection control in aged care living residences and also establishes a modern infection control process for long-term care facilities for the elderly.",

As the residents in the aged care living residences can move freely, if the device cannot provide wireless transmission, the resident movement may be restricted.

            "text": "RFID is widely applied in industry and has been extensively studied in academic research. Hence, RFID's indoor positioning algorithm undergoes continuous development and evolution. Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) is an immediate addressing system through which personnel and items in the environment can be addressed immediately. This system can be divided into four positioning modes, including the angle of arrival (AOA), time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). AOA conducts estimation with the angle of arrival of signals, which needs the isotropic antenna for positioning. As signal refraction often occurs in the indoor environment, signal direction cannot be identified. The positioning will be inaccurate. TOA (time of arrival) conducts estimation based on the time taken to transmit signal from Tag to Reader. TDOA (Time difference of arrival) which is similar to TOA performs evaluation based on the difference of time when Tag arrives at each Reader. These two methods need highly accurate arrival time of the signal. In practice, this is difficult to achieve, so they are seldom used [15, 16] . RSSI uses the signals from Tag to Reader to estimate positions. An increase in the distance between Tag and Reader is directly proportional to signal attenuation, and this method can be used for positioning. This positioning method does not require any particular device and can meet the needs of the actual application. Thus, this positioning method has been widely adopted and researched, and new positioning methods have been continuously developed based on it. Nan Li, Burcin Becerik-Gerber reviewed these RSSI positioning methods and classified them into three types [13] . The first one is triangulation, which initially uses RSSI. It uses the direct-line distance between Tag and Readers as the standard for measurement. In an indoor environment, three Readers are built. As the distance from each Reader to Tag differs, the signals by the three Readers are also different. The users can add the relationship between the increase in range and the decrease in signals in calculating to estimate the position of a target. However, there are many materials such as metal and glass in the indoor environment. These materials may cause signal refraction. As signal refraction occurs, the transmission path becomes unpredictable, and the signals cannot be sent to Reader in a straight line. Thus the triangulation loses efficacy. This method, therefore, has been seldom used in recent years. The second type is proximity, which can divide the environment into several areas according to needs. Many Tags are deployed in these areas, and these tags are called the RT (Reference Tag), which can continuously send signals to Readers in the environment. The signal by each RT represents a signal of one area in the environment. When the target person or item with the Tag moves in the environment, the Reader will receive a signal by RT and target Tag. The comparison shows which target Tag is closest to the RT to estimate the area where target Tag is located. The arrangement method is shown in Fig. 1 . Many RTs are arranged in the environment. The larger the environment, the more the RTs, the higher the setup costs and maintenance costs. Thus, this method is applied to the smaller environment.",

The difference between this method and the proximity method is that this method does not place RT in the environment continuously and it removes it until certain quantities of signals collected from this area are achieved. The collected signals are stored in the database. When the target person or item with tag moves in the environment, the target signal can be compared with the stored signals in the database to find the closest RT to estimate the area where the users are located. When four readers are arranged in the environment, each area collects four signals. The positioning accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of readers.

This study is intended to build an infection control system for aged care living residences. The residents in the environment can move freely, which cannot ensure the transmission of signals in the direct line between Tag and Reader.

Although there are a few errors, the screening scope can be narrowed significantly to increase infection control efficiency. Concerning IoT transmission security, there are many security protection measures whose development has reached maturity. The design usually includes four security locks, with security protection mechanisms established according to the Security Development Lifecycle, SDL, including the sensory layer, the transmission layer, the network layer, and the cloud layer. In the cloud layer, in order to prevent the susceptibility of equipment deployed during transmission to attacks, MIT has, through \"elliptic curve cryptography\", developed a new chip placed on IoT products, thereby providing security encryption to protect transmissions; in the network layer, in order to prevent hackers from intercepting data from communication channels, Securolytics Company has proposed multiple-layer security strategies for IoT firewalls, including firewalls, encryption protocols, and authentication [20, 21] ; in the cloud layer, in order to eradicate major data leakage, AWS provides several security features and services to strengthen privacy protection and control network access, while TLS encryption is used to transfer data among services [22] ; in the application layer, the IMperva SecureSphere Web can apply the software firewall on the patient management platform, PMP to analyze all the web application traffic and prevent complex multi-faceted attacks from penetrating security protection and contact with applications and data [23] . The wireless transmission structure proposed in this study is relatively simple and structuralized compared to the IoT transmission structure. Hence, deployment under the wireless transmission structure in accordance with the above concepts should not be a cause for concern.",

Most infectious diseases can spread more rapidly and the survival time of viruses may be extended in an indoor environment. This study presents an infection control system for the aged care living residences, which can collect the Tag signals of the residents in the aged care living residences by using RFID technology. It combines the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm and the location fingerprinting method to improve positioning accuracy and to accurately and timely calculate and store the indoor movement path of residents. This system can track movement time, location, the path of patients, and the distance between the patient and other residents, and the scope of infection to identify residents with a high risk of infection and to establish the database with the records. Using the positioning and screening functions of the proposed system, medical personnel can conduct more effective infection control to improve care quality of the aged care living residences.",
