Special attention should be drawn to these findings, and potential deterioration of the situation should be addressed by health care facilities. Particularly, psychological, and financial burden due to the crisis were identified as factors increasing the risk for PTSD. These factors can easily be evaluated during routine anamneses, and might be a valuable source of information, when special attention is needed.",

Negative consequences are exacerbated by social distancing, fear of infection, lockdowns, travel restrictions, unemployment due to the crisis, as well as uncertainty of the future. In respect to mental health of the general population, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to promote development and deterioration of mental and behavioral disorders, and potentially increase a variety of clinical symptoms including depression, anxiety, denial, fear or sleep disorder (1, 2) . Furthermore, lockdowns and quarantine promote additional psychological stressors (3) . In Austria, a study found an increase in depression rates between the time before and after the first lockdown in 2020. The most pronounced negative effect on developing depressive symptoms was identified as a combination of higher levels of stress and stronger perceived loneliness during lockdown (4) . The challenges of the pandemic could additionally result in an increase in addictive behaviors and SUDs as maladaptive coping strategies (5) .",

Taking this situation into account, a tremendous burden on patients with SUD stemming from reduced social support as a protective factor (16) could be expected.

In general, PTSD follows traumatic events and is characterized by a symptom pattern of intrusions, avoidance of thoughts and behaviors, negative changes in thoughts and mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity (18). Prior clinical research also confirmed relatively high rates of comorbid affective and anxiety disorders among patients in treatment for SUDsa subgroup, which might also be characterized by a higher severity of this disorder (19) . Furthermore, a complex interplay between psychiatric comorbidities and substance use is assumed. Among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) depression has been identified as highly prevalent, and its impact on therapy outcome is anticipated, but poorly understood yet [for a recent review see Ghabrash et al. (20) ]. The potential interplay between stress and risk for drug use was investigated among a sample of patients with OUD (21) . Higher reported levels of stress have already been associated with early dropout (22) .",

However, this number has to be interpreted with caution, given potential biases due to the small sample size and a high proportion of inpatient participants in this study. Developments on illicit drug markets due to the pandemic, as well as their direct and indirect consequences remain unclear. Due to government control strategies and border closures major interruptions in illegal drug supply were expected (33) . Unavailability of substances could lead to hazardous activities, including self-manufacturing of substances or even a rise in cases of suicide (34) . Increase in pricing and disruption of illicit opioids could have further severe impacts on the drugtaking community, including more cases of overdose (11) . This risk is heightened by the consumption of other opioids than normally administered due to the lack of availability, as well as by accompanied changes in quality and strength of those substances (28, 35) . Furthermore, social distancing may increase the probability of fatal overdoses due to isolation without opportunity for rescue (36, 37) . Consequently, the situation on the drug market should be closely monitored, enabling reactions to further potentially negative implications for patients suffering from drug use disorder.",

Therefore, the main goal of the current study was to assess the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, PTSD symptoms were evaluated using an adapted version of the IES-R (38) . The sample of patients in OST was accordingly split into two subgroups labeled as low or high risk for PTSD due to the pandemic based on the IES-R (but not as a professional diagnosis of PTSD). In this context, the impact of potentially contributing sociodemographic and various COVID-19 related worries and fears for different areas of life (physiological, psychological, economic and social factors) were investigated. Furthermore, levels of severity in psychopathology (depression, anxiety, and stress), as well as differences and changes on these measures since the beginning of the pandemic were evaluated between the two groups. Additionally, momentary craving, concomitant use of illicit substances, and developments on the Austrian drug market were assessed.",

To that end, participants were given examples of potential fears regarding the different areas of life, and asked to rate their worries on a Likert-Scale from 0 (no worries at all) to 10 (a lot of worries). Physiological factors included the fear to contract COVID-19, worries about other possible health problems in the context of COVID-19, restricted access to the health care system due to the pandemic, as well as postponed medical procedures. Psychological factors assessed negative feelings due to the pandemic like depression, anger, worries or helplessness. Economic factors addressed the negative financial consequences of the pandemic, such as job loss or the fear to lose one's livelihood. Social factors focused on the negative impact on social life, like experiencing loneliness or isolation during lockdowns, as well as restrictions for many social interactions due to related government measures.",

            "text": "Concerns about the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of the SUD population have been raised by experts early on. Since then, many studies have focused on investigating these consequences in terms of clinical symptoms like PTSD, depression and anxiety. However, given the sudden and unexpected onset of the pandemic, classical comparisons of results before and after the beginning of the crisis fell short. Hence, findings are often difficult to be directly associated to the impact of the pandemic itself. In the current study, we aimed to overcome this shortcoming by assessing risk for PTSD directly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and no other traumatic event. Furthermore, self-reported changes in symptomatology of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as changes in consumption patterns and at the Austrian drug market were evaluated. The IES-R was adapted to measure PTSD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic itself [similar to Vanaken et al. (16) ]. By applying the recommended cutoff-score for patients with SUDs (42), we found that more than a quarter (27%) of our patient in OST developed an elevated risk for PTSD. However, this risk for PTSD as assessed by the IES-R score has to be interpreted with caution, since it does not fulfill the same clinical criteria for a diagnosis made by a specialist. Our results of a binary logistic regression analysis further indicate that self-reported higher negative impact by psychological and economic COVID-19related aspects increase the risk to develop PTSD. Psychological burden in this study summarized perceived stressed and isolation and the pandemics' impact on mental health as feelings of irritability, depression, anger or helplessness. Similar findings were reported by an Italian study, which confirmed a significantly negative association between well-being with depressive, anxious and PTSD symptoms (23) , as well as an Chinese study reporting a moderate-to-severe psychological impact during the initial phase of the pandemic (24) . The individually perceived burden in terms of negative financial consequences, often resulting in income cuts due to short work or even job loss, were rated on the scale for economic COVID-19 factors. The finding of economic factors as a second significant risk factor in our model is in line with a study identifying lower perceived economic stability as one risk factor for PTSD during the pandemic (15) . In general, rather high scores of psychopathological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were observed in our sample of patients in OST. For depression, half of our participants indicated scores above exceeding the normal severity level, and nearly 40% indicated a deterioration in these symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic. Prevalence of current depression in a sample of patients with OUD were reported up to 32% (with reports up to for 75% lifetime prevalence) before the pandemic (20) . Our findings exceed this estimated incidence, but can be explained by the high percentage of patients indicating a worsening of depressive symptoms, which is also in line with other studies on the current pandemic. Similar findings were observed for anxiety and stress, with approximately one third scoring above the normal level, and more than 40% reporting a deterioration of these symptoms. All of these negative consequences were anticipated by experts early on, and have already been confirmed by several studies (13, 23) . In our study, pairwise comparisons of groups with low and high risk for PTSD, respectively, confirmed the differences in depression, anxiety and stress levels. Importantly, the high-risk PTSD group also reported a more pronounced increase of these symptoms since the onset of the pandemic. These findings affirm the expected negative impact on mental health of patients in OST and further contribute to identify a risk group of patients, who should receive special attention in health care during this ongoing pandemic.",

In this context, the complex interactions between depression and substance use disorders are highlighted. While the important role of concomitant treatment of depression in alcohol use disorder is well-documented, the impact of depression on OUD treatment remains unclear (20) . Our findings underline the importance of depressive symptoms among patients in opioid substitution therapy (OST). Especially the significantly higher scores on the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales, alongside the more severe self-reported deterioration in the high-risk PTSD group call for a closer look at these comorbid mental disorders during this ongoing pandemic. Short screening instruments for these symptoms are available, and adapted interpretation of scoring for populations suffering from SUDs have already been put forward for some of them, like the IES-R (42). The DASS-21 was identified as a suitable screening tool for depression in an SUD population when administered after detoxification (49) . The current pandemic calls for a further adaptation of existing tool (16) to specifically determine the current effect. These modifications might allow to rapidly and effectively screen for symptoms, which have been identified to provide a particular source of distress for this population during COVID-19. Integrating these screenings into medical history taking might be a successful way to identify especially vulnerable individuals and potentially counteract the pandemic as a potential additional reason for early dropout in OST.",

In this context, the reported changes in symptoms due to the pandemic were also assessed cross-sectionally. Second, our results are solely based on patients' self-reports, whereas no professional evaluation of the psychiatric symptoms were assessed for this study. Importantly, the risk for PTSD in this study was based on the IES-R total score and not on a professional evaluation. Furthermore, the symptoms assessed by the IES-R and DASS-21 might overlap to a certain degree. A clear distinction between the different symptoms as well as a diagnosis of a clinically relevant disorder is not within the scope of this study. Additionally, we want to emphasize that individual drug use and consumption patterns in this study were subjectively reported by the patients and not measured objectively. Future studies should additionally explore the impact of the pandemic on the development of PTSD as a professional diagnosis, and include objective measures of drug use.
