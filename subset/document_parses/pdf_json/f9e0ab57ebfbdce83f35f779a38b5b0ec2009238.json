Critically, hospitals in many countries have had to transform. In Europe as of April 28, there have been 880,000 cases of COVID-19, and specifically in Spain 213,000 cases have been confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (2). We have had to convert the departments of our hospitals in an attempt to ensure that human resources and medical infrastructure were adequate to treat patients affected by COVID-19, and a key element of these efforts has been an increase in staff levels through the involvement of doctors from different specialties in the care of these patients. As our healthcare system has become increasingly saturated, most nurses have been moved to COVID-19 areas and the majority of the OR personnel have been moved to the ICU owing to the rise in the need for ventilated beds; these changes have entailed the added difficulty of obtaining adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Other specialized hospitals have been declared COVID-19 free in order to allow treatment of all patients considered non-infected. Pregnant COVID-19 patients have been transferred to these centers, and all cases of pediatric disease are being treated exclusively in maternal and pediatric hospitals. The COVID-19 crisis has forced health care providers to establish priorities for the treatment of pathologies and to suspend elective surgeries, all with the aim of increasing the number of personnel, and this, too, has meant an involuntary change in our health care systems (3) . The decision on which type of care should be postponed and which should continue will need to be reviewed as the pandemic situation changes.",

Data were extracted from 54% of the reported cases (63,002 cases) as of that date (117,710 cases) (11) . Based on the currently available data, children with COVID-19 have a better prognosis than adults, with few reported severe cases, and in mild cases recovery occurs within 1-2 weeks of disease onset. Most of the confirmed cases were secondary to exposure to family contacts. However, transmission from children to adults and other children can occur, as documented in a number of pediatric cases in China. On the other hand, it has been reported that the elimination of the virus in respiratory secretions and feces occurs over a longer period in children with mild symptoms than in adults, a fact that represents a great challenge for infection control (12) . Transmission of the virus from asymptomatic children and a carrier period of up to 21 days have also been demonstrated. These data may explain a greater number of infections. Therefore, children should participate in the usual preventive actions to contain spread of the infection, and the protection of health professionals during evaluation and examination of children with respiratory infections is crucial (11) .",
