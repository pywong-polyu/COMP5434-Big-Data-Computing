As specific drugs are either nonexistent, produce secondary effects, or are expensive, a therapeutic possibility is using nonspecific immunostimulants, such as human interferon alpha. We used this drug to treat 27 cats infected by FeLV and 31 infected by FIV. All cats were naturally infected and treatment was administered orally by their owners for four months. Participating cats were evaluated in our clinics at mid-treatment (M2), end of treatment (M4), and 4-8 months after the end of treatment (M10). We observed that treatment was well tolerated by the cats (as it did not affect the liver or the kidney functions), and improved most of the parameters analyzed (clinic, anemia, white cell counts, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) as long as it was administered. However, 4-8 months after it was discontinued, though most animals remained clinically healthy, many of these parameters had rebounded to initial values or values even worse than the initial values. Thus, more studies should be conducted with longer administration of this drug to evaluate tolerability and sustained improvement of diseases produced by these two viruses which may lead to death.",

Immunostimulants is one of the few alternatives to the symptomatic treatment. In this study, 27 naturally FeLV-infected (FeLV+) and 31 naturally FIV-infected (FIV+) cats were administered orally by their owners 60 IU/day of recombinant human interferon alpha (rHuIFN-\u03b1) for four months in alternate weeks. Clinical status was evaluated and blood samples collected at four different visits or months (M): pretreatment (M0), mid-treatment (M2), end of treatment (M4), and 4-8 months after end of treatment (M10). Most cats ostensibly improved their clinical status, and many became asymptomatic. rHuIFN-\u03b1 treatment improved the anemic processes observed at M0 (at least in cats with mild or moderate anemia) and leukocyte counts, including a more favorable CD4+/CD8+ ratio. An increase in the serum gammaglobulin concentration was seen in 80% of the cats. Despite observing an obvious favorable progress in the clinical, biopathological, and CD4+/CD8+ values during treatment, almost invariably all the parameters analyzed worsened after treatment discontinuation (M10), which suggests that the interferon-\u03b1 protocol should be either extended or include additional cycles for a long-lasting benefit in FeLV+ and FIV+ cats.",

            "text": "Feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency viruses (FeLV and FIV, respectively) are retroviruses that affect domestic cats. Feline leukemia is a severe disease with several outcomes associated mainly with the immune response of the cat [1] [2] [3] . Disease outcomes range from \"abortive infection\" (a strong immune response eliminates the virus at the initial stages of the infection) to \"regressive infection\" (the virus remains integrated in the haemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow) and \"progressive infection\" (when the virus is constantly expressed, associated to persistent viremia and progression of the FeLV infection to related diseases) [4, 5] . Usually, FeLV-infected (FeLV+) cats die within 1 to 3 years after the initial diagnosis due to all the pathologies and clinical complications the cats develop [1] , mostly produced by secondary infections that may arise because of immunodeficiency, but also to lymphoma and other neoplastic diseases. Infections by FIV progress following several phases similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans, leading in some cats to a final stage characterized by a progressive decline of CD4+ T lymphocytes that predisposes to many secondary infections and, eventually, to the death of the cat [1] . Naturally infected cats may remain apparently healthy for many years under adequate housing conditions with appropriate care and food [6] , but recovery from FIV infection has never been documented.",

            "text": "As most clinical signs of both infections are associated with immunosuppression and secondary diseases, an approach to therapy is the use of immune modulators, such as interferon (IFN), which increase innate immunity and reduce viral replication and spread to target cells and organs [7] . Due to the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of IFN-I, interferons have been employed for some time in the treatment of infectious diseases of small animals. Several published studies show its potential usefulness in feline medicine, including viral infections by herpesvirus, papillomavirus, coronavirus, parvovirus, and retroviruses [1, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . As mentioned above, many FeLV-or FIV-infected cats suffer immunosuppression which allows the establishment of concurrent bacterial, viral, protozoal, and fungal infections [1] . The most common ones are Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans-Cryptococcus gattii complex, Haemobartonella felis, Mycoplasma haemofelis, Mycobacterium spp., feline infectious peritonitis, feline panleukopenia, or feline calicivirus [1, 5, 13, 14] , but any other secondary or opportunistic pathogen can benefit from the immunosuppression. The incidence of this concomitant infections varies from region to region and with other factors such as age, outdoor access, etc. [1, 15] . Presently, the use of more sensitive techniques allows the detection of subclinical infections which would otherwise pass unnoticed to the clinician [16] and which may be affected by different treatments. This detection is very difficult to apply in the routine practice, and the veterinary clinician is challenged by the need of treating retrovirus-infected cats not knowing if they have any other infection. Hence the interest of doing studies in the normal conditions the practitioner may encounter, in cats in which the moment of infection by FeLV or FIV is unknown and in which it is not possible to determine the multiple concomitant infections they may suffer. In any case, treatment with IFN-I may help the retrovirus-infected cat fight these pathogens.",

Neutralizing antibodies against rHuIFN-\u03b1 are raised when it is administered parentally, ruling out treatment for more than 3-7 weeks [1, 18] , but not when administered orally for a longer time. Several studies reported the effect of rHuIFN-\u03b1, mainly in FeLV-infected cats (reviewed in [9, 19] ). In general, these studies associate the effect of this cytokine with decreased mortality [17] , improvement in the clinical signs, laboratory alterations, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and viral parameters of FeLV+ cats treated with IFN-\u03b1 [18, 20] . Very few studies describe results of treatment with rHuIFN-\u03b1 in FIV infection, but they seem to be similar to those reported for FeLV infection, though no significant effects of rHuIFN-\u03b1 were observed with respect to viral and proviral load [20, 21] . The aim of the present study was to analyze the progress of the clinical status, biopathological markers, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio in FeLV-and FIV-naturally infected cats during oral treatment for four months with rHuIFN-\u03b1 and several months after treatment discontinuation, as it is not known whether changes in these parameters are long-lasting. This study tries to reproduce the genuine conditions when treatment is administered by the cat owners at home and reflects the everyday activity of the veterinary clinician, in which when therapy is initiated, it is generally unknown when the animal became infected or whether there may be a subclinical infection by other pathogen. The results of the study suggest that rHuIFN-\u03b1 has a very positive impact on the clinical status of the infected cats, as well as on the other parameters analyzed. However, this is not long-lasting and several months after treatment discontinuation several patients recede to the initial stage or worse.",

However, lymphadenomegaly and digestive disorders in FeLV+ cats were the most persistent signs and were still present in 8.3% of these cats at M10.

When rFeIFN-\u03c9 became available, it largely displaced the application in veterinary medicine of rHuIFN-\u03b1. However, rHuIFN-\u03b1 has as advantages over rFeIFN-\u03c9 that the oral administration of rHuIFN-\u03b1 facilitates the continuity of treatment as it can be done by the owner; and the low concentrations of rHuIFN-\u03b1 required reduce significantly the cost of treatment of these chronic diseases. However, there are few studies on the effect of rHuIFN-\u03b1 treatment on FeLV or FIV infected cats in a real situation, as most studies are conducted on experimentally infected cats and in controlled environments.

This agrees with that described by other authors for cats treated with rHuIFN-\u03b1 [21] or with rFeIFN-\u03c9 [10, 28] , but not with others [25, 29, [31] [32] [33] . Disagreement may be due to variable FeLV virulence or initial severity of anemia in treated cats. Decreased replication of FeLV in erythrocyte precursors and stroma cells may account for the improvement of the hemogram in FeLV+ cats treated with rHuIFN-\u03b1. In our study, the response and progress of the hemogram was different in FeLV+ and FIV+ cats. In FeLV+ cats we observed what we termed \"rebound pattern\", as most hematological results were worse at M10 than at M4. Contrarily, most FIV+ cats improved their hematological parameters at M10. We also observed the \"rebound pattern\" in the viral follow-up in these same cats, especially in FeLV+ cats [20] , suggesting that rHuIFN-\u03b1 only controls the effects produced by the virus as long as it is administered.",

As respects the renal parameters, all cats which developed high urea and/or creatinine values had hypergammaglobulinemia. In our study, most treated cats developed hypergammaglobulinemia which may result from an increased polyclonal activation of B cells [35, 36] in response to the immune stimulation by IFN-\u03b1. However, in FeLV+ and FIV+ cats the progress of the hypergammaglobulinemia was different, which suggests a different mechanism in both infections. FeLV+ cats responded very fast to treatment, as almost 80% of them had become hypergammaglobulinemic at M2, a percentage that remained stable even at M10, twice as high as in M0. The average concentration of gammaglobulins in FIV+ cats was higher than the corresponding one in FeLV+ cats at all time points, and hypergammaglobulinemia has been observed to be one of the characteristics of FIV infection [23] . In FIV+ cats, the highest percentage of hypergammaglobulinemia was seen at M4 and decreased at M10.",

However, according to a study with blood donors [16] , even asymptomatic cats may be infected by any of the innumerable pathogens of cats, which may have gone undetected in our study. As in the literature reviewed, IFN-\u03b1 had been studied only for treating herpesvirus [38] , enteroviruses [10] , parvovirus [11] , and coronavirus [12] in cats, it is unclear whether if coinfection had occurred how would it have progressed. However, the mechanism of action of this cytokine is quite nonspecific and may have improved the clinical outcomes in other infections (for a review on the mechanism of action see in [8] ). Regardless of the limitation of the potential concomitant diseases, the study presented here has the value of representing the reality faced by the clinician when treating FeLV-or FIV-infected patients, as most frequently these cats are not tested for other pathogens, unless they present a clinical disease compatible with other infections.",
