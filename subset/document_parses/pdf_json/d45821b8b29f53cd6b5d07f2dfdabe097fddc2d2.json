Online focus groups were each an hour long with a maximum of five participants and 2-3 facilitators. Interviews were recorded with video and audio, transcribed verbatim, and de-identified. Using grounded theory, patterns within the data were analyzed and identified through inductive thematic analysis; recruitment continued until thematic saturation was reached; an inter-coder reliability analysis was performed using percent agreement between raters. 6 Participants provided verbal informed consent per OHSU IRB exemption guidelines.",

Considering COVID-19 infection and death rates among Black Americans, many participants questioned how their race, and not pre-existing conditions, could heighten their risk. Participants held two predominate beliefs about COVID-19's disproportionate effect on Black Americans despite underlying conditions: (1) implicit bias within health care, and (2) apathy among individuals, possibly influenced by misinformed administration of policies regarding social distancing and subsequent reopening in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Participants also believed that infrastructure and finances limiting one's ability to stay home or socially distance contributed to disproportionate infection rates. Participants generally preferred health initiatives that recruit according to structural or socioeconomic variables contributing to disparity, instead of initiatives that recruit by racial demographics.",

For example, COVID-19 transmission surveillance programs that oversample Black communities may face barriers to optimizing outreach if (1) race, isolated from lifestyle or acknowledgement of personal health accountability, is a criterion in sampling or study design; or (2) established community rapport is lacking or overlooked in program design, perhaps prevented through the involvement of community liaisons. Black Americans would likely benefit more from initiatives that emphasize patient autonomy and provide tools for addressing socioeconomic or pathologic risk factors relevant to health outcomes. Potential study limitations include generalizability to populations lacking health coverage. Overall, findings highlight the importance of understanding community concerns about the orchestration of optimized treatments for COVID-19 among Black Americans, and underscore the health benefits of building community trust through early research involvement.",
