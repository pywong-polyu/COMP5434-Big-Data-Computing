We leverage delay embedding theorems of Whitney and Takens and use Gaussian Process regression to estimate the number of cases during the first 2020 wave based on the second wave of the epidemic in several European countries, South Korea, and Brazil. We assume that the second wave was more accurately monitored and hence that it can be trusted. We then construct a manifold diffeomorphic to that of the implied original dynamical system, using fatalities or hospitalizations only. Finally, we restrict the diffeomorphism to the reported cases coordinate of the dynamical system. Our main finding is that in the European countries studied, the actual cases are under-reported by as much as 50%. On the other hand, in South Korea -which had an exemplary and proactive mitigation approacha far smaller discrepancy between the actual and reported cases is predicted, with an approximately 17% predicted under-estimation. We believe that our backcasting framework is applicable to other epidemic outbreaks where (due to limited or poor quality data) there is uncertainty around the actual cases.",

R 0 is defined as the number of secondary infections an infectious individual can generate in a population of susceptible individuals. It is quite important for epidemiologists and public health officials to have an accurate estimate of its magnitude. The clinical characteristics of the disease -latency period, period of infectiousness, incubation period -were not known, so differing estimates of R 0 existed (ranging from 1.4-6.49) [30] that largely depended on the models that were used to estimate them and the corresponding assumptions made. At the same time, limited testing capacity obscured the true size of the epidemic and the actual growth rate. Varying estimates of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases also exist [20, 40, 45] . These inadequacies, in turn, caused serious handicaps in mounting an appropriate response by public health authorities. While our understanding of the relevant models and both their benefits and weaknesses has greatly progressed [17, 19, 21] , there is still significant room for improvement of our understanding of both the first and subsequent waves of the epidemic.",

In [42] a backcasting approach based on fatalities and a Gamma distribution of the time from infection to death was used to study the epidemic in 15 countries. It was estimated that the number of infected people is 6.2 [95% CI: 4.3 \u2212 10.9] times higher than reported. This echoes a study of the epidemic in the US [54] , where probabilistic bias analysis was used to approximate the true case counts. They found that 89% of infections were undocumented. Indeed, the US Centers for Disease Control indicated an under-reporting of infections by a factor of 2 to 13 times in [13] , illustrating the gravity and relevance of the issue. In Brazil, it was estimated [38] that the actual case counts are three times and the deaths twice as many as those reported.",

For instance, excess deaths, rather than reported deaths, during the first wave in the northern part of Italy were embedded in a differences-in-differences regression model. One of the findings of the study was that deaths may be under-reported by as much as 60% [8] . The reason for the discrepancy is that only hospital deaths are included in the official reports. The excess mortality in the first months of the epidemic was estimated to be 28% higher than the reported COVID-19 fatalities. Another pertinent point is that delays in death counts may be as long as a year in some cases [52] .

Several countries in Europe experienced a first peak in the observed cases and fatalities, as shown in Figures  1a and 1b, respectively.

Thus, a heuristic definition of T * can be described as the time when mortality falls close to zero for a long period, which coincides, in many countries, with the summer months of 2020. The leads to an almost boolean T * occurring sometime within this period. We note that our backcasting results are not sensitive to such a T * , as long as its choice is reasonable, namely falls within the period of low mortality and not close to the second peak (see Section 3.1 for the effect of the choice of T * on backcasting results for Italy). A compromise in the characterization of accuracy can be reached by assuming that the data after T * are not necessarily true, but can be trusted enough to make an estimate of the true number of infections after T * , which is further explored in Section 2.",

A remarkable feature of Fig. 5 is that at the peak of the first wave, the number of reported daily cases was found to be less than 10,000, while any selection of the kernel in our backcasting scenarios suggests that there were approximately 40,000 cases at that time. Even adjusting for the trusted observations in Fig. 6 , we still find a substantial disparity between the number of cumulative cases observed and the ones predicted by our backcasting analysis. The uncertainty interval of this and similar figures is computed based on the uncertainty of the corresponding daily cases, and is > 95% based on the sub-additivity of standard deviation. As we consider more data, the disparity (as a ratio) between observed and estimated cases will necessarily decrease because the result is cumulative and the increments agree after T * . Comparing cumulative cases at T * gives a more accurate picture of the beginning stages of the pandemic, while comparing at a later time can be used to understand the long-term effect of that early (unreported) spike in cases; see, for example, the results presented in Tables 2 and 3. We demonstrate the effect of changing the time window on the backcasting result in Figure 7a , whereas the effect of varying the T * is shown in Figure 7b . In the latter it can be seen that variations of T * do not change the qualitative picture described above. In the former, we can see that k = 13 may lead to potential overfitting, while already k = 10 yields an adequate qualitative representation of the number of cases.",

To avoid additional computation, we circumvent this issue using the same T * = 160 and time window k = 10, but apply the CRC method to adjust cases and their uncertainty after T * (as described in Section 2.3). The associated backcasted results are presented in Figure 8 . Moreover, the cumulative number of cases based on the CRC-adjusted backcasting is shown in Figure 9a . Figure 9b , instead, shows backcasting results using the hospitalization time series in place of the fatalities time series as the predictor for cases. It is important to realize that the CRC adjustment of the cases can only be relied upon for t \u2265 T * and not where the estimated number of cases is unrealistic. We note similar behavior to Figure 6 but with a much narrower uncertainty envelope due to the smaller uncertainty after the CRC adjustment.",

In particular, we found that the diagnosed cases for t \u2264 T were underreported although by a substantially smaller fraction than in other countries. Specifically, the proposed backcasting method predicts a higher and earlier peak in cases than observed, but it notably fails when trying to extrapolate outside of the range of the given data: early predictions, when cases and deaths due to Covid-19 are near zero, should yield a similar result. The left tail should therefore be considered inaccurate.

Specifically, at the end of the period considered, the ratio of predicted (backcasted) cumulative number of infections to those reported was found to be 1.43 (Italy), 1.39 (France), 1.47 (UK), 1.69 (Sweden), 1.33 (Germany), and 1.57 (Spain), i.e., the predicted number of cases was consistently greater by over 30% than the reported number. In South Korea, however, where the epidemic was controlled, the discrepancy between predicted and observed cases is substantially smaller; we found the ratio of predicted to reported to be 1.20, a discrepancy of 20%.

In a scenario where significant testing takes place (as, e.g., is the case in South Korea among our selected examples) or was subsequently developed, perhaps one can use the correlation between fatalities, symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in order to infer the fractions of infections that stem from symptomatic vs. asymptomatic cases. This is an interesting aspect of such epidemiological models for which presently there is considerable uncertainty with very different asymptomatic fractions being reported in different studies [29] . in latter stages asymptomatic testing became broadly available, so many cases that were asymptomatic or mild would be included in the corresponding measurements.

This parameter need not be optimal: The theory presented in Section 2.1 (main text) guarantees that an embedding dimension of at most 2n + 1 is sufficient to embed in Euclidean space, where n is the dimension of the original manifold. If k * , the minimal embedding dimension, is sufficient, reconstructions using k > k * points will still be diffeomorphic to M (in the absence of noise). Still, it is important, that n is small enough so that the available data are adequate for the reconstruction: e.g., for n = 5 we can take k = 11 and a point d t = {d t\u221210 , ..., d t } \u2208 M d \u2282 R 11 . Then we will require that f GP (d t ) = c t to be the cases at time t (wheref GP is the transformation based on the GP estimator, see, also, Section 3.1). Thus, having a large n corresponds to needing a longer time series to reconstruct the corresponding manifold. Furthermore, using a larger k than necessary may lead to overfitting ( [26] , [16] ).

We use the publicly available data set by Our-World-In-Data (OWID) 3 that aggregates information from other trustworthy sources (for confirmed cases and deaths the JHU database [11] is used, while hospitalizations are sourced from several government websites). This means that availability and quality of some data categories are different across countries (for example, Germany does not readily publish daily hospitalization data and Spain has days on which the reported cases are negative, functioning as adjustments to previous reports). In turn, comparisons between statistics across countries is not always possible, and even if it is, may not be trustworthy.Due to these and related issues, our estimates are dependent on data quality and trustworthiness. To avoid large disparities in reporting strategies and healthcare we have focused on a few selected countries. Furthermore, we address data uncertainty in the following section.The latest version of the data set used was downloaded on April 4, 2021. We consider data after the Spring of 2021 to correspond to a very different dynamical system, in which a large part of the population (of countries for which results are presented) almost discontinuously obtained immunity due to vaccine roll-out. Thus, we do not consider later data in this work.Our model is centered around learning the relationship between diagnosed cases (c t ) and reported fatalities (d t ). Assuming that there is enough trustworthy information (past the selected T * ), we can extrapolate backwards to points in time where we do not believe the available information. However, even though COVID-19 monitoring has been improving continuously, it would be na\u00efve to entirely trust even the most recent information.

Since the method developed in Section 2.1 (main text) is valid for arbitrary time series, as long as these two are coupled in the dynamical system, we can replace the role of the death time series (D) by a hospitalization time series (H), under the reasonable assumption that the number of hospitalized patients should also be an observable quantity of the pandemic.In principle, one can use either time series (and any other similar observable, such as ICU admissions) to backcast the numbers of cases. This can be used as a tool to increase the certainty of a prediction by repeating the computational experiment using different time series. However, hospitalization data are less readily available world-wide, and for countries with low hospital capacity the time series may not be as predictive, since there is no way to quantify the severity of an outbreak solely on these records after capacity is reached; after that point, capacity saturation yields misleading results regarding the number of cases.It is important to note that our estimates of the true case incidence include a mixture of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This is because early on tests were scarce and not available to the broader public, while",

Prior knowledge about the system is encoded in the probability kernels used and regression is performed by specifying distributions over an infinite number of possible functions passing through the observation points.A Gaussian process [43] is specified by its mean (m) and covariance (k) functions. If c = f (d) is the real process then:In the sklearn implementation of the method the covariance matrix specified by the kernel function k has a zero diagonal value, denoted by the parameter \u03b1. There are numerical advantages to having a nonzero such value which makes the matrix positive definite. In the results of Section 3 we use the default \u03b1 = 1e \u2212 10.Overall we make use of two kernels: the Radial Basis Function Kernel (RBF) given byand the Mat\u00e9rn Kernel.where l > 0 is a real-valued length scale parameter, \u0393(\u00b7) is the Gamma function, K \u03bd (\u00b7) is a modified Bessel function, and \u03bd is a parameter determining the smoothness of the kernel [39] . They were combined with a Constant Kernel and a White Noise Kernel to account for variance in the mean and possible small amounts of noise respectively. In the results of Section 3 only the Mat\u00e9rn kernel was used with \u03bd chosen to be 7/2. The remaining kernel hyperparameters are tuned during fitting by maximizing the log-marginal-likelihood using the L-BFGS algorithm. The implementation is performed entirely using Python's sklearn library.For a detailed presentation of Gaussian Process Regression see [43] .",

The reconstruction can be achieved using the time series of a one-dimensional observable that is coupled to all components of the dynamical system. An upper bound on the embedding dimension k (number of delay observations of the one coordinate that is needed to construct S * ) is 2n + 1 (i.e. S * \u2282 R 2n+1 ).These theorems are powerful and, in fact, suitable to address much more complicated problems, like chaotic dynamics. While in our problem we anticipate the dynamics to be much simpler, their appeal is their ability to uncover information about the system whose explicit dynamics are unknown, especially doing so through the use of a single observed variable (and its delays) as opposed to a larger number of observed quantities.The Whitney embedding theorem [53] can be restated as Whitney Embedding Theorem, 1936 Any n-dimensional, differentiable (of class C r ) manifold M can be embedded in R 2n+1 through a C r function.Takens [49] focused on dynamical systems for which an observable exists and proved the following delay embedding theorem. Assume M is an n-dimensional compact manifold. Let X be a vector field on M and y : M \u2192 R be a smooth function (observable). Moreover, let \u03c6 denote the flow of X on M (smooth diffeomorphism).Takens Delay Embedding Theorem, 1981 For pairs (\u03c6, y), \u03c6 : M \u2192 M , it is a generic property that the map \u03a6 (\u03c6,y) : M \u2192 R 2n+1 defined by \u03a6 (\u03c6,y) (x) = (y(x), y(\u03c6(x)), ..., y(\u03c6 2n (x))) (C.1)is an embedding.While the Takens theorem pertains to smooth attractors, it was later generalized to apply to attractors of any box-counting dimension [46] . Another generalization is for more than one observables [10] .",
