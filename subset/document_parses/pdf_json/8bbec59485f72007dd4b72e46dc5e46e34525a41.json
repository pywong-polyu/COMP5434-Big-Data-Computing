The stress and anxiety of this event will undoubtedly impact Orthodox communities regardless of location after the world has met the crisis and resumed some sense of normalcy. The assessment of mental health needs among Orthodox Christians remains a largely unstudied phenomenon. A small narrative review was conducted to ascertain ways in which other faith-based organizations have studied mental health in their own communities. While studies that address many minority and immigrant-based faith-based organizations exist, these are limited in scope. Given similarities that exist between minority and immigrant-based faith-based populations and Orthodox communities, a planning framework is suggested to improve an Orthodox response post-pandemic.",

For Orthodox Christians around the world, this meant that the holiest days of 2020 (i.e., Great Lent, Holy Week, and Pascha) were celebrated online-a virtual reality of Holy Resurrection. The visceral reality of disease and death in centuries past was a much more familiar event than it has been in the modern age. The ways in which ancient people dealt mentally with these events, albeit common to all of the human race, have become somewhat obsolete. The Medieval physician, Tommaso del Garbo, for example, offered the following advice to those suffering during a plague: \"Spend your time in your house, but not with too many people, and at your leisure, in gardens\" (Phillips, 2020) .",

Doubts and feelings of insecurity will take a toll on the psyche of many families. When such events impacted societies in ages past, the Church always provided comfort and hope (Walker et al., 1985) . Opening Churches in disaster areas, providing shelter for refugees and the disease, and establishing houses of care, among other programs, have been a part of the Christian organizational experience (Walker et al., 1985) . Plagues, wars, and revolutions have come and gone but the Church remains. Yet, this places before us a fundamental question at this time: is the Church ready to meet this new challenge? Given the many ways that life continues to change as a result of the pandemic and the mental health impact likely to follow, are we prepared to address what may come in the modern context?",

Explorations into the subject of mental health stigma in immigrant and minority-based faith-based populations, of which many Orthodox communities consist, have also shown pervasive suspicion and misunderstanding of mental health treatment. (Caplan, 2006; Codjoe et al., 2019; Hankerson & Weissman, 2012) . In Caplan's work, for instance, the impact of stigma is directly targeted in three largely Latino Churches. Although small in scale and limited to one particular ethnic group, this work shows the impact that stigma has in these congregations and how that impedes mental health treatment acquisition (Caplan, 2006) . Given that many Orthodox congregations are also composed of immigrant populations, the cultural implications might be generalized given the conservative and religious fervor within these groups. Hankerson and Weissman conducted a meta-analysis of church-based programs focusing on African-American congregants. They determined that while Church-based programs help with racial disparities in health service access, the focus on mental health programs is \"extremely limited\" (Hankerson & Weissman, 2012) . Issues of individuals being \"\u2026ostracised or isolated\u2026\" were also noted in Codjoe and colleagues' work. This was particularly noted among historically black Churches in the UK but could easily apply to other communities as well (Codjoe et al., 2019) .",

Some faith-based organizations have liaison with mental health practitioners and public health services to address these perceived gaps (Codjoe et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2014) . For instance, Laverne Williams and colleagues recognized many ways in which social workers were working with faith-based organizations toward the goal of health promotion. What they found, however, was that focus on specific mental health issues, such as major depression, was not present in the body of literature related to that relationship. As such, they recommend the establishment of a \"mental health ministry\" that specifically addresses the exposure of African-American communities to mental health studies in their work (Williams et al., 2014) . It should be noted that many Orthodox communities offer meeting space for Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and other 12-step programs currently. These are not often accessed by members of the specific congregations, however. These groups could provide a platform for greater outreach if promoted from within the Church.",

This type of relationship allows for better communication between organizations and churches with the express intent of improving access and outcomes to a broad range of social services that may or may not be directly associated with mental health. However, as Kramer points out, many Churches may be limited in terms of resources to support those linkages in communities especially where public funds are involved with mental health programs (Kramer, 2010) . There may be further complications related to these limitations such as \"\u2026religious content, separation, and client protections\u2026\" which may or may not cross the boundaries of Priest/Parishioner confidentiality (Kramer, 2010) . This model redirects the mental health needs of the parishioners into existing public health systems with the Church as the linkage (DeKraal et al., 2011) .

Their exploration concluded that clergy do recognize the burden of mental health issues among their congregants. However, clergy did not always feel trained in those issues adequately enough to address the myriad of interpersonal and functional issues that mental health can impact. Thus, the need for \"collaboration\" between religious groups and mental health services is seen as a necessary bridge to effectively address the gaps that clergy training may have not provided. They also note that the role of clergy in the lives of many people is not well understood or appreciated by the mental health professionals. For instance, spiritual direction as a means of helping with anxiety over life issues through greater contact with a \"higher power\" is viewed with suspicion even while it is a hallmark of most 12-step programs. The religious emphasis, however, is not always appreciated in the mental health community. This, too, in their analysis would need to be corrected to \"\u2026accommodate spiritual conceptualizations of illness\" into the framework of mental health support. (Leavey et al., 2007) .",

Their results demonstrate that a congregation's ability to support social services that address mental health is related to the general financial and overall resources available to those congregations (Wong et al., 2018) . The direct impact of individual clergy, however, was only mitigated in terms of age and experience and not necessarily a function of training directly. While many Orthodox communities do not have large financial or capital resources, clergy training and exposure to local services could fill this gap.",

In short, this suffering that we have endured these last several months does not have to be a defeat but, by the mercy of God, can be changed into a cause for transformation. Of particular value is that, while these approaches may be contemporary, they call upon the tested methods of Orthodox Christians who have come and gone. Though situations have changed over the long course of this world's history, human emotions have not changed. However, because approaches to those emotions have been modified over the centuries, it is important for the Orthodox Church and Orthodox Christians to apply the wisdom of the past to new situations in the present with greater fervor and specificity.",

Through the use of a survey, Kopacz and colleagues sought to understand the differences in support given the veteran populations in faith-based organizations compared to non-faith-based. What they found is that \"\u2026 faith-based respondants were found to provide significantly less mental health, suicide prevention, education/outreach, and other services\" to veteran populations (Kopacz et al., 2019) . Their work recommends linkages between faith-based organizations and local agencies to fill this service gap (Kopacz et al., 2019) . The potential to mediate that impact has also been recognized and actively encouraged. (Leavey et al., 2007) . Thus, clergy play a vital, central role in the mitigation of the eventual impact. The tensions that often arise, however, between the mental health world and the religious community must be recognized as well. Centuries of misunderstandings and mistrust between the two groups are a reality that needs to be addressed at the individual level. Sullivan and colleagues make it clear that these historical prejudices have their impact but are not insurmountable (Sullivan et al., 2014) . Their examination of a VA population demonstrated that cooperation can provide much needed support across a spectrum of both mental and spiritual adversities. They recommend greater partnerships so that mental health professionals and clergy can gain a better understanding of each other and how they can complement the work of the other in the mental healing process (Sullivan et al., 2014) . A failure to properly prepare for the inevitable impact of the pandemic is pastorally irresponsible and, at the same time, very amenable given what has already been studied.",

As mentioned in several works, clergy should investigate mental health resources in their communities.

Clergy should also assess their own understanding of mental health treatment and familiarize themselves with the various modalities employed, especially related to incidents of major societal disruption. This assessment will help to allay any fears or misgivings that may arise. Finally, and most importantly, clergy should care for themselves. Clergy have been impacted by the same stressors that all society has in these days. Family issues, income, and quarantine living have undoubtedly taken their toll.
