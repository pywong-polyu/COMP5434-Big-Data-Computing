The prototype AeroFact\u2122 nebulizer uses a Photo-Defined Aperture Plate (PDAP) composed of a two-layer vibrating mesh architecture with approximately 20,000 precision-formed apertures. This allows for increased liquid output while generating small aerosol droplet sizes. This nebulizer synchronizes drug delivery with a ventilator breath to prevent drug loss to the system during exhalation by generating aerosol for the first 80% of inspiration. Nebulizer actuation and generation of aerosol on inhalation is based on flow changes detected with a flow sensor placed within the inspiratory limb of the ventilator ( Figure 1A ). The Aerogen PDAP Controller and Synchronizer can be adjusted to generate aerosol early or late in the inspiratory phase. This technology does not require an external flow source to operate and therefore has no impact on inspiratory volume and pressure delivery or ability of the patient to trigger ventilator breaths. Following completion of nebulization with each dose, 2 drops of normal saline were placed on the mesh and nebulized to prevent residue from forming on the PDAP. 4 ",

Whole body was perfused with cold normal saline from the right heart ventricle to wash out the blood from the vascular system at the end of the protocol. Animals were euthanized with euthasol (100 mg/kg). The lungs were removed en bloc while ventilated at peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O. After taking gross morphological photos, the left lung was catheterized with a 14 Fr catheter and lavaged with 20 mL normal saline.",

The right lower lobe was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing. After excision of the right middle lobe, samples were rapidly weighed to obtain the \"wet\" lung weight, and then samples were oven dried (65\u00b0C) for 48 hours to determine the stable \"dry\" lung weight. The wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio was used to measure extravascular lung water resulting from injury/inflammation (15) .",

Also recorded were relevant histologic phenotypes that have recently been described in severe COVID-19 ARDS, including vascular thrombi, multinucleated giant cells and reactive alveolar pneumocytes (18) . Review occurred on H&E slides at x20 magnification, with the whole slide evaluated. Features assessed were: A) Neutrophils in the alveolar space, B) Neutrophils in the interstitial space, C) Hyaline membranes, D) Proteinaceous debris filling the airspaces, E) Alveolar septal thickening, F) Capillary congestion and alveolar hemorrhage and G) Lobular remodeling (including fibrosis and smooth muscle hyperplasia). Grading was as follows: Zero = absent, 1 = mild or localized injury, 2 = moderate injury encompassing several fields, 3 = severe injury encompassing most fields. To generate a lung injury score, the sum of each of the seven independent variables shown in Tables 1 and E1 was tabulated.

Experiments were carried out on mixed breed Yorkshire piglets (S&S Farms, Ramona, CA) with weight of 34.3 \u00b1 0.6 kg (n = 8). Pigs were initially sedated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (30 mg/kg), xylazine (3 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and placed in supine position on a surgical table. Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and rectal temperature were recorded on a PowerLab 16/30 recorder (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Temperature was maintained at the normal porcine body temperature range of 38-39\u00b0C with a heating pad and a heat lamp. After the administration of local anesthesia (0.5% bupivacaine) subcutaneously around the trachea, animals were tracheotomized with a cuffed 7.5 mm endotracheal tube and connected to a ventilator (Draeger V500, Draeger medical, Lubeck, Germany) in volume assist/control mode with tidal volume (VT ) adjusted to target 8 mL/kg. The ventilator rate was set at 20/min prior to lavage and adjusted to maintain pH between 7.35 -7.45, remaining at that setting for the remainder of the experiment. A 20-22-gauge angiocatheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and the left external jugular vein for continuous recording of arterial blood pressure, fluid/drug infusion and blood samples. Anesthesia was maintained by continuous venous infusion of propofol (loading, 1-2 mg/kg; first 15 minutes, 15 mg/kg/hr to achieve plasma equilibrium concentration; 15-60 minutes, 12 mg/kg/hr and then maintain at 4-10 mg/kg/hr) combined with bolus of fentanyl (1-2 \u00b5g/kg intramuscular injection every 1-2 hours) and vecuronium bromide (0.02-0.04 mg/kg intravenous injection every 30-60 minutes). Analgesia and sedation were titrated to maintain anesthetic plane based on toe pinch and increases in heart rate or blood pressure. Additional doses of vecuronium bromide were administered to prevent spontaneous breathing efforts. A urinary catheter was also inserted via a small lower abdominal incision of the bladder. Arterial blood gases (ABG: pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and SaO2) were measured at regular intervals by a Radiometer ABL 800 (Radiometer America, Brea, CA). An 8 Fr pulmonary artery catheter (Edwards Lifesciences Corp. Irvine, CA) was inserted via the right external jugular vein and connected to the Vigilance II monitor (Edwards Lifesciences Corp.) for the measurement of central venous pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP). A 12 Fr esophageal balloon catheter (Cardinal Healthcare, Dublin, OH) was positioned in the lower esophagus and proper placement confirmed using the occlusion technique as previously described (1). Changes in esophageal pressures were used to estimate changes in pleural pressures, and end-inspiratory/expiratory transpulmonary pressures were used in the calculation of static lung compliance measurements. A Hans Rudolph calibrated, differential pressure pneumotachometer was also placed in series for flow, VT, and airway pressure measurements. The elastance, resistance and static compliance respiratory system (including chest wall and lung) were monitored intermittently using the mechanical ventilator. Disease severity (PaO2/FiO2 and oxygenation index (OI: (FiO2*mean airway pressure*100)/PaO2), and ventilation efficiency Index (VEI: 3800/((PIP-PEEP)*RR*PaCO2) (2), ABG, hemodynamics, and lung mechanics were obtained at time zero and every 30 minutes following nebulization (Figure 1B). Peridosing events or physiologic 'clinical deterioration' (e.g. bradycardia, hypoxic events) associated with nebulization were established a priori and continuously monitored and recorded following nebulization according to the guideline (3).",
