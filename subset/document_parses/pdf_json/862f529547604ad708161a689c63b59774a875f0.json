            "text": "The Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus (FMDV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Apthovirus of the family Picornaviridae [1] . The FMDV causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which is highly contagious in various clovenhoofed animals, such as pigs, cows and goats [2, 3] . The FMDV genome is 8.5 kb and consists of one open reading frame (ORF), which encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently proteolyzed into four structural proteins (SPs: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4) and eight nonstructural proteins (NSPs: L pro , 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C pro and 3D) [2, 4, 5] . The innate immune system plays an important role in defending against invading pathogens. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in host cells and activate signaling cascades, leading to the expression of the host immune response, type 1 interferons (IFNs; alpha/beta interferon [IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2]) genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines [6] . PRRs involved in RNA viral genome detection include Toll-like receptor (TLR) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) [7] . TLRs are expressed on the surface or endosomal compartments of macrophages, dendritic cells and other immune cells [8] . The RLR family mainly encompasses two members: RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5),",

The mRNA and protein levels were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. FMDV mRNA levels and viral titers were highest at 12 h post-infection (hpi) and decreased from 16 hpi (Figure 1a ). The mRNA levels of MDA5, RIG-I and IFN-\u03b2 gradually increased and were highest at 16 hpi ( Figure 1b) . The levels of the three mRNAs decreased after 16 hpi. The protein expression levels of MDA5, RIG-I and MAVS gradually decreased in a timedependent manner as FMDV replicated in the PK-15 cells. In particular, the expression of the MDA5 protein was significantly reduced 16 hpi compared to that of the RIG-I protein ( Figure 1c ). While the amount of IRF3 was not affected by FMDV infection in PK-15 cells, the phosphorylated form of IRF3 (pIRF3), which induces IFN-\u03b2 transcription, increased until 16 hpi and decreased at 24 hpi ( Figure 1d ). These results suggest that MDA5 plays a more important role than RIG-I in innate immune evasion of FMDV.

In this study, the PK-15 cells were employed to see phenomena related with interferon signal transduction after FMDV infection because the PK-15 was susceptible to FMDV and have interferon signaling pathway [34] [35] [36] . Endogenous MDA5 in PK-15 decreased significantly on FMDV infection, resulting in no protein band by western blot analysis (Figure 1) . Previous studies have shown that MDA5 is inhibited by 3A or 2B. They, however, were carried out using Sendai virus [11] or a plasmid expressing MDA5 [37] . This study is the first to report that endogenous MDA5 expression is inhibited by FMDV infection. The result that MDA5 mRNA increased and MDA5 protein decreased until 16 hpi indicates that protein level rather than transcription was interfered with by FMDV infection. Once FMDV enter the host's cell, interferon signaling pathway initiates after MDA5 recognizes FMDV RNA, leading to increasing MDA5 mRNA. Meantime, NSP that is accumulated as FMDV infection progress in the cells interferes with interferon signaling pathway by degrading MDA5 protein translated from mRNA. We suggest that that is why the amount of MDA5 between mRNA and protein level was different. In previous studies, the similar result was reported by other research group that FMDV infection can induce RIG-I mRNA expression, while RIG-I protein was gradually downregulated as an infection progress [24] .",

Of these, L pro and 3C pro significantly inhibited endogenous MDA5 expression in contrast to RIG-I, which was not reduced by any of them.

The contradictory results of 2B, 2C and 3A for endogenous and exogenous MDA5 might be due to the fact that endogenous MDA5 was derived from humans (HEK293T) and the exogenous MDA5 plasmid was constructed based on the porcine sequence. In this study, HEK293T cells were used due to its much higher transfection efficiency than that of PK-15 cells.

Similar results were previously reported with RIG-I, which was degraded during FMDV, EMCV, poliovirus and rhinovirus infection [24, 41] . Since we assumed that the protease activity of 3C would cleave MDA5, 3C mutants with point mutations in the catalytic triad of H46, D84 and C163 were constructed. As anticipated, all three inactive 3C pro mutants (H46Y, D84N and C163G) did not cleave the MDA5 at all. Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitation assay using HA-3C and Flag-MDA5 to observe the direct interaction between 3C pro and MDA5. The 3C pro interacted with MDA5 and that its protease activity degraded MDA5 protein expression. In this study, the degradation product of 3C pro -induced MDA5 was not detected. Previous studies reported that Lb pro degraded MDA5 without degradation products [35] and that 2B degraded RIG-I without intermediate products [24] . In further studies, we are planning to research regarding its degradation mechanism because the MDA5 was degraded independent of the proteasome, lysosome and caspase pathways. FMDV L pro is expressed in two forms, Lab and Lb. Lb is more abundant than Lab in infected cells [42] and is associated with translocation to the nucleus and cleavage of NF-kB and IRF3/7 proteins [43] [44] [45] . Since the direct interaction between the FMDV Lb pro and MDA5 has recently been reported [38] , we focused on the interplay between FMDV 3C pro and MDA5, which has not been elucidated at all.",

To antagonize the interferon signaling pathway, the protease activity of FMDV 3C pro blocks STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation [36] . These biological functions of FMDV 3C pro appear to ruin the IFN system in the broad spectrum [48] . However, there is no report that FMDV 3C pro could exert a role to inhibit innate immunity by targeting MDA5.",

In this regard, we identified the antagonistic role of FMDV Lb pro and 3C pro on MDA5-mediated immune responses. In particular, the protease activity of 3C pro inhibited MDA5 expression independent of other protein degradation pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first report that FMDV 3C pro targets MDA5 in the mechanism to evade the immune response of the host. These results will improve our understanding of FMDV pathogenesis in the host and provide fundamental insights for the development of novel vaccines or therapeutic agents.",
