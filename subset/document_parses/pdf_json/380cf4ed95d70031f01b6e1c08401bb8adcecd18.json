            "text": "Background: Acute Heart Failure (AHF) is a common condition that often presents with acute respiratory distress and requires urgent medical evaluation and treatment. Arterial hypercapnia is common in AHF and has been associated with a higher rate of intubation and non-invasive ventilation in the Emergency Room (ER), but its prognostic value has never been studied in the prehospital setting. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on the charts of all patients taken care of by a physician-staffed prehospital mobile unit between June 2016 and September 2019 in Geneva. After approval by the ethics committee, charts were screened to identify all adult patients with a diagnosis of AHF in whom a prehospital arterial blood gas (ABG) sample was drawn. The main predictor was prehospital hypercapnia. The primary outcome was the admission rate in an acute care unit (ACU, composite of intensive care and high-dependency units). Secondary outcomes were ER length of stay (LOS), orientation from ER (intensive care unit, high-dependency unit, general ward, discharge home), intubation rate at 24 h, hospital LOS and hospital mortality. Results: A total of 106 patients with a diagnosis of AHF were analysed. Hypercapnia was found in 61 (58%) patients and vital signs were more severely altered in this group. The overall ACU admission rate was 48%, with a statistically significant difference between hypercapnic and non-hypercapnic patients (59% vs 33%, p = 0.009). ER LOS was shorter in hypercapnic patients (5.4 h vs 8.9 h, p = 0.016). Conclusions: There is a significant association between prehospital arterial hypercapnia, acute care unit admission, and ER LOS in AHF patients.",

It often manifests by acute respiratory distress and requires urgent medical evaluation and management [1, 2] . Classical treatment includes use of vasodilators, diuretics and oxygen, as well as positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with or without pressure support (PS), in case of severe AHF [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In the prehospital setting, application of PEEP, whether by use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), is associated with an improvement in vital parameters and a reduction in both endotracheal intubation (ETI) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Common negative prognostic markers for AHF include hypotension on admission, advanced age and polymorbidity, as well as an ischemic etiology [2] .",

Briefly, the prehospital emergency medical response in Geneva consists of three levels of increasing expertise (advanced life support ambulance, medical mobile unit, senior emergency-medicine certified physician). The SMUR is staffed by a paramedic and a physician and is called upon according to specific dispatch protocols or if the first responding paramedics request it. Severe respiratory distress is among the criteria used to dispatch this unit. In addition to providing specific medical skills and knowledge, the SMUR can initiate NIV in the field well before arrival in the emergency room (ER). A Hamilton T1 ventilator (Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland) has been part of the standard SMUR equipment since 2013. ABG analysis has been possible since 2016 thanks to a portative i-STAT point-of-care blood analyzer (Abbott Point of Care inc., Princeton, New Jersey, USA). The indication for drawing an ABG sample in the field is left to the physician's appreciation but is strongly suggested whenever NIV treatment is initiated. In order to avoid unnecessary delays, SMUR physicians are only allowed one single attempt on the radial artery in at most 1 min. There is no specific data available regarding the timing of ABG analysis, but SMUR physicians almost always begin by administering oxygen and often initiate NIV or other life-saving measure before drawing blood for analysis.",

Patients with (n = 61, 58%) and without (n = 45, 42%) hypercapnia were similar regarding personal history except for chronic hypertension and likely coronary heart disease and diabetes. Prehospital vital signs as well as Glasgow coma scale (GCS) were more severely altered in the hypercapnia group. Hypercapnic patients were more often put under NIV, which was set at significantly higher PS settings. Data were missing mainly for GCS (18%) and ER hypercapnia (19%).",

This result seems mainly explained by the difference in ICU admissions between the two groups. In our study, the prevalence of hypercapnia was higher than in most others (58% vs 33.7% in Konishi's study [18] , for example). To explain this difference, two hypotheses can be put forward. The first is related to the fact that we report prehospital values as opposed to other studies, which usually report in-hospital values. Therefore, an improvement consecutive to prehospital treatment before ER arrival cannot be ruled out in these settings. Indeed, our results show that almost 40% of patients with prehospital hypercapnia were normocapnic upon arrival in the ER. Another hypothesis is that prehospital physicians were more prone to performing ABG analyses in critically ill patients, thereby inducing a selection bias.",

These patients were indeed more tachycardic, more severely hypertensive, had lower GCS scores and higher respiratory rates. They also had a higher ETI rate at 24 h. The association between hypercapnia and worse clinical state is not fully elucidated, and the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypercapnia are not fully understood. It has been theorized that gas exchange might be impaired by the development of interstitial edema [20] , and muscle fatigue, which leads to hypoventilation, certainly contributes to the increase in PaCO 2 [21] . This latter effect probably best explains the link between hypercapnia and ETI, which was significant despite the limited sample size and the almost systematic use of NIV in hypercapnic patients. Indeed, prehospital NIV has been shown to significantly decrease the need for prehospital ETI [12] .",

Though it can hardly be assumed that hypercapnia alone was responsible for this time reduction in ER, one might argue that in-hospital orientation for patients with worse clinical state was more straightforward and could therefore account for this finding. Whether the ER physicians took prehospital ABG results into account could not be ascertained owing to the design of this study, and a prospective evaluation should be performed to determine the potential causality link. Should a link between early evaluation of ABG in the prehospital phase and ACU admission be proven, fast-tracks similar to those used for stroke or myocardial infarction could be considered [22, 23] . Such fast-tracks have been shown to shorten the delay to initiation of optimal in-hospital treatment, and might also decrease the strain on the ER and the waiting time of other patients [24] . Different limitations must be acknowledged. The small study sample did not have sufficient power to draw conclusions regarding mortality or to adjust our results for potential confounders. Moreover, potentially valuable data, such as usual medications, frailty parameters, or left ventricular function could not be obtained, further limiting the interpretation of our findings. Furthermore, though a clear relationship between ACU admission and prehospital hypercapnia has been found, such a relationship does not necessarily imply causality. One last limitation is the retrospective design of this study, as diagnosis of heart failure can differ from one physician to another. Nevertheless, as our prehospital chart only allows the use of a limited and standardized list of diagnoses, such differences might have been mitigated. Despite these elements, the good quality of patient's data can be highlighted, and is mainly linked to the review of electronically recorded charts the use of which lessens memorization bias. Another strong point is that, as prehospital hypercapnia has to our knowledge never been studied in AHF, this work shows new elements that could improve patient orientation in the ER. Prospective studies would be needed to better describe the role of prehospital hypercapnia in AHF.",
