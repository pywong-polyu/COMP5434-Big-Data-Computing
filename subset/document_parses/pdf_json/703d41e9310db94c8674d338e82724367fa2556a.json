This study aims to explore whether clinical profiles and healthcare utilization patterns are related to suicide among cancer sufferers. Methods: Verified suicide cases with cancer (2012-2016) were identified. Each case was matched with two non-suicide controls suffering cancer, by birthyear, sex, and admission year. Cancer-related information, physical and psychiatric comorbidities, opioid-based painkiller usage, the number and length of inpatient admissions, and the number of outpatient and Accident & Emergency (A&E) attendances, in the six months leading up to the suicide, were identified. Conditional logistic regression models were constructed to explore the influence of clinical profiles and hospital utilization on suicide. These models were stratified by age and cancer stage. Outcomes: 383 cases and 766 controls were included in the analyses. Overall, younger age, metastasis/recurrent status, suffering head and neck cancer, having psychiatric comorbidities, using opioid-based painkillers, and high frequency of A&E attendances and inpatient admissions increased the odds of suicide. Being diagnosed with liver cancer, consuming high numbers of outpatient attendances, and high numbers of inpatient days decreased the odds of suicide. Stratified analyses confirmed the influence of young age and metastatic/recurrent cancer status on risk of suicide. Interpretations: Suicidal cancer sufferers had distinctive clinical profiles and hospital utilization patterns. Detecting and mitigating suicidal risk should be incorporated as an important component in treatment of cancer sufferers in the clinical setting.",

Cancer sufferers frequently visit hospitals for medical treatment, symptom control and/or follow-up their clinical profiles and hospital utilization patterns might identify their specific needs and assist healthcare providers with early identification of suicidal risk, implementation of hospital-based suicide prevention strategies, and development of a safe home discharge plan to reduce tragedies. [7] A study exploring hospital utilization patterns of people who died by suicide, one year prior to the suicide event, found different patterns for different subgroups, as the suicide event approached. [7] The elderly had more hospital visits compared to young people, [8] as did people whose suicide was motivated by physical illnesses. [9] Cancer sufferers with severe disease had more frequent but less regular contact with hospitals, [10] however, there was no evidence as to whether hospital utilization patterns predicted cancer-related suicides.",

            "text": "To ensure the representativeness of the control group, the distribution of cancer types among control group was compared with the annual incidence and mortality of each cancer type reported by the Hong Kong Cancer Registry. [18] We reported frequency and percentage for categorical variables, mean (standard deviation [s.d.]) for age at diagnosis, and median and interquartile range (IQR) for hospital utilization-related variables. Independent t-tests and Chi-squared tests compared the clinical profiles of cancer sufferers who killed themselves, or not. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared the medians of hospital utilization-related variables by suicide status among cases. This was because the number of hospital visits and admission days had significant skewness, violating the normality distribution assumption for independent t-tests. To reduce inflated false positive rates from multiple testing, a correction method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg was used to adjust for the p-values from bivariate analyses. [19] To account for the potential clustering from the matching process, multivariable conditional logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors independently associated with suicide using \"survival \" package in R. [20] Conditional logistic regression was often used for matched case-control studies. [21] We tested an overall model (unadjusted for cancer type) and then models for the specific cancer types which were identified as significant predictors from bivariate analyses. Further stratified analyses were performed to examine the impact of clinical profiles and hospital utilization on cancer-related suicides, by cancer stage (primary cancer; metastasis/recurrent) and age group (younger than 60 years old; 60 years or older). Previous research has found that cancer sufferers in advanced stage had higher risk of suicide, [22] and those with metastatic cancer had different patterns of hospital utilization compared to those without metastasis. [23] The 60-year age threshold was established from research which had highlighted the critical value of 58 years, from a non-linear relationship between age and suicidal/self-harm behaviours among cancer sufferers in inpatient services. [6] The stratification did not take into account the matching process. Therefore, sex variable was put into all the stratified analyses to control for potential confounding. The multicollinearity assumption was checked for each model. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) were reported. Significance was set at p < 0.05 with two-sided p-values reported. All analyses were performed with R, version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

The mean difference in distance for the matched controls was -0 \u2022 0 0 015 (s.d. = 0 \u2022 02). The distribution of cancer subtypes in our control group generally represented the cancer subtypes in HK. Clinical profiles and hospital utilization for cases and controls are reported in Table 1 . Among suicide cases, 65 \u2022 54% were male. Suicide mean age was 64 \u2022 83 years (s.d. = 13 \u2022 61), while control mean age was significantly older (66 \u2022 16 years, s.d. = 12 \u2022 95) ( p < \u2022 05). Approximately 60% cases had significantly higher frequency of metastasis/recurrent status compared with controls (52 \u2022 76%) ( p < \u2022 05). Lung and colorectal cancers had the highest frequencies in both groups, whilst H&N cancer was the third most-common cancer in cases (15 \u2022 40%), which was significantly higher than controls (9 \u2022 40%) ( p < \u2022 05). There was a significantly lower percentage with liver cancer among cases (3 \u2022 92%) than controls (10 \u2022 44%) ( p < \u2022 05). The proportion of cases with a history of any physical illness (32 \u2022 90%) was also significantly lower than controls (39 \u2022 69%) ( p < \u2022 05). Only 4 \u2022 83% of the controls reported a history of psychiatric illness, compared with cases (16 \u2022 45%) ( p < \u2022 05). Nearly 30% cases had used opioid-based painkillers within the study period (significantly more than controls (18 \u2022 67%) ( p < \u2022 05)). Compared with cases, controls had fewer A&E visits and inpatient admissions ( p < \u2022 05), and fewer days of inpatient admission ( p < \u2022 05) but had more outpatient visits within the study period ( p < \u2022 05).

Those cases which only received care in the private sector would not be captured, and no information related to private hospitals is included in CDARS. Thus, our data may have underestimated the actual service usage. Nevertheless, more than 90% of the cancer sufferers are treated in public sector. Second, this study considered cancer sufferers' utilization of hospital inpatient, outpatient and A&E services in general terms. There was no information on service specialty (e.g., psychiatry, oncology, etc.). A greater focus is needed into the types of medical care consumed by those cancer sufferers who killed themselves, and controls, to provide better insights into which areas to target for implementing effective suicide prevention for cancer sufferers. Third, since the data were from clinical records, there was little information on sufferers' socioeconomic background and insurance status. However, in our study, the participants were drawn from public hospitals. In the HK public hospital system, the medical cost is affordable with a daily charge at around US$20.0. [30] Residents with difficulties paying the medical cost can apply for discount or full waive of the payment. [31] Therefore, the medical cost for cancer management will be a less of concern in HK. Due to the limitation and the availability of the data, other factors including the type of cancer treatments and palliative care cannot be accessed in the current study. Future studies may be conducted to look at these factors with the use of other datasets. Last, this study retrospectively compared hospital utilization information between cases in the six-months leading up to their suicide, and a randomly chosen six-month time period for controls. Future research might explore hospital service utilization patterns in other time periods preceding the suicide event to better understand precursor events.",
