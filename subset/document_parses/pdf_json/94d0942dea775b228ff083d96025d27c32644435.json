The data for the real rate of interest on a 30year US Treasury Inflation-Indexed Bond. However, this latter data is only available from 2000 onward. 5 The goal is to analyze whether the typical relationship observed by researchers in the past persists in the COVID-19 recessionary period. The first tests involve simple correlations between the returns to gold and the returns to the market for both recessionary and non-recessionary periods.
