            "text": "The InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ interpro/) provides an integrative classification of protein sequences into families, and identifies functionally important domains and conserved sites. InterProScan is the underlying software that allows protein and nucleic acid sequences to be searched against InterPro's signatures. Signatures are predictive models which describe protein families, domains or sites, and are provided by multiple databases. InterPro combines signatures representing equivalent families, domains or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification. Founded in 1999, InterPro has become one of the most widely used resources for protein family annotation. Here, we report the status of InterPro (version 81.0) in its 20th year of operation, and its associated software, including updates to database content, the release of a new website and REST API, and performance improvements in InterProScan.",

With entire genomes being routinely sequenced, and environmental samples yielding hundreds of millions of sequences, there is a crucial need to classify proteins that have not been, and likely never will be experimentally characterized. To address this challenge, several automated sequence analysis methods have been developed to annotate protein families, domains, and functional sites by transferring the information from an experimentally characterized sequence to uncharacterized sequences using predictive diagnostic models (hidden Markov models, patterns, profiles or fingerprints), known as signatures. A number of protein signature databases have been developed, each having their own field of interest (e.g. protein superfamilies, functional and structural domains, orthologous groups). InterPro integrates 13 protein signature databases into one central resource: CATH-Gene3D (1), the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) (2), HAMAP (3) , PANTHER (4), Pfam (5) , PIRSF (6) , PRINTS (7) , PROSITE Patterns (8) , PROSITE Profiles (8) , SMART (9) , the Structure-Function Linkage Database (SFLD) (10) , SUPERFAMILY (11) and TIGRFAMs (12) . Collectively, member databases provide complementary levels of protein annotation, making InterPro a comprehensive resource about protein families, domains, and functional sites.",

However, the overall integration figures often hide a lot of curation work. Updating member databases remains a challenge, especially when it involves substantial data changes. For example, many InterPro entries were at risk of being deleted when updating PANTHER to version 14.1, because the underlying signatures had been either changed or deleted as part of the rebuild process be-tween PANTHER 12.0 and 14.1. The percentage of member database signatures integrated into InterPro for each member database is shown in Table 2 . The level of integration is over 90% for all databases, except CATH-Gene3D, CDD, PANTHER, SFLD and SUPERFAMILY. CATH-Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY are the databases that InterPro primarily relies on for broad and diverse domain families. As CATH-Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY use a different methodology from other InterPro's member databases, in that they rely on a collection of underlying HMMs to represent diverse structural families rather than one single model, their signatures can only be integrated in a new type of In-terPro entries: homologous superfamilies. The diversity of signatures provided by CATH-Gene3D and SUPERFAM-ILY, along with their relative lack of annotations, makes their integration in InterPro challenging. However, we are working in close collaboration with these databases to help them improve their annotation and hence increase their integration in InterPro. PANTHER provides \u223c120 000 signatures, which is more than twice as many as other member databases. Such a backlog of signatures will take a considerable amount of curation time. In addition, PANTHER updates involve a large number of deleted or changed signatures, potentially resulting in a large number of lost integrated signatures. Finally, CDD and SLFD are the most recent additions to InterPro (incorporated in InterPro 58.0 and 59.0, respectfully). CDD is a collection of almost 15 000 conserved domain footprints in version 3.17, which is \u223c2000 signatures more than in version 3.14 (included in In-terPro version 70.0), and SFLD, a smaller scale database, describes structure-function relationships for functionally diverse enzyme superfamilies. Both CDD and SFLD provide hierarchical classifications, but their hierarchies differ from InterPro's classification, limiting their integration.",

Although fewer than 10% of PANTHER signatures are integrated in InterPro, 32% of UniProtKB residues annotated by PANTHER are hit by PANTHER signatures integrated in InterPro. This is because the largest PANTHER families are integrated into InterPro. PAN-THER also provides the greatest unique coverage of spe- cific residues not in InterPro (6.4%), i.e. residues that are only covered by PANTHER families yet to be integrated. Focussing the curation effort on these families will maximize the contribution of PANTHER to InterPro. CATH-Gene3D, Pfam, and SUPERFAMILY offer comparable levels of residue coverage, but lower than PANTHER's as they contain fewer models and focus on domains. Similarly to PANTHER, just over half (53%) of residues annotated by CATH-Gene3D are matched by a CATH-Gene3D signature integrated in InterPro, while under half (43%) of CATH-Gene3D signatures are integrated.",

These included domain entries for the following replicase polyprotein non-structural proteins: NSP2 (Nand C-terminal domains), NSP3 (C-terminal), NSP4 (Nterminal), and NSP15 (N-terminal oligomerisation, middle, and uridylate specific endoribonuclease). Following cleavage of the replicase polyprotein, these NSPs all assemble into the replication-transcription complex, which is essential for the synthesis of viral RNA. For several of these domains, more specific structural and functional information is available. For example, NSP4 is a membrane-spanning protein that interacts with NSP3. The N-terminal domain of coronavirus NSP4 (IPR043612) represents the four membrane spanning regions. NSP15 is an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. The N-terminal domain (IPR043606) is critical for formation of hexamers thought to be the functional unit of NSP15. The function of the NSP15 middle domain (IPR043608) is not yet known, however the NSP15 C-terminal domain (IPR043609) contains the active site of the enzyme. NSP6 is a membrane protein containing six transmembrane domains with a large C-terminal tail and an InterPro family entry (IPR043610) was created to integrate the NSP6 Pfam signature. New domain entries were also created to represent the Coronavirus Spike S1 subunit (IPR002551), which is responsible for receptor binding, and the cysteine rich intravirion region found at the C-terminus of the Coronavirus Spike S2 subunit (IPR043614).",

This is a complex process for overlapping domains found across the many InterPro member databases. In order to overcome this difficulty we have taken the decision to limit the IDA definition to matches with Pfam entries because they do not overlap with each other. The limitation of this approach is that proteins without pfam matches will not have an IDA string, even if they have matches with entries defined in other member databases. However, this change was necessary because searching through and calculating domain architectures across all member databases had become unscalable. The new method has vastly improved the performance of the search system. In our tests, queries to the new system are roughly an order of magnitude faster than the previous approach. Additionally, we have also cut down the time dedicated to IDA calculations in our release procedures by half.",

Furthermore, there were some parts of processing, like the initial steps that included fetching the pre-calculated matches, which were single threaded. Refactoring these parts to include multithreaded solutions and improvements to memory handling resulted in improved performances. For example, until v5.36-75 running Inter-ProScan against the Arabidopsis proteome (31 819 protein sequences) without using the match lookup service was taking 41 h. In version v5.45-80 (June 2020) and newer this analysis takes only 12 h. The performance gain is significant and increases with the number of input sequences, as shown in Table 3 .",

This has meant that not all the resources are able to make regular updates and add new data. In the case of PRODOM, a fully automated domain database, we removed it from InterPro after it had not made an update for some years and the majority of its content was superseded by other resources.
