On 12 March 2020, the national government declared a state of emergency throughout the country in order to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its effects; the following measures were adopted: suspend events with a capacity greater than 500 people, implement hygienic measures in commercial establishments, and prohibit the transport of passengers. Specific measures for Bogot\u00e1 included a total quarantine from 16 March decreed by the mayor's office initially for two weeks and then for an indefinite period.",

Nonetheless, there is scarce evidence on how the pandemic has affected school communities across the world, especially in Latin America, where most countries have closed their schools for long periods [11] . Most studies on this topic have been conducted to evaluate the impact of school transmission on the community, but none, if any, have explored what happens to a school's population while schools are closed.",

Given the volume of members in the educational system and the uncertainty about the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pattern in this population, the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n Distrital (Bogot\u00e1 Department of Education-SED for its initials in Spanish) has stopped all in-person activities since March 2020, and education activities have continued by online and other remote activities, like other countries have done in an effort to mitigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the evidence on the effectiveness of school closure to reduce COVID-19 is controversial, and the degree of benefit reported by different studies probably depends on the level of community transmission of the specific setting where the study is conducted [13] . Two regression studies have shown that this measure did have a significant effect on reducing the reproductive numbers and infection rates [14, 15] . Likewise, an evaluation of the impact of nonpharmacological measures used in Hong Kong showed that the closure of schools significantly reduced the number of pediatric hospitalizations [16] . On the other hand, a model in Japan indicated that closing schools alone was not effective in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19 in the community but could be more effective if combined with other measures [17] . Additionally, another study from Israel found no evidence of increased infection between children that stayed at home compared to children attending an alternative school [18] .",

In agreement with what has been described internationally [1, 22] , the frequency of infection and severe disease were higher among schoolteachers and older students. We cannot attribute this difference to the social distancing behaviors of schoolteachers and students; there are several personal and environmental factors that modulate infection and social distancing behavior that we could not measure [23, 24] . Notwithstanding the additional social isolation measures taken by both students and schoolteachers, the age-related risk distribution for COVID-19 infection remains; the incidence rates obtained using the official case registry [3] and the telephone survey behaved similarly with respect to age [3] . The differences in observed incidence rates between the official data and the telephone survey could be attributed to the recall bias inherent to the telephone survey, which constituted a self-report [25] .",

This surveillance strategy is passive; thus, it has a high probability of false positives and a low sensitivity [26] . Further, the sensitivity of the telephone survey was greater to detect cases, since there was less probability of information bias, because the interviewers had prior training and used a validated tool [27] . The telephone survey presented a COVID-19 cumulative incidence rate for students 20.1 times higher than estimated from the online questionnaire. In schoolteachers, the estimated cumulative incidence rate was almost 10 times higher in the telephone survey compared to the online questionnaire. On the other hand, after the comparative analysis between the detection of COVID-19 cases in students and schoolteachers, we found that the two data sources detected more cases among schoolteachers, being, respectively, 4.3 and 2.1 times more.",

Two reasons could explain this: First, fewer COVID-19 tests than recommended have been performed to identify all possible cases of COVID-19, and telephone surveys (given their active nature) have highlighted this problem. Second, people who tested positive for COVID-19 may have been more willing to participate and complete the telephone survey than those who either had a negative result, had not even been tested, had mild symptoms, or were asymptomatic. However, the telephone survey had limitations when collecting information, such as a number of wrong phone numbers, people who rejected the phone call, and unsuccessful phone calls. We believe that telephone surveys may be a reliable source of information to monitor the health status of school populations in low-resource settings.",

We did not find evidence of the protective effect of school closure when comparing the COVID-19 incidence rates in students, schoolteachers, and the general population. This suggests that the closure of schools is not an effective measure to control the transmission of COVID-19.
