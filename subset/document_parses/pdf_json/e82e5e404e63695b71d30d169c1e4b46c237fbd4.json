Since that time, waves of COVID-19 activity have been seen globally and continue to occur one year later. In late 2020 two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern emerged, the so-called Kent variant (lineage B.1.1.7 or VOC202012/01) and a South African variant (lineage B.1.351 or 20H/501Y.V2), both of which have been detected in multiple countries, including the UK [1] . Both variants have the N501Y mutation, which, along with other mutations affecting the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein, are associated with increased host receptorbinding affinity; this may, in part, result in increased transmissibility [2e4] .",

Triplicate samples per variant were taken by placing coupons individually into 1 mL of complete minimum essential medium (cMEM) with four glass beads (3 mm diameter). Seven time-points were used: 0 (immediately after inoculation), 2.5 h (once completely dried), and subsequently 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 h; coupons were kept within the FFI for their exposure period.

The rate of decrease in viability fell after the drying process, with all variants following a similar trend in recovery of viable virus. However, including the drying process, there was a significant difference between the units recovered of common predecessor virus and the B. After completion of the drying process (2.5 h), the rate in reduction in viability of the three variants was not significantly different from each other (P \u00bc 0.12), indicating that, once dried, the variants lose viability at a similar rate, with no viable virus detected after 7 days. This similarity in viability of the variants over time shows that the likelihood of a contaminated surface being touched, and viable virus being present, is the same for the three variants studied.",

Previous studies have investigated differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Van Doremalen et al. reported that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 was similar on stainless steel, observing a >3 log 10 reduction in viability within 48 h, from the starting inoculum decreasing to the detection limit in this time; suggesting that contaminated fomites were a potential transmission route [5] . Sizun et al. compared two human coronaviruses (229E and OC43), with 229E surviving longer than OC43 after drying [7] . No indication was given to explain the differences in the persistence between the coronaviruses. Other studies have focused on single variants/isolates, and then compared data obtained with those from other groups. The challenges to this approach are the variations in methods between studies, making comparison difficult [8, 9] . Incubating dried SARS-CoV-2 virus at a higher temperature than room temperature (28 vs 20e25 C) increased the inactivation rate, but viable virus was recovered over the same time-period at both temperatures [10] .",

These starting concentration levels have not been found during environmental surface sampling, so are artificially high in comparison, but using a lower starting concentration could preclude the detection of inter-strain differences through the rapid inactivation of the virus on the surface, giving few data points for analysis. Stainless steel was chosen as the carrier material for this study because it is representative of touchpoints that will be frequently contacted by different individuals and provides an inanimate surface on which SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to persist. This is in comparison to other surfaces such as face masks, which are likely to be contacted by fewer individuals and disposed of after use [6, 8] . Since multiple environmental factors may influence virus SARS-CoV-2 viability, the persistence of viable virus on surfaces and the associated transmission risk may be considerably shorter in various real-life settings [9, 10] .",

Consistent with previous findings, viable virus is not recoverable from stainless steel coupons after seven days, under experimental conditions [6] . ",
