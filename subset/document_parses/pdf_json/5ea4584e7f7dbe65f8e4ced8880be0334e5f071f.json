In this work, the main concepts related to the topic under study are introduced and a framework concerning the use of thermography to evaluate the temperature distribution in the feet is presented. Additionally, in this work, a mathematical model to characterise the plantar temperature distribution variation is presented and an optimization programming problem based on the nonlinear least squares approach is proposed. Some considerations about the two global non-linear optimization metaheuristic methods used to solve this model, namely a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and a Hybrid Simulated Annealing, are also described. Thermal plantar images of non diabetic and diabetic individuals are used to test the approach. The numerical results obtained with both methods for the different regions of each foot are presented and analysed; the best results were obtained with the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm. Some preliminary conclusions were made.",

Although not all diabetics develop this pathology, those who develop it loose quality of life. In addition, ulceration of the diabetic foot causes serious medical consequences for the patient; for example, the development of ulcers can lead to infections, since ulcers can harbor bacteria and fungi. These infections, when severe, can lead to amputation of the lower limb [7] . Therefore, early identification and effective preventive methods for diabetic foot are essential. A significant number of studies have demonstrated that temperature variations in the plantar feet region may be related to diabetic foot problems [8] [9] [10] . Thus, the analysis and characterization of the temperature distribution on the plant of the foot can contribute to the early diagnosis of the onset of certain diseases, namely the diabetic foot, consequently preventing their appearance and increasing the probability of cure.",

In a second phase, Carvalho et al. [18, 19] continued the work of Bento et al., initiating the characterization of the temperature of the foot of healthy and diabetic individuals and comparing both of them; these two works used mathematical models composed of trigonometric functions.

Diabetes is a chronic disease, characterized by the occurrence of abnormalities in glucose metabolism, resulting in defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational diabetes. Type 1 is associated with autoimmune disease, that is, the human system attacks the beta cells of the pancreas that are responsible for the insulin production. Thus, the body becomes unable to produce the sufficient quantity of insulin and the individual needs daily doses of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. Type 2 is associated with the most common form of diabetes. The body produces insulin but, due to the resistance developed by the body to this hormone, it does not act effectively. Over time, it leads to high blood glucose levels. The majority of the patients do not require daily insulin treatment, they only take oral medication that helps control blood glucose levels. Gestational diabetes happens to women when the hyperglycemia state is diagnosed during pregnancy and extra care is needed as there is the possibility of complications with the baby.",

Peripheral vascular disease is another consequence of diabetes, provoking obstructive atherosclerotic of the extremities of the body; as in the previous case, minor trauma in patients with this pathology may result in painful and chronic ulceration of the foot [24, 25] . Diabetic foot appears in diabetic patients as a result of damaging nerves and blood vessels problems that may increase the risk of ulceration, infection and amputation [22] . In fact, the biggest problem associated with diabetic foot is ulceration [26] , which represents the biggest medical, social and economic problem worldwide [5] . Inflammation is one of the first signs of foot ulceration, being characterized by redness, pain, swelling, loss of function and heat [9] . Diabetic foot ulceration occurs due to a variety of factors such as: neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, foot deformity, arterial insufficiency, trauma, and decreased resistance to infection [23] . Usually, it results from a combination of two or more risk factors, being neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease the main factors that lead to the development of diabetic foot ulcers [5, 24] .",

Neuropathic ulcers are usually located in the metatarsal, but are also found on the fingertips, the dorsum of the foot and the plantar zone. They are the least painful for the individual. The surrounding skin shows loss of sensitivity and calluses. This type of ulcer comes from bone deformation caused by neuropathy. Ulcers that develop on the plantar surface are usually circular and perforate in appearance, often deep. The foot that presents this type of ulceration is considered warm. Ischemic ulcers are located in the plantar and dorsal zones of the feet, in the heel, in the big toe, in the medial surface of the head of the first metatarsus and in the lateral surface of the fifth metatarsus. They are black in color and the surrounding skin is pale, shiny and cold. This pathology is not associated with callus or bone deformation, instead it is associated with peripheral vascular disease, for example, atherosclerosis (occlusion of blood vessels). Ischemic foot is considered cold.",

This situation is described in reflection column, for example #R3 < #R2 < #R1 means that the best value in Region 3 is smaller than the value in the Region 2, and the last one is smaller than the value in the Region 1. Similar situation occurs in the right foot (#R6 < #R5 < #R4). This situation occurs in images H01, H02, H03 and D06.
