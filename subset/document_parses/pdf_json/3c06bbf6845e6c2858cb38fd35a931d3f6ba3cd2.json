Both vaccines were used depending on their availability and administered according to the vaccination protocols. This is a cross-sectional study using an online ad hoc survey. All vaccinated healthcare workers received a mobile text message inviting them to answer a self-reported questionnaire that was available from 10 February 2021 to 3 May 2021. Those vaccinated after launching the survey received the invitation to participate 5 days after the second vaccine dose. The questionnaire was also available through the institutional webpage.",

A total of 2929 of those (38.0%) responded to the selfreported questionnaire (Table 1) . A total of 2373 participants received the BNT162b2 vaccine, 506 participants received the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and 50 participants did not report the vaccine type. Around 80% of the participants were women and 77% of those were between 18 In the BNT162b2 group, 40.6% (95% CI 38.6-42.6%) reported at least one adverse reaction with the first dose and 70.2% (95% CI 68.4-72.1%) with the second dose ( Table 2 ). In the mRNA-1273 group, self-reporting of any adverse reaction reached 59.9% (95% CI 55.6-64.2%) with the first dose and 91.7% (95% CI 86.8-96.6%) with the second dose. All adverse reactions were more frequently reported by the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group compared to the BNT162b2 group. Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction (Annexes S2 and S3). Fatigue, headache and malaise were the most common systemic reactions for both vaccines and doses. However, the BNT162b2 vaccinated group had significantly lower frequencies than the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group. In the BNT162b2 group, 10.8% (95% CI 9.5-12.0%) reported needing a medical leave after the second dose, while in the mRNA-1273 group it was 25.6% (95% CI 17.8-33.4%, p < 0.001). Need for med-ical attention after vaccination was also significantly more frequent among the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group. Four participants reported a potential life-threatening reaction; however, the revision of their medical histories revealed that only one life-threatening report was correct (an autoimmune hepatitis reactivation after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, that was reported to the Spanish Pharmacovigilance Adverse Reactions System). The frequency of adverse reactions after both the first and the second doses of both vaccine types was higher in participants who had a history of previous symptomatic COVID-19 infection (Table 3 , Figures 1 and 2) . After a first dose of vaccine, 81.3% (95% CI 67.7-94.8%) of participants with a history of hospitalization for COVID-19 and 54.1% (95% CI 50.3-57.9%) of participants with a history of mild or moderate COVID-19 self-reported at least one adverse reaction, compared to 40.4% (95% CI 38.3-42.5%) of participants with no history of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). After a second dose of the vaccine, the frequency was 96.0% (95% CI 88.3-100%) for those with a history of hospitalization and 85.6% (95% CI 82.6-88.6%) for those with mild or moderate symptomatic COVID-19, significantly higher than for participants with no history or history of asymptomatic COVID-19 (p < 0.001). The ranking of the most common adverse effects was similar for the participants with no history of COVID-19 and the participants with a history of asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19. However, for the participants who had suffered a hospitalization for COVID-19, fever and muscle or joint pain were ranked higher when ordered by frequency than other symptoms. Fever was the third most common symptom in the group that had been hospitalized for COVID-19 (62.5%, 95% CI 45.7-79.3% after dose 1) whereas it was the eighth most common symptom in other groups. ",

Vaccine recipients with a history of symptomatic COVID-19 showed a significantly higher frequency of adverse reactions. Among participants with a history of hospitalization for COVID-19, fever was the third most common symptom after the first vaccine dose, a different pattern than that found in other groups where local adverse reactions were the most frequent.

In the phase III clinical trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 84.7% of the vaccine recipients reported at least one local reaction and 77.4% one systemic reaction [5, 14] . In the clinical trial of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, the majority of vaccine recipients reported local and systemic reactions, with higher rates after the second dose [7, 15] . Our study showed a higher frequency of adverse reactions after the second dose both with the BNT162b2 and the mRNA-1273 vaccines, with a higher frequency for the mRNA-1273 group after both the first and second doses. Future studies should explore the biological aetiology of these differences in the two vaccines that use the same mRNA technology [16] and similar lipid nanoparticle delivery systems [17] . One possible explanation for the difference observed could be the amount of mRNA used in the vaccines. BNT162b2 [5] contains 30 \u00b5g of mRNA, while mRNA-1273 [7] contains 100 \u00b5g of mRNA. Additionally, mRNA-1273 has a higher concentration and dose (100 \u00b5g within 0.5 mL) compared to BNT162b2 (30 \u00b5g within 0.3 mL), which may also contribute to adverse reactions, especially injection site reactions.",

Most of our study participants were female and younger than the general population, so these results cannot be generalized to other population groups. In the vaccination campaign at our centre, BNT162b2 was more available than mRNA-1273. Accordingly, our sample size for BNT162b2 was larger than for mRNA-1273, particularly for second vaccine doses. Participants in the mRNA-1273 group were more likely to report a history of COVID-19 infection than those in the BNT162b2 group. This difference may be explained because vaccination with mRNA-1273 started a month after vaccination with BNT162b2. During that month-January 2021-, Spain was suffering the third wave of COVID-19 with a high population incidence [26] . When the vaccination campaign started, there was no minimum interval between the COVID-19 infection and the administration of the vaccine. We did not register when the prior COVID-19 infection occurred, which could also be related to vaccination adverse effects. We did not obtain specific data about the severity of the local or systemic adverse reactions. However, we obtained information regarding the need for medical attention or medical leave. We may have overestimated or underestimated the frequency of adverse reactions since this is a crosssectional study that used an ad hoc online self-reporting survey. We were able to review the medical histories of all the participants who reported a potential life-threatening reaction.",

However, the aetiology of local or systemic adverse reactions to the COVD-19 vaccines is still unclear [19] . Our results point to a higher frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions in vaccine recipients who have a history of symptomatic COVID-19 and show that the seriousness of a previous COVID-19 infection could be associated with having more symptoms after vaccination. Therefore, it is possible that the local and systemic adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines that we have assessed are associated with the vaccines' active ingredients and immune responses in addition to the excipients.",

            "text": "Widespread COVID-19 vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic [29] . After more than 5% of the world's population has been vaccinated, it could be safe to say that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks. So far, pharmacovigilance systems have observed that serious adverse reactions related with mRNA vaccines are very uncommon [30] . The effects recorded in our study, although frequent, are mild and well tolerated. However, studies regarding intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 have shown increasing doubts about vaccine side effects and safety [31] . Adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines can cause fear and anxiety in the general population and may contribute to decreased willingness or delays in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine [32] . According to our results, adverse reactions were more frequently reported by the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group compared to the BNT162b2 vaccinated group. Moreover, vaccine recipients who had a history of COVID-19 infection reported more adverse reactions than those without a history of COVID-19, and the seriousness of the COVID-19 infection was associated with the frequency of adverse reactions. Our results could help inform vaccine recipients of their probability of having relatively common but mild adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, increasing vaccine confidence and acceptance.
