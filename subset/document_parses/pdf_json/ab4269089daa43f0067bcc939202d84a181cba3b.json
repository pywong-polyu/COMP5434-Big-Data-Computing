In its original formulation, this corresponds to an additional term in a linear regression for financial forecasting, but the idea is general and requires the quantification of information flow between variables.",

Indeed, the economic value of things and firms is both material and immaterial. Reputation is playing a major role in economics. This has probably always been true, but it has become even more crucial in the present world where social-media has a pervasive role. Therefore, a current study of market behaviour cannot be limited to the hard evidence related to the financial metrics but must also dig into the so f t metrics of social media and news. The relation between the two is still a domain in exploration.",

The first represents the uncertainty related to a variable's possible outcomes and quantifies its information content, the second one measures the information that two variables share. The transfer entropy is a conditional mutual information between the past of a variable and the future of another variable conditioned to the past of this second variable. It measures the information transferred between the two variables or equivalently the reduction in uncertainty uniquely caused by a variable on the another [2] .",

They observe that only some of the six moods are correlated with DJIA values, with a lag of 3-4 days. Zhang et al. [11] find that, by analyzing the sentiment spikes on Twitter posts, it is possible to predict what will happen in the market the following day. Rao et al. [12] using Granger's Causality Analysis show that, in the short term, tweets influence the trend in stock prices; Ranco et al. [13] considering 30 joint-stock companies of the DJIA index, through the \"study of events\" methodology [14] , a technique used in economics and finance that analyzes abnormal price changes linked to external events; for each stock, it highlights the external events grouped according to a measure of polarity. They relate the prevailing sentiment in financial tweets, in terms of volume, and stock returns showing a statistically significant dependence. Souza et al. [15] studying retail brands analyze if there is a significant connection between sentiment and volume of tweets with volatility and return on stock prices, seeing that the data obtained from social media are relevant to understand the financial dynamics and, in particular, demonstrate how the sentiment obtained from the tweets is linked to the returns more than traditional news-wires.",

According to such method, the observation space is divided into bins and the observations are allocated to each bin depending on their value. It is evident that the appropriate choice of bins is crucial. We chose the equi-probable bins approach, which enforces that, in each bin, the number of data points is approximately the same. In previous studies [27] , it was shown that this approach yields the best results for artificial data where the true underlying causality structure is known. In our case, where the causality structure must be discovered, we verified that other choices, such as equi-sized bins, return similar results on our dataset; however, the equi-probable bins provide the cleanest outputs.",

Indeed, for the transfer entropy between two variables, we have to estimate a three-dimensional histogram. In general, for p variables, the dimension is at least d = p + 1. For any meaningful statistical analysis, the bins in the histogram must be populated and therefore one must have a number of observations that is larger than (number of bins) d . This method is non-parametric; however, the choice of the number of bins is important, and this could be seen as a hyper-parameter. In the present study, however, the choice is highly constrained by the sample size. We have indeed two years of observations (512 days, see Section 3). Therefore, the maximum number of bins should be no larger than (512) 1/3 = 8. In [27] , it was shown that results are robust for a range of different values of the number of bins. Indeed, we tested the bin number in a range between 3 and 8 obtaining consistently similar results. We eventually decided for a number of bins equal to 5, which was giving the cleanest result. It should be clear that, with this non-parametric approach, with the present dataset, it would be unfeasible to extend the analysis to greater dimensions beyond the computation of transfer entropies between two variables.",

In this paper, we used 50 shuffles. We use the Z-score because it is a robust statistical validation that depends on minimal assumptions. We checked the quantiles as well, retrieving consistent results. However, with only 50 shuffles, the quantile measure tends to be noisier.

Whilst the sector's classification is important for the correct assessment of the pattern drivers, the tendency of big companies to diversify the types of business more and more is unquestionable. As an example, Amazon, which is listed in the Consumer discretionary sector, has a division named 'Amazon Web Services' for cloud computing and device and a division named 'Amazon Studios' for music and videos streaming. Bear in mind that the division among the sectors does not completely reflect the real connections among the companies.

By performing a sensitivity analysis by changing the threshold values, we observe that the four networks have different patterns. The Price to Price causality network shows relations with news with a rather large number of overlaps and statistical significance with p-values below 1% but only when the network is less restricted using a small news threshold and small Z-scores. This seems to indicate that news pick some insights of the internal dynamics of the market and that identify correctly important events in the financial domain that trigger propagation of information through the social media. This significance at small thresholds could indicate that this happens on average, but the importance of the news or the intensity of the causality relation is not relevant.",

We focus on top 50 companies of the S&P index rooted in different sectors: Consumer discretionary, Consumer staples, Energy, Healthcare, Tech, and Financial Industrial and Communications. Data cover two years from November 2018 through November 2020. In our analysis, we employ an information-theoretic measure, the transfer entropy, to monitor the information flows between sentiment and market movements. We use a recently developed nonlinear methodology [27] that can better capture causality extending the traditional Granger approach.",

For instance, in the sentiment to sentiment network, we can clearly spot the pivotal role of the Healthcare sector which influences both the consumer discretionary and the technological sectors. Such pattern is present, although with differentiated importance within the other networks too. What is surprising is the role of the Financial sector, which is traditionally in a paramount position compared to other sectors. Our analysis shows that financial companies are still important if we restrict to price data solely or if we consider the impact of sentiment on price but much less within the alternative scenarios. However, this is in line with what was already reported in [31] where a reduction of centrality of the financial sector was pointed out. This was also reported by [28] , where, through a temporal dynamic network analysis, the authors show that the financial sector behaves differently as an isolated cluster which reacts mainly to market price data (more on such peculiar pattern in [32] ). Another important sector is the technological one, either as influencer or follower depending on the network we may consider. The remaining sectors seem less consistent and change in relevance and role across the different networks.",

On the contrary, the cross sector interactions tend to be more relevant. This might be because companies with high capitalization tend to operate in many markets other than their core business. Secondly, the price variables show a more homogeneous behavior, with connections which tend to be stronger and also more frequent. Nonetheless, we identify several cases where sentiment about a company has a strong influence on sentiment on other companies and also to other company prices. In particular, the Tech sector reveals a very strong influence of sentiment on prices. This might be a consequence of the presence of the most popular companies in terms of branding, the 'Big Five' (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple), which are often mentioned in news and blogs and this continuous notoriety obviously affects the financial aspect. The present paper can be improved and extended into several directions: US companies should be complemented and compared with European ones which typically show different patterns and level of connectedness.",
