Therefore, this study aimed to explore barriers to implementing an integrated One Health surveillance system in Palestine. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted from April 2020 until August 2020. Data were collected using semi-structured interview guides. Seven key stakeholders were interviewed during data collection. A thematic analysis was performed. Results: Four overarching themes emerged explaining barriers to integrated implementation of the One Health surveillance system. They are lack of policy coherence, limited financial resources, poor governance and leadership, and lack of One Health training programmes. Conclusion: Improved understanding of the transmission and effective control (including One Health approach) of zoonotic disease and better governance and leadership are critical in the diseases that threaten public health, such as the COVID-19.",

            "text": "The emerging zoonoses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are a growing public health security concern due to their ability to spread across the globe rapidly, plus their subsequent adverse impacts on a wide range of sectors, including health, trade, commerce, and tourism. 1 A multi-sectoral response to the phenomenon is evident. Therefore, the One Health (OH) approach provides the needed conceptual framework to bridge the gap between sectors and enhance effective prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines OH as an approach to designing and implementing programmes, policies, legislation, and research. Multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes. 4 Yet, practical application of OH remains a challenge, especially in developing countries. 2, 5 Several studies have identified persisting challenges in establishing and implementing OH programmes, many of which are related to the importance of including a diverse range of relevant experts. Everyone brings unique skills and views to the cause. Despite the consensual OH definition that emerged in recent years, the level of collaboration required in the OH approach is not yet agreed upon. 6, 7 The recent success stories of OH surveillance tend to concentrate on the apparent interfaces between human and veterinary medicine, such as zoonoses and food safety. 8 The lack of a clear definition and accompanying vision for the future of OH acts as a barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration, and fragmented approaches by different sectors limit professionals' ability to collaborate across disciplines are the most common two implementation challenges. 9 Collaboration in an OH surveillance system can take many forms (across sectors, disciplines, decision-making scales, and public-private partnerships) and be implemented at different stages of the surveillance process (from planning to the dissemination of surveillance results) with varying degrees of integration. 10 The issues that the Palestinian healthcare system faces are comparable with those of other nations in the area confront. In Palestine, there are four healthcare providers: the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector, with the MOH serving as the primary provider and accountable governor. The fragmentation of the Palestinian health system and the fact that it is an emergencyoriented, highly political system with acute limitations in resources, capacity, and supplies that are reliant on unpredictable international help is a distinguishing feature. The healthcare costs are not made public, and the healthcare outcomes are not up to par with present spending levels. Over the previous decade, overall health expenditures (public and private) have varied at the cost of lower-priority sectors that get enough funding. In Palestine, long-term depletion of essential medications and supplies, restricted access to healthcare, and violence against health professionals and system facilities are significant hurdles and health determinants. 11, 12 In Palestine, major interrelated sectors, including the health, environmental, and agricultural sectors, are fragmented and lack coordination. 13 As a result, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gaza have been wide-ranging and severe -fascinated by the increased unavailability of potable water and sanitation and disposable wastewater systems and their associated health and economic threats. [14] [15] [16] These, in addition to many other factors, have deepened the fragility of Gaza's health system and efforts towards universal health coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. [17] [18] [19] There is broad recognition that the OH approach to health through an improved surveillance system is central to a resilient and sustainable health system. 20 A recent commentary discussed OH principles' contributions in strengthening the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This is especially the case for challenges of conducting OH surveillance, which is driven mainly by a lack of resources and manpower. [34] [35] [36] In response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Palestine, the MOH developed the national COVID-19 surveillance system based on the existing open-source DHIS2 software. The system reflects the WHO case definition and reporting form, in addition to the Palestinian case management criteria and workflow. The system is capable of generating indicators at the output and outcome levels, and allows heath workers to track information at the patient level. 37, 38 The difficulties in stakeholder cooperation stem from the fact that for the knowledge co-creation envisioned in OH innovations, a diverse team of scientists working together but within their own silo is insufficient. Nonetheless, such flimsy collaborations result from a long history of fragmented systems and practices that limit actors' and organizations' ability to collaborate and incorporate varied ideas, approaches, and activities. [39] [40] [41] The findings of the current study should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. To begin with, the limited sample size of this qualitative study emphasizes the need for more large-scale research in the field.
