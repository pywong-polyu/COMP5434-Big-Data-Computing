            "text": "Background. Human resources are one of the most critical organizational resources, the reinforcement and maintenance of whom require much energy in health organizations, particularly in long-term crises. Many methods have been suggested in this regard; however, there is a need for their integration and clarification. Methods. We systematically searched the international databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, from 2003 to April 2021by using some relevant keywords. e quality of the included studies was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist. Results. e search resulted in 1613 papers, among which there were 16 systematic reviews. e studies addressed a wide range of problems and solutions. Twelve items and four items were classified with moderate quality (AMSTER score 5-8) and high quality (AMSTER score 9-11), respectively. Half of the studies (n \ufffd 8) dealt with mental and psychological problems resulting from crises as the most important factor in the decline of health system staff's durability in organizations. ey also provided different solutions such as mental health counselling during and after the crisis, flexible work schedule, promoted trust in the organization, support of staff's family, and enhanced awareness to support employees. And the other articles addressed managerial problems as the most critical factor in the decline of health system staff's durability in organizations and proposed solutions such as suitable planning before, during, and after the crisis and the use of material and spiritual incentives to increase the employees' motivation and organizational resilience to maintain the staff. Conclusion. In the present review study, three dimensions (namely, resilience, motivation-hygiene measures, and development of manager's soft skills) are considered as the main factors reinforcing and maintaining human resources in the health systems in long-term crises and disasters.",

On the other hand, healthcare staff, in particular nurses, who make up the largest number of healthcare providers and play the pivotal role in crises response and care, are required to have sufficient knowledge, skills, competencies, and adequate preparation to respond to crisis [1, 7] . In this regard, the findings reported by Said and Chiang indicate that nurses should focus on psychological preparedness to develop and create better educational plans to reinforce knowledge and care abilities required in crises [1] .",

In this situation, many employees have been encouraged to work in their homes, and their managers monitor tasks remotely; however, health organizations, especially those with emergency personnel and healthcare specialists, need their staff in their workplace [2] . Under this condition, human resource managers should help the staff deal with changes occurring in the workplace and social environment and adapt themselves to these changes [8] since it affects how personnel are supposed to make decisions. Moreover, plans, policies, and organizational decisions should be made based on the best available evidence [3] .

Resilience is defined as an organization's capability to continue its activities in line with its goals in the presence of challenges. Resilience not only increases the system's capacity to resist strikes but also adapts and changes in accordance with the challenges. In this regard, managers need to consider crises in advance and adopt some management techniques such as the accelerated successive overrelaxation and ASOR method, identify the organization's weaknesses and strengths, and make necessary plans [9] . is planning is also necessary for the provision of human resources. In crises, workers could be classified into three groups. e first group includes workers who work in the organization and continue their activities during the crises period. is group of workers might either be satisfied with their jobs or not be satisfied and stay in the organization due to their lack of willingness to search for a new job and family commitments, while they are dissatisfied with their jobs. is is not good for the organization since such workers fail to be creative and dynamic and finally quit the organization when they find an appropriate job. Organization managers must take management measures to promote the satisfaction of dissatisfied and unmotivated workers because the lack of motivation could decrease the quality of service [11, 32] . e second group includes workers lost because of job dissatisfaction, retirement, death, or other causes [32] . e third group encompasses workers coming to the organization during the crisis. ese workers might be just graduated or senior students, who join the organization with the incentive of employment upon the call of the health system [32] . According to Collado-Boira, despite the threats of COVID-19, senior students were more willing to accept the government's request due to their social commitment and professional ethics [11] .",

Furthermore, Pavani Rangachari's investigations in 2017 indicated that excluding nurses from the decision-making process was the leading cause of job burnout [33] . According to Chia-Ching Wu's research findings on nurses' willingness to care for patients with SARS in 2012, the workers' willingness to work during crisis periods does not change significantly, and the majority of workers are willing or unwilling under normal conditions. In this investigation, considering their financial needs, family support, safeguarding individual health, and human resource policies, nurses found it a better decision to stay in their jobs during the outbreak of SARS [24] . erefore, motivation-hygiene measures need to be adopted under both crisis and normal condition [13] [14] [15] since workers' reluctance to work in both conditions reduces the quality of work and service even if it does not make workers quit their jobs. is will be more alarming under the crisis condition.",

According to workers' needs, an increase in motivationhygiene measures can play a pivotal role in maintaining workers in the long-term crises. ese measures in healthcare systems include the provision of protective equipment required by workers, shift change programs to let the worker rest [12] , information dissemination [24] , training programs, and increased awareness in dealing with illness, all of which would decrease their feelings of fear [13] . High work pressure should also be considered since it has negative effects on the nurses' performance. In this regard, if a nurse's mistake aroused by high work pressure under a crisis condition makes a patient die or get worse, the consequences have destructive effects on the nurse's morals and her/his willingness to continue working [38] . Accordingly, employee new graduates and entrusting simple tasks to these individuals would make more experienced health workers have more time and concentrate on handling high-level care services [3] . Moreover, if it is possible not to reduce salaries with a decrease in work hours, a motivation-hygiene Managers' soft skills measure should be adopted, which would have a positive effect during the crisis period [39] . e provision of personal protective equipment can significantly influence individuals' mental and physical health. It makes workers be less concerned with their health status and their families' health, as such the likelihood of disease transmission is decreased [33, 38] . Moreover, training, public health, families' awareness of mental and social supports, and the appreciation of workers are considered motivation-hygiene measurements that positively influence workers' mental and physical health and prevent job burnout and the loss of healthcare workers under such conditions [15] . One of the main study findings was the necessity of developing managers' soft skills. e skills are as significant as establishing an intimate relationship with workers to promote organizational resilience in crisis. Organizations with more competent managers respond to crises better [14, 40] . Establishing effective relationship under critical conditions promotes trust among workers [33] . Trust as the driving force of ethics and the incentive for employees is of great importance for organizations, especially in crisis since psychological trust and safety are the prerequisites of organizational resilience in health organizations [33, 41] . Such measures require not many financial resources; however, managers' attention and managerial skills are of paramount importance. e measures include tasks such as listening to workers, learning from their personal problemsolving experiences, making clear strategies to support and manage workers, and generally sparing efforts to build trust.",
