There are several HSPs, including HSPA5, also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) that is an ER resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the Golgi network. HSPA5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment. Surface HSPA5 has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance. Recently, surface HSPA5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. In spite of these observations, the association of HSPA5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear. To gain information about this process, we studied the interaction of HSPA5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids. We found that HSPA5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HSPA5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids, but to a lesser extent than the full-length protein, suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of HSPA5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the N-terminus end of the protein plays a critical role.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous polypeptides present in all living organisms, from bacteria to humans. They participate in several basic cellular processes, including protein folding, assembly of multiprotein complexes, as well as protein transport and degradation. In this regard, they have been coined molecular chaperones (Hartl and Hayer-Hartl 2002) . Although many HSPs are present constitutively in cells, other members are expressed or overexpressed during stress conditions, such as increases in temperature or exposure to harmful chemicals. The expression of these proteins facilitates a rapid recovery from the stress preserving survival and prompting protection from subsequent insults (De Maio 1999) .

Each of these groups is also composed of various members. For example, the Hsp70 (HSPA) family is made up of four proteins with different subcellular localizations. Hsc70 or HSPA8 (constitutive) and Hsp70 or HSPA1 (stress-inducible) are both present in the cytosol/nucleus, mortalin or HSPA9 is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), or HSPA5 is present in the ER lumen (De Maio 1999) . A common feature of Hsp70s (HSPAs) is that they are flexible proteins containing two regions, the nucleotide-binding and peptidebinding domains (NBD and PBD, respectively), connected by a short hydrophobic linker. NBD is within the N-terminal end containing ATPase activity, whereas PBD is within the Cterminal end and is involved in the binding of client polypeptides (Mayer et al. 2001; da Silva and Borges 2011) . These two domains coordinate the folding process that is mediated by a bidirectional heterotrophic allosteric mechanism driving a conformational change from an open state in the presence of ATP that established the initial interaction with the client polypeptide to a closed state upon conversion of ATP into ADP retaining the target polypeptide. This process is modulated by cochaperone molecules (Young 2010; da Silva and Borges 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 224, "text": "(Kampinga et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 682, "end": 696, "text": "(De Maio 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1087, "text": "(Mayer et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1113, "text": "da Silva and Borges 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1526, "text": "(Young 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1552, "text": "da Silva and Borges 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although the folding process occurs inside the cell, extensive and compelling evidence has shown that HSP are also present outside the cells, apparently acting as signaling molecules participating in the communications between cells (De Maio 2011; De Maio 2014) . The mechanism for the export of cytosolic HSP into the extracellular environment is still unclear, particularly because these proteins do not have the respective signal for the translocation into the classical secretory pathway. Thus, the challenge for cytosolic HSPs to reach the extracellular space is crossing the hydrophobic environment provided by the plasmalemma. Although the translocation across the plasma membrane appears as thermodynamically impermissible, there are broad reports showing the presence of HSP, particularly Hsp70 (HSPA1), embedded into the plasma membrane of transformed cells (Multhoff and Hightower 1996) . Moreover, the insertion of HSP into lipid membranes has been corroborated by several studies using artificial lipid bilayers (Arispe and De Maio 2000; Vega et al. 2008; Armijo et al. 2014; Macazo and White 2014; De Maio et al. 2019) . The interaction of HSP with the plasma membrane is likely the first step for their export mechanism (De Maio 2011). One possibility is that membrane HSPs are released in association with exosomes from viable cells (Gastpar et al. 2005; Vega et al. 2008 ). However, HSPs may also be discharged from dying necrotic cells (Basu and Srivastava, 2000; De Maio and Vazquez 2013) . Among all HSPs, the only one that could follow the classical secretory pathway is HSPA5 that is present in the ER lumen (Lee 1992; Pobre et al. 2019 ). HSPA5 has the same structural characteristics of all HSPAs with two domains, NBD and PBD. In addition, HSPA5 presents a leading sequence at the N-terminus end that is responsible for its translocation into the ER lumen and an ER retention signal (KDEL) at the carboxyl-terminal end. HSPA5 participates in the translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across the ER membrane (Casanova-Morales et al. 2018; Pobre et al. 2019) , in protein folding and quality control (Haas and Wabl 1983) , in targeting misfolded proteins for degradation (Gardner et al. 2013; Oikonomou and Hendershot 2020) , and in the unfolded protein response (Luo and Lee 2013; Wang and Kaufman 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 247, "text": "(De Maio 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 248, "end": 261, "text": "De Maio 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 868, "end": 897, "text": "(Multhoff and Hightower 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1050, "text": "(Arispe and De Maio 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1068, "text": "Vega et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1088, "text": "Armijo et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1111, "text": "Macazo and White 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1132, "text": "De Maio et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1370, "text": "(Gastpar et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1387, "text": "Vega et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1481, "text": "(Basu and Srivastava, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1507, "text": "De Maio and Vazquez 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1640, "text": "(Lee 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1658, "text": "Pobre et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2072, "text": "(Casanova-Morales et al. 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2091, "text": "Pobre et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2153, "text": "(Haas and Wabl 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2204, "end": 2225, "text": "(Gardner et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2256, "text": "Oikonomou and Hendershot 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2314, "text": "(Luo and Lee 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2337, "text": "Wang and Kaufman 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "HSPA5 was reported present on the plasma membrane (Suzuki et al. 1991; Delpino and Castelli 2002; Zhang et al. 2013) , in which it acts as a signal-transducing receptor or coreceptor for soluble ligands (Zhang et al. 2010 ). Also, cellsurface HSPA5 appears to be involved in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance (Pfaffenbach and Lee 2011) .

HSPs are not alone in this regard since many other cytosolic proteins follow the same pathway moving into the extracellular environment by an unclear mechanism, namely, the nonclassical secretory pathway (Nickel and Seedorf 2008) .

Even more interesting, this protein was also detected on the surface of cancer cells (Delpino and Castelli 2002; Zhang et al. 2010 Zhang et al. , 2013 . These observations have raised several intriguing questions. Firstly, how is HSPA5 exported outside the ER in spite of presenting a retaining signal (KDEL)? HSPA5 was found to escape this subcellular compartment after ER stress (Zhang et al. 2013) . Secondly, how does the protein get inserted into the plasma membrane? Prior studies have suggested that HSPA5 displays several potential domains, particularly within the C-terminus end (Tseng et al. 2019) , that could explain the insertion into the plasma membrane (Zhang et al. 2013; Tsai et al. 2015 ). In the current study, we directly addressed how HSPA5 could interact with lipid membranes by analyzing their association with liposomes.

However, the most interesting observation is that HSPA5, as well as HSPA1 undergoing an oligomerization process upon membrane insertion, is mediated by the formation of disulfide bonds. HSPA5 contains two cysteine groups, one at the beginning of the N-terminus end and the second at the C-terminus end (Fig. 1a) . Although there is no evidence that these cysteine groups could form intramolecular bridges, we think that they produce intermolecular bonds coordinating the assembly of oligomeric complexes. This multipolypeptide complex appears to assemble after insertion into the lipid bilayer since it was observed only in the presence of phospholipids (Fig. 6) . Therefore, the lipid bilayer may provide an oxidative environment capable of forming these disulfide bridges. Moreover, we found that the N-terminus end domain was capable of forming dimers, whereas the Cterminus end was not. Thus, the cysteine within the N- Fig. 8 Model for the presence of antiparallel oligomers of HSPA5 or HSPA1 after incorporation into the lipid bilayer via formation of disulfide bonds terminus end of the proteins may be in the right conformation to form intermolecular complexes. A puzzling observation is that multiple oligomers were only observed in the case of the full-length protein, whereas only dimers were noticed when the N-terminus domain was inserted into the liposomes. A possible explanation for these results is that intermolecular disulfide bonds could be formed between the N-terminus end and the C-terminus domain of an adjacent polypeptide. Tandem repeats of HSPA5 in an antiparallel conformation may be assembled within the lipid bilayer (Fig. 8) . These observations were also seen for HSPA1 that share the same cysteine group on the N-terminus end as HSPA5 (Fig. 1a) .

Interestingly, DnaK, which contains only one cysteine group, formed dimers but not oligomers (Lopez et al. 2016 ).

This observation is apparently due to reduced access for this protease since HSPA1/HSPA5 within CL liposomes forms large aggregates at 25\u00b0C that likely hindered accessibility for digestion.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 401, "text": "(Lopez et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 527, "end": 547, "text": "(Armijo et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although our results showed a great deal of selectivity of HSPA5 for negatively charged lipids, it is still unclear how the protein interacts with the natural membranes in which this protein resides. The lumen of the ER is not rich in phosphatidylserine moieties (Yeung et al. 2008 ) that may explain why the protein has not been detected in the membrane of this subcellular compartment. Similarly, phosphatidylserine is constrained to the inner side of the plasma membrane as a result of an active energy-dependent process to maintain the asymmetry of the plasma membrane (Leventis and Grinstein 2010) . However, phosphatidylserine is capable of flipping out the plasma membrane by a process enhanced during cell activation (Elliott et al. 2005; Dillon et al. 2000) or pathological processes (Zwaal et al. 2005) . Thus, HSPA5 may encounter phosphatidylserine microdomains within the surface of the plasma membrane that facilitates its insertion, particularly in cancer cells. Although several functions have been ascribed to cell-surface HSPA5, the biological significance of this phenomenon needs further exploration. HSPA5 also showed affinity for CL that is a major component (18%) of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Horvath and Daum 2013) . The presence of HSPA5 has been detected within the mitochondrial matrix associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane upon activation of the unfolded protein response (Sun et al. 2006) . The presence and possible interaction of HSPA5 with the CL-rich inner membrane may be part of a mechanism to maintain the proper import of proteins into the mitochondria, perhaps in cooperation with HSPA9 (mtHsp70), that is constitutively present in this compartment (De Maio 1999; Daugaard et al. 2007) .
