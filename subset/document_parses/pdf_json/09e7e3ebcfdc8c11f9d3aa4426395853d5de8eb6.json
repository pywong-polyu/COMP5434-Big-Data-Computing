However, there is a growing concern about the relation of dexamethasone with the unprecedented rates of ICU-acquired respiratory tract infections (ICU-RTI) observed in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study; conducted in ten countries in Latin America and Europe. We included patients older than 18 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 requiring ICU admission. A multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to determine the relation between dexamethasone treatment and ICU-RTI. Results: A total of 3777 patients were included. 2065 (54.7%) were treated with dexamethasone within the first 24 h of admission. After performing the PSM, patients treated with dexamethasone showed significantly higher proportions of VAP (282/1652 [17.1%] Vs. 218/1652 [13.2%], p = 0.014). Also, dexamethasone treatment was identified as an adjusted risk factor of ICU-RTI in the multivariate logistic regression model (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.37-1.97; p < 0.001).",

It is estimated that more than 10 billion dollars have been expended taking care of these patients only in the United States, and around 20 billion dollars were invested in developing the new vaccines currently available worldwide [4] . Moreover, about 30% of hospitalized patients develop severe infections and require organ support, including advanced ventilatory treatments and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), increasing the mortality and costs of patient care [5, 6] . During the pandemic, several medications have been tested to improve clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2, especially in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, data evaluating the efficacy of these treatments have been contradictory. Notably, dexamethasone was the first medication to show a mortality benefit consistently in patients requiring oxygen support or invasive mechanical ventilation; thus, it has become the standard of care for severe COVID-19 patients globally [9] .",

Moreover, patients that develop ICU-RTI are frequently infected by multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae). Consequently, these patients have higher mortality rates, longer ICU length of stay, and higher patient care-associated costs [10] . The mechanisms underlying these higher rates of ICU-RTI remained widely unknown, and few studies have documented the risk factors associated with these infections. The high incidence of ICU-RTI observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients is contradictory because these patients are in strict isolation, theoretically decreasing hospital-acquired infections. However, there may be other factors such as a lower implementation of bundles in pneumonia prevention, longer duration of ventilation, prolonged length of stay, and uncontrolled usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics. A growing concern has also emerged that treatment with immunosuppressors, such as dexamethasone, might be associated with ICU-RTI; however, data exploring this unintended effect is lacking. Therefore, this study will attempt to bring novel data in this regard.",

Thus, steroids were used early in the pandemic as a strategy to modulate the inflammatory reaction observed in COVID-19, especially in severely ill patients [16] [17] [18] . As a result of this potential benefit, systemic steroids were included in the platform trials launched to identify treatments to improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, such as the REMAP-CAP the RECOVERY trial, among others [9, 19, 20] . Dexamethasone was found to reduce the 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received respiratory support in the RECOVERY trial [9] . Also, a metanalysis carried out by The World Health Organization found a mortality reduction in patients treated with systemic corticosteroids [19] . Therefore, dexamethasone has become the standard of care in patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19. Notably, some experts have postulated that there are still unresolved issues regarding using systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients, particularly secondary infections. Superinfections in COVID-19 patients are more frequent than in other lower respiratory tract infections, such as influenza pneumonia [10] .",

Although multiple factors have been shown to contribute to the mortality associated with these infections, it is mainly attributable to the failure or delays of adequate antibiotic therapy; importantly, we did not assess this aspect in this study. Patients in these scenarios have a higher risk of ICU mortality, ranging from 20 to 50% and even up to 76% [14, 22, 23] . Mortality in patients with COVID-19 and VAP is not widely described yet; however, Luyt et al. described patients with severe infection due to SARS-Cov2 with VAP and showed a mortality rate of 34%, comparable to patients with influenza pneumonia and VAP (40%) [21] . These ranges coincide with our study results since 39.8% of patients with ICU-RTI died during their ICU stay. This should be of great concern to the health community, as secondary infections such as VAP, VAT, and HAP are generally preventable. All possible risk factors associated with them must be identified and avoided where possible.",

First, although this was a multicenter collaboration allowing a more significant sample and excellent generalizability, treatments between the different ICUs and, therefore, dexamethasone administration were not standardized. However, international guidelines were homogeneous at the beginning of the pandemic. All societies recommended 8 mg of dexamethasone for ten days, which was the scheme used per protocol in all participating centers. Secondly, statistical adjustments through PSM matching analysis could have limitations like unmeasured severity scores at ICU admission (e.g., APACHE or SOFA), or there might have been differences in antibiotic use in terms of agents used, the timing of initiation dose and administration; all of which may have been confounding variables. However, other severity variables were considered, such as laboratory parameters on admission, physiological variables on admission, FiO2 on admission, IMV and days of IMV, ICU-LOS, and Hospital-LOS. Notably, the PSM analysis is a methodology that permits close simulation to randomization, balancing the sample and reducing observational bias. Mortality in patients who developed ICU-RTI was not adjusted for covariables; however, this study aimed to approximate the survival in patients who had been superinfected and not determine the factors associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm this potential unintended effect.",

However, some complications are derived by their use as the increased risk of superinfection reported in our study; thus, cautious use of this treatment is warranted, especially in patients with no severe infection. Further studies are needed to determine strategies to reduce the rate of ICU-RTI in patients with severe COVID-19.",
