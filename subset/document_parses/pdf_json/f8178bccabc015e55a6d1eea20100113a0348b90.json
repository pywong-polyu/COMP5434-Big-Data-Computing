These observations were in agreement with ours and others with respect to circulating Angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone levels in COVID-19 patients, in whom no significant differences were observed between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, as well as by COVID-19 severity [3, 4] . However, we also observed significant decreases in both Angiotensin I (Ang I) and Angiotensin 1,7 (Ang 1,7) levels in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, with Ang 1,7 trending lower with increased disease severity [5] . Such findings would suggest a potential disturbance of ACE. In this report, we aimed to confirm the findings of Guler et al. [2] with respect to serum ACE activity, as well as measure plasma ACE concentration, which could also contribute to RAAS imbalance in patients with COVID-19.",

Samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 15 min and frozen at \u00c080 C until analysis. Inclusion in COVID-19 cohort was dependent on positive result of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 on standard-of-care nasopharyngeal swabs. RT-PCR negative patients were deemed non-COVID-19 sick controls, after confirmation of negative infection status using clinical criteria (CoronaScore) and serology testing, in an algorithm previously described [6, 7] . Plasma concentration of ACE was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), with manufacturer's reference range between 58 and 211 lg/L. Serum ACE activity was measured using an ACE Kinetic Enzymatic Assay (Buhlmann, Amherst, New Hampshire, USA), on a Dimension RxL Max Chemistry Analyzer (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany), with manufacturer's reference range between 20 and 70 U/L. Patients in COVID-19 cohort were stratified based on peak severity during course of infection, as having mild (ambulatory, n \u00bc 19), moderate (hospitalized, n \u00bc 17) and severe (requiring intensive care unit admission or death, n \u00bc 16) illness. Continuous data was reported as median and interquartile range (IQR), whilst categorical data was shown as absolute and relative frequencies. With regards to the comparison between COVID-19 positive patients and non-COVID-19 sick controls, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify significant differences between laboratory values, and Fisher's exact test to identify significant differences between categorical variables. Comparisons of plasma concentrations of ACE activity and concentration, along with other laboratory values, between patients with different severity levels were performed using the Kruskal Wallis test, followed by the Dunn-Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons when necessary, whilst comparisons of categorical variables were done using Fisher's exact test. The relationship between ACE activity and concentration in COVID-19 positive patients and inflammatory biomarkers was examined using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Statistical analysis was conducted using R software (version 4.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), and a p < .05 was considered statistically significant.",

Moreover, we have previously reported a low Ang 1,7 state in COVID-19 [5] , which has been found to be associated with other forms of ARDS [8] , which could instead be explained by decreased ACE2 activity. However, the relatively normal levels of Ang II and decreased Ang I in this cohort, are not congruent with the ACE activity and level found in this study, but such findings are consistent with the abundance of literature published to-date. While an early study by Liu et al. reported to observe extremely high levels of Ang II in patients with COVID-19 [9] , such findings have not been replicated in larger, well-designed investigations. In congruence with our findings in this cohort, Rieder et al. [4] observed no differences in serum concentrations of ACE 2, Ang II, or aldosterone in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 sick controls presenting to the emergency department. Kutz et al. [10] reported a similar decrease in Angiotensin 1,7 and Angiotensin 1, as well as a decrease in angiotensin II, but no differences in ACE or ACE 2 activity, between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 sick controls. Taken together, such findings suggest, at least on a systematic circulating level, a state of a depressed RAAS in COVID-19, as opposed to drastic circulating ACE2/ ACE imbalance.",
