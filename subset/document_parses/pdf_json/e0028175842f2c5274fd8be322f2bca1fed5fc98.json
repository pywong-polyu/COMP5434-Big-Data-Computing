            "text": "As very recently reviewed, in addition to its classical hormone action related to calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, vitamin D is supposed to be more or less directly involved in a plethora of physiological mechanisms aimed at maintaining the whole-body homeostasis. For example, in recent years, vitamin D has emerged as a potential immune modulator [2] . The most active metabolite of the vitamers D, 1\u03b1,25-(OH) 2 D [3] , regulates development, maturation, and functioning of different lineages of immune cells [4] . Vitamin D, indeed, limits the activation of T lymphocytes and determine a phenotypic shift from T helper (Th)1/Th17 pro-inflammatory to the Th2/T regulatory (Treg) anti-inflammatory phenotype [5] [6] [7] . Antigen presenting cells (APCs, such as macrophages and dendritic cells) and epithelial barrier cells, which are involved in the identification of pathogens, express the 1\u03b1-hydroxylase which is responsible of the biosynthesis of 1\u03b1,25-(OH) 2 D. Cytochrome P 27B1 (CYP27B1), that holds the 1\u03b1-hydroxylase activity, is directly induced by pathogens throughout the activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Instead, systemic calcitriol activation takes place at the kidney level and is under the control of calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast-growth factor (FGF)-23 [8, 9] . Furthermore, 1\u03b1,25-(OH) 2 D stimulates the synthesis anti-microbial compounds (i.e., cathelicidins, defensins) [8] , which are also active against viruses [10, 11] , reduce the availability of iron and the needed for pathogens replication in infected cells by inhibiting hepcidin expression [12] . Furthermore, 1\u03b1,25(OH) 2 D improves the epithelial barrier function at the gut [13, 14] and the lung level [15] , which are the main sites of entrance for pathogens, enhances neutrophils function [16] and stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [17] , that cooperate in killing pathogens, and stimulates the phagocytic and autophagocytic activity of macrophages [18] . Thereby, hypovitaminosis D has been proposed as an increased susceptibility factor for respiratory and systemic infections, although definitive clinical evidence is lacking [19, 20] .",

Moreover, although several clinical trials are ongoing, preliminary but contrasting evidence is emerging concerning the usefulness of vitamin D supplementation on the clinics of COVID-19 patients [2] . Serum 25-(OH)D (D3 and D2) is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status [22, 23] although definitive reference ranges for 25-(OH)D are still object of discussion [2] and different national institutions and scientific societies defined different reference ranges.

This is of particular relevance since, as well known, the endogenous biosynthesis of vitamin D is triggered in the skin by ultraviolet (UV) B radiation. However, as we recently demonstrated on a large mid-latitude north Italian cohort of 30,400 subjects over 13 years, UV exposure alone is not sufficient to explain the vitamin D status of the population and several other factors, including lifestyle habits and personal characteristics, are important variables [27] . Only a few studies have investigated the association between UVB exposure, 25-(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection fate. However, all these investigations have been performed considering the first pandemic wave and consequently, since temporarily limited (more or less correspondent to the \"vitamin D winter\") to a specific period of the year, cannot be definitively exhaustive in terms of association with vitamin D potential. Furthermore, the strict lockdown and the consequent home-confinement and possibly the further limitation of sun exposure may have had a relevant effect on vitamin D biosynthesis.",

During the second Italian COVID-19 wave, approximately framed between 1 October and 30 November, 89,666 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (33,641 positives and 56,025 negatives) were performed, of which 1373 (188 positives and 1185 negatives) were associated with at least one 25-(OH)D measurement between 1 June 2020 and 30 November 2020 (Table 2) . During this period, 27,684 25-(OH)D measurements were performed in the same hospital. Although information about the origin of vitamin D requests were not available, only 5% were from hospitalized patients. We might assume that the remaining 95%, from outpatients, were mainly associated to routine vitamin D monitor requests. Furthermore, information about patients' vitamin D supplementation were also lacking. In contrast to the first wave, according to the Fisher's test, no significant differences were observed in the male/female distribution for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative groups. Table 2 ).

No statistically significant differences were observed between the negative and positive groups with the exception of females older than 65 years of age where the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals had vitamin D levels significantly lower (p-value < 0.001) than those recorded in the negative group. In contrast, when the negative and positive groups were compared to the averaged vitamin D concentration of the general population, their levels were statistically different, with the only exception of SARS-CoV-2 + males younger than 46 years (p-value 0.6174), SARS-CoV-2 \u2212 females younger than 46 years (p-value 0.0818) and SARS-CoV-2 + females aged 46-65 (p-value 0.4451). All the individuals older than 65 years of age, with either a negative or positive swab test, had f25-(OH)D concentrations significantly lower than the general population. Table 3 also shows that, in the general population, the averaged 25-(OH)D levels were very similar and below the sufficiency level of 30 ng/mL for males (any age) and younger females (< 46 years) whereas, despite the recent passage through warm season, only females older than 46 have, on average, sufficient 25-(OH)D concentrations.",

In general, the few published studies indicate the existence of a fair but significant association between the diseases outbreak and latitude, although they are limited to the first few months of the pandemic [30, 31] . A more updated analysis has shown a possible correlation between COVID-19 cases every million of inhabitants and 25-(OH)D levels, but not with COVID-19-related death rates [2] . Rhodes and colleagues studied the situation in 117 countries with a population above one million and recorded more than 150 COVID-19 cases. The analysis has identified a threshold at 28 \u2022 north (the latitude of the capital city was considered). After adjustment for age, the authors estimated a mortality rate increase of 13.7% (95% CI 7.4%-20.3%) for each 1% increase in % \u2265 65 years of age, which was highly significant. Furthermore, while population density was not significantly associated with mortality, the authors found a significant association with latitude with an estimated 4.4% (95% CI 0.4%-8.5%) increase in mortality for each 1 \u2022 further north [32] . This study supports the findings about the link between latitude and COVID-19 mortality reported within the USA [33] . Similarly, Moozhipurath et al. [34] identified a negative association between UV intensity (UVI) and COVID-19 deaths. A fixed-effect log-linear regression model applied to data from 152 countries over 108 days found that a permanent unit increase in UVI associates with 1.2% decline in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths and 1.0% decline in the case-fatality rate (CFR) daily growth. Thereby, a 12% reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths and 38% reduction for CFR was described [34] . These findings were confirmed by Tang et al. who indicated that the average percent positive of four common coronaviruses (CoVHKU1, CoVNL63, CoVOC43, and CoV229E) and SARS-CoV-2, in a month, based on US geographical distribution along the latitude, negatively correlated with sunlight UV radiation dose [35] . During the period 1 January-30 August, no significant differences in UVDVC were found between 2019 and 2020. In particular, since the effects of UV radiation on 25-(OH)D levels are typically observed after two months [27] , any impact of the pandemic-related lockdown took place approximately between May and July 2020, as the UVDVC profiles overlap ( Figure 1 ). However, when vitamin D status is considered, it becomes evident that in such a period, the 25-(OH)D concentrations were significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019. This effect is more evident when considering females and older individuals, whereas it is almost absent in the male group aged 21-45 ( Figure 2 ). Although speculative, it is possible to hypothesize that, during the lockdown period, in order to limit the negative effects of confinement, a general suggestion to supplementation with vitamin D was given by a physician to the elderly. The marked drop in 25-(OH)D concentrations observed between March and April 2020, was likely a consequence of the strict directives imposing the priority for clinical examination (as well as admission to emergency room) to those patients with pronounced acute respiratory syndrome symptoms. Consequently, during the lockdown period of the first pandemic wave, only admitted sick patients were tested for vitamin D because they were most likely to be in a hypovitaminosis D status. This matches with the existing evidence about the associations between vitamin D status and the susceptibility and severity of respiratory tract infections [19, 20] . The drop in 25-(OH)D was mainly due to measurements from elderly females (e.g., those admitted to the hospital) which, in contrast, experienced higher vitamin D levels during both the pre-and post-lockdown timeframes. This latter aspect is likely related to the common vitamin D supplementation, in this age group, for osteoporosis prevention (Figure 3 ). As a further confirmation of this hypothesis, the first wave lockdown corresponds to the period in which vitamin D values are lacking among the young subjects (0-20 years), as reported in Figures 2 and 3 , who were only marginally involved in the epidemic [36] .",

In contrast, both the first and second waves showed that the averaged 25-(OH)D levels of those RT-PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly lower than those of the general population. Such data suggest that adequate vitamin D levels have a protective effect against both SARS-CoV-2 (positive group) and general respiratory tract infections (negative group). However, a generalization linking the amount of UVR (latitude) and the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases might not be appropriate. It is well known that because of the current lifestyle (people spend little time outdoor and current dress codes imply covering the majority of the skin, even in the warm season) the UVR only partially influence 25-(OH)D levels [23, 27] . In addition to the reliability and the ease of retrieval of UVR data from the public database, this method would be not the most appropriate one. On the contrary, the use of a dosimeter would have given a more accurate measurement of UV exposure. Furthermore, in a pandemic scenario, infections are largely influenced by a country's population density as well as the local lockdown strategies which might differ from country to country [37] . Based on the updated data (Supplementary Table S1 ), the association between SARS-CoV-2 infected people and 25-(OH)D concentrations in different countries is not statistically significant (p-value 0.4557), as well as for the association between COVID-19-related deaths and 25-(OH)D (p-value 0.3782).",
