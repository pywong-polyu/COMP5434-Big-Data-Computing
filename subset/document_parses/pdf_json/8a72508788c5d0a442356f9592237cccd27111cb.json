            "text": "Hemodialysis (HD) is the most common renal replacement therapy for patients with endstage renal disease (ESRD) and can significantly reduce mortality and improve the quality of life of patients. The occurrence of intradialytic hypotension and intradialytic hypertension are important risk factors for death and disability during dialysis in patients with ESRD, yet their etiology remains unclear, and some studies suggest that nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play an important role in these hemodynamic alterations. For this purpose we examined the changes in NO and ET-1 levels during hemodialysis in 30 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) after arteriovenous fistula surgery. Thirty dialysis patients were divided into group I (stable blood pressure during dialysis), group II (Intradialytic hypotension) and group III (Intradialytic hypertension) according to the change of blood pressure (BP) during hemodialysis, with 10 cases in each group. BP of MHD patients were measured Predialysis (Pre-D), at 1 h of dialysis (1h-D), at 2 h of dialysis (Mid-D, 2h-D), at 3 h of dialysis (3h-D), and at the end of dialysis (Post-D); and blood samples were taken from the arterial end at Pre-D, Mid-D, and Post-D to measure NO and ET-1 levels. The results of the analysis showed that as dialysis proceeded and ended, the NO levels in the three groups gradually decreased, with significant differences compared with those before dialysis ( p < 0.05); the ET-1 levels in group III gradually increased, with significant differences compared with those before dialysis ( p < 0.05), while the increasing trend of ET-1 levels in group I and group II was not significant. The increasing trend of MAP in group I was not significant ( p > 0.05); MAP in group II showed a gradual decrease and MAP in group III showed an increasing trend, and the difference between MAP after dialysis and before dialysis was significant ( p < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between ET-1 levels and MAP in Group III at Mid-D (r = 0.847, p = 0.002). This shows that serum ET-1 and NO levels are significantly higher than normal in MHD patients after arteriovenous endovascular fistula surgery, and both ET-1 and NO levels are changing during dialysis, and there may be a link between their changes and blood pressure changes.",

In recent years, the composition ratio of dialysis complications has changed with the advancement of HD technology, including the improvement of dialysis machines, the improvement of dialysis water quality, the application of dialyzers with good membrane biocompatibility, etc. (3, 4) . However, acute hemodynamic changes during dialysis are still common, mainly in the form of intradialytic hypotension and intradialytic hypertension (5, 6) . Poor BP (BP) control is a common complication in patients with ESRD-HD and an independent risk factor for patient prognosis. Unlike the control of BP in general patients, HD patients need to control BP not only during HD but also during the fluctuation of BP during HD. However, some studies (6, 7) have shown that intra-dialysis hypotension and intra-dialysis hypertension caused by fluctuations in BP during dialysis can increase the incidence of cardiovascular time and mortality in HD patients. Therefore, the pathogenesis of hypotension and hypertension during HD, if fully understood and effectively controlled, may have a significant impact on the long-term survival and quality of life of HD patients.",

            "text": "It is now believed that vascular endothelial injury is an important pathophysiological basis for cardiovascular disease, and in chronic kidney disease, endothelial dysfunction is often seen in the early stages of disease development, with patients commonly having abnormal endothelial function (19) . Studies (20) (21) (22) have shown that vascular endothelial function is closely related to the dynamic levels of NO and ET-1, where ET-1 acts on ETA receptors in smooth muscle cells to promote calcium ion release and enhance extracellular calcium ion inward flow, resulting in strong vasoconstriction, which leads to an increase in SVR. NO is an important vasodilator with the opposite effect of ET-1, which is widely distributed in the body and can modulate vascular tone, inhibit platelet monthly endothelial adhesion and thrombosis to prevent vascular endothelial disorders and atherosclerosis (23, 24) . In this study, serum NO and ET-1 levels were found to be significantly higher than normal in patients with MHD, which is consistent with many literature reports (25) (26) (27) . Meanwhile, this study found that serum NO levels in all three groups showed a gradual decrease during dialysis, and there were statistical differences between the three groups before and after dialysis when comparing serum NO levels themselves. The consideration may be related to the smaller molecular weight and stronger dispersion properties of NO, which is gradually removed by dialysis during the dialysis process and the amount removed increases with time, etc. However, we also found no statistical difference in NO levels in group II dialysis compared with the post-dialysis group, while the other two groups were statistically different, suggesting that the occurrence of hypotension in dialysis may still be related to NO levels. The effect of NO is not only to achieve peripheral vasodilation, but also to inhibit sympathetic nerve endings, to inhibit the release of catecholamines, and to inhibit their biological activity, which can inhibit autonomic function and can act synergistically with prostaglandins to cause a drop in blood pressure in patients on dialysis (28, 29) . However, this study did not find any significant correlation between changes in NO levels before and after dialysis and changes in MAP, considering that the reason is mainly that NO, as a small molecule, can be removed by hemodialysis. In addition, this study also found that the changes in serum ET-1 levels at Pre-D and Post-D in group I and group II were not significant, but the ET-1 levels in group III were significantly higher at Mid-D than Pre-D and were still higher than the Pre-D levels at Post-D (p < 0.05), showing the same change trend as their MAP changes. The correlation analysis of MAP and ET-1 in dialysis showed a significant correlation (p < 0.05), which suggests that serum ET-1 levels may be associated with the development of hypertension in dialysis.",
