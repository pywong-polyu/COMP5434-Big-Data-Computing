            "text": "The newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro is essential for the rapid replication of the virus. Inhibiting this protease may open an alternative avenue toward therapeutic intervention. In this work, a computational docking approach was developed to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Totally 288 potential hits were identified from a half-million bioactive chemicals via a protein-ligand docking protocol. To further evaluate the docking results, a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of 3CLpro inhibitors was developed based on existing small molecule inhibitors of the 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 and their corresponding IC 50 data. The QSAR model assesses the physicochemical properties of identified compounds and estimates their inhibitory effects on 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 . Seventy-one potential inhibitors of 3CLpro were selected through these computational approaches and further evaluated via an enzyme activity assay. The results show that two chemicals, i.e., 5-((1-([1,1 -biphenyl]-4-yl)-2,5dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methylene)pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione and N-(4-((3-(4chlorophenylsulfonamido)quinoxalin-2-yl)amino)phenyl)acetamide, effectively inhibited 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50 's of 19 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M and 38 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M, respectively. The compounds contain two basic structures, pyrimidinetrione and quinoxaline, which were newly found in 3CLpro inhibitor structures and are of high interest for lead optimization. The findings from this work, such as 3CLpro inhibitor candidates and the QSAR model, will be helpful to accelerate the discovery of inhibitors for related coronaviruses that may carry proteases with similar structures to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.",

We must therefore in parallel develop therapeutic drugs for those infected with coronavirus. Furthermore, we have observed SARS-COV-2 variants spread (CDC, 2021a) . Though so far there is no indication that known mutations will prevent vaccines from being effective, it remains a possibility. Exploring effective anti-COVID-19 agents, that might also be useful for future coronavirus variants, is valuable. The structure of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease, 3CLpro, is highly conserved across coronavirus variants (Abian et al., 2020) . Identifying therapeutic agents to inhibit 3CLpro might then be useful for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and these agents will remain valuable for the treatment of infections caused by mutated SARS-CoV-2 in the future (Anand et al., 2003; Klemm et al., 2020) . Thus, it is crucial that we continue to develop new anti-viral therapies, and in silico screening and experiment validation can be an important first step in this process.",

However, the efficacies of those tried so far are not as high as expected. For example, although Remdesivir, which was approved for Ebola virus, was able to shorten the recovery time and decrease the mortality rate of COVID-19 (Beigel et al., 2020) , various side effects were reported (Grein et al., 2020) . Another anti-COVID-19 clinical study was based upon a combination of the HIV 3CLpro inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the 3-Chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro) associated with HIV, is not a particularly potent therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2. The concentration necessary to inhibit viral replication is relatively high as compared with the serum levels found in patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. It is thus not surprising to find that no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment when compared to the standard care protocol (Li and De Clercq, 2020) . Therefore, effective anti-COVID-19 agents still need to be developed.",

The SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lower respiratory system and the gastrointestinal system . Before entering host cells, the spike (S) protein on coronavirus binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface (Perlman and Netland, 2009 ). After the viral RNA enters the host cell, the replication of viral RNA occurs in double membrane vesicles (DMV) (Stertz et al., 2007; Perlman and Netland, 2009) . The 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is essential for viral replication. 3CLpro cleaves the transcript polyprotein, releasing both itself and other functional proteins (Anand et al., 2003; Ratia et al., 2008) . Inhibitors of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 have been extensively studied . This motivates us to make use of existing inhibitors of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 to accelerate the identification of effective inhibitors of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19.",

Its monomeric subunit is irreversibly inactivated, as its catalytic machinery is frozen in the collapsed state, characterized by the formation of a short 3 10 -helix from an active-site loop (Shi et al., 2008) . Inhibiting dimerization of the 3CLpro monomer is thus one way to inhibit 3CLpro. However, dimerization inhibitors typically target the dimerization interface and thus compete with the attractive forces between subunits (Barrila et al., 2006) . A previous study suggested covalent inhibitors of 3CLpro targeting the nucleophilic cysteine 145 in the active site eliminated the enzyme activity (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . Additionally, a cluster of serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) was identified near the active site cavity and was susceptible to being targeted by compounds containing boronic acid compounds, which are particularly effective inhibitors, with K i 's as strong as 40 nM (Bacha et al., 2004) . Targeting the active site is thus preferred for 3CLpro inhibition.",

Many peptide inhibitors were designed to mimic natural viral polypeptides and covalently bind to the active site Cys 145 . Despite their potent inhibition of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 and relatively long half-life in buffer at neutral pH values, these peptide inhibitors are likely to be problematic, because of their high propensity to be rapidly hydrolyzed by lipases, esterases, and other enzymes in mammalian cells. Moreover, these compounds can potentially react nonspecifically with other thiols or nucleophiles in mammalian cells, thereby leading to toxicity (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . The other category of 3CLpro inhibitors includes noncovalent or reversible covalent inhibitors, which have advantages regarding side effects and toxicity. These inhibitors were discovered by high throughput screening of synthetic compounds and natural products, such as etacrynic acid derivatives, isatins, flavonoid derivatives, terpenoids, active heterocyclic ester analogs, pyrazolones and pyrimidines Turlington et al., 2013; .",

            "text": "On the basis of the aforementioned 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors and IC 50 data, we implemented a protein-ligand docking approach (refer to Zhang F. et al., 2020 as an example) to identify potential 3CLpro inhibitors and then developed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to narrow down candidates (i.e., with low IC 50 ) for 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 . A three-dimensional QSAR model attempts to correlate 3D molecular structure to biological activity, often using a variety of molecular descriptors such as physicochemical, topological, electronic and steric properties (Nantasenamat et al., 2009 ). In particular, 3D Atomic Property Fields (APF) QSAR methods developed by ICM calculate physico-chemical properties of superimposed chemicals and utilize their halfinhibition data to weight contributions for each property through Partial-Least-Squares (PLS) regression modeling (Totrov, 2008) . Such a QSAR model allows for the quantitative prediction of pharmacological activities of congeneric unknown compounds so that it can be used to direct the design of novel derivatives with enhanced activity (Totrov, 2008) . While hundreds of compounds were screened by their binding affinity to the 3CLpro through automated molecular docking (Sirois et al., 2004; Achilonu et al., 2020) , the resulting docking scores had a limited ability to accurately predict inhibitor efficacy (Kitchen et al., 2004) . It is thus necessary to further implement the 3D QSAR model to evaluate physicochemical properties and potential inhibitory effectiveness of those compounds identified through the molecular docking. In particular, the 3D QSAR model is able to predict IC 50 's of those compounds with high-binding scores. The inhibitors with good predicted IC 50 values are good candidates for further experimental validation. One hypothesis underlying our work is that the 3D QSAR model that links the structures of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors to IC 50 values can be applied to identify inhibitors of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 . The rationale behind this hypothesis is that the crystal structure of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 and the active pockets are conserved between these two 3CL proteases . Furthermore, some aldehyde and \u03b1-ketoamide compounds serve as broad-spectrum inhibitors of 3CLpro from both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 .",

The structure 6LU7 was first converted into the format used in ICM and then modified by removing ligand, deleting water, and adding hydrogens. The following residues were further optimized: three protonation states and two rotations of all histidine (His) residues and 180degree flip of asparagine (Asn) and glutamine(Gln) residues were tried to minimize the global energy. Particularly, both His41 and His163 at the active site were in N\u03b41-protonated \u03c0 tautomer state.

The docking conformation gave an RMSD of 0.6 \u00c5 relative to the original, but it does not contain a covalent bond with Cys145 (Supplementary Figure 2) . Such a non-covalent docking mode could mimic the N3 inhibitor binding at the active site prior to the covalent reaction. Therefore, the docking score is meaningful as a threshold for virtual screening. In terms of the chemical libraries to screen, FDA approved drugs (2,305 compounds) (Patridge et al., 2016) provided the first set, while additional compounds came from InterBioScreen's high-quality compound database (>550,000 compounds) for drug screening (Roy et al., 2015) . The InterBioScreen database was preferred in this work as it has been widely implemented for repurposing, high-throughput screening, and hit identification. Compounds were first filtered by \"Lipinski's rules of five\" (Lipinski et al., 1997) and around 0.45 million compounds were maintained and docked into the structure 6LU7. The virtual screening was conducted using scoring function 2005 and docking effort 1. Docked compounds with scores lower than those of ligand 6LU7 (\u221229.02 kcal/mol) were retained. We validated docking conformation for each potential hit by redocking it into a second structure 7L0D and evaluated the RMSD values (Supplementary Figure 3) . The ICM score was calculated as a binding free energy ( G) that is composed of the hydrogen bond energy, hydrophobic energy in exposing a surface to water, van der Waals interaction energy, internal conformational energy of the ligand, desolvation of exposed h-bond donors and acceptors, solvation electrostatics energy change upon binding, loss of entropy, and the potential of mean force score (Neves et al., 2012) . Additionally, LogP, log of the octanol/water ratio, was calculated by ICM to allow evaluation of the water solubility and bioavailability of each drug.",

Docking scores were used to estimate ligand binding affinity for 3CLpro, and the results are shown in Supplementary Table 3 . Potential inhibitors were defined as those that were predicted to bind more tightly (lower scores) than the crystallographic ligands. G (binding to 6LU7) of the predicted strong binders ranged from \u221241.3 to \u221230 kcal/mol, with a cutoff of \u221229.02 kcal/mol. The lower docking scores indicated relatively higher binding affinity and stronger ligand-receptor interaction. The compounds were all predicted to be bound within the active site of 3CLpro in a position similar to the crystallographic ligands. After the first run of virtual screening was finished, more 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 structures, including structures with non-covalent binders (e.g., 7L0D), became available. Although structures 6LU7 and 7L0D are identical in sequence and similar in secondary structure, some residues around the active site are not identical in conformation. These residues, e.g., T25, M49, M165, and P168, may slightly change the docking grid. Therefore, we redocked the hits identified on the basis of structure 6LU7 into structure 7L0D to further validate the ligand conformations. It turned out that compounds showed similar docking conformations (RMSD < 2\u00c5) between the two structures. The results are provided in Supplementary Table 3 . This agreement between the structures indicates that the presented approach should be applicable to other 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 structures. The training dataset for the QSAR model (35 known 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors) had a good quality fit (R 2 = 0.8967) (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 3) , while the testing dataset suggested the predicted IC 50 was still correlated to the actual IC 50 (R 2 = 0.7257) for 30 additional known inhibitors that hadn't been used in training (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 3 ). The QSAR model generated using these 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors was then used to evaluate the IC 50 of potential 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The 288 identified hits were input into the developed QASR model to estimate half-inhibition values. The predicted IC 50 for each compound were ranged from 0.35 to 46.7 \u00b5M. The top 71 compounds with predicted IC 50 's ranging from 0.35 to 19.86 \u00b5M (Supplementary Table 3) , were selected for further evaluation in an enzyme activity assay.",

For this purpose, in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) enzymatic assays were conducted in the presence of 10 nM enzyme and 100 \u00b5M of each inhibitor. 33 compounds were not soluble in water (5% DMSO, room temperature) at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. There were 29 additional soluble compounds that showed no inhibition. Nine small-molecule compounds were found to have an inhibitory effect in the enzyme activity assay (Supplementary Table 2 ). Compounds listed in Table 1 , 5-((1-([1,1 -biphenyl]-4-yl)-2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methylene)pyrimidine-2,4,6 (1H,3H,5H)-trione (abbreviated as PMPT), and N-(4-((3-(4-chlorophenylsulfonamido)quinoxalin-2-yl) amino) phenyl)acetamide (abbreviated as CPSQPA), which were among the highest scoring soluble compounds in the QSAR screen, appeared to have the highest inhibition potential in the preliminary screen. PMPT and CPSQPA at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M reduced the activities of 3CLpro to 21 and 11%, respectively. 100 \u00b5M Pentagastrin, an FDA approved drug, reduced 3CLpro's activity to 31% (Supplementary Table 2) . GC376, a known covalent 3CLpro inhibitor with its IC 50 as 0.15 \u00b5M (Fu et al., 2020) , suppressed initial activity to 5% (Supplementary Table 2 ). We therefore proceeded to measure the IC 50 for CPSQPA and PMPT. Enzyme activities in the presence of the two compounds (concentration gradients from 200 to 6.25 \u00b5M) were plotted in Figures 3A,B and listed in Supplementary Table 1 , and IC 50 curves are shown in Figures 3C,D. The IC 50 of PMPT was determined to be 19 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M by nonlinear regression of the rate of enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration (R 2 = 0.97). The IC 50 of CPSQPA was 38 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M as calculated by same fitting method (R 2 = 0.99).",

Although docking scores, to some degree, evaluate the binding affinity of the compound to the docking target, imperfections of scoring functions continue to be a major limiting factor impacting the accuracy of the docking prediction (Kitchen et al., 2004) . To effectively identify novel 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, an integrated docking-based virtual screening and QSAR method was conducted in this work. ICM scores of the identified 288 compounds indicated that they might bind at the active site of 3CLpro with high affinity. The docking scores for the structure 6LU7 were used to narrow down the candidates for the next step in which IC 50 values of the selected candidates were predicted by a QSAR model. In particular, the developed QSAR model gave a quantitative ligand-based virtual screening approach to further evaluate the physico-chemical properties of compounds and estimate their IC 50 values on the basis of the data for the known inhibitors for 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 to narrow down the number of compounds for testing. Indeed, nine compounds showed an inhibitory effect among the 71 candidates tested, with a success rate of 12.7%. The two inhibitors found in this work, i.e., PMPT and CPSQPA, were ranked as top candidates in the virtual screen with insoluble compounds removed from the list. The two small-molecules compounds found in this work (i.e., PMPT and CPSQPA) were shown to inhibit the activity of the 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50 values of 19 and 38 \u00b5M in the experimental verification section. Most coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors have molecular weights in the range of 300-500 g/mol and IC 50 's in the range of nM to mM . The molecular weights of the two identified inhibitors were in a similar range with relatively low IC 50 values. The two newly discovered 3CLpro inhibitors noncovalently bind with the amino acid residues in the S1, S2, and S4 pockets, particularly in catalytically active Cys145 in the S1 pocket. Additionally, the non-covalent inhibitors are mainly advanced in having weak reversible binding, which could result in avoidance of the off-target risk and toxicity of irreversible inhibitors. These noncovalent inhibitors might be suitable for long-term administration . Since no toxicity study has been conducted on either of these compounds, future work could test the toxicity of PMPT and CPSQPA.

Amino acid residues interacting with the ligands are labeled. Surface of the protein is displayed and colored in gray (B,D). Hydrogen bonds between PMPT and 3CLpro are shown as black lines (A). As CPSQPA likely has a net charge of -1 (sulfonamide pK a 's generally are in the range of 5.0-7.0), the anionic form was docked into the protein (C,D).

Quinoxalin is a newly found functional group that has not been reported in other known 3CLpro inhibitors. Many quinoline derivatives were tested for their inhibitory effect previously, but the IC 50 values were generally more than 100 \u00b5M . Quinxalin would be an alternative basic structure to further design 3CLpro inhibitors. Furthermore, the sulfonamide of CPSQPA appears in some known 3CLpro inhibitors, including 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives that inhibited 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 in the low micromolar range (Liu et al., 2014) . Therefore, pyrimidinetrione and quinoxalin derivatives would be good starting points to find additional 3CLpro inhibitors. These two identified inhibitors have similar features to known inhibitors, and at the same time they provide new basic chemical structures for the further lead optimization.",

            "text": "In order to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, an integrated computational and experimental approach was developed in this work to identify potential compounds that inhibit 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 . 288 potential inhibitors of the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 were identified through virtual screening of half a million compounds from existing databases. Inhibitory activities of the compounds were predicted from a QSAR model developed from existing data for the inhibitors of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-1 . Among these potential inhibitors, 71 compounds were further selected for validation via an enzyme activity assay, and 9 compounds showed certain inhibition of 3CLpro. Among these compounds, PMPT and CPSQPA were confirmed by experiments to effectively inhibit the activity of 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 , with IC 50 values of 19 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M and 38 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M, respectively. The functional groups pyrimidinetrione and quinoxaline were newly found in 3CLpro inhibitors, thus they are of high interest for lead optimization. In future studies, cellular infection and animal testing could be conducted to validate the efficacy and safety of the two newly identified compounds.",
