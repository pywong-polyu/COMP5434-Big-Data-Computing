Low fucosylation levels on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein-specific IgG1 has been described as a hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may lead to activation of macrophages via immune complexes thereby promoting inflammatory responses, altogether suggesting involvement of IgG1 Fc glycosylation modulated immune mechanisms in COVID-19.",

            "text": "The current global coronavirus disease pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been leading to extensive hospitalizations worldwide. 1 To date, more than 253 million infections and more than 5 million deaths have been reported. 2 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and its uptake by target cells in the respiratory tract is mediated by the spike glycoprotein. 1 Interestingly, most infected people clear the virus with mild symptoms, whilst around 20% of the adult cases are characterized by severe, sometimes life-threatening conditions. 3 Approximately 7-10 days after symptom onset, seroconversion occurs with immunoglobulin M (IgM) and A (IgA), and G (IgG) antibodies against the spike protein. 4 These antibodies can form immune complexes with viral particles and thereby neutralize the virus and mediate clearance, but are also capable of aggravating the disease. 5\u00c07 IgG exerts effector functions via the activation of complement or fragment crystallizable (Fc) gamma receptors (FcgR) on immune cells. 8 Various effector functions of IgG are steered by the N-glycan moiety attached to the highly conserved N297 glycosylation sites within both C H 2 domains of the Fc tail. 9,10 Specifically, afucosylated IgG1 shows increased affinity to the activating FcgRIIIa receptor, hence leading to enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). 10, 11 Galactosylated IgG1 shows increased hexamerization, C1q binding and complement activation. 12 Recent reports have indicated that the high interindividual variability in COVID-19 disease severity 3 may partly be explained by low Fc fucosylation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific (anti-S) IgG1. The lack of core fucose on these specific antibodies early on during disease points to their potential proinflammatory role in severe illness. 6, 13, 14 Literature suggests, that in particular membrane-embedded foreign antigens, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, induce low fucosylated IgG1 responses, which in combination with high titers may lead to excessive macrophage activation and drive COVID-19 associated pathology including acute respiratory distress syndrome. 6, 13 Here, we study the dynamics of IgG1 Fc glycosylation and its association with clinical parameters in a longitudinal cohort of 159 hospitalized COVID-19 patients that were either admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or not (non-ICU), analyzing a total of 1300 longitudinal patient samples. We report on the association of early anti-S IgG1 glycosylation signatures with disease severity and various inflammatory markers.",

Studies have hitherto focused on afucosylation, a modification on immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc-tail-linked N-glycans that enhances effector functions. Most of these studies featured limited sample numbers or were imperfectly matched with respect to demographic and other important confounding factors. Our lab has contributed to some of these studies, and we additionally searched for research articles on PubMed and Google Scholar from January 2020 to October 2021. To date, only two groups studied anti-S IgG1 glycosylation, which resulted in overall three publications found. However, none of these groups found a severity marker between hospitalized non-ICU and ICU patients or studied dynamic changes. Instead, exclusively fucosylation at the first available timepoint has been associated with disease severity between severely ill inpatients and mild outpatients.",

Our study reveals low galactosylation and sialylation as well as high bisection on anti-S IgG1 as early hallmarks of severe COVID-19, after correction for known confounders of glycosylation. In line with these observations, anti-S IgG1 glycosylation correlated with many inflammatory markers. As days since onset is one of the major confounders of anti-S IgG1 glycosylation due to its highly dynamic nature, we additionally confirmed our findings in time-matched patient subgroups. We believe anti-S IgG1 glycosylation, in combination with other inflammatory markers conveys early severity marker potential in hospitalized patients in this study.",

Recombinant trimerized S protein was prepared as described. 15 Study cohort BEAT-COVID-19 is a prospective, observational single center cohort study established at Leiden University Medical Center, with longitudinal plasma samples of 159 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients that were collected during the first and second wave of the pandemic (between May 2020 and October 2020) (Tables 1 and S1, Figure S1 ). After informed consent was obtained from the patient or his/her relatives, longitudinal sampling was performed for the duration of the hospital admission, and one convalescent sample was obtained at the outpatient follow-up appointment, which was scheduled six weeks after hospital discharge. None of the patients had received a COVID-19 vaccine, nor had they used hydroxychloroquine. Patients were hospitalized when their peripheral oxygen saturation was below 92% and they were consequently in need of extra oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask. Patients were discharged when they were not in need of oxygen supplementation anymore and capable of taking care of themselves, irrespective of a potential PCR result. The convalescent sample was 6 weeks after discharge, but not necessarily 6 weeks after a negative PCR. Statistical sample size calculation was not performed, the sample size was determined based on availability. The Medical Ethics Committee Leiden-Den Haag-Delft (NL73740.058.20) approved the study. The trial was registered in the Dutch Trial Registry (NL8589). The study complied with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Structurally similar glycopeptide species were used for the calculation of derived traits fucosylation, bisection, galactosylation and sialylation (Table S4) . Anti-S and total IgG1 glycosylation traits were compared using a Wilcoxon signedrank test (Figure 1 , Table S5 ), while a Wilcoxon ranksum test was used to compare non-ICU and ICU patients as well as severity score and other groups (Figures. 3, 5, S3, S7, S8, S10\u00c013; Tables S6, S7, S9). To account for multiple testing, p-values of the Wilcoxontests have been corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to 5% FDR in each statistical question (Tables  S5\u00c07, S9 ). Both anti-S and total IgG1 galactosylation were found to be confounded by age and sex ( Figure S2 ) in line with literature on IgG Fc glycosylation. 26 Therefore, delta (D) values were calculated by subtracting total from anti-S IgG1 levels to eliminate the confounding effect, which we believe was a sensible way of limiting the influence of possible other confounders as well (Figs. S2, S3, S12, S13, Table S9 ). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were first assessed using all Dglycosylation traits with a significant difference between the ICU and non-ICU groups at time of hospitalization ( Figure 4 ). As only Dgalactosylation was found as a significant predictor of ICU admission, we decided not to show the composite model, but the individual ROC curves. The model was trained on a random selection of 70% of the patients' samples, with the prediction being validated on the remaining 30% of the patients' samples. Spearman's correlation was used to explore associations between Dglycosylation traits and age, and Dglycosylation traits and ICU admission and severity (Figs. S2, S8, S11), as well as between Dglycosylation traits and inflammatory markers and titers ( Figure 6 , Table S8 ). To assess method repeatability, the inter-plate variation for the 14 analytes included in the final analysis was calculated for the standards, which was 2\u00a24%.

Anti-S glycosylation was found to be highly dynamic, but also total IgG1 glycosylation showed changes in the course of the disease ( Figure S6 ). The longitudinal samples allowed us to establish the time course of DIgG1 glycosylation during hospitalization, normalized for day of onset of symptoms ( Figure 2 , Table S1 ). The D values were calculated by subtracting total from anti-S IgG1 levels, representing the skewing of anti-S as compared to total IgG1, and used hereafter. Interestingly, all glycosylation traits showed a transient pattern for most patients, and were characterized by profound dynamics, as illustrated by the timelines of individual patients (as indicated by differential line coloring) and by the fit cubic polynomial line ( Figure 2 ). Fucosylation ( Figure 2a) and bisection (Figure 2c ) showed a rapid increase within days and weeks after onset of the disease, followed by a plateau and approximation of the glycosylation patterns of total IgG1 ( Figure S6 ). In contrast, galactosylation ( Figure 2b ) and sialylation (Figure 2d ) quickly declined in the first days and weeks, with the decrease continuing for a long period albeit at lower pace. At the moment of hospital discharge anti-S galactosylation and sialylation were still slightly higher than total IgG1. Since 19 convalescent patients returned for follow-up sampling after hospital discharge, we noted that for most, fucosylation and bisection largely remained constant or slightly increased, whilst galactosylation and sialylation continued to decrease since the last available timepoint ( Figure S5 ).",

This resulted in two groups: (1) patients who at some point during hospitalization were admitted to the ICU, and (2) patients who were not enrolled to ICU treatment at all (non-ICU) during hospitalization. DIgG1 glycosylation derived traits fucosylation, bisection, galactosylation and sialylation of the above groups were compared both at time of hospitalization and at the time point of their highest disease severity ( Figure 3 , Table S6 ). DIgG1 Fc glycosylation of ICU patients showed a different profile from those of non-ICU patients, with the latter being characterized by lower bisection (FC: 0\u00a266, p-value: 7\u00a22 \u00a3 10 \u00c08 ) (Figure 3c) , and higher galactosylation (FC: 0\u00a239, p-value: 2\u00a29 \u00a3 10 \u00c09 ) (Figure 3b ) and sialylation (FC: 0\u00a246, p-value: 1\u00a27 \u00a3 10 \u00c07 ) (Figure 3d ) at the time of hospitalization. This difference was maintained or even more pronounced at the time of highest disease severity (FC: 0\u00a261, 0\u00a226, 0\u00a234; p-value: 1\u00a29 \u00a3 10 \u00c010 , 4\u00a21 \u00a3 10 \u00c012 , 3\u00a24 \u00a3 10 \u00c09 ), for Dbisection, Dgalactosylation and Dsialylation, respectively (Table S6) . DFucosylation levels of the ICU group were higher at the time of highest disease severity (FC 0\u00a262; p-value: 0\u00a2012), but were similar at the time of hospital admission (Figure 3a) . The observed differences in Dgalactosylation and Dsialylation were reflected in changes of anti-S IgG1 glycosylation, while changes in Dbisection were largely attributed to alterations of total IgG1 levels ( Figure S7 ). To confirm that the observed effects were not confounded by vast glycosylation dynamics, a subset of non-ICU and ICU patients were created and compared, which resulted in comparable observations with regards to Dbisection, Dgalactosylation and Dsialylation as shown above (Figs. S8 and S9).",

Although several studies reported on the importance of (anti-S) IgG1 Fc glycosylation and its association with disease severity in COVID-19, 27 this study involves a large, single center cohort that confirms specific anti-S IgG1 glycosylation features as an early hallmark of severe COVID-19 in an Afucosylated IgG1 B cell responses have recently been described to characterize immune reactions against membrane-embedded antigens in general, and in particular against viral infections caused by enveloped viruses such as COVID-19. 13 Foregoing studies showed that severe, hospitalized patients exhibit a decreased anti-S IgG1 fucosylation as compared to mild, non-hospitalized patients. 6, 13, 14 Accordingly, we likewise observed proinflammatory, low-fucosylation signatures on anti-S as compared to total IgG1, but found no difference in fucosylation comparing hospitalized ICU patients versus hospitalized non-ICU patients, which is in line with a previous report on anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG1 fucosylation. 14 Therefore, based on the early existence of these proinflammatory signatures in some of the patients, we hypothesize that low fucosylation \u00c0 potentially even lower before measurable seroconversion, as hypothesized before 13 \u00c0 on anti-S IgG1 may act as an early inflammatory signal that promotes the development of a more severe disease in COVID-19 patients, resulting in hospital admission. However, disease severity between hospitalized patients could not be further distinguished based on anti-S IgG1 fucosylation. Furthermore, hardly any negative associations were found between anti-S IgG1 fucosylation and inflammatory markers in this study, unlike in previous reports, where in vitro experiments demonstrated that the stimulation of isolated macrophages with recombinant, glycoengineered anti-S or patient sera-derived low-fucose IgG1 antibodies trigger higher proinflammatory cytokine release than those with normal fucose levels. 6, 13, 14 However, high proinflammatory cytokine levels are not (Table S7 ). *, **, ****: p-value < 0\u00a205, 0\u00a201, 0\u00a20001, respectively (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.). necessarily present in all severe patients, 28 and this contrasting observation suggests a different regulation and/ or the temporal resolution of fucosylation and cytokine production dynamics in vivo. Additionally, beyond or in combination with low anti-S IgG1 fucosylation a preexisting risk factor may play a role in COVID-19 disease severity, which hitherto remained unclear. 29 Of note, the anti-S and anti-RBD IgG1 Fc glycosylation data were all determined from the circulation, and it is unclear to which extent this would reflect the inflammatory pattern and glycosylation profile of anti-S antibodies in the lung. Our results demonstrate that the proinflammatory fucosylation signature that is observed at the early time points in the disease tends to fade with the course of the disease, which one may interpret as a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory Fc glycosylation profile that is maintained over time. The absence of core fucose is known to enhance a proinflammatory immune response by activating FcgRIII receptors on monocytes, macrophages and NK cells. 10 Decreased fucosylation on specific IgG1 has been described in HIV 13, 30 and dengue fever, 31 as well as in alloimmune diseases. 32\u00c036 However, whilst afucosylation of specific IgG1 plays a protective role in HIV, it clearly marks high disease severity in dengue, alloimmune diseases or COVID-19. 6, 13, 14 Furthermore, low total IgG1 fucosylation has been associated with outcome of pediatric meningococcal sepsis indicating a systemic inflammation due to the potential accumulation of airway infections during early childhood. 37 Even though the origin of low fucose IgG responses is seemingly linked to antigen context and affect mostly specific antibodies, 13 the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of antibody glycosylation remain elusive.",

            "text": "Besides afucosylation, a transient, decreased bisection was found on anti-S IgG1. Recent reports suggest that severe COVID-19 patients present low levels of bisection both on total IgG (Fc and Fab combined) 29 and anti-S IgG1 13 relative to mild cases. In contrast, no difference was found in anti-RBD IgG1 bisection between ICU and non-ICU patients in age-and sexmatched patients, 14 albeit these disease groups were largely comparable to the ones in our study. While bisection associated positively with, and was an important predictor for ICU admission, disease severity and survival in our study, it lacks functional relevance based on our current understanding and has no effect on FcgRIII or C1q binding. 10, 38 Elevated galactosylation and sialylation of anti-S IgG1 were associated with a less severe disease course upon hospitalization, and no ICU admission. Similar observations were made in a previous report, where severe COVID-19 was characterized by lower anti-S IgG1 galactosylation and sialylation than mild COVID-19. 13 Interestingly, both anti-S and total IgG1 galactosylation and sialylation decrease by advancing age. As Larsen et al. compared anti-S IgG1 galactosylation and sialylation of imperfectly age matched patient groups without age correction, the disease and age effects remained indiscernible. 13 We describe decreased anti-S IgG1 galactosylation in ICU patients as compared to non-ICU patients, and analogously, markedly lower specific IgG1 galactosylation has been shown to characterize the more severe, active phase of tuberculosis as compared to its latent counterpart. 39 Even though more and more reports support that elevated levels of galactosylated IgG are associated with the activation of the classical complement pathway 10, 12, 40 , agalactosylation was associated with increased disease severity in this study, possibly due to the fact that complement can contribute to the increased inflammation both directly, and through inducing a chemotactic response through C5a, thereby increasing cellular infiltration to inflamed tissues such as the lung. 41 Furthermore, galactosylation appeared to be another predictor for ICU admission besides bisection. Elevated sialylation levels on anti-S IgG1 were associated with low disease severity in the current report. Sialylation has been broadly described as critical in mediating anti-inflammatory activity, 42\u00c044 yet it remains to be elucidated whether sialylated IgG exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in COVID- 19 .",

Therefore, the results may to some extent be influenced by small sample size. Secondly, demographic characteristics and comorbidities, in particular age, sex, BMI and diabetes are known confounders of IgG glycosylation. Although such associations were not revealed by the performed statistical tests, these features, together with other unknown factors may led to uncertainty in study inferences. As a third limitation, while the study points to a possible link between IgG1 Fc glycosylation and disease mechanism, supporting functional and mechanistic data is missing.",
