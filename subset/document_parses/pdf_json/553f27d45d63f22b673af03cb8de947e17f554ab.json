            "text": "In the present study, one of the targets present on the envelopes of coronaviruses, membrane glycoprotein (M) was chosen for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine by Immunoinformatics approach. The B-cell and T-cell epitopes used for the construction of vaccine were antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic. An adjuvant, b-defensin and PADRE sequence were included at the N-terminal end of the vaccine. All the epitopes were joined by linkers for decreasing the junctional immunogenicity. Various physicochemical parameters of the vaccine were evaluated. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted for the vaccine construct. The tertiary structure was further refined, and various parameters related to the refinement of the protein structure were validated by using different tools. Humoral immunity induced by B-cells relies upon the identification of antigenic determinants on the surface of the vaccine construct. In this regard, the vaccine construct was found to consist of several B-cell epitopes in its three-dimensional conformation. Molecular docking of the vaccine was carried out with TLR-3 receptor to study their binding and its strength. Further, protein-protein interactions in the docked complex were visualized using LigPlot\u00fe. Population coverage analysis had shown that the multi-epitope vaccine covers 94.06% of the global population. The vaccine construct was successfully cloned in silico into pET-28a (\u00fe). Immune simulation studies showed the induction of primary, secondary and tertiary immune responses marked by the increased levels of antibodies, INF-c, IL-2, TGF-b, B-cells, CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe cells. Finally, the vaccine construct was able to elicit immune response as desired.",

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV also belongs to the same genus Betacoronavirus (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) . The genome of the SARS-CoV2 is a positive sense single stranded RNA that acts as mRNA immediately after its release into the host cell. The genome of coronavirus is approximately 20 kb-30 kb. Two-third of the genome of Coronavirus towards 5 0 -end is made up of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b that codes for the synthesis of several nonstructural proteins. ORF1a is translated and results in the synthesis of ORF1a polyprotein. However, due to ribosomal frame shifting, the ribosome continues to translate the ORF1b resulting in the synthesis of ORF1ab polyprotein. Cleavage of the mature peptide of ORF1ab gives rise to the following peptides -nsp2 to nsp4, nsp6 to nsp11, 3C-like proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, 3 0 -to 5 0 -exonuclease, endoRNAse and 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase. Remaining one-third of the genome of Coronavirus towards 3 0 -end is made up of structural proteins consisting of Surface Glycoprotein (S), Envelope (E), Membrane Glycoprotein (M) and Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) . Interspersed between these four structural genes are ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a-ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 genes (NCBI Accession MT434760) (Graham et al., 2008; Joshi et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Prasad & Prasad, 2020) .",

For the successful development of a vaccine candidate till its release into the market takes considerable amount of time as it needs to qualify in different phases in the clinical trials along with the huge investment involved. However, at times, the rate of success of the vaccine is also bleak. In such a scenario, Immunoinformatics approach is helpful in reducing the time taken for the development of vaccines compared with the conventional approaches and there are examples of the successful development of vaccine candidates by adopting in silico approaches (Ada et al., 2018; Bhatnager et al., 2020; He et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2019; Oli et al., 2020; Patronov & Doytchinova, 2013; Tordello et al., 2017 and the appropriate references cited therein). The whole genome sequence of the SARS-CoV2 is made available in the public domain by next generation sequencing. This enabled the design of several multi-epitope in silico vaccine candidates targeting different structural and nonstructural proteins of the SARS-CoV2 (Bhatnager et al., 2020; Bhattacharya et al., 2020; Devi & Chaitanya, 2020; Dong et al., 2020; Enayatkhani et al., 2020; Kar et al., 2020; Lizbeth et al., 2020; Peele et al., 2020; Samad et al., 2020) .

In the first step, it employs LOMETS, a meta-server threading programme for template-based protein structure prediction. It contains 11 threading programs. Each threading programme generates many templates from PDB that are aligned with the query sequence. However, only one template that has shown the highest z-score from each of the threading programs is selected. Subsequently, 10 threading programs are ranked. Thus, the output from LOMETS contains the top 10 threading programs along with their respective high score template. Using the templates generated from LOMETS, in the next series of steps, I-TASSER generates top five final models. Each model is given a Confidence score (C-score). The quality of each of the predicted models is estimated by means of C-score. A higher Cscore implies higher confidence in the particular model generated. Apart from C-score, I-TASSER computes TM-score and RMSD value for all the five models. I-TASSER chooses the top model out of the five models generated which has a strong correlation between C-score and TM-score. The tertiary structure generated by I-TASSER was submitted to 'GalaxyRefine2' (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=REFINE2) available at GalaxyWEB server (http:// galaxy.seoklab.org/index.html) for the refinement of protein structure obtained from the top model generated by I-TASSER. GalaxyRefine2 is an advanced version of 'GalaxyRefine', utilizes local operators and global operators as well as local error estimation and homology structure information for the improvement of the accuracy of the structure of the input protein . It generates 10 refined models and provides information related to RMSD, MolProbity, Clash score, Poor rotamers, Rama favored and 'GALAXY energy' for all the ten models in comparison with the user submitted model.

EAAAK is a rigid a-helix forming peptide linker, with intramolecular hydrogen bonding having a closed packed backbone. Rigid linkers possess several advantages when compared to the flexible linkers. EAAAK linkers offer efficient separation of the functional domains by keeping a fixed distance with minimal interference between the epitopes thereby maintaining their individual functional properties (Chen et al., 2013) . This helps in the effective separation of domains in a bifunctional fusion protein (Arai et al., 2001) .",

CAI value and GC-content of the improved sequence were 0.96 and 52.31, respectively. The CAI value >0.8 is considered as a good value for high-level expression and the range for optimal GC content is 30-70% (Nezafat et al., 2016) . Thus, the CAI value and GC-content obtained are highly satisfactory for the expression of the multi-epitope vaccine in the E coli (strain K12) (Nezafat et al., 2016; Pandey et al., 2018). 3.3.8. In silico cloning of vaccine candidate DNA sequence was cloned into pET-28a (\u00fe) vector in between Pae71-PspXI-XhoI and MluI restriction sites. These restriction sites were not present at both the ends as well as within the DNA sequence of the vaccine construct. As a result, the XhoI and MluI restriction sites were added at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, respectively. After this, the insert was treated with these two restriction enzymes in silico in SnapGene and the insert DNA was successfully cloned into the vector (Figure 10) . The vector along with the insert was 5079 bp in length.",

However, the peaks depicting the titers of IgM and IgM \u00fe IgG are distinctly separated in the secondary and tertiary responses than in primary response. There is a decrease in the levels of antigen at each stage of immune response with the increase in the levels of antibodies (Figure 11(a) ). The decrease in antigen count is also attributed to the increase in the total count of B (Figure 11(b) ) and T-lymphocytes. Apart from B-lymphocytes, active (Figure 11 (c)) and total T H (helper) (Figure 11 (d)) cell populations along with memory T H cell (Figure 11 (d)) populations were increased during the secondary and tertiary immune responses. The T H cell count (active and total) in the secondary and tertiary immune responses is more when compared to primary immune response. There is also an increase in the active T C (Cytotoxic) cell population per state (Figure 11(e) ).",

T-cell and B-cell epitopes were designed using different online servers that are efficient in predicting the epitopes. Only those epitopes which are antigenic, nonallergic and nontoxic were used for the construction of vaccine. Epitopes were joined by different linkers to reduce junctional immunogenicity and also for efficient separation and presentation to T-cell and B-cell receptors. Population coverage analysis (using the epitopes that were used for the construction of the vaccine) had shown that the vaccine can cover 94.06% of the world-wide population. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted for the protein. Subsequently, the tertiary model generated was further refined and validated. Molecular docking was performed between the vaccine construct and TLR-3 receptor. Various molecular interactions, i.e. hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, etc. were visualized between the protein and TLR-3 receptors. Condon optimization was carried for cloning and expression of the vaccine in E. coli. CAI value of 0.9 was obtained for codonoptimization; indicating the high-level of protein expression in the E coli host. The vaccine was successfully cloned into pET-28a (\u00fe) vector. The multi-epitope vaccine was efficient in eliciting primary, secondary and tertiary immune responses as evident from Immune simulation studies. The proposed vaccine needs to be further validated for its efficacy by in vivo studies.",
