            "text": "The most severe health crisis that the 21st century has faced so far has its origins in a zoonotic virus from the Coronaviridae family. Along with its predecessors, which have also become human pathogens, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV), the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the positive-sense single-stranded enveloped ribovirus family [1] with primary respiratory tropism. However, SARS-CoV-2 differentiates itself from the rest of the aforementioned viruses through an unprecedented pathogenicity and contagiousness, even in a lower mortality rate context [2] . Its aggressiveness, which is considerably higher than that of other long existing human pathogen beta coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) [3] , including its abovementioned predecessors, is first and foremost defined by its unique clinicopathological features. The worst manifestations requiring ICU management to support life [4] include pulmonary complications [5] , cardiac complications [6] , neurological complications [7] , and, last but not least, renal complications [8] . Despite accumulated knowledge until present, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) clinical manifestations and long-term sequelae continue to form an incomplete puzzle. However, from a medical point of view, it is certain that the pathological picture has to be understood as a multi system disease [9] .",

In this regard, the COVID-19 outbreak has hit with unexpected tsunami-like force the population across the globe, with only a few states-arguablyclaiming themselves to be COVID free (e.g., Turkmenistan, North Korea, a number of Pacific nations) since the start of the pandemic and until the present day. Even the most advanced medical systems have been severely affected by the unprecedented number and gravity of cases, while conventional healthcare services are being compromised in order to meet the demands of caring for COVID-19 patients. The unusual spread of the novel Coronavirus has claimed several victims including among frontline healthcare workers (HCW) who are fighting against the pandemic. Thus, up until recently the median of the HCW deaths in 100,000 per population of the country was 0.05, according to data from a study on 27 countries including Romania [18] .",

Although the physical closure of educational institutions (schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions) helped significantly reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 it has also led to challenges for both students and teachers [24] which involved changed communication channels for lecturers and administrative support, new assessment methods, different workloads and performance levels [14, [25] [26] [27] . When it comes to universities, challenges included, on one hand, the elimination of all interior and outdoor campus activities, such as exams, workshops, study in the libraries, conferences, festive events, meetings with university colleagues, sports, and, on the other hand, the rapid and often unprepared implementation of distance learning solutions [28] on e-platforms. Apart from internet connectivity issues in some countries and regions across the globe, the switch from face-to face learning to e-learning has revealed problems such as lack of information technology, educational materials, and digital technology skills [29] , as well as emotional, mental, and physical health breakdowns, due to dramatic changes in one's social life (e.g., moving back home due to the closure of university dorms, lack of traveling, meetings and parties, etc.) [14, [30] [31] [32] [33] , personal financial situation of students (e.g., loss of student job, concerns about their financial situation) [20, 34] , and COVID-19 infections within this category. However, the positive aspect is that although COVID-19 is a threat to humanity, it has also forced academic institutions to best deliver theoretical online content, such as redesigned courses, problem-based learning tutorials, theoretical and practical exams [35] via well-known platforms such as email, Google \u00ae educational tools, Skype \u00ae , Facebook \u00ae , Instagram \u00ae , YouTube \u00ae , WhatsApp \u00ae , Telegram \u00ae , and others [36] .

These were replaced with simulating the clinical maneuvers demonstrated by the lecturers, followed by student practice in groups with fewer individuals, using simulation models, study models, extracted teeth, prosthetic appliances and casts, or training on adjustable articulators, etc., according to each clinical discipline.",

All of these add to the competitiveness, rigor and increased demands and to the early responsibility when treating patients [41] , which characterize dental medicine education in general, and which place it in one of the most stressful academic environments [42, 43] , while also being one of the most emotionally and psychologically demanding professions. Our study highlights the significant psychological impact on students, as both stress and anxiety levels are directly correlated and, therefore, perceived by the majority of them as being elevated, due to the supplementary psychological stress triggered by the pandemic. According to this study, the percentage of students who significantly feel the stress after 10 months into the pandemic, is even higher than that of those who are afraid of contracting the novel coronavirus, regardless of their study year. The same student stress impact was highlighted by Hakami, Z. et al. [44] , in a study performed through the evaluation of DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale) scores, at the beginning of the pandemic. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning the current scarcity of comparative data from other European countries on pandemic related stress, among the same study sample.",

In a similar manner, a study on a large number of medical students (7143) in China [46] , informed on lower percentages of moderate (2.7%) to severe anxiety (0.9%) among them, the motivation most probably being the significant attention from the central Chinese government regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and its influence on students' psychological health, thus strongly guiding the educational sector in the area of psychological counselling, psychological assistance hotlines [47] , etc.",

In this regard, one of the most surprising and maybe concerning findings of our study was that, despite unmodified study motivation, the vast majority of dental students from Bucharest, regardless of their respective study year, had difficulties in acquiring academic information through the online teaching system. This was most likely due to the fact that this academic model was absolutely inexperienced at our university until the time of the pandemic. Similar or even worse perceptions regarding the efficiency of academic online learning have been reported in Pakistan dental schools [50] , Iraqi dental universities [51] , and the Faculty of Dentistry University of Indonesia [52] . However, there were some rather positive student opinions according to a study conducted at the Dental School of Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) [53] . Deficiencies in the online learning process could be explained by the lack of technical computer skills among some students who were unprepared in this regard and forced in this system, the lack of familiarity and virtual learning fatigue [54] , increased difficulty to stay in contact with lecturers [55] , etc.",

The inclusion of a neutral answer option was not randomly chosen at the moment the questionnaire was being constructed as this allowed freedom to the student, an escape button, where a firm opinion was not required, and which allowed them not to choose an answer which did not reflect their true beliefs [56] . Thus, two or even three interpretation options can be discussed, just like the neutral answer was intentionally thought by Likert, where students either do not know the answer to the question regarding the lecturers' efficiency in communicating academic information through the online system (the other answers being: very low, low, high, very high) [57] , either they know but they wish to not respond, whether they do not understand the question [58] , or they are undecided [59] . Regardless of the interpretation, it is certain that theoretical and practical information communicated by the university lecturers is a subject which needs to be reflected upon and at the same time perfected, as, although students' perception on the assimilation of online taught curricula could be influenced by multiple factors, it seems that the most important factor is the quality of the courses [60] . Our study certifies this important issue, as indicated by the significant correlation between the efficiency of online teaching by the university lecturers, and the acquisition of academic information by students. On its part, the lecturers' performance in the online learning process is influenced by their professional ability, which should focus on the interactive pedagogy model through communicative and reflective-active instruction [61] , on the online teaching adaptability, as well as on confidence toward utilization of digital learning [52] . The adoption of sustainable models, starting with flipped classroom techniques, where students are invited to review online modules before participating in seminars [62] , and continuing with the introduction of haptic technology [63] into the clinical curriculum even after the pandemic, and even the use of novel portable teaching-learning platforms such as DenTeach [64] , could be solutions to the issues we are facing.",

In this case, it should be mentioned that the question did not intentionally refer to whether it was positively or negatively affected. We did not consider the quantification of this modification to be necessary, but the simple modification of this parameter could be interpreted as a supplementary stress factor for the student, which could consist in another argument regarding the stress level that they reported. This statement is all the more plausible as our study found a significant correlation between the modified individual study time and the low level of acquiring academic information due the online system, which, in turn, is certainly a strong stressor for students. A study conducted by Amir et al. [52] , indicates that although students admitted there was more time to study and to review study material during distance learning, one-third of the participants experienced important levels of stress, thus being convergent to our study.",

This is an unsurprising result, due to the fact that no current teaching method, as demonstrated by the correlational analysis in our study, can substitute the acquisition of manual dexterity and fine motor skills, which are necessary for various clinical procedures, possible only by practicing on real patients. Although it is not a statistically significant result, an increase in the impact on practical skills as the study years progress can be noticed and should be discussed. Thus, first and second year students have reported they are less affected in this regard compared to their colleagues in the last preclinical study year, namely the 3rd one, as well as compared to the students in the clinical semesters, namely from the 4th, 5th, and 6th study years. To the best of our knowledge, till present there are limited studies with a similar assessment. One of these studies, conducted in the only dental school in Malta, suggests that the majority of students were severely impacted by not being able to practice their laboratory or clinical skills for a long period, their manual dexterity skills being, therefore, greatly affected [41] .",

In our opinion, the reason for this result is the forced break of treatments performed directly on patients by dental students in their final study years, the self-perceived level of acquisition of practical skills being strongly positively correlated to the professional perspective in our study. Regarding the issue of evaluating the dental medicine students' perception on practicing the profession, literature from the first 6-12 months since the pandemic has been declared by WHO, only presents a few comparative studies. One of these studies, conducted at the University of Otago Faculty of Dentistry in New Zealand [65] and which used a questionnaire since mid-March 2020, reports an increased impact, with almost half of the participating students anticipating a decrease in the clinical competence in their profession. Although the study does not differentiate the impact by study year, its authors suggest that this perception might worsen if clinical activities are suspended for an extended period of time, a hypothesis confirmed by our study, which shows that over 60% of the participants foresee either a high or a very high professional impact. Another opinion, this time from May 2020, but with a similar result to our study, came from Roseman University of Health Sciences (RUHS) College of Dental Medicine, Henderson, NV, USA, [66] , which indicates that the majority of students foresee a great negative impact on practicing the dentistry profession from the perspective of employment difficulties on a oversaturated job market, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These manifestations, also found among our students, indicate the need to promote programs to support good mental health, taking into account some relevant aspects such as the resources to support these measures. Therefore, as resources could be particularly scarce during a serious pandemic situation, as is currently the case, timely psychological support including telemedicine and informal support groups [68] could be a potential help for this young category from our country.",

At the time our report is finished, as the pandemic continues to evolve, forcing the Bucharest dental curriculum to be taught following a hybrid system, it appears that new guidelines and protocols regarding the dental education program will be adopted, according to both this dynamic and our students' necessities, as it is highlighted by the current study. Moreover, given that the Faculties of Dental Medicine are not only educational and research institutions, but also small hospitals [70] , finding sustainable solutions during this period, which are adapted to the local realities as they are showcased by the current study, may contribute to the improvement of both the oral health and wellbeing of the citizens in Bucharest.",

Furthermore, students' perceptions regarding the online distribution of the theoretical content of the curriculum may lead to upgrading the e-teaching strategies among our university lecturers. Thus, the results of our study should be seen as a great opportunity to reconsider the clinical activity in the Faculties of Dental Medicine across the country, in the benefit of both the students and the patients, and to optimize the student interaction in an academic environment which will most probably never resemble the one prior to the COVID-19 pandemic or at least for many years to come.",
