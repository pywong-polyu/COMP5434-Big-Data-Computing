There are marked differences in the natural history of the two diseases, where microcephaly caused by Zika virus infection only emerges months after infection, COVID-19 occurs acutely. Intensive research efforts for both infections were catalysed by the needs of national, regional and global health agencies to answer key questions on transmission, prevention, and interventions at the individual and community level [5] . During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the accumulation of peer-reviewed and preprint publications has been vast; from April, 2020 onwards, an average of 2000 scientific publications appeared per week. A similar, albeit smaller surge in publications occurred in 2016 during the Zika virus epidemic. The sudden large increases in publications about these conditions over a short time can also be described as outbreaks.",

Hierarchies of evidence are often used to rank the value of epidemiological study designs, prioritising experimental methods, but these do not take account of purposes, other than the effects of interventions. Anecdotal observations allow for the discovery and description of phenomena, studies with comparison groups are more appropriate to test hypotheses, and randomised trials test the causal effects of interventions [6] . Early on in the Zika epidemic, questions about causality were important because the link between clusters of babies born with microcephaly and Zika virus infection was not obvious; congenital abnormalities caused by a mosquito-borne virus had never been reported. In an earlier analysis of 346 publications about Zika virus alone, we described the temporal sequence of publication of types of study to investigate causality [7] . Others have assessed the accumulation of study designs over time during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and concluded that early in the outbreak, simple observational studies, mathematical modelling studies and narrative reviews were most abundant [8, 9] . Here, we proposed a hypothetical sequence: first, anecdotal observations are reported in case reports or case series. Analytical observational studies follow. In parallel, basic research studies investigate the biology and pathogenesis of the disease. Mathematical modelling can provide evidence where direct observations are not available [10] . After a delay, controlled trials examining interventions are published.",

For weeks where the volume SARS-CoV-2 of research was over 400 publications, starting mid-March, we drew a random sample of 400 publications with the R 'sample' function, without replacement. The number of selected publications was a pragmatic decision that balanced an adequate sample size and manageable workload for the number of crowd-volunteers. The annotation of the Zika virus dataset was performed for previous systematic reviews (from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) [13, 15] . We first classified publications into the broad groups \"epidemiology\" or \"basic research\", \"non-original\" articles (editorials, viewpoints, and commentaries) and \"other\". These are groups that we used in an earlier study about Zika virus [7] , so for this comparative study, we applied them to the publications about SARS-CoV-2. We subdivided epidemiological and basic research further, based on their study design. We provide details on the classification of the study designs in the Additional file 1 Table S1 and in an online annotation guide [17] .",

We tried to tackle this limitation by screening and training of the volunteer scientists, verification of decisions and having a third person resolving disagreements [12] . There are other limitations. First, we only recorded the study design of publications and did not assess the content or its methodological quality. To trace the evolution of evidence for specific research questions, in-depth studies are needed. Second, for SARS-CoV-2, the volume of publications meant that we only annotated a sample of records. The total in the first 5 months of the pandemic was, however, higher than for 1 year of publications about Zika virus and the proportions of different study designs for Zika virus stabilised quickly. Third, the searches do not include all sources of peer-reviewed evidence or preprint sources. Incompleteness of the evidence base should not affect our conclusions as long as other sources account for a stable proportion of publications.",

            "text": "The differences between study designs in the two epidemics are compatible with differences in characteristics of the diseases. The higher proportion of basic research in Zika virus research may have several explanations. First, the occurrence of congenital abnormalities following a vector-borne infection was poorly understood; in vivo and in vitro studies were essential to investigate in utero transmission and mechanisms for neurotoxicity and neuropathology [22] . Second, the establishment of mouse models was more successful in Zika virus research than for SARS-CoV-2 research, [23] although efforts are ongoing [24] . Third, the later occurrence of case-control studies and cohort studies in Zika virus, might be caused by the delay to congenital outcomes, compared to the shorter delay in outcomes caused by SARS-CoV-2. Fourth, the prominent role of mathematical modelling studies during the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, probably reflects early recognition of the pandemic potential and the need for forecasts of the global spread. Mechanistic models describing the transmission SARS-CoV-2 are also less complex than for arboviruses like Zika virus, allowing many to explore transmission dynamics [10] . The higher volume of observational research about SARS-CoV-2 research could reflect both the 50-fold higher numbers of cases than for Zika virus and the severity of the pandemic, whereas Zika virus was largely limited to the Americas and cases of infection were already declining as the research volume started to increase. The increasing role of preprints during the SARS-CoV-2 coincided with developments in open access publishing and the need for speedy access to outbreak research [25] . The increase of preprint publishing results in faster access to evidence, which will benefit the public health response. The rapid pace of publication in both preprint and peer-reviewed publications mean that readers need to carefully appraise the methodological quality of the research.",

(2010) described epidemiological studies from Toronto and Hong Kong [26] , whereas we included epidemiological and nonepidemiological articles all over the world. Xing and colleagues primarily studied the publication time delay during the outbreak and concluded that only a minority (7%) of the publications was published during the time outbreak, while we investigated the proportion of the preprints over peer-reviewed publications [26] . For the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Liu et al. (2020) performed a bibliometric analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 literature up to March 24, 2020 [27] , classifying research by theme, rather than by study design. They observed that clinical features of the COVID-19 were studied heavily, whereas other research areas such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, and pathophysiology remained underexplored. In contrary to the manual annotation of our project, Tran et al. (2020) performed automatic Latent Dirichlet allocation topic modelling of publications on SARS-CoV-2, published up to April 23, 2020 [28] , with findings similar to those of Liu. et al. [27] . While we validated classification of study design manually, Tran et al. did not describe a validation of their automated modelling method. Jones et al. (2020) , who classified study designs using categories comparable to ours, showed a similar pattern of study design occurrence during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where case reports and narrative reviews were found to be most published [8] . However, they merely present absolute numbers and a comparison with other outbreaks is absent [8] . Similarly, Fidahic et al. (2020) concluded that early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic articles were predominantly retrospective case reports and modelling studies [9] . Haghani and Bliemer (2020) compared SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 literature and showed that around 50% of studies were non-original, which is in line with our results [29] . Unlike our categorization method, Haghani and Bliemer used the categorization by the citation database 'SCOPUS' and conclude that the studies linked to public health response are first to emerge .",

The change over time in the types of studies has particular implications for synthesis of evidence and for public health as more research is published. Policy makers and public health practitioners need to keep up with rapid changes in the state of the evidence, because these changes affect recommendations for control measures. For example, preprint publication in December 2020, about the spread of new more infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom and South Africa [30] , provided the scientific evidence for strengthening control measures in several European Countries and changing vaccination policy in South Africa. The earliest studies published might not be the most appropriate to answer specific questions, for example, about causality [31] , or to quantify disease characteristics. Triangulation of different sources of evidence using frameworks, such as those based on the Bradford Hill criteria [15] , and careful interpretation through explicit acknowledgment of limitations can help. Living systematic reviews are particularly useful because changes to inclusion criteria can be planned and protocols can be amended in advance of an update. For example, quantifying the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in March 2020 relied largely on descriptions from contact investigations in single families [32] . By June 2020, there were also studies at lower risk of selection and measurement biases, such as population screening .",

The speed with which the evidence about SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated is unprecedented. We recruited a large team of experienced scientists, but we were still not able to categorise all publications by the time this manuscript is written. Machine learning methods, such as natural language processing, to classify text is a promising approach for the triage of publication types [18] . We also see potential in a scaled-up version of collaborative crowd-sourcing among experts in the field, to increase efficiency and avoid research waste [33] . The technical tools to manage such efforts are available, but guidelines on how to best conduct the live synthesis of evidence should be developed and evaluated further [34] .",
