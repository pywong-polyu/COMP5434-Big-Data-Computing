            "text": "Anxiety has been steadily increasing, particularly in the adolescent and young adult populations in the past 24 years [1] . The economic cost of anxiety in the 1990's in the United States was estimated to range from $42.3 billion to $46.6 billion [2, 3] . COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have further increased the prevalence of anxiety with U.S. adults being three times more likely to screen positive for anxiety disorders in April/May 2020 compared to 2019 [4] . In many cases the origins of anxiety can be traced to early stressful life events (ELS) that alter the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [5] . ELS has the effect of negatively influencing an individual's development affecting all spheres of an individual's life: emotional, cognitive, behavioural, social and physical [6] . In these terms, it is likely that the COVID19 pandemic could be an ELS for many people during this time. The bulk of the evidence indicates that ELS often lead to permanent changes in the HPA axis and may develop into anxiety in adulthood [5] . Specifically, increased activity of the HPA axis is associated with hypercortisolemia and reduced inhibitory feedback [5] . Indeed, higher cortisol levels are present in people suffering from anxiety disorders [7, 8] . This suggests that treatments that target cortisol and other components of the HPA axis may be potentially effective in treating anxiety.",

However, response rates to antianxiety medication can be poor, many patients also can have negative side effects such as sexual dysfunction and it is difficult to predict reliably which patients will respond well and which will have a limited treatment response [10] . In more extreme cases, benzodiazepines are prescribed to treat anxiety, are taken on an as-needed basis, are overused and are physically and psychologically addictive, particularly if used over extended periods of time [12, 16] . Between 1996 and 2013, there was an average annual increase in benzodiazepine prescription of 2.5% in the United States [11] , which represents an increase in the quantity of benzodiazepines consumed from 1.1 to 3.6 kilograms per 100,000 adults. The overdose rate increased concurrently from 0.58 to 3.07 per 100,000 adults [11] .",

This may be due to the neurochemical effects of music which include increased levels of endogenous opioids and dopamine [25] [26] [27] . There is also strong evidence to suggest that this also may be due to music's ability to reduce cortisol in a natural setting (field study) [28] , as well as preventing cortisol increases and in some cases reducing cortisol in stressful situations [29] [30] [31] . The bulk of the evidence suggests that music can be very effective in reducing self-reported anxiety in nonclinical samples according to a recent meta-analysis [32] . However, the same meta-analysis found a non-significant decrease in psychophysiological signals related to anxiety. The authors of the meta-analysis suggested that the discrepancy between self-reports and psychophysiology may have been due to the heterogeneity of the studies considered and an overall lack of rigorous methodological standards which may have biased the results [32] . One randomized control trial involving children with anxiety disorders found that Multi-Modal Music Therapy (MMT), which is combination of music therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than normal treatment (a mixture of behavioural interventions, psychodynamic psychotherapy, nonspecific group therapy) according to the remission rates after treatment which persisted for four months [33] .",

This approach to sequencing music selections follows the iso principle, first proposed as a system of mood regulation supported by music [35] . The music recommendation system used in this research is supplied by LUCID Inc. (https://www.thelucidproject.ca) and employs the iso principle along with affective classification and reinforcement learning to cultivate affectdriven personalized music sequences [36] . The sequences are instrumental music integrated with nature sounds and were composed by LUCID's music director/composer. Prior to the music treatment the participant inputs their current mood using the arousal and valence dimensions of the Russell Circumplex Model [37] . Based on this input as well as the target emotional state of reduced anxiety/increased feelings of calm, the machine learning algorithm within the application predicts the optimal sequence of tracks to produce mood induction in the listener from their current emotional state to the target state. This machine learning algorithm uses reinforcement learning techniques and is trained on real-world data correlating the quantitative features of musical excerpts and sequences alongside the emotional responses induced by them in listeners. From a conceptual point of view, this algorithm is based on the iso principle, a methodology used in music therapy to achieve mood induction that involves matching musical stimuli to a patient's current mood and gradually changing the music in the direction of their desired mood state [34] . The iso principle has been indicated in prior research to be more effective than other musical sequences at reducing tension [38] .",

Combination tone signals can be generated by superposing two sine waves of neighboring frequencies. Monaural beat refers to the presentation of amplitude modulated beat signals to a single ear, or to both ears simultaneously. When the individual sine waves are presented dichotically, a binaural beat percept is produced [42] . For example, a two-tone exposure of 400 and 405 Hz presented to each ear separately will be experienced as a modulated wave of 5 Hz by the listener [43] . Theta and delta ABS may reduce anxiety and increase self-reported relaxation [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments using the Qualtrics randomizer algorithm: 1) Combined (music & ABS), 2) Musicalone, 3) ABS-alone, and 4) Pink noise (control). Music preferences, trait anxiety and personality traits have been confounding factors in previous studies involving music, ABS, and mental health [48] [49] [50] [51] . Therefore, before their treatment session, participants completed the Short Test of Music Preferences (STOMP), the short form of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Our hypotheses were that the combined, music alone and ABS alone conditions would experience a greater reduction in somatic and cognitive state anxiety compared to the pink noise control condition. These hypotheses were pre-registered using the Open Science Framework (Registration DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/VHCA5) and were based upon previous studies showing that ABS and music listening are capable of reducing anxiety [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [44] [45] [46] [47] [52] [53] [54] . We had no specific predictions for moderate and high trait anxiety participants, but our preregistration noted our intention to recruit from both of these populations. Trait anxiety is a confounding factor in studies involving music [50, 51] . Therefore, we separated the participants into moderate and high trait anxiety conditions according to prior criteria to determine whether moderate and high trait anxiety participants differ in their responses to the treatments [55]. Trait anxiety was measured by the State Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA), this is not a diagnostic tool but is a quantitative assessment of perceived anxiety level. This experimental protocol received approval from the Ryerson Research Ethics Board (REB 2020-068) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki [56] . All participants gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.",

The participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: combined (music with ABS); music-alone, ABS-alone, or pink noise. Pink noise is noise that follows a 1/f energy distribution in the frequency domain [64] . Many prior studies involving auditory stimuli have used pink noise as a control stimulus [65] [66] [67] . Pink noise is not much different from a silent condition [68] . A potential issue in using a silent condition as a control is the potential for placebo effects since all other conditions have an auditory component. In addition, the advantage to pink noise as control condition compared to the silent condition is that helps control for the placebo effect. Pink noise was administered in the same manner as all the other stimuli, with the experimenter having control over this variable.",

Permutation methods control false positives, allow the use of non-standard statistics and make only weak assumptions regarding the data [69] . Therefore, we decided to conduct a multiple linear regression using the permutation package Permuco in R [70] . .

Pairwise Fisher Randomization Resampling tests (5000 iterations) also known as permutation tests were done comparing the treatment conditions for both somatic and cognitive state anxiety reduction. Permutation tests are a good way to control the type I error rate for multiple comparisons, it is non-parametric and so makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data that are common in other inferential statistical tests [71] [72] [73] [74] . For the PANAS, for each participant, the pre-treatment positive affect was subtracted from the post-treatment positive affect.

The effect size of these comparisons was large (Table 2A) . One reason for these large effect sizes may be the use of slow tempo in music selections. Slow tempo music has been associated with reductions in respiration rate, heart rate, sweat production, body temperature, and muscle tension, the same physiological changes associated with reducing somatic anxiety [25, [75] [76] [77] [78] . Interestingly, we found no significant difference in somatic state anxiety reduction between the ABS and pink noise conditions in moderate trait anxiety participants (Fig 2A) . This finding may be explained by the potential for pink noise to increase relaxation and sleep quality [64, 79] coupled with the potential for theta ABS to increase negative affect [80, 81] . ",

In addition, the combined condition compared to the pink noise control also had a medium effect size (Table 2B ). We can speculate that the theta ABS component of the combined condition may have contributed to reductions in cognitive anxiety by entraining endogenous oscillations that are characteristic of relaxation [45, 82] . Another possibility is that the ABS component increased interhemispheric coherence [83] . To investigate these possibilities, future studies should incorporate EEG in addition to self-report methods.",

The pink noise condition also had a significantly higher reduction in negative affect compared to the ABS condition. This may be explained by the fact that pink noise increases sleep quality and relaxation [64, 79] and participants may have found the persistent hum of the ABS only condition irritating. ",

This inconsistency in experimental results is likely due to several factors which include frequency used, type of sound used to mask the binaural beat, trait anxiety, personality factors such as extraversion and duration of exposure [49] [50] [51] [91] [92] [93] . In this study we accounted for these factors statistically and through experimental design which should help increase the reproducibility of this study. Specifically, we took into account personality traits and trait anxiety of our participants. Personality traits such as extraversion are related to mesostriatal dopamine levels which have been found to determine the effectiveness of gamma ABS in improving cognition [49] . In this study, we used theta ABS and found no significant effects of extraversion on the anxiety reduction effectiveness of our music with ABS or ABS conditions, but we did see a significant effect of trait anxiety on anxiety reduction effectiveness.",

            "text": "Participants in all conditions experienced pre-post reductions in somatic and cognitive state anxiety suggesting the presence of demand/expectancy characteristics. However, given that some conditions (Combined and music) resulted in significantly greater anxiety reduction than others (pink noise control), this suggests that experimental condition plays a significant role over the presence of demand characteristics. Nevertheless, in future studies the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire [94] may be administered to further examine the role of demand characteristics. Comorbidities such as depression often occur in people with anxiety symptoms. However, time constraints and limitations of the Prolific platform with respect to recruiting enough participants with and without anxiety comorbidities such as depression precluded extensive data collection beyond the primary domain of interest (anxiety). Although, comorbidities such as depression can affect anxiety treatment outcomes, particularly in older populations [95] . In some cases, particularly in younger populations comorbidities do not seem to affect treatment outcomes [96, 97] . This is one of the first few studies examining the anxiety reducing potential of music and ABS. Based on prior work we wanted to control for potential confounding effects of personality, music preferences and musical experience [49] [50] [51] . These additional questionnaires took up considerable amounts of the participants' time, so a limitation in this study is that there was not any time left to administer additional anxiety measures without compromising data quality, particularly given the online nature of data collections. In addition, because the study was conducted online, we could not do a heteroapplied medical evaluation assessment and there is also inherently a lack of control over certain variables such as timing of when participants were taking their anxiolytics. The sample population of this study were on anxiolytics with the majority being on SSRIs (Tables A & B in S1 File). SSRIs may inhibit emotional responses [98] which in turn may impact the responsiveness to music/sound based treatments. This limits the generalizability of our findings to those taking anxiolytics. However, we hope to address this in a future study examining the anxietyreducing potential of sound-based treatments on both anxiolytic and non-medicated populations.",

Similarly, the combined condition significantly reduced cognitive anxiety compared to the ABS-alone and pink noise conditions. In high trait anxiety participants, the music treatment significantly reduced somatic and cognitive anxiety compared to the ABS treatment, however, the pattern of results was difficult to interpret because of the lack of differences with the pink noise condition. We hypothesize that high trait anxiety participants may require longer and more frequent music treatments over time in order to achieve the same reductions in anxiety as moderate trait anxiety participants. We hope to examine this hypothesis in a future longitudinal study. The implications of this work are immense as many people who suffer from anxiety do not respond to standard treatments and fail to seek treatment and this simple and easily distributable method of potentially reducing anxiety may help serve this segment of the population.
