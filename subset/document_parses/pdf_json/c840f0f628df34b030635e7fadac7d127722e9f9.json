More Abbreviations used ACT-Asthma Control Test CDC-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention LABA-Long-acting beta-agonist OR-Odds ratio recently, as new evidence has emerged regarding the associations between asthma and COVID-19 outcomes, 3, 4 the CDC has updated its guidelines to include only those with moderate to severe asthma as those who might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. 5 Although underlying comorbidities such as asthma are potential risk factors, one of the most striking findings during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the incredible health disparities demonstrated in outcomes. For example, black individuals account for nearly 70% of deaths from COVID-19 in Chicago, despite representing only 30% of the population. 6 In addition, the COVID-19 death rate among Hispanic individuals is significantly higher than that among non-Hispanic individuals in New York (74.3 vs 45.2 per 100,000, respectively). 7 Such disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have renewed attention on other conditions with significant health disparities, such as asthma. Although the prevalence of asthma among black individuals is somewhat higher than that among white individuals (10.7 vs 8.0%, respectively), black individuals experience significantly worse outcomes. Asthma mortality rates are nearly 3 times higher in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites (22.7 vs 8.1 per million). 1 In addition, asthma hospitalization rates are 4 to 5 times higher for black individuals than for white individuals. 8, 9 The reasons for these extreme disparities in both COVID-19 and asthma outcomes may be multifactorial. Although genetic factors may play a role, 10 these differences have been attributed more strongly to socioeconomic factors including environmental influences. 11, 12 In addition, differences in cultural beliefs, attitudes, and health-seeking behaviors may contribute to disparities in asthma. 13 Finally, institutional racism (which refers to the systemic practices or individual attitudes that result in the blocking of people of color from the distribution of resources) has been recognized as another factor that promotes health disparities. 14 A better understanding of the contribution and interaction of these elements is critical to develop programs to eliminate health disparities.",

Such disparities may partially explain why minority individuals were significantly more likely to feel that both the state and federal governments were not doing enough during the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "Although not fully explored in this study, both institutional racism and individual physician implicit bias can contribute to health disparities in asthma. For example, physician responses regarding difficulties caring for minority patients may be related to factors such as perceived difficulties in affording medications, baseline health status, or attending office visits (examples of an institutional-wide problem). However, even when controlling for socioeconomic factors, previous studies have found unequal outcomes for minority individuals, thought to be due to larger social inequalities within societies, of which socioeconomic status is only one part. 19 Another possibility is that implicit bias may be contributing to institutional racism, 20 and implicit bias has been found to be prevalent among health care workers. 21 Unlike overt racism, implicit bias refers to attitudes or stereotypes that affect understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. One way to help overcome implicit bias is through workshops and education, which can improve clinical outcomes for minorities. 22 In July 2020, in response to the disparities seen in COVID-19 outcomes, the state of Michigan issued a directive requiring all medical professionals to take implicit bias training-the first state to do so. 23 There are limitations to this study. Because this was sent through social media and email, both patients and physicians who do not use this form of communication would be excluded. The age and socioeconomic status of the participants may not be representative of all patients with asthma or physicians, because those in the lowest socioeconomic strata who may be most vulnerable to COVID-19 are least likely to use social media. 24 Additional factors that may influence asthma outcomes (eg, obesity and environmental tobacco exposure) were not assessed. Answers to all survey questions were self-reported and not verified through medical chart review. Given the method of distribution, it was not possible to calculate a response rate nor to evaluate whether those who responded were different than those who did not. The surveys were validated for face but not content validity. Testing of implicit bias in physician respondents was not done, because validated tools (such as the Implicit Association Test 25 ) often take a significant amount of time to administer. A complete analysis of the factors contributing to institutional and systemic racism was not carried out. Follow-up questions or focus groups were not performed to further elucidate responses by patients or providers. Finally, because the study is crosssectional rather than a prospective trial, cause and effect cannot be proven but rather associations between worse outcomes and factors.",
