The near-final version of the survey was then reviewed and refined by another investigator (SBW) who had not previously commented on the instrument.Survey DistributionDue to the rapidly-evolving and critical nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the emphasis placed on timely and transparent results as well as widespread survey distribution, the approach to dissemination was unconventional, utilizing several media. A composite list of email addresses representing gastroenterologists at numerous institutions throughout North America was developed by the study team, with an intent to maximize geographic diversity. This list ultimately comprised 187 individuals. Two en masse emails were sent (by BJE) to the contact list encouraging participation in the survey and including a direct link. At their discretion, four investigators (NF, ZLS, SBW, BJE) also directly contacted gastroenterologists through email, phone calls and text messages, encouraging survey participation. The survey was also promoted on the social media platform Twitter, and featured in an online editorial regarding gastrointestinal endoscopy amidst the pandemic.7 Finally, respondents that had completed the survey were sent a personalized link 4 days before study closure to encourage them to update their entries.Survey ItemsThe survey consisted of 42 items, stratified into 6 categories: institutional demographics, changes in endoscopy practice, changes in GI and hepatology clinical practice, changes in training, peri-procedure screening for COVID-19, and changes in PPE practices. Based on early feedback from respondents after the initial dissemination of the survey, one additional question and three additional response options to existing questions were added. A complete list of survey questions and possible answers is provided in below.Publication of Intermediate Results During the StudyDuring the study period, many centers in North America remained in fluid situations regarding practice adaptations during the pandemic. Further, many centers anticipating surges in COVID-19 cases were learning from the experience of centers at which surges were already occurring. Because of the importance of real-time knowledge dissemination during these unprecedented times, the decision was made to publish the survey results, in aggregate, on three separate instances. The intermediate results were published on the survey website (GI-COVID19.org) and promoted on Twitter.Response StratificationFor subgroup analyses, responses were stratified according to 3 factors: 1) geographic region of origin, including Canada and U.S. regions of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Southwest, West, Northwest, and Midwest; 2) whether they represented teaching or nonteaching institutions, as defined by the presence or absence of a gastroenterology fellowship program; and 3) according to the time of completion, in intervals of 7 days after initial survey dissemination.",
