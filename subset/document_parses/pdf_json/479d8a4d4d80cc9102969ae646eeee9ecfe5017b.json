In turn, perceptions of a romantic relationship as chaotic or tumultuous can influence a person's engagement with their social network. Alternately, previous research also suggests that engagement with friends and family has the potential to influence married partner's relationship quality. Research Design: This study examined these propositions among a sample of married couples (N = 64, 128 individuals) whose daily experiences and relationship dynamics changed during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Results/Conclusions: Based on a 10week, weekly diary repeated measures design, results suggest that relational turbulence and the valence of social network engagement may be mutually influential, such that (a) relational turbulence may influence the way in which married partners interpret communication with social network members and (b) the valence of communication with social network members may influence experiences of relational turbulence.",

In particular, we examined associations between relational turbulence and the frequency and valence of participants' interactions with social network members from week-to-week in a sample of married couples (N = 64, 128 individuals) during the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was on the rise in the United States (i.e., the summer of .

For many couples, \"specific episodes\" were made more fraught by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, during the summer of COVID-19, married partners experienced heightened stress (Kowal et al., 2020) and anxiety (Gunther-Bell et al., 2020) associated with state mandated lockdowns, as well as increased childcare burden that stemmed from school closures and the move to remote learning (Adams & Todd., 2020) . In addition, the switch to virtual work and school environments caused some parents to struggle with work-family balance, and those families reported higher levels of marital conflict and stress (Chung et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the sudden change in the family's daily routine provided ample opportunity for married partners to interfere with each other's daily goals, which corresponded with increases in reports of relational turbulence for married partners (Knoster et al., 2020) . Because relational turbulence theory says that relational turbulence arises as the result of repeated polarized interactions, relational turbulence is a relevant index of relationship functioning during the pandemic.",

            "text": "In advancing relational turbulence theory, Solomon et al. (2016) proposed that relational turbulence affects married partners' relational and social outcomes in two ways. First, according to the theory, relational turbulence negatively affects partners' ability to uphold topic coherence, exchange speaking turns fluidly, and regulate conversational behaviors (Harrist & Waugh, 2002) . In doing so, the global feeling of chaos in one's marriage undercuts conversational synchrony and generates more inept and uncomfortable exchanges. Second, Solomon et al. (2016) suggested that when married partners experience relational turbulence, they are pre-occupied with the variable conditions in their daily life, and so lack the ability to generalize about their relationship's history and future trajectory. This mode of thinking can lead to less creative and more pessimistic reasoning (Henderson et al., 2011) . As a result of dyadic asynchrony and decreased psychological distance from relationship issues, partners may lack coherent relational schema (Harrist & Waugh, 2002; Henderson et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2016) . In turn, they may find it difficult to create a coherent narrative about their relationship for friends and family and, thus, be less likely to engage with social network members (Harrist & Waugh, 2002; Henderson et al., 2011; Solomon et al., 2016) .",

For example, in a study of hypothetical support messages from social network members, Brisini et al. (2021) found that reports of relational turbulence were associated with increased defensive processing. In turn, defensive processing was associated with decreases in perceived support quality. Similarly, among dating partners, relational uncertainty and interference from a partner, relationship parameters that are theorized to lead to the experience of turbulence, are negatively associated with perceptions of a social network as helping their relationship (Knobloch & Donovan-Kicken, 2006) . Finally, a dyadic study of married couples raising a child with autism spectrum disorder demonstrated negative associations between experiences of relational turbulence during the child's transition to school and general perceptions of support for their marriage and their child from social network members, especially for husbands Brisini et al.

For example, a longitudinal study by Bryant and Conger (1999) showed that positive relationship support from social network members was associated with increased marital success over the course of 3 years. In a study of over 1500 couples, Widmer et al. (2009) found that the size of people's social network and the frequency of their contact with its members were negatively associated with marriage quality when network members were perceived to interfere in marital issues, particularly when one or both partners had inadequate conflict management skills. In contrast, if social networks were seen as supportive, density and frequency of contact with social network members were positively associated with marriage quality.",

First, previous research demonstrates linkages between social network experiences and relationship quality more generally and between social network involvement and aspects of relational turbulence in dating couples. In general, engagement with one's social network is associated with improved marital adjustment (Parks, 2013) . Among dating partners, Stein et al. (2020) demonstrated that uncertainty about one's social network was positively associated with reports of relational uncertainty and negatively associated with relationship satisfaction and intimacy. Second, as described previously, prior studies have demonstrated associations between experiences of relational turbulence and perceptions of social network support as less helpful and, instead, a greater hindrance (e.g., Brisini & Solomon, 2020; Knobloch & Donovan-Kicken, 2006; ) .",

Similarly, bivariate correlations suggested that age, years married, and marital satisfaction were not significantly related to husbands' or wives' weekly relational turbulence, frequency, and valence of social network engagement over the course of the study. Husbands' and wives' scores were significantly correlated on each of the variables of interest (see Table 2 ) and paired samples t-tests identified significant differences in husbands' and wives' average scores on the frequency, t (64) = \u00c01.74, p = .03, and valence of social network engagement, t (64) = 1.91, p = .02, and marital satisfaction at pre-test, t (64) = 2.10, p = .04. Wives reported more frequent and more positively valenced social network engagement, but lower levels of marital satisfaction at pre-test (see Table 2 ). Given the added challenge of having children in the home during the COVID-19 pandemic (G\u00fcnther-Bel et al., 2020; Kowal et al., 2020) , we examined associations between our variables of interest and participants' parental status using independent samples t-tests. 02) compared to participants who did not report having children (M = 5.51, SD = 0.55). Although most demographic differences represented in this study did not demonstrate significant associations with our variables, parental status was associated with significant differences for participants on multiple variables of interest. Thus, parental status was considered a covariate in substantive analyses.",

In the crosssectional analyses, analyses of the data aggregated across the 10-weekly diaries (H1) and also within-weeks (H2) showed negative associations between relational turbulence and the valence of social network interactions. Likewise, the week-to-week analyses revealed a negative association between relational turbulence in 1 week and the valence of social network experiences the next week for husbands (H3), and a negative association between the valence of social network experiences and relational turbulence the next week (for both husbands and wives; H4).

These findings add to a growing body of work suggesting that the frequency of social network interaction is not as consequential as the quality of those interactions. For example, Brisini et al., 2021 found that married partners who reported higher levels of relational turbulence were no less likely to disclose to their social networks about relationship issues, but they were more likely to demonstrate reactance in response to support messages, and in turn evaluate support messages as lower in quality. Similarly, among a sample of married parents of children with autism spectrum disorder, Brisini and Solomon (2020) found that increased relational turbulence was associated with perceptions of social network members as less helpful for their marriage and their parenting. Whereas relational turbulence theory (Solomon et al., 2016) emphasizes the potential for relational turbulence to decrease the frequency of disclosures about the marriage to social network members, evidence to date suggests otherwise. Rather than decrease the frequency with which romantic partners engage with social network members, relational turbulence seems to negatively impact perceptions of those interactions. Whether communication with social network members is less positive, or simply perceived more negatively, is a question the merits further study.",

We are reluctant to overinterpret this potentially idiosyncratic finding, but it is noteworthy that it ran counter to our prediction. Whereas we anticipated interacting with social network members to alleviate some of the conditions that contribute to relational turbulence in marriages, our results suggested that husbands subsequently experienced more turbulence after their wives communicated with people outside their marriage. One possibility is that this pattern reflects the conditions of the COVID-19 lockdown, in which people were discouraged from engaging others outside their immediate family. Although speculative, we wonder if women who spent time with friends and extended family were doing so because of stressful exigent circumstances, which contributed to subsequent relational turbulence, or if their engagement with people outside the family sparked disagreements within the marriage. More generally, this finding reminds us that frequency of engagement, per se, is a poor proxy for details on the quality of social network interactions.",

Brisini and Solomon (2020) found similar results in a cross-sectional study of perceived support for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. In that study, husbands' and wives' reports of relational turbulence were negatively associated with their own evaluations of the helpfulness of their social network members, but not their spouse's evaluations. A wealth of research suggests that support from one's social network contributes to relationship quality (e.g., Bryant & Conger, 1999; Felmlee, 2001; Sprecher & Felmlee, 2000; Widmer et al., 2009) ; however, much of the work in this area does not include partner effects. Although an individual could seemingly be happy that their spouse is spending time with friends or frustrated that a spouse is taking time away from the family or other obligations, data from this study suggest that husbands and wives may not be directly influenced by their partner's social network engagement.

At a more general level, the results of this study underscore how the relationships of married partners are embedded withinboth affecting and affected by-the social relationships that partners have with others.",

            "text": "The results of the study are qualified by the strengths and limitations of our methodology. We recruited our initial sample using a Qualtrics pre-paid panel and allowed participants to opt-in to the diary studies. This strategy gave us access to a nation-wide sample of married partners from across the United States; however, the sample is not random. In addition, the use of panels limited our sample to married, rather than dating/cohabiting couples. Given the lack of formal commitment between dating partners, result may vary across this population. Moreover, criteria for participation in the study required that one or both married partners had moved from working outside the home to being inside the home (either working remotely or unemployed) during the lockdown stages of the pandemic. While this criterion allowed us to focus on couples that had experienced significant shifts in their day-to-day experiences, it also contributed to a smaller sample size and left out segments of the population that were already unemployed. In particular, we note that our final sample was generally older and married longer than participants in our initial sample who did not volunteer for the diary study, and our sample was not culturally diverse. In addition, due to the restrictive sample size, we were unable to include a large number of relationship covariates into our analytical models. We also did not account for the content of the participants' discussions with their network members. Doing so may further reveal the complexity of married partners' engagement with social networks. Finally, the repeated measures research design allowed us to increase the power of our analyses, controlling for week-to-week levels of the variables in our substantive analyses; however, repeated measure diary studies run the risk of measurement effects and fatigue. Alternative methods for assessing mutual influence in the association between relational turbulence and social network engagement, such as experimentally manipulating qualities of social network interactions, might provide an alternative, albeit more intrusive, means to test these associations.",

(2016) suggesting that relational turbulence would undermine social network engagement, and (b) research on social networks and romantic relationships indicating the potential benefits of social network engagement for dating and married couples. Using a repeated measures, 10-week diary research design, we were able to clarify that covariation between these constructs may be limited to social network valence, and not frequency, and that this relationship is mutually causal over time. Our findings take on added significance when located in the historic conditions that households faced in the summer of 2020. In a context in which social network engagement was constrained by remote work and education, as well as widespread community lockdowns, positive interactions with friends and family helped people mitigate feelings of chaos, instability, and turmoil in their marriage. We see replicating these overtime effects when couples are not navigating pandemic living conditions as a valuable direction for future research.",
