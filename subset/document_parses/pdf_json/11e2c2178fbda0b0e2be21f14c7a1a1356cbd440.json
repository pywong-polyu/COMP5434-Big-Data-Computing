            "text": "Economic vulnerability is often reported to underlie involvement in sex work among female sex workers (FSW), but may also create urgency in women's work, limiting women's negotiating power with clients and in turn, increasing their vulnerability for violence and HIV. This study assessed economic vulnerability in relation to violence and sexual risk behaviors for HIV among a sample of FSW in Tijuana, Mexico. FSW at least 18 years of age were recruited through venue-based sampling for a survey (n = 228) and in-depth interviews (n = 50) to investigate HIV risk factors in this region. Using crude and adjusted logistic regression models, we assessed lack of financial support from others as well as reports of financial hardship separately in relation to experiencing sexual violence (e.g. by clients, police, relationship partners, in the past 6 months), physical violence (past 6 months), STI diagnosis, and inconsistent condom use (past 30 days). Qualitative interviews (n = 50), conducted with a subsample of the survey participants, were also examined for related themes. FSW who reported no financial support were more likely to report sexual violence (OR = 2.1; 95% CI:1.1-4.2). FSW who reported financial hardship were more likely to experience sexual violence (OR = 1.9; 95% CI:1.1-3.6) and physical violence (OR = 1.9; 95% CI:1.1-3.6), as well as to report past 30-day inconsistent condom use (OR = 2.4; 95%CI: 1.3-4.6) and to test positive for an STI (OR = 1.9; 95% CI:1.1-3.4). Qualitative data substantiated these findings. Findings suggest that interventions to improve economic well-being may be useful to prevent the intersecting concerns of violence and HIV among FSW.",

This method has been successfully employed to recruit hidden samples of FSW, men who have sex with men, and truck drivers in a number of Mexican cities [40] [41] [42] . With the help of outreach workers, the paired study developed maps of bars, brothels, hotels, alleys and street corners with sex work activity. All sites were visited to verify their location and days/hours of business, and to estimate the size of the target population present. A maximum number of 15 recruits per establishment and geographical stratification were employed to ensure a diverse sample. Days and times for recruitment were randomly selected based on hours of operation/when target populations are present. Trained outreach workers familiar with these establishments and their clientele approached women. Using a personal digital assistant, the approximate age and reason for refusal/ineligibility was recorded. Women who were eligible and interested in participating were given a study card and asked to present it when they visited the study office. economic environment can increase women's vulnerability through processes related to stigmatization and marginalization, the criminalization of sex work, and through unequal distributions of power that can limit the accessibility of health-related resources and increase exposure to violence [10] [11] [12] [13] . These factors work individually and in tandem to shape individual risk and impede women's ability to prevent HIV infection. In particular, the pervasiveness of financial hardship among this population, and its relationship to both violence and HIV vulnerability, is an important avenue of research that has yet to be fully explored.",

Notably, studies among FSW in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, the US, and South Asia have found that economic vulnerability (e.g. economic debt, financial hardship) is not only a primary reason for women's involvement in sex work, but also creates an urgency in women's work that increases safety risks (e.g. threatening women's ability to avoid potentially violent clients) and reduces women's condom negotiating power, altogether, increasing HIV risk [10, 18, [23] [24] [25] . Previous research in South Asia among FSW has also noted the economic challenges faced by FSW who are the primary caretakers of their children, with no other financial support [26] . Recent work in Tijuana indicates that almost half (46%) of FSW agree to condomless sexual transactions in exchange for more money [20] , suggesting that economic burdens are a critical issue affecting FSW and increasing their vulnerability to HIV. Yet, little is known regarding the link between economic vulnerability and HIV risk among FSW in Tijuana or other regions in Mexico.",

Qualitative data indicated that financial support was largely absent, with women reporting the need to engage in risky behaviors in order to make more money. Experiencing financial hardship likely impedes women's ability to negotiate condom use or other risk behaviors with clients (e.g., substance use), as prior work has found that FSW report making more money for having condomless sex or using drugs/alcohol with clients [12, 18] . Therefore, while lack of financial support (particularly for children) is one factor that may underlie women's initial involvement in sex work, as indicated in the qualitative data, experiencing financial hardship, regardless of financial support, may increase the likelihood of engaging in behaviors that increase HIV/STI risk. More work is needed, however, to understand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to FSW's perception of financial hardship, and how this uniquely contributes to HIV risk.",

However, in the current study, financial hardship was associated with STI, suggesting that women who experience economic vulnerability may be more willing to engage in behaviors that increase HIV/STI risk. For example, items may be needed to better understand which clients women may be more likely to agree to more money for condomless sexual transactions -and whether certain types of clients present greater risk for STI/HIV. Prior qualitative work among FSW in Mexico has found women are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as inconsistent condom use, with financially lucrative male clients [48] . In addition, given that we found heightened risk for sexual violence among FSW reporting economic vulnerability, violence may also be increasing STI risk. While recent work has started to examine other risk behaviors in addition to inconsistent condom use (e.g., substance use with clients), more work is needed to understand the unique role of economic vulnerability in women's' decision (or lack thereof) to engage in specific behaviors that increase their risk for violence and HIV/STI risk in order to design comprehensive social and structural intervention programs to reduce HIV risk among FSW.",

Financial support was found to be associated only with marital status, suggesting that women not married have less financial support, and in turn, may be more vulnerable to risk behaviors for HIV. While financial support can provide a method for measuring women's financial independence, it may also mean vulnerability often underlies women's involvement in sex work. Findings further indicate that economic vulnerability is associated with greater risk for HIV and violence, particularly sexual violence, among FSW in Tijuana. Findings are consistent with previous, but limited work in other regions of Latin America as well as South Asia documenting the association between economic vulnerability, violence, and HIV risk among FSW [25, 43] . Current study findings build upon this previous work by highlighting the types of economic vulnerability (e.g. no financial support, general reports of financial hardship) and role of economic vulnerability on risk for violence and HIV/STI among FSW in Mexico. The types of economic factors associated with HIV risk appear to vary by context. For example, informal debts were associated with HIV risk in South Asia [12] . However, similar to our study findings, research in Brazil found that more general reports of economic hardship were most salient for determining HIV risk among women working in sex work [25] . Future studies will be needed to further understand the major contributing factors to financial hardship in women's lives (e.g. financially supporting children on their own [44] , challenges in securing stable employment) to inform the development of intervention efforts.",

Prior studies have found FSW experience high levels of physical and sexual violence from both clients and noncommercial partners [45] and women who report engaging in riskier sexual transactions (e.g. sex without a condom) if offered more money are at heightened risk for experiencing violence [48] . Altogether, these findings suggest that reducing economic vulnerability among FSW may also reduce physical and sexual violence and related HIV risk. Programmatic efforts are needed that consider women's' economic situation as primary in affecting risk and health behaviors; economic interventions (e.g., economic empowerment programs) that reduce women's economic reliance on sex work as well as efforts reducing financial urgency that restricts women's options (e.g. ability to refuse certain clients or unsafe situations) while working in sex work may be particularly beneficial.",

While we developed items on economic vulnerability based on our previous work with this population, more research is needed to continue to refine these measures and identify more specific sources of economic vulnerability (e.g. items specifically asking about child support or housing expenses) affecting women's HIV risk. Additionally, it is not known whether the sample, recruited by venue-based sampling, is truly representative of the underlying population of FSW in this geographic location. The sampling strategy could introduce bias if selection of participants is based on some factor relevant to our study outcomes. Current study findings are most applicable to populations of FSW working in Tijuana, Mexico and may not be generalizable to other populations of sex workers from other contexts in Mexico or elsewhere.",

Programs that increase economic opportunities for women have often been theorized as a way to decrease women's reliance on and entry into sex work. There is expanding evidence supporting economic interventions (e.g. those promoting savings and vocational training) as promising in reducing HIV risk among FSW [23, 24] . Our findings further highlight the potential utility for economic interventions to prevent the intersecting concerns of violence and HIV among women while working in sex work. Findings also have implications for the potential adverse effects of larger societal economic downturns (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic) that exacerbate experiences of economic vulnerability, and in turn, further",
