            "text": "A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China (Zhou et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020) as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 . The spread of SARS-CoV-2 was explosive with $140 million confirmed cases and >3 million deaths worldwide as of April 2021. Few therapies are available to treat COVID-19 in humans, and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens to diminish their efficacy. Remdesivir (RDV; Veklury) is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved direct-acting, small molecule antiviral to treat COVID-19. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, RDV showed broad-spectrum activity against highly pathogenic human CoVs, including SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), their related enzootic viruses, and endemic common-cold-causing CoV in various in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of CoV pathogenesis (Brown et al., 2019; de Wit et al., 2020; Sheahan et al., 2017 Sheahan et al., , 2020 . More recently, RDV was shown to exert potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Pruijssers et al., 2020) and therapeutic efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 rhesus macaque model, which recapitulates mild to moderate respiratory symptoms (Williamson et al., 2020) . In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial [ACTT-1]), RDV was shown to shorten recovery time in hospitalized COVID-19 patients by 5 days on average as compared with those receiving placebo (Beigel et al., 2020) . In contrast, in an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, and nonblinded clinical trial (WHO Solidarity trial), RDV was not shown to improve outcomes in hospitalized patients . Importantly, mutations in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) known to interfere with the antiviral activity of RDV are not found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) (Martin et al., 2021) . Because combinations of RDV with immunomodulators (baricitinib) have very recently been shown to improve COVID-19 outcomes over single-agent treatment (Kalil et al., 2021) , it remains unknown whether RDV combinations with other antiviral drugs with complementary modalities will yield similarly promising results.",

Most clinical candidate mAbs are RBD specific and have varying modes of binding and epitope specificities (Barnes et al., 2020a) . Lilly's LY-CoV555 can recognize the RBD in both the up and down conformations (Jones et al., 2020) . REGN10987 binds to the RBD outside the ACE2 binding site, whereas REGN10933 binds to the top of the RBD and competes with the ACE2 binding site (Hansen et al., 2020) . Two recently described highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs, C144 and C135, are currently being evaluated in human trials at the Rockefeller University Hospital (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04700163) and licensed to Bristol Myers Squibb for development (Robbiani et al., 2020) . C144 (inhibitory concentration at which 50% reduction is observed [IC 50 ] = 2.55 ng/mL) and C135 (IC 50 = 2.98 ng/mL) were isolated from convalescent human patients and target non-overlapping sites on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein similar to the REGN mAb cocktail (Barnes et al., 2020a (Barnes et al., , 2020b Robbiani et al., 2020; Sch\u00e4 fer et al., 2021) . Because mAb prophylaxis can prevent COVID-19, preliminary results from human clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs in COVID-19 outpatients have thus far been promising (Weinreich et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020b) .",

Following SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection of standard laboratory mice, virus replicates primarily in ciliated epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes with peak titers by 48 h postinfection (hpi) concurrent with body weight loss, loss of pulmonary function, the development of acute lung injury (ALI), and mortality, consistent with severe human COVID-19 pathogenesis . Here, we define the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of RDV and C144 + C135 mAbs used singly and in combination in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 MA10. We show that the prophylactic and therapeutic administration of RDV or mAb exert a robust antiviral effect, and their ability to abrogate disease diminished as a function of initiation time. When combined, RDV/mAb therapy modestly improved outcomes compared with monotherapy, suggesting that combination ther-apy may provide an additional therapeutic benefit over single agents in humans with COVID-19. Importantly, we demonstrate that C144 + C135 mAb combination protects from severe disease against SARS-CoV-2 South African B.1.351 variant challenge in a mouse model of age-related COVID-19 pathogenesis.

            "text": "Prophylactic and therapeutic RDV protect against COVID-19 in mice First, we sought to determine the time at which RDV therapy would fail to improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Due to a serum esterase absent in humans but present in mice that reduces RDV stability (carboxyesterase 1c [Ces1c]), we performed all of our RDV efficacy studies in C57BL/6 mice that lack this gene (Ces1c \u00c0/\u00c0 ) (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Although we had previously explored the in vivo efficacy of RDV against SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses (Pruijssers et al., 2020) , we had not yet evaluated RDV in mice infected with our recently described SARS-CoV-2 MA10 . We initiated twice-daily treatment of mice with a human equivalent dose of RDV (25 mg/kg) or vehicle \u00c012 h prior to infection or 12 (early), 24 (mid-late), or 48 (late) hpi with 1 3 10 4 particle-forming units (PFUs) of SARS-CoV-2 MA10. Body weight loss is a crude marker of emerging CoV disease in mice. Body weight loss observed in vehicle-treated animals was prevented with prophylactic RDV ( Figure 1A ). When initiated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, only early therapeutic intervention (+12 h) was able to significantly diminish weight loss ( Figure 1A ). Although RDV therapy initiated at 24 h did not prevent weight loss, lung viral load was significantly diminished in this group similar to those receiving prophylaxis (\u00c012 h) or early therapeutic intervention (+12 h) (Figure 1B) . Similarly, lung discoloration, a gross pathologic feature characteristic of severe lung damage, was observed in the vehicle-treated animals but was diminished in all treatment groups except the 48 hpi RDV group ( Figure 1C) . We then used a histologic tool developed by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) to quantitate the pathological features of ALI that we recently utilized to examine the pulmonary pathology of SARS-CoV-2 MA10-infected BALB/c mice Matute-Bello et al., 2011) . Per animal, three random diseased fields in lung tissue sections were blindly evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist for alveolar septal thickening, protein exudate in the air space, hyaline membrane formation, and neutrophils in the interstitium or air spaces. Scoring revealed that RDV prophylaxis and therapy initiated at both +12 and +24 hpi reduced ALI as compared with vehicle-treated animals ( Figures  1D and 2) . A complementary histological tool measuring the pathological hallmark of ALI, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), revealed consistent data ( Figures 1E and 2 ) with those in Figure 1D ( Schmidt et al., 2018; Sheahan et al., 2020) . Lastly, pulmonary function was measured daily in a subset of mice per group (n = 4) by whole-body plethysmography (WBP). As shown with the WBP metric enhanced pause (PenH), a metric for airway resistance or obstruction that was previously validated in animal models of CoV pathogenesis (Menachery et al., 2015; Sheahan et al., 2017) , only prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of RDV (+12 hpi) prevented the loss of pulmonary function observed in the other groups. Together, these data show that prophylactic and therapeutic RDV exert a profound antiviral effect when administered up to 24 hpi, but the ability of RDV therapy to improve disease outcomes wanes with time of initiation.",

To address this, we sought to determine the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of a cocktail of clinical candidate mAbs, C144 and C135, in the SARS-CoV-2 MA10 pathogenesis model noted above. We first established therapeutic efficacy profiles for single mAbs. We treated C57BL/6 mice with mAb C144, mAb C135, or control HIV mAb 12 h before infection or 12, 24, or 48 hpi with 1 3 10 4 PFUs of SARS-CoV-2 MA10 (Figures S1-S4). Both mAbs significantly prevented (prophylactic) or reduced (+12 h, +24 h) SARS-CoV-2 MA10 pathogenesis (body weight loss, lung discoloration, ALI scores, etc.), with C135 exerting more robust protection over C144 with measurable improvements in weight loss and gross pathology even when initiated 48 hpi (Figures S1-S4). Unlike C135 mAb, C144 mAb did not completely prevent virus replication in the lung when administered at 24 hpi, suggesting incomplete viral breakthrough ( Figure S3 ) likely driven by mouse-adapting Q493K spike mutation, which resides in a region critical for C144 binding (Barnes et al., 2020a (Barnes et al., , 2020b Gaebler et al., 2021; Leist et al., 2020) . Neither antibody when administered 48 hpi could prevent weight loss, lung discoloration, or ALI, yet viral lung titers were significantly reduced (Figure S4) . Together, these data demonstrate that clinical candidate mAbs C135 and C144 can both prevent and significantly diminish disease in an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.",

Unlike the uniform and consistent body weight loss observed in SARS-CoV-2 MA10-infected mice treated with negative control HIV mAb, prophylactic, early (+12 h), and mid-late (+24 h) therapeutic administration of C144 + C135 mAbs protected against body weight loss ( Figure 3A ). Initiation of therapy 48 hpi afforded limited protection from body weight loss ( Figure 3A ). Remarkably, the levels of infectious virus in the lung were significantly reduced below the limit of detection (50 PFUs) in all C144 + C135 mAb groups by 5 days postinfection (dpi), unlike control mAb-treated animals (mean lung titer = 1 3 10 4 PFUs/lobe). Mirroring the trend observed in body weight loss, gross lung pathology as measured by observation of lung discoloration was eliminated with prophylactic C144 + C135 mAb, significantly diminished with early (+12 h) and mid-late (+24 h) dosing of C144 + C135 mAb, and even moderately reduced with late (+48 h) therapy.

            "text": "To determine if a further delay in treatment initiation time closer to peak of virus replication in the lung would reveal an improved benefit of combination therapy, we performed a therapeutic efficacy study initiating treatment at 36 hpi. Rather than focus on the Pathologic features of ALI were scored using two separate tools: ATS ALI and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Using these systems, we created an aggregate score for the following features: neutrophils in the alveolar and interstitial space, hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris filling the air spaces, and alveolar septal thickening. Three randomly chosen high-power (360) fields of diseased lung were assessed per mouse. Representative images are shown from HIV mAb and C144 + C135-treated mice. Symbols identifying example features of disease are indicated in the figure. All images were taken at the same magnification. Scale bars indicate 100 mm. potential effects on recovery, the goal of this study was to determine if combination therapy had a differential effect on lung pathology and virus replication during the acute phase of disease. We initiated treatment 36 hpi with 1 3 10 4 PFUs SARS-CoV-2 MA10 in C57BL/6 (Ces1c \u00c0/\u00c0 ) mice with the vehicle, singleagent, and combination groups as described in the previous combination experiment. We observed a small but measurable improvement in body weight loss with RDV/mAb treatment ( Figure 5A ). Similarly, by 3 dpi, only the RDV/control mAb and RDV/mAb-treated groups had lower lung viral titers compared with the vehicle/control mAb-treated group (Figure 5B ). By 5 dpi, vehicle-treated animals had mean lung titers nearing 1 3 10 5 PFUs, yet all treatment groups had significantly reduced lung titers at or near the limit of detection ( Figure 5C ). When examining gross lung pathology 5 dpi, all therapies provided significant protection from lung discoloration observed with vehicle treatment, but RDV/mAb combination therapy group had the overall lowest score and was significantly improved over single-agent vehicle/mAb ( Figure 5D ). We then quantitated the histological manifestations of ALI using the two complementary scoring tools employed above. With both ATS and DAD scoring systems, ALI was readily apparent in vehicle-treated animals ( Figures 5E and  5F ). Although mirroring the trend observed in the gross pathological observations where combination therapy afforded protection over single-agent therapy, significant differences were not observed among groups receiving antiviral therapies, and all reduced ALI on 5 dpi (Figures 5E and 5F ). Lastly, we examined the effect of combination therapy on pulmonary function. Combination RDV/mAb initiated at 36 hpi reduced the loss of pulmonary function observed with vehicle treatment on 3-5 dpi ( Figure 5G ). Altogether, our findings suggest that combination therapy with RDV and potent neutralizing mAbs provides a small but measurable benefit over single agents in some, but not all, metrics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in this model. C144 + C135 mAb prophylaxis and therapy improve outcomes in South African B.1.351 VOC-infected mice The emergence of neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants is a growing threat. B.1.351, which initially emerged in South Africa, is a VOC that can infect mice without adaptation (Montagutelli et al., 2021) . B.1.351 has characteristic RBD mutations at residues K417, E484, and N517, which result in resistance to many of the class 1 and 2 antibodies that dominate the initial RBD-directed neutralizing response (Barnes et al., 2020a; Chen et al., 2021; Planas et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021c) . For example, B.1.351 is completely resistant to Eli Lilly's Ly-CoV555 mAb (Wang et al., 2021a) , underlining the importance of monitoring the in vivo efficacy of mAb therapies that are in advanced clinical testing against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. To examine the in vivo efficacy of the C144 + C135 mAb combination against recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 bearing the B.1.351 spike, we treated aged BALB/c mice with mAb 12 h before or after infection with 1 3 10 4 PFUs. Weight loss observed with control antibody treatment was prevented with C144 + C135 prophylaxis, and lung viral loads were reduced below the limit of detection on both 3 and 5 dpi ( Figures 6A-6C) . Similarly, mAb combination therapy accelerated recovery and diminished virus replication below the limit of detection by 5 dpi (Figures 6A  and 6C ). To complement the infectious virus data, we then quantitated viral subgenomic RNAs in mouse lung tissues in each group. Unlike the quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, which has the potential to measure RNA from infectious particles, defective particles, mAb-bound particles, and various replicative forms of viral RNA, these subgenomic RNA qRT-PCR assays are specific for envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) viral transcripts that are made only in actively replicating cells. Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of C144 + C135 significantly reduced lung viral E subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) ( Figures  6D and 6E ) and N sgRNA ( Figures 6F and 6G ) compared with the control mAb-treated animals, indicating that mAb therapy successfully reduced levels of replication of SARS-CoV-2 bearing the B.1.351 spike in vivo. Finally, gross pathology caused by mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 bearing the B.1.351 spike was significantly reduced in aged mice with both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of the C144 + C135 combination (Figures 6H and 6I) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that both prophylaxis and therapy with combination C144 + C135 mAb can potently reduce virus replication and improve disease outcomes in vivo following infection with variant B.1.351.",

            "text": "In this study, we aimed to define the time after SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice where RDV or mAb therapy fail to exert an antiviral effect and/or fail to improve disease outcomes. Like mouseadapted models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the replication kinetics of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 in mice is compressed with peak replication in the lung 48 hpi . In contrast, the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways of humans is more variable with reports estimating peak replication within the first week after the onset of symptoms Zheng et al., 2020) . Moreover, human patients can shed viral RNA in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract as long as 24 dpi (Zhou et al., 2020a) , underlining that sustained viral shedding and symptoms can last considerably longer in humans than in mice. Thus, the window within which to intervene with antiviral therapy prior to the peak of virus replication in humans is dramatically different from in mice ($2 days). Although our mouse model faithfully recapitulates many aspects of human COVID-19 (e.g., high titer replication in the upper and lower airways, loss of pulmonary function, ALI, age-related exacerbation of disease, etc.), it is not possible to very finely correlate the compressed kinetics of disease in mouse and those in humans, but there are a few notable takeaways from the modeling presented herein. Given early therapeutic treatment at +12 and +24 hpi in our model provided the most benefit, it is likely the benefit of antibody and small molecule antivirals like RDV will be maximized if given prior to peak viral replication and/or early in the disease course before patients are hospitalized. In addition, we show a small improvement with combination mAb/RDV over singleagent therapy, which suggests that combinations of antiviral drugs of disparate modalities may offer an additional benefit in COVID-19 patients over single agents, something that should be rigorously evaluated in humans. Although our studies clearly support the use/evaluation of RDV and mAb as treatments for COVID-19, both are administered intravenously, limiting their broad distribution to COVID-19 outpatients. Potential strategies to allow the wider dissemination of these treatments may include chemical alteration of RDV to facilitate oral bioavailability and/or less complicated subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of mAbs. The effect of mAb injection route (i.e., subcutaneous versus intravenous) on pharmacokinetics and safety is currently being evaluated for C144 and C135 in phase 1 clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04700163).",

Importantly, the C144 + C135 cocktail demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against the B.1.351 VOC, which is encouraging given that this variant has demonstrated full escape from other mAbs approved for emergency use in humans, such as the LY-CoV555. In addition, Figure 6 .

Error bars denote min and max. the neutralizing potency of the AstraZeneca and Brii Biosciences mAbs in clinical trials are clearly dampened by mutations present in the variants, such as the B.1.351 (Wang et al., 2021b) . The target of the antiviral activity of RDV is the viral RdRp. Importantly, hallmark mutations of current SARS-CoV-2 VOCs are not found in regions of the RdRp known to affect the antiviral potency of RDV; thus, antiviral resistance to RDV is not currently anticipated with current VOCs (Martin et al., 2021) . In the context of emerging variants in the future, it will be critical to continue to evaluate the prevention and therapy of currently approved small molecule and mAb antivirals and those in clinical development against newly emerging variants of interest. Our results reveal that prophylaxis and therapy with the C144 + C135 mAb combination has high efficacy against the B.1.351 VOC spike in vivo and can diminish the development of disease during an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. These data support the further evaluation of this mAb cocktail as therapy in human patients infected with the B.1.351 variant.",

Eleven-month-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Envigo (#047). A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (MA10) was used in all experiments and this virus was previously described . Briefly, mutations predictive of increased affinity to mouse ACE2 were introduced into a SARS-CoV-2 virus plasmid system and the virus was recovered by reverse genetics (Dinnon et al., 2020) . This modified virus was then serially passaged in aged BALBc mice (Envigo #047) for ten passages which we refer to as the mouse-adapted passage 10 (MA10) SARS-CoV-2 . A mouse-adapted (MA10) backbone expressing the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 spike was generated for this study.

RT-QPCRreactions were carried out on a CFX Opus 384 machine (Bio-Rad) using a program below: reverse transcription at 50 C for 5 minutes, initial denaturation at 95 C for 20 s, then 40 cycles of denaturation-annealing-extension at 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 30 s. Standard curves were used to calculate E or N sgRNA in copies per ml; the limit of detections (LOD) for both E and N sgRNA assays were 150 copies per lung lobe. Biocontainment and biosafety Studies were approved by the UNC Institutional Biosafety Committee approved by animal and experimental protocols in the Baric laboratory. All work described here was performed with approved standard operating procedures for SARS-CoV-2 in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility conforming to requirements recommended in the Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories",
