This makes sexual history an essential part of the history taking process, and potentially a vital piece of the diagnostic puzzle. A recent case of a 70-year-old male who was referred by his GP to our oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) department with refractory OC and was then later diagnosed with HIV has prompted this letter.",

The average range of force exerted when eating carrots or meat is 70 to 150 N. 1 The website for the device has numerous claims without any medical backing including improved collagen stimulation, improved jaw function and relief of TMJD symptoms. It seems likely that the repeated use of this device will result in far more stresses on the TMJ and cause significant wear on the articular disc potentially triggering various TMJD symptoms from crepitus to complete dislocation.
