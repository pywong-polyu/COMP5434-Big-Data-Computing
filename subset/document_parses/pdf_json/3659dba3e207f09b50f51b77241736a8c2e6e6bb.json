In short time intervals, however, nucleotide substitutions are ineffective to record all complexities of virus population dynamics. In this sense, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses a challenge for evolutionary analysis. We used computer simulation to evolve populations in scenarios of varying temporal intervals to evaluate the impact of the age of an epidemic on estimates of time and geography. Before estimating virus timescales, the shape of tree topologies can be used as a proxy to assess the effectiveness of the virus phylogeny in providing accurate estimates of evolutionary parameters. In short timescales, estimates have larger uncertainty. We compared the predictions from simulations with empirical data. The tree shape of SARS-CoV-2 was closer to shorter timescales scenarios, which yielded parametric estimates with larger uncertainty, suggesting that estimates from these datasets should be evaluated cautiously. To increase the accuracy of the estimates of virus transmission times between populations, the uncertainties associated with the age estimates of both the crown and stem nodes should be communicated. We place the age of the common ancestor of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late September 2019, corroborating an earlier emergence of the virus.",

When trees are rooted, a time direction, implying ancestor-to-descendent relationship, is incorporated into phylogenies. Although rooted topologies are time-oriented, branch lengths are not necessarily proportional to absolute time units (Felsenstein, 2004) . In order to fully incorporate the temporal dimension onto trees, divergence times of nodes must be estimated. When genetic divergences between genomes are linearly related to the age in which genomes shared a common ancestor, this task is straightforward (Kumar, 2005) . By employing some calibration information, a direct linear transformation may be readily applied. This is the standard molecular clock, in which sequence substitution rates are constant along branches and across lineages. However, since the 1970s, rate constancy was found to be the exception rather than the rule (Langley and Fitch, 1974; Gillespie and Langley, 1979) . Alternatively, timescales may be inferred by accommodating rate variation among lineages (Gillespie, 1991; Kishino et al., 2001; Bromham et al., 2018) .",

Although frequently ignored, the age of the circulating virus population will affect the sampling strategy required for accurate inference of evolutionary parameters. Depending on the mutation rate, virus populations that successfully infected a new host species may not accumulate enough substitutions to allow for phylogenetic inference within a few generations after the initial transmission, resulting in branch lengths close to zero, and an large number of duplicated sequences (Boskova and Stadler, 2020) . In a longer timescale, nucleotide substitutions shared by allelic lineages arise and the tree-like hierarchical relationship between sequences also emerges. The absence of the tree-like structure between sequences is a consequence of both the mutation rate and the time duration of internal branches and not of the coalescent process that model virus genealogies, i.e., the lines of descent (Figure 1 ). For instance, an interval between coalescent events of 10 generations is equivalent to a branch length close to zero substitutions/site in reconstructed phylogenies, even assuming the elevated mutation rates of RNA viruses.",

When transmission events along geographic areas take place, the sampling of the genetic diversity of the donor virus population is often incomplete and, because of the stochasticity of the coalescent process, both the ages of common ancestors of genomes and the monophyly of the virus genetic diversity in geographic areas is affected (Figure 1 ). This probability of mismatch between both trees (population history and gene genealogy) is increased if the time interval between transmission events is short and the level of genetic diversity is high (Tajima, 1983; Pamilo and Nei, 1988) . This problem is equivalent to the mismatch between the species phylogeny and the gene tree in molecular phylogenetics, which is modeled by the multispecies coalescent (Liu et al., 2009; Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009) , and will impact the estimates of the age of the epidemic as well as the recovery of the true pattern of the virus spread in space.",

However, confidence intervals between these inferences were large. Most studies so far places the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of circulating SARS-CoV-2 in November or December 2019, although confidence intervals extends from late September to late December 2019 (Biggerstaff et al., 2020) . Lai et al., (2020) , compared the performance of strict versus relaxed molecular clocks to estimate the age of the common ancestor of 52 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, and obtained 18 Nov. of 2019, with 95% credibility interval ranging from 10 Sept. 2019 to 28 Dec. 2019, as the most likely date.

Three parameters were investigated: the age of the epidemic (the root node), the ages of the transmission events, and geographical association, which are the main parameters inferred by most studies of virus evolution, with consequences for designing health policies. Our simulations were implemented using R scripts and consisted of populations that evolved under the standard neutral model, using Wright-Fisher sampling of haploid individual genes of 1500 bp; this sequence length has been shown sufficient to control for the effects of nucleotide sampling errors (Yang and Rannala, 2006) . At each generation, which was equal to one day in our simulation, sites were mutated at a rate of 3 x 10 -8 substitutions/ site under the Jukes-Cantor model. This rate is equivalent to a per year rate of 1 x 10 -5 s/s, which is the average rate for RNA viruses. The effective population sizes were set to 1000 individuals. Although this value is arguably smaller than empirical virus population sizes, it is appropriate for the computational demands of forward-time simulations that aim to generate tree topology shapes from short-term evolutionary dynamics.",

This simple simulation allowed the investigation of the evolutionary parameters in different epidemiological timescales. Four scenarios were investigated by varying the total temporal extent of the epidemy, which equaled the age of the population from area A. In the first scenario, henceforth referred to 10Y, the age of the common ancestor (tmrca) of the population from area A was 10 years. The transmission event to area B took place 8 years ago, while transmissions from B to areas C and D occurred at 6 and one year ago, respectively. In the second scenario, 2Y, the common ancestor of population A was 2 years old, and the transmission to area B occurred 5 months later. From population B, transmissions to areas B and C took place at 1 year and 6 months ago, respectively. In the remaining two scenarios, we simulated the rapid geographic spread of a virus within less than one year. In scenario 6M, the age of population of A was 6 months, the transmission to B occurred three months later, and transmissions from B to C and D occurred at 3 and 1 month ago respectively. Finally, in scenario 1M, all transmissions took place within a single month (age of A): from A to B at 20 days ago; from B to C and D at 10 and 5 days ago respectively. For each scenario, we evolved 300 independent replicates. In each replicate, sequences were sampled serially along time intervals to yield approximately 28 sequences.

It is clear that the ages of the stem nodes were better approximations of the true ages of the transmission events than the ages of the crown nodes. Using the ages of the stem nodes, errors associated with the estimates ranged from 0.9% to 3.1% of the total time duration, whereas the crown node yielded 4.1% to 4.8%. Under this scenario, the age of the root was also estimated accurately (0.7% error). As the total duration of the epidemic narrowed, the age of the root became increasingly harder to estimate; the mean difference between the estimates and the true ages shifted from 0.9% (10Y) to 1157.2% (1M) of the root age (Table 1 ). In shorter timescales (6M and 1M), the best approximations of the ages of transmission events were inconsistent, because in four cases the ages of the crown nodes were closer to the true value, whereas the remaining two cases were best inferred by the ages of the stem nodes. In most cases, the true transmission ages lied between the estimated ages of the stem and crown nodes.

In the 1M scenario, this metric varied significantly between topologies (Figure 3 ). The two most informative topological metrics to differentiate the scenarios were the peakedness and the number of peaks (the eigen gap, or the number of modalities) of the density profiles ( Figure 3 ). Similar to the shift metric, the peakedness of topologies tended to decrease in shorter timescales, and the variance of the metric was larger in both 10Y and 1M scenarios. The number of peaks (modes of evolution) was 1 in most topologies from the 10Y and 2Y datasets.

In 6M and 1M, the majority of topologies were assigned to the same cluster (cluster 2, green, Figure 4) . A small amount of the 2Y topologies were also assigned to this cluster, whereas near zero topologies from the 10Y scenario were assigned to cluster 2. On the other hand, most 10Y trees were assigned to cluster 1 (salmon, Figure 4) , which was almost exclusively found in 10Y trees. Overall, 10Y and 2Y topologies generated distinct cluster assignment profiles that were also distinct from the 6M and 1M profiles. The Jensen-Shannon distances between spectral densities of topologies corroborated the cluster profiles (Table 3) . As timescales narrowed, J-S distances tended to increase when compared to the 10Y trees. Therefore, the mean distance between trees from the 10Y and 1M scenarios was the highest inter-scenarios distance. It is worth noting that the 10Y scenario was the case with the highest intra-scenario mean distance. ",

Schrago and Barzilai 8 Figure 5 -Comparison between the spectral density of SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny for each genomic ORF with the spectral densities of topologies simulated in each scenario. Comparisons were carried out using the Jensen-Shannon (J-S) distance. When inferring the ages of transmission events, a simple strategy that improves the success rate of recovering the true age is to employ a bracketing approach, in which both the ages of the crown and stem nodes are communicated. However, when the genetic diversity of the epidemic finds its common ancestor within few generations ago, the interval between the ages of the crown and stem nodes might fail to encompass the true ages. In fact, in such scenarios, the age of the common ancestor of the epidemic (root node) is also harder to estimate, as well as the dynamics of viruses in space. In long-term epidemic scenarios, however, the age of the stem node is the best approximation of the true transmission times, although the age of crown node is frequently used as an estimate of this parameter.",

Firstly, the low genetic diversity of recent epidemics. If mutations accumulate randomly at a fixed rate, which was the assumption employed to simulate our sequences, then at short time intervals the probability of observing new mutations is lower. The intervals between coalescence events, which define the internal branch lengths, will likely have zero length when measured in units of substitutions/site. Therefore, the structure of the virus phylogeny will be largely random, because sequences lack information on the evolutionary history of virus populations. Such problem could be alleviated by sampling more sites of the virus genome. Assuming that mutation rate is homogeneous across sites, sampling more sites will increase the probability of finding substitutions shared by more than two sequences (internal branches). However, because virus genomes are limited in length, this may not be feasible.",

The finding that monophyly of the genetic diversity within populations may not be recovered even with a single founder virus genome exemplifies how hard it is to infer the spatial dynamics of a recent pandemic. The difficulty in estimating evolutionary parameters will obviously increase in more complex epidemiological scenarios, such as recurrent gene flow between areas (multiple transmission events) and differential selection along the genome (Leach\u00e9 et al., 2014; Sol\u00eds-Lemus et al., 2016) .

(2020) at 11 Dec. 2019, if confidence intervals are accounted for, one cannot rule out the hypothesis that these estimates are statistically equivalent. The same applies to the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2. As shown in our simulations, this higher uncertainty is expected in short-term epidemic scenarios. Our estimate, 1.24 x 10 -4 subst./site/year, is in agreement with the values calculated for RNA virus along the last decades (Peck and Lauring, 2018) , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate is not unique. Unfortunately, the bracketing approach for establishing transmission times is not applicable to the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, because its closest known sister lineage, the RaTG13 sequence is evolutionarily distant, artificially increasing the lower bound for the age of the common ancestor (stem node) (Boni et al., 2020) . However, the strategy can be used to evaluate the age of transmission events along SARS-CoV-2 diversification. Recently, Candido et al. (2020) inferred the age of the common ancestor of the earliest among the largest of the Brazilian clade at 22 Feb 2020 (crown node). Following the rationale developed here, we argue that the uncertainty of this estimate should also include the age of the stem node, which would push the entry time of the ancestor of this clade into Brazil to early February.",

Metrics of tree topology shape are thus a useful proxy for evaluating the probability that evolutionary parameters were accurately inferred. We showed that short-term epidemics (SARS-CoV-2, SARS 2003 , H1N1 2009 , EVOV 2014 ) could be distinguished from long-term circulating viruses (HIV-1B, HCV-1a and DENV-1). Metrics of SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny were similar to simulated scenarios of very recent population dynamics, which resulted in parametric estimates with large uncertainty. Health policies drawn from SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary estimates should thus be designed cautiously.
