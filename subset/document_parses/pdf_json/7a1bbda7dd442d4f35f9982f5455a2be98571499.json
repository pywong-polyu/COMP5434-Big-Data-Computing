Conspiracy theories can be defined as \"explanatory beliefs about a group of actors that collude in secret to reach malevolent goals\" [2] . Van Prooijen and Jostmann [3] point out four relevant aspects of these theories: \"conspiracy theories are consequential as they have a real impact on people's health, relationships, and safety; they are universal in that belief in them is widespread across times, cultures, and social settings; they are emotional given that negative emotions and not rational deliberations cause conspiracy beliefs; and they are social as conspiracy beliefs are closely associated with psychological motivations underlying intergroup conflict.\"",

            "text": "One problem that has many similarities with the rejection of vaccines is the opposition to the road safety measures promoted by the governments of the countries. Thus, it is common to observe certain degrees of distrust on the part of some sectors of the population both towards the alleged effectiveness of the measures and of the actual reasons underlying the efforts behind their promotion-with the implication that there are ulterior motives. This distrust often materializes in statements that go against the statistical evidence or the recommendations of the experts, such as that seat belts can be dangerous for drivers because \"one can fall into a lake and not have time to unfasten it\"; that airbags \"do more harm than good in a crash\"; that helmets are only capable of protecting \"something that has the shape of a head in the laboratory but not in real accidents\", so forcing the people to use them is an infringement on their personal liberties [7] ; or that speed surveillance cameras are \"tax cameras\" [8] . For example, Morelock et al. [9] studied the opposition and support for the mandatory seat belt laws in New England and signaled that \"despite the many efforts of public officials to alter the public's knowledge about seatbelt effectiveness, it appears from these analysis that many common myths about seatbelts have not been dispelled\". Examples of what they regarded as myth about seat belts -given the scientific evidence-were: as follows \"It is better to be thrown clear of the car if you are in a serious accident\"-14% of the respondents strongly thought this was true-or \"A person who is wearing a set belt is less likely to be injured in a serious accident than a person who does not wear one\"-31% believed this. Their data also showed that the people supporting those myths were more inclined to oppose a mandatory belt use law, used seatbelts less, reported more heavy drinking and smoking marijuana before driving, and had more crashes than the rest of the population [9] . In the past, these kinds of beliefs have constituted the basis for opposing the enactment or the application of legislation supporting certain road safety measures, despite the evidence of the benefits that they would bring in terms of crashes and casualties. The lack of confidence in the road safety measures often affects only small percentages of the population, but, unfortunately, the media usually magnifies the real opposition and fosters the false perception that the measures are unpopular with the public at large [10] .",

Kaviani et al. [28] explores nomophobia, or smartphone addiction [23] , as another factor of importance, particularly for young people [29, 30] . Similar to other safety measures, laws banning smartphone use while driving are not as effective as desired [31, 32] , and they may even have worsened the problem according to Jannusch et al.

For example, answering a call using the hands-free phone device (question d) has fundamentally cognitive elements.

The manual element is greater if the call is answered without the hands-free device (question b).

In this model, gender, age (treated in this case as a numerical variable and not divided into categories as before), and the academic level of the participants as covariates were also introduced, since these variables have been shown to have an impact on the use of the smartphone behind the wheel. The two parts of this model, the measurement part and the structural part, can be consulted in Tables 6 and 7 . A graphic diagram of the structural part of model can be seen in Figure 1 . The model presented an adequate adjustment according to both the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI): the former gave a value of 0.977 (above 0.9, which is considered to be the adequate value), and the latter gave a value of 0.981, which is also above the appropriate value of 0.9. Finally, the root mean square error of approximation was 0.038, with a significance value of 1 for the value of 0.05. The test of RMSEA is not significant, which means that we do not reject the null hypothesis that the RMSEA is less than or equal to 0.05. In this study, all factor loadings in the two latent variables reached statistical significance with p-values lower than 0.001. The indicator of composite reliability was computed from factorial loadings \u03c9 = 0.67 for the scale about conspiracy ideas, and \u03c9 = 0.82 for the scale about use of the smartphone at the wheel.",

[9] called \"myths\", because they felt that the government was not doing its work well [8] , or because they were afraid that their individual liberties were at risk [7] . The percentage of people opposing the measures may vary in each case, but the results in Munnich Jr and Loveland [10] pointed that its size was often overemphasized by the media, and there were actually more citizens in support of the law than was represented in news coverage. However, in contrast with other road safety measures, there is not a organized civil movement fighting against the use of the smartphones at the wheel, but it seems that the percentage of people somewhat supporting it might be relatively large for one reason or another. In fact, taking into account the demographic variables used in this study, this support would be quite uniform between males and females, and among groups of age, although in depends on the academic level of the subjects, as those with low education expressed more agreement with many of the statements than the other groups.",

This statement assumes a causal relationship between maintaining conspiracy theories and the conduct of the subjects, which if applied to this specific case would lead to the assertion that conspiracy beliefs about smarphone use at the wheel can make the subjects who hold these beliefs behave more imprudently than those who do not, which results in crashes and/or injuries. There is plenty of evidence that links the distractions caused by the smartphones at the wheel with crashes, so it seems straightforward to connect the conspiracy beliefs to crashes throughout the use of the smartphone at the wheel as intermediate step. Future research should be able to prove such a relationship, but we should not jump to conclusions before such evidence is available.",

Therefore, van Prooijen and van Vugt [39] mention three interventions or practical implications supported by the research on conspiracy theories: (1) providing rational arguments against specific theories reduces belief in them; (2) instilling feelings of security among the public as anxiety or lack of control increases belief in conspiracy theories [39] [40] [41] ; (3) working on the social dimension of conspiracy theories, being careful for example that the groups more reluctant to adopt a recommendation do not perceive it as a menace specifically targeted to them.",
