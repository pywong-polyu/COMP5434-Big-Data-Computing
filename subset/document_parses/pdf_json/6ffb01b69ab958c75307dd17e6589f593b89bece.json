This can be explained, at least in part, by the evidence that the oral cavity is a hostile environment for the establishment of infectious agents due to the presence of both mechanical and molecular mechanisms related to digestion [39] . More specifically, Fakhry et al. [39] conducted a study that directly compared the local immunologic profiles of the oral cavities and cervices of healthy women using paired secretion specimens. This study showed that the oral cavity contained significantly higher concentrations of immunoregulatory factors that were related to the adaptive and cellmediated immune response than the cervix, which may in part explain the significantly lower burden of sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, HPV, and HIV-1 in the oral cavity than in the cervix. According to the authors, these findings provide additional information to better understand the differences in the etiology and natural history of pathogenic agents that are capable of colonizing both the oral cavity and female reproductive tract. The most prevalent HPV types in the cervical samples from both HIV+ and HIV-women were hrHPV18 and hrHPV58; however, hrHPV45 and hrHPV16 were frequently detected in HIV+ women and HIV-women, respectively. Prevalence studies around the world have shown that hrHPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 52 , and 58 are the most commonly detected hrHPVs in CC, with hrHPV16 being the most common in all populations, with the exception of HIV+ people [1] . Data have consistently shown that HIV+ women are frequently more infected with other hrHPV types than hrHPV16 and hrHPV18, such as hrHPV52 and hrHPV58 [40] . The high prevalence of non-vaccine hrHPV types of 2-valent and 4-valent vaccines in the cervical and oral mucosa found in our study suggests that the 9-valent HPV vaccine is significantly required, which is considered important to reduce the risk of developing HPV-related cancers, specifically in the HIV+ population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 494, "end": 498, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 499, "end": 503, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 504, "end": 508, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 742, "end": 746, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1839, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1843, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1847, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1851, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1855, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1858, "text": "52", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2005, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2163, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Unlike the distribution of HPV types in cervical samples, HPV type concordance between the HIV+ and HIV-groups was not observed in oral samples. hrHPV39 was the most common hrHPV detected in oral samples of HIV+ women, followed by hrHPV18, hrHPV45, hrHPV52, and hrHPV68, with these types being also frequently found in cervical samples in the same group.
