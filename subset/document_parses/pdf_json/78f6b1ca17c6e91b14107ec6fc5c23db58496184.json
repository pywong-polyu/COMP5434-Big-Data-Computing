First, both confusion about testing eligibility and concerns about the cost of the test suggests suboptimal communication about criteria for testing, which changed frequently. Email was the primary mode of communication during the pandemic, but many HCWs do not access their work email consistently. Communication strategies that include all employees may address disparities in access to timely and relevant information. Second, changing workplace policies around sick leave is one potential employer action to encourage testing. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs regularly worked while sick due to staffing concerns and fear of letting colleagues down. 3,4 Among our sample, 18% of respondents reported that they did not get a SARS-CoV-2 test due to concerns about using up their sick time, while 8% reported that they did not get a SARS-CoV-2 test due to concerns over lost wages if they tested positive and had to quarantine. In Massachusetts, being told to self-quarantine by a medical professional is a qualifying reason to apply for unemployment insurance, but this was not communicated to TuftsMC staff. 5, 6 Designating certain staff as sick relief, rather than requiring others to work doubles or without cover, and clarifying what constitutes too sick to work are recommended workplace policies that encourage employees to stay home if they are sick. 7 Employees in this study who were required to get tested in order to return to work were more likely to do so, demonstrating that managerial support of testing and adequate coverage for employees was effective at ensuring employee SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

This introduces selection bias to our results, as it is likely that there are different barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing among those who did not report wanting a test. Secondly, the survey responses were created as options within \"select all that apply\" questions, and therefore were not independent of each other. Third, contracted employees, such as traveling nurses, dialysis clinic staff, or members of the environmental services team, were not considered hospital employees and therefore excluded from data collection. Because these contracted employees frequently held positions with high risk of exposure but did not receive employer benefits, it is likely that they experienced significant barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing.",
