Methods: This population-based cohort study used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Administration data on FPICP (fiscal year 2015-2016, with follow-up duration of one year). Participants included diabetic patients aged \u226530 in primary care clinics. We used conditional logistic regression modeling of patient characteristics and annual diabetes examinations and compared FPICP participants with non-participating candidates. Main outcome measures included completion of annual diabetes examinations, including glycated hemoglobin (A1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), urine microalbumin (MAU), routine urinalysis (UR), and fundus examination (FE).",

Taiwan's National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) selects patients that incur higher medical costs among the target patients on a yearly basis to compile a list of FPICP candidates. For each patient, the primary care physician providing the most frequent healthcare service is invited to join the program by entering a Community Healthcare Group (CHCG) and registering the patient as an FPICP participant. Each CHCG is formed by five to ten clinics in a community with at least one community hospital or medical center in the same living area as their backup and mutual referral. Through continuous medical educational meetings and case discussions with hospital physicians every month, CHCGs intensify the communication and education among the colleagues. For patient care, the CHCGs and its referral hospital(s) work together to establish primary community care networks and receive FPICP incentives from the healthcare authorities. For physicians per participant per year, FPICP provides a payment of 250 points (1 point = NTD 0.9, the floating point value under the global budget scheme since 2001) as case management fee and 550 points bonus if performance passes certain quality assessments. The quality assessment indicators of FPICP are primarily preventive healthcare services, such as an influenza vaccination, adult health examination, and cancer screenings (Pap smear for cervical cancer, faecal immunochemical test for colon cancer, and oral cancer screening by inspection). A detailed list of quality assessment indicators is provided in Appendix 1.",

A brief explanation of propensity-score matching in this study is shown in Appendix 2. According to our previous study, FPICP patients had slightly lower prevalence of several chronic diseases, including diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, systemic embolism, cerebral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease [3] . The presence of these chronic conditions are related to diabetes or its complications (macrovascular or microvascular) [7] , and would influence the physicians' behavior of ordering related examinations. In addition, participation in the diabetes pay-for-performance program (DMP4P) also influences the completion rate of diabetes examination. Therefore, we included above-mentioned variables along with age and gender in the propensity score matching. The ICD-9 codes used in this study are provided in Table S1 .",

These factors affect the disease status of diabetes, and could be related to the adherence and communication between patient and doctor. Missing the information could bias the study results by overestimating the influence of FPICP if the participants had a higher level of health literacy and adherence, and by underestimating if the situation was the opposite. Second, since we used ICD-9-CM codes to identify diagnoses and comorbidities, our estimates may overestimate the true prevalence, as physicians might make tentative diagnoses based on their impressions. Third, we were unable to compare the quality of care between participants and nonparticipants before the FPICP in 2015; therefore, higher rates of proper checkups for diabetic patients might also result from the fundamental differences in healthcare providers of these two groups of patients.",

The inspection frequency depends on whether the data and records check out. Compared to total cholesterol or triglyceride, LDL may be less frequently checked in the primary care setting because of the availability and deletion by NHIA. MAU is also less available in community care compared to urine protein analysis. Instead, urine protein or routine urinalysis is used to replace MAU. That is a major reason why A1c had the best completion rate in our study. FPICP grants an incentive made up of 10% weighting of quality assessment on preventable hospitalization for complications related to chronic diseases, including diabetes (Appendix 1).",

Although significant in statistics, the influences of FPICP on the completion rates of diabetes examinations are small, as the program was not solely focused on diabetes care. However, according to Taiwan's National Health Research Institutes, the number of diabetic patients are 2.2 millions in 2014, accounting for 9.3% of Taiwanese population [13] . Compared to 840 thousand diabetic patients in 2000, the population has increased 2.6 times. In this sense, 1 % difference in completion rate affects 22 thousand patients, and the population is growing approximately 7% per year.

This finding is likely to be related to the expertise and equipment needed to screen for diabetic retinopathy, which is usually performed by ophthalmologists. To further support this, we compared the medical specialty of the FPICP member physicians to that of local practicing physicians in total. FPICP member physicians were more likely to be specialized in family medicine (32.8%), internal medicine (19.0%), and pediatrics (14.1%). In contrast, ophthalmologists accounted for only 3.8% of FPICP physicians, compared to 6.3% among all local practicing physicians. A detailed comparison is shown in Table S3 . In a study with a small sample size by Gill et al., eleven family physicians in Delaware assessed twenty-eight standardized patients with diabetes using nonmydriatic ophthalmoscope [14] . The mean sensitivity was 87% with a specificity of 57%, indicating that the technique of the family physicians was not sufficiently effective in screening for diabetic retinopathy. Likewise, primary care physicians in Taiwan who join FPICP might also be less familiar with ophthalmoscopy than they are with other diabetes examinations, thus resulting in a suboptimal completion rate in FE examination. This finding indicates that actions are needed to facilitate primary care referrals to local ophthalmologist's clinics or using artificial intelligence-assisted devices that can help with the screening or diagnosis of diabetes retinopathy.",

In other words, for NHIA-selected patients who are not enrolled in FPICP, their primary care clinics are those that do not apply for the yearly project. It is possible that what helps improve the quality of diabetes care are primary care clinics providing better diabetes care, and they are more inclined to join other P4P programs, rather than FPICP itself.

The variety might be a result of the year of study, the level of hospitals/clinics providing services, the accessibility of medical resources, and the intervention of healthcare programs among the cohorts. In earlier studies conducted before 2005 by Tseng et al. and Hsu et al., the completion rate of A1c examination were 3.3% (data from clinics) and 51.6% respectively [17, 18] . These studies reported lower completion rates probably because of the lower availability of diabetes examination in that era. It is worth noting that the study by Tseng et al. shares the same setting of primary care clinics as our study, whereas most other studies we were able to identify report the completion rates of examinations at both clinics and hospitals together. One cross-sectional study on DMP4P participants in 2008 revealed 100 and 92% completion rate of A1c examination among enrolled and non-enrolled patients [19] . The perfect completion rate of A1c examination indicated the impressive effectiveness of DMP4P on enrolled patients. However, the arbitrariness of patient enrollment in DMP4P could also produce a selection bias in that study. Another study on participants of a diabetes management program in Changhua reported a 92.2% completion rate of A1c examination in 2012 [20] . According to that study, the result was better in the participants than in the general population, demonstrating the efficacy of the diabetes management program.

Since significant differences in the design of P4P programs and healthcare system among countries can arise, we assume that the results of this study are The odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (in parentheses) were estimated with an interaction term (FPICP * DMP4P) using multiple logistic regressions. Other independent variables for adjusted odds ratios include age, gender, and comorbidities DMP4P Diabetes Pay-for-performance program, FPICP Taiwan's Family Practice Integrated Care Project more applicable to healthcare systems based on the Beveridge Model, such as the ones in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, or to those with a single-payer insurance scheme, such as the ones in Canada and South Korea. Taiwan's experience of FPICP demonstrate that, for patients making frequent OPD visits, incentivizing primary care physicians with case management fee and bonus for quality performance helps to successfully promote preventive healthcare services and improve patients' satisfaction [2] , as well as improve holistic healthcare in terms of the process of care. The design of FPICP in Taiwan may serve as a reference for health care policy makers interested in launching an integrated primary care program with P4P features.",
