This report describes the design and methods of a study evaluating the potential of ES as a routine clinical tool for pediatric patients who have suspected genetic conditions and who are in the early stages of the diagnostic odyssey. Methods: The North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-generation Exome Sequencing (NCGENES) 2 study is an interdisciplinary, multi-site Phase III randomized controlled trial of two interventions: educational pre-visit preparation (PVP) and offer of first-line ES. In this full-factorial design, parent-child dyads are randomly assigned to one of four study arms (PVP + usual care, ES + usual care, PVP + ES + usual care, or usual care alone) in equal proportions. Participants are recruited from Pediatric Genetics or Neurology outpatient clinics in three North Carolina healthcare facilities. Eligible pediatric participants are < 16 years old and have a first visit to a participating clinic, a suspected genetic condition, and an eligible parent/guardian to attend the clinic visit and complete study measures. The study oversamples participants from underserved and under-represented populations. Participants assigned to the PVP arms receive an educational booklet and question prompt list before clinical interactions. Randomization to offer of first-line ES is revealed after a child's clinic visit. Parents complete measures at baseline, pre-clinic, post-clinic, and two follow-up timepoints. Study clinicians provide phenotypic data and complete",

Discussion: NCGENES 2 will contribute valuable knowledge concerning technical, clinical, psychosocial, and health economic issues associated with using early diagnostic ES to shorten the diagnostic odyssey of pediatric patients with likely genetic conditions. Results will inform efforts to engage diverse populations in genomic medicine research and generate evidence that can inform policy, practice, and future research related to the utility of first-line diagnostic ES in health care.

            "text": "For patients with a suspected genetic condition, the \"diagnostic odyssey\" can be a period of considerable uncertainty characterized by multiple clinical interactions and potentially distressing procedures aimed at identifying the underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms [1, 2] . Often commencing at birth or early in childhood and sometimes continuing well into adulthood, the diagnostic odyssey can be emotionally and financially draining for patients and families. Genome-scale sequencing (GS), used to collectively refer to sequencing of the protein-coding regions (the exome) or the entire genome, is an evolving technology with demonstrated utility for identifying molecular diagnoses among people with suspected underlying genetic disorders [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Expanding clinical understanding of sequence variants, improvements in sequencing technologies, and decreasing costs are driving the clinical use of diagnostic GS, including in neonates and critically ill infants with suspected genetic disorders [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, there is still much to learn about the potential impact of GS in diagnosing conditions with clinical presentation in childhood or later that are often genetically heterogenous and elude diagnosis through routine medical care. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the utility of GS for pediatric patients early in their diagnostic odyssey.",

However, this body of literature also highlighted the need for additional research about optimal and equitable clinical integration of GS, such as cost-benefit tradeoffs of GS compared with traditional approaches to diagnosis in standard clinical care, short-and long-term ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genomic sequencing for families (including potential clinical and personal benefits of shortening the diagnostic odyssey), and the need to dramatically improve communication between clinicians and laboratorians and the patients, families, and communities who will receive and seek to understand their diagnostic sequencing results [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Though previous research has examined aspects of clinical GS and informed various facets of its use in clinical practice, the goal of the Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research consortium (the currently active CSER Consortium, or \"CSER 2\") [19] is to provide a broader understanding through dedicated enrollment of diverse participants in various clinical settings. Successfully transitioning GS from research to standard clinical care-and convincing third-party payers to equitably adopt this technology-requires thoroughly evaluating its effects on medical decision making and clinical care, familial psychosocial dynamics, and communication processes between patients, clinicians, and laboratorians among diverse patients and clinical settings [20, 21] .",

Attention to enrollment of a diverse study population in the NCGE NES study enabled a broad range of perspectives to be elicited, but also raised potential challenges regarding enrollment and attrition of participants from populations under-represented in traditional research [38] . Given that historical exploitation and exclusion of lowresourced or non-White research participants have resulted in disparities and barriers to health care access [15, [39] [40] [41] , it is vital to investigate clinical applications of diagnostic GS with more diverse cohorts to improve health equity in genetic medicine [19] . Developing optimal and equitable genomic implementation requires engaging participants from diverse social, economic, and cultural backgrounds. Partnering with a range of institutions in different geographic areas can facilitate this engagement and aid our understanding of variations in clinical barriers to implementation. NCGENES 2 is a Phase III randomized controlled trial that will apply and extend our prior findings on how to employ diagnostic ES in routine medical care with a specific focus on understanding and addressing the needs of underserved and under-represented populations throughout the study [38] . It will address specific outcomes of first-line or early use of ES in the context of a diagnostic odyssey, an emerging area of potential impact in genomic medicine. Procedures in the NCGENES 2 study will be incorporated in the usual clinical process for recruited patients who will be having their initial visit to pediatric genetics or pediatric neurology clinics. Additionally, NCGENES 2 will employ methods to establish a more diverse cohort with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. It will also include an intervention designed to examine the impact of helping families prepare for a clinical visit that may include ES, in light of evidence showing subgroup differences and disparities in genomic knowledge and patient engagement, with implications for patient outcomes [33] .",

The study's design will also provide evidence about the effect of early use ES on the diagnostic odyssey for pediatric patients with suspected genetic conditions, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.",

Active involvement allows patients to share their concerns and priorities, clarify uncertainties, and obtain new information; thus, this involvement is critical for shared decision making and patient-centered care. In the context of ES for minor patients with suspected genetic diseases, it is also important that patients/parents share information about symptoms that can guide the interpretation of variants. Achieving these objectives can be challenging in minority or medically underserved patients/parents, who may prefer a less active role in decision making [47] [48] [49] . However, providing tools to increase health knowledge and encourage participation in informed choice and collaborative decision making, has been shown to improve decision self-efficacy, preference for collaborative decision making, and reduced decisional conflict [50, 51] .",

Therefore, in addition to evaluating the diagnostic capabilities of ES, it is important to explore other health-related outcomes, including diagnostic thinking, therapeutic choice, medical outcomes, and familial/societal impacts. Thus, a broad definition of clinical utility goes beyond considerations of diagnostic yield to also include patient and family consequences as well as defined health outcomes. The second intervention seeks to provide information about the clinical utility of ES as it is broadly defined by randomizing participants to be offered ES testing versus no offer of ES testing.

Insight from parent/caregiver stakeholders was also essential to the development of participant-oriented processes and materials. We have engaged three parent/ caregiver groups: (1) individuals with prior genomic research experience; (2) individuals with personal experience as a caregiver of a child with a genetic condition; and (3) individuals who are caregivers and/or advocates for families of children with neurodevelopmental needs. Parents/caregivers who had participated in the original NCGENES study from under-represented and underserved population groups provided experiential perspective on motivations for research participation, ways to facilitate participation by supporting families through long clinic visits, and ways to encourage engagement between caregivers and their child's doctors [57] . Recruitment telephone scripts and participant compensation plans were revised with feedback from caregiver members from a sickle cell disease community network. A Community Consult Team (CCT) was established to provide continuing materials refinement and ongoing insight. The CCT comprises a diverse group of individuals who are parents of children with neurodevelopmental needs, and/or advocates for families, especially those with special needs children [57] . Most of the CCT members also identify as members of under-represented and underserved populations. Early engagement with the CCT enabled the integration of revised language and format for consent, educational, and survey materials that are more responsive to the needs of our target study populations. Engaging with diverse stakeholders early and throughout the research process will enable our study to be more responsive to the needs of our diverse population and to troubleshoot recruitment and retention challenges as they arise. Throughout the study, all stakeholders (clinical and non-clinical/community) will continue to be informed of study progress and outcomes through regular meetings and periodic newsletters.",

Evidence shows that the standard deviation of perceived patient-centeredness of a clinical consultation ranges from 0.8 to 1.3 [96] , and the standard deviation of the number of questions patients ask during a clinical consultation ranges from 2.89 to 7.22 [54, 97] . The anticipated intervention effect size measured in the difference between any two of the four arms is more than 2. Hence, conservatively, our sample size as a 1:1 ratio (425 versus 425) has 100% statistical power to detect such a difference, even under a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons between four arms, i.e., under 0.05/6 = 0.008 type-I error rate.

Recruitment for the study relies closely on the examination of clinical scheduling data. As such, study recruitment is sensitive to the unique and dynamic scheduling characteristics of the different clinics participating in the study. Further, critical components of the NCGENES 2 study (e.g., pre-visit and post-visits procedures and audio recording of clinical visits) are built around routine clinical processes and interaction. Thus, study procedures needed to be developed to allow for the seamless integration of study processes into these clinic visits and processes across the three separate health systems. Given the clinical integration aspect of the study, the COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge to an already complex design and required adjustments to be made across the study sites. For example, the restart of study activities at UNC and ECU required the process for consent forms 2 and 3 to occur virtually (i.e., either by WebEx, Zoom, or teleconference). Hence, prior to a virtual visit, the study team mails all consent and, if necessary, assent forms to the parent to be discussed during the virtual visit. And, with IRB approval, assent procedures have been adapted for families attending virtual clinic visits. Instead, parents are provided the assent form for ES to help them answer questions their child may have regarding this part of the study. If necessary, the parent can call the study toll-free number to have the study coordinator answer the child's questions. Early and continued engagement of important and diverse stakeholders through the development and implementation phases of the trial has been crucial for developing sensitive approaches to address myriad potential barriers to research processes and participation [57] .",

Intervention 2 (ES) is a diagnostic intervention where parent-child dyads are randomized to be offered first-line exome sequencing for the child. The trial applies a full-factorial design, resulting in four arms, as illustrated in the figure: 1a PVP, exome sequencing, and usual care; 1b PVP and usual care; 2a exome sequencing and usual care; and 2b usual care (control arm). Estimates of positive, uncertain, and negative findings in the groups receiving ES are based on prior experience. e Parents complete two post-return of result (ROR) surveys: (1) 2-week post-ROR (approximately 6 months after the clinic visit) and (2) 6-month post-ROR (approximately 12 months after the clinic visit). f Clinicians complete survey measures at two timepoints: (1) post-visit survey after the clinical interaction with the child and parent and (2) approximately 6 months after the clinical visits when clinical diagnostic and ES results (if relevant) have been returned",
