In this study, we report the results of a series of three patients who underwent single-stage bilateral THA in a free-standing ambulatory surgical center with excellent short-term outcomes and no 90-day complications.",

Advances in surgical techniques and multimodal analgesic protocols have improved patient safety and recovery allowing for reduction of hospital length of stays (LOS) and enabling same-day discharge with lower readmissions and decreased postoperative complications [5e7] . In terms of unilateral THA, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) have been found to achieve similar outcomes compared with hospitalbased surgeries in selected populations while simultaneously being more cost-effective [5,8e14] . In addition, bilateral THA has been found to minimize repeated exposure to anesthesia, reduce cumulative procedure time, and lower overall cost with equivalent complication rates [15e18] . We report our first three patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral THA in a stand-alone ASC where unilateral total joint arthroplasty has been successfully performed since 2012. Compared with inpatient hospital care, utilization of the ASC during the COVID-19 pandemic minimized potential exposure to the virus and reduced the overall cost for the health-care system without unnecessary delay of care.",

All patients underwent preoperative evaluation and medical optimization before the procedure. Standard laboratory tests including complete blood count, metabolic panel, SARS Cov-2 assay, and electrocardiogram were performed and evaluated. A total joint coordinator, who helped with all the perioperative logistics and coordinated home care, was assigned to each patient. All patients met with a physical therapist preoperatively to review the postoperative therapy protocol. Each patient was admitted to the ASC on the day of the surgery. Spinal anesthesia (0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride with epinephrine 1:200,000) and sedation were used. Patients received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g of cefazolin, one dose 30 minutes before incision and one dose before discharge. A direct anterior approach was used on a regular operating room table with both legs prepped and draped. The more symptomatic hip was performed first, and then the contralateral hip was replaced while a physician's assistant closed the wound on the first hip. All patients received standard uncemented implants. Intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to confirm accuracy of the implant position. After implantation of the components, the deep tissues of each hip were infiltrated with a periarticular cocktail for postoperative anesthesia which consisted of bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine, depomedrol, and cefazolin in normal saline. Perioperatively, pain was controlled with intravenous acetaminophen, morphine, fentanyl, and dexamethasone. As part of the perioperative blood management protocol, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered before incision of each hip. Postoperative prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was achieved with 4 weeks of rivaroxaban, and postoperative pain management regimen consisted of celecoxib, acetaminophen, tramadol, and oxycodone. Physical therapy was started as soon as patients recovered from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit. Patients were discharged home after completion of gait training and tolerating oral pain medications. On the evening of surgery, a visiting nurse completed a postoperative evaluation at the patient's home, and the following day, in-home physical therapy was started. Both the visiting nurse and physical therapist were in communication with our total joint coordinator. The patient was also contacted by a physician assistant on postoperative day 1. The first postoperative visit was scheduled 1 week after the surgery. Physical therapy was continued in an outpatient setting for 6 weeks followed by a home exercise program.",

It has been found that readmission rates, number of adverse events, and LOS are minimized at ASCs [5,8e12] . Not only do ASCs provide similar outcomes but they are also significantly more costeffective for patients.

The incidence of total joint arthroplasty in outpatient settings is projected to continue to increase, with over half of all primary joint arthroplasties being performed in an outpatient setting by 2026 [22] . While simultaneous bilateral THA appears to be beneficial for both the patient and the health-care system, increased risks of postoperative complications have all been reported, including thromboembolic disease, blood loss, transfusion requirements, as well as decreased functional outcomes requiring increased rates of discharge to rehabilitation facilities [23, 24] . A recent meta-analysis by Shao et al. [18] of 63,909 patients, however, demonstrated that simultaneous bilateral THA had fewer major complications, including death, pulmonary embolism, DVT, cardiovascular, or neurologic complications, and fewer minor systemic complications including postoperative anemia. Their study also demonstrated decreased cumulative operative time, LOS, and cost in the simultaneous THA cohort [18] .",

While there are existing data to support the safety of THA in the setting of an ASC, and the efficacy of single-stage bilateral THA, there is a paucity of literature which has addressed both concurrently. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the feasibility of performing single-stage bilateral THA in an ASC. The eligibility criteria for bilateral THA at our institution include age <75 years, BMI <40, and hemoglobin level >12.0 g/dL. Absolute contraindications include history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with an HgbA1C level >8.0% [29] . None of the patients in this study required a blood transfusion, experienced a DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), or had any postoperative complications at 90-day follow-up. One patient required 7 hours in recovery before discharge because of significant nausea and vomiting. The other patients were discharged between two and four hours after surgery. All patients had adequate preoperative hemoglobin levels (>12.0 g/dL), and tranexamic acid was used intraoperatively. We did not routinely check postoperative labs. Our study presents a protocol for single-stage bilateral THA in a stand-alone ASC that can be successfully implemented with excellent outcomes.",
