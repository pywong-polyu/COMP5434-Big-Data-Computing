Despite the increased vehicular volumes, no significant changes in average travel times were observed on NYC and Seattle corridors in May, compared with Apr 2020. \u2022 Data from May 2020 shows a smaller drop of the subway ridership from 2019 levels compared to previous March and April drops from 2019, but more data is needed to verify the increase. Seattle's public transit ridership rebound continued to lag in May, indicating a lagging mode choice preference for public modes of travel. \u2022 Weigh-in-motion (WIM) from C2SMART's testbed on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) showed the number of very heavy trucks (GVW > 100 kips) remain down 29% for Queens bound (QB) and 44% for Staten Island bound (SIB) traffic as of May 15 compare to Feb 2020. \u2022 An agent-based simulation model (MATSim-NYC) was used to predict how this pandemic is changing travel behavior provide some insights for the reopening of NYC. o Because of changed preferences, a full reopening would perhaps only see as much as 73% of pre-COVID transit ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as much as 142% of pre-pandemic levels, assuming mode preferences held during the crisis are maintained. Evidence from other cities further in the reopening process points to lingering mode choice preferences from the pandemic during reopening, however due to the unique mode-choice in NYC these numbers may represent an extreme case.

Compared with the Pre-COVID model, car mode share increased the most among all the modes tested in the model.

In addition, both the number of walking and bike trips are expected to increase in Phase 4. The number of walking trips will be 101% of Pre-COVID levels and bike trips will be 104% of Pre-COVID levels. The mode share in Phase 4 of scenario 1 is shown in Figure 7 , showing that the mode share of transit decreased 9 percentage points compared to the pre-COVID period (35%), while the mode share of car increased by 12 percentage points, which was 30% in the Pre-COVID model.",

The increase in the number of car trips is around the same in both scenarios (142% of the Pre-COVID model in Scenario 1 and 143% of the Pre-COVID model in Scenario 2). The increase of bike trips is more significant in scenario 2, which is 123% of Pre-COVID model compared to 104% in scenario 1. This shows that with 50% transit capacity restriction, people may prefer to use bikes as an alternative of transit.

The C2SMART research team developed a novel social-distancing dataset along from a video processing method based on deep learning for analyzing time-dependent, social-distancing, patterns at the local level in the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery process. Object detection was applied to real-time traffic camera videos (13) at multiple key locations within NYC and Seattle to provide information about crowd density. One of the state-of-the-art algorithms, RetinaNet (14) , and ResNet-50 (15) are used as the backbone network architecture. The model was pre-trained using the COCO dataset (16) .

This location is typically a highdensity area and has an overall high and consistent pedestrian density through the day (Figure 11 (a) navy line) before the crisis. While car and pedestrian density remain low in Apr and May 2020 compared with pre-pandemic levels, the emergence of commuter spikes (morning and afternoon peak for pedestrians and morning peak for cars) was observed. One possible reason could be that most of the observed pedestrians are essential workers. Unlike pedestrian and car density, cyclist density has almost approached pre-pandemic level at this location by the end of May. As an on-going effort, this approach will be extended to cover 100 camera locations to continuously evaluate the changes in crowd density and social distancing practice between pedestrians. With cloud computing power, it is also possible to translate the findings to actionable operational items in near real-time to track the density trends during the reopening phases and further utilized for predictive analysis (e.g. future cycling rates), to assist developing effective strategies or to plan for potential future scenarios.",

Results from May 18 and June 1 show a similar average and maximum pedestrian density. However, the pedestrian social distancing safety rate is reduced from 88% to 85%. More camera data will be collected and enlarge the coverage of social distancing safety detection. Additional locations and examples are available at c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/covid-19-dashboard.",
