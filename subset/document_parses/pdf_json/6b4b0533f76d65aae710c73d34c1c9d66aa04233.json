Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is mostly, apart from allergic etiology, caused by a viral infection and, in some cases (30-50%), by a bacterial superinfection. Antibiotics, indicated only in rare cases according to EPOS guidelines, are nevertheless prescribed in more than 80% of ARS cases, which increases the resistant bacterial strains in the population.",

In some cases (approximately 30-50%) the cause of sinonasal infections are bacteria, which secondarily populate the previous viral infection [3] [4] [5] . The most common of such bacteria are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus and M. catarrhalis [6] . Despite these findings, ARS is commonly treated with antibiotics worldwide. Several studies demonstrated that antibiotics are prescribed in more than 80% of ARS cases [7, 8] . Differentiating diagnoses between viral and bacterial ARS has become a challenge, thus rendering the decision of physicians of whether to prescribe antibiotics more difficult [9] .",

Antibiotics (macrolides) are only recommended for treatment of CRS without polyps in patients with low overall IgE antibodies [1] . In other cases, systemic antibiotic treatment of CRS does not have any significant effect [13] . According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care in the USA, rhinosinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which antibiotics are prescribed despite many randomized studies and clinical guidelines that question the benefits of antibiotics in moderate or uncomplicated ARS [3, [9] [10] [11] [12] . A recent multi-national study highlighted a problem of antibiotic misuse by physicians [14] . A randomized double-blind study has identified that if the oral streptococcal microbiome in healthy individuals is exposed to azithromycin and clarithromycin, it is the main driving force of antibiotic resistance [15] . Systemic over-usage of antibiotics might cause many side effects, but also leads to an increase in antibiotic resistance [16] [17] [18] with potential global consequences and thus poses a threat to the health of the general population [19] . An appropriate tool in medical practice, one which would make the decision-making process more precise to determine whether there is a need of use of antibiotics in treatment of sinonasal infections, would validly contribute to reduce the excessive overconsumption of antibiotics worldwide [8, 20] .",

However, a large proportion of patients are also examined, diagnosed and treated in the primary medical sphere (general practitioners), who show generally lower adherence to valid recommendations [21] . Diagnosis and treatment of some patients are not always pursuant to generally accepted guidelines. It can be assumed that if valid recommendations are presented electronically to these treatment providers, the adherence of these doctors to valid recommendations will be increased, thus allowing them to make \"safer\" decisions in the treatment of patients [22] . The aim of this study was to create a CDSS for examination, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with rhinosinusitis, based on valid EPOS recommendations and available to all physicians, specialists and practitioners who encounter a patient reporting symptoms of rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this article is not only to present the software we have developed for better treatment of patients with rhinosinusitis, but also to introduce the terminology of expert systems to the health reader, as well as to introduce the history of this artificial intelligence in medicine and to point out its advantages and disadvantages in common medical practice.",

It was clear that the quality of these systems depended much more on the quality of knowledge than on the quality of the mechanism for their use. To date, thousands of systems have emerged covering a wide variety of issues. At least half of them focus on the field of medicine, most likely because medical knowledge is very well structured. From the beginning of their development, numerous software systems have been introduced: Mycin-diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized patients [23] , internal medicine systems-Internist-1 [24] and QMR [25] , pneumology PUFF [26] , oncology-Oncocin [27] etc., and in the ENT area, for example, the expert system for disorders of the equilibrium system [28] or allergic rhinitis [29, 30] .",

Since the publication of \"To Err is Human\" [32] , CDSS in conjunction with CPOE (Computer Based Order Entry) have been identified as key systems for assisting in the prevention of medical errors and promoting patient safety [33, 34] . CDSS can be categorized as knowledge-based systems and nonknowledge-based systems. Knowledge based CDSS simulates a person's thinking, offering information to the user and thus assisting him in his own decision making process [31] . Such a system consists of three basic parts: (1) the knowledge base, (2) the inference engine and (3) the communication mechanism. The knowledge database is composed of compiled information in the form of if-then rules, probabilistic interactions of symptoms with diagnosis, etc. [31] . The second part is the inference engine or reasoning mechanism, which consists of formulas for combining rules and associations from the knowledge base with actual patient data. The third inseparable part is the mechanism of communication, i.e. how the patient's data gets into the system and the output of the system to the user who makes the decision [31] . The inference engine confronts patient's information (symptoms) with its knowledge base and offers the user a possible diagnosis for these symptoms. Since the physician knows the patient more deeply, and all patient data is not able to be reported in any CDSS, it is therefore up to the physician to make the last correction in terms of avoiding unlikely diagnoses [35] .",

This result faithfully demonstrates that the CDSS drew on its knowledge base in diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and did not take into account other information such as a patient's overall health as it lacked the necessary knowledge and experience of a human physician. Nevertheless, we see its benefit mainly in primary care, outpatient clinics, where it could assist in diagnosis and treatment of immunocompetent patients presenting with symptoms of rhinosinusitis of any duration, and so contribute to a significant reduction in antibiotic over-prescription, which in turn limits the growth of resistant bacterial strains in the epidemiological group.",

New nosological units or subunits are emerging every day, hundreds of new medicines flood the pharmaceutical market every month. The knowledge base of each CDSS must therefore be regularly updated and include uptodate information. Who is to blame if the end-user makes a medically erroneous decision based on outdated knowledge-based information? Scientists addressed this issue several decades ago [45] . Ultimately it can be argued that the overall benefits of the CDSS are outweighed over the drawbacks of outdated knowledge-based information. CDSS has already demonstrated its benefit at the pharmaceutical level, reducing the frequency of adverse drug-drug interactions and preventing excessive or under-prescription of drugs [46, 47] . With the demand of health management for the best possible health care at the lowest cost, the interest in the use of CDSS in clinical practice is growing and their future is promising [48] . Similarly, as fear of using computers in clinical practice has subsided, the opposition to the widespread application of CDSS as part of contemporary medicine is expected to subside. If the new CDSS are sufficiently accessible and user-friendly, the medical community may be more interested in this phenomenon. Some even believe that the computer will replace the human doctor [49] . However, we must never forget that artificial intelligence should only support a person and strengthen their decision-making process, which, after all, is the ultimate responsibility of the physician.",

In general practice, general practitioners use computer technology and the implementation of this software into equipment already purchased will not increase the cost of office operation. Furthermore, the cost of usage of the CDSS application can be reduced and its accessibility increased in low income communities through mobile phone-based applications, which is the aim of our future study. The CDSS RHINA was subjected to extensive testing in the form of a retrospective study of a total of 1465 patients with varying degrees of rhinosinusitis, in 90.2% of cases it coincided with the diagnosis and treatment determined by the ENT specialist. Thus, it can be assumed that patients will be treated by using our CDSS RHINA with a higher adherence to valid EPOS recommendations and that over-prescription of antibiotics in a given epidemiological group will be reduced with the hope of reducing resistant bacterial strains to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics.",
