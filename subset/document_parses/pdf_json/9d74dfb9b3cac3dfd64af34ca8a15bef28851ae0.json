Some patients are complaining that their dentist was uncaring and indifferent to their pain. Others are saying that they have not understood the treatment options described by the clinician or the likely outcome.",

Dentistry requires a degree of collaboration and understanding between the patient and dentist if the process of decisionmaking is to be effectively shared. Any barrier to communication in the dental setting will diminish the level of rapport and increase the potential for patient dissatisfaction.",

We need to enhance other means of communication to compensate for the loss of visible facial expression.",

            "text": "Develop these skills to compensate for any reduction in effective communication when wearing a mask AE The environment -Minimise the noise and distractions in the surgery; patients need to understand what is being said and if not hearing fully, especially in the absence of lip-reading cues, they will 'make a guess' at what's been said, particularly patients with a cognitive or hearing impediment AE Make eye contact -This conveys 'I see you ' activating empathy and connection. Too much and the patient feels uncomfortable, but enough strengthens the greeting and promotes trust AE Introductions are key -Wear a name badge so everyone knows 'who's who' and their job title AE Explain why you are wearing a mask -This can enhance trust in the dental setting signalling adherence to cross infection control measures given dentistry is carried out at such close quarters AE Listen well -Let patients tell their story, uninterrupted AE Give reassurance That the patient is safe and acknowledge the extra difficulties imposed by wearing a mask AE Check your tone of voice -The tone conveys over 38% of the non-verbal emotional content of what we say. The pace, rhythm and pitch of spoken language is called prosody. Prosody infuses a layer of emotion that goes above and beyond the singular meaning of each word and we are all highly sensitive to variations in tone of voice. In a famous study by Nalini Ambady, 1 audiotapes of surgeons talking with patients were filtered so only the volume, pace and rhythm of their communications were audible. When the tapes were played to a group of volunteers, listeners could determine the surgeons who had a history of complaints and claims AE Name your emotion -If the PPE makes it difficult to express it: for example, 'You make me smile' or 'I empathise with you' AE Convey openness, warmth and respect with body language -Sit down with patients, turn towards them, and sit at eye level whilst maintaining social distance. AE Encourage questions to gauge understanding -In the face of any lack of comprehension that is critical to obtaining valid consent. Information gathered by the dentist may otherwise be incomplete leading to clinical and consent inaccuracies. AE Use gestures -Thumbs up or down to clarify what has or hasn't been understood AE Give more supplementary written information than usual AE Safeguard confidentiality -It can be difficult to speak louder for clarity. You may have to move somewhere more confidential if the situation demands it AE Use technology -Creatively to supplement information given -some dentists are experimenting with live transcript applications compatible with mobile phone technology as a means of communication solving, so the patient can listen again when they've left the surgery.",
