Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells, to target COVID-19 from therapeutic angle, we engineered a hexapeptide corresponding to the ACE2-interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS) that inhibits the association between receptor-binding domain-containing spike S1 and ACE-2. Accordingly, wild type (wt), but not mutated (m), AIDS peptide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and expression of IL-6 in human lungs cells. Interestingly, intranasal intoxication of C57/ BL6 mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 led to fever, increase in IL-6 in lungs, infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, arrhythmias, and impairment in locomotor activities, mimicking some of the important symptoms of COVID-19. However, intranasal treatment with wtAIDS, but not mAIDS, peptide reduced fever, protected lungs, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of ACE2-to-SARS-CoV-2 interaction by wtAIDS may be beneficial for COVID-19.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main effector of the classical renin-angiotensin system, is a cell surface receptor that is predominant in lung, heart and kidney (Zaman et al. 2002) . Although the prototype function of ACE2 is to convert angiotensin II (AngII), a vasoconstrictor, to Ang1-7, a vasodilator, and thereby to play an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases (Vickers et al. 2002; Zaman et al. 2002) , recently, ACE2 came to renewed attention due to its requirement by COVID-19 for entering into host cells. It is found that COVID-19 binds to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface (Machhi et al. 2020; Stower 2020) . During infection, the S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits and the S1 subunit encompasses the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Therefore, this subunit permits to directly attach to the peptidase domain of ACE2 (Ledford 2020; Stower 2020) .",

For ECG analysis, electrocardiography data were exported from the Labchart pro, version 8.0 (Power Lab 4/35 model) as raw data format and the digital signal processing was performed using this software. The recording was conducted for 120 s and the ECG signals were recorded at a sampling range of 20 mV with 4 beats/s sampling rate as recommended in the software for mouse ECG analysis. The ECG tracing was visually reviewed for identifying possible arrhythmias or other anomalous complexes. Prior to analyze the data, in the Labchart pro software ECG setting data source was kept for ECG channel selected as the channel 1 out of the multiple channels and selected for whole channel specific for mouse species. In the detection setting, typical QRS width was reserved at 10 ms and R wave kept at least 60 ms apart with the alignment maintained at QRS maximum. In the analysis portion, pre-baseline was kept at 10 ms with maximum at 50 ms. We selected for rodent waves and measured ST segment height at 10 ms height. All the ECG parameters including PQ interval, QRS interval, QT interval, T duration, JT interval as well as P Amplitude, Q amplitude, R Amplitude, S amplitude, T amplitude were calculated.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 is involved in the interaction with ACE2 (Du et al. 2009 ). Therefore, we applied rigid-body protein-protein interaction tool to model the interaction between RBD of spike protein S1 subunit and ACE2. As evident from our in silico modeling analysis, the docked pose of ACE2 and S1 RBD complex revealed a strong H-bond between Asn501 of spike S1 and Lys353 of ACE2. In addition, Tyr505 of spike S1 exhibited a hydrophobic interaction with Gln42 and the side chain of Lys353 of ACE2 (Fig. 1a) . Therefore, we designed a hexapeptide (Fig. 1b) corresponding to the ACE2interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS) from the RBD of S1 subunit to unsettle the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2.",

In addition to COVID-19, pulmonary complications are also evident in different bacterial and viral infections (Edwards et al. 2012; McCullers 2014) . Therefore, we investigated if AIDS peptide was capable of suppressing the expression of proinflammatory molecules in human A549 lung cells induced by different stimuli. A549 cells pretreated with different concentrations of wtAIDS and mAIDS peptides for 15 min were stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1, poly IC, HIV-1 Tat, and bacterial flagellin. At first, we examined whether recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 was capable of inducing proinflammatory cytokines in A549 lung cells. Dose-dependent analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 was very potent in inducing proinflammatory cytokines and that spike S1 even at a dose of 0.2 ng/ml significantly induced the mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in lung cells with maximum induction at 1 ng/ml (Fig. S1A-C) . Inability of boiled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 to induce the expression of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in A549 cells ( Fig. S1A -C) and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-mediated expression of these cytokines by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 antibody ( Fig. S2A-C) suggest that the induction of proinflammatory molecules in lung cells is due to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein.",

After 7d of treatment, the activation of NF-\u03baB was checked in lung tissues by EMSA (b) followed by monitoring the mRNA expression of IL-6 (c) and in lung by real-time PCR. IL-6 protein was measured in lung tissue homogenates by ELISA (e). Levels of IL-6 (f) and CRP (g) were also quantified in serum by ELISA. Lung sections were analyzed by H&E (h, images of different magnification; i, epithelial cell count; j, neutrophil cell count; k, infiltrated cells as percent of epithelial cells; l, lung injury score). Cells were counted from two sections of each of five mice (n = 5) per group. Body temperature (m) was monitored by Cardinal Health Dual Scale digital rectal thermometer. Results are mean \u00b1 SEM of nine mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 (Fig. 2b) . In situ ChIP assay of lung indicated the recruitment of NF-\u03baB subunits p65 and p50 as well as histone acetyltransferase p300 to the IL-6 gene promoter in vivo in the lung of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice (Fig. 3a-e. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 was also able to recruit RNA polymerase to the IL-6 gene promoter in vivo in the lung (Fig. 3f) . These results are specific as no product amplification was observed in immunoprecipitates with control IgG (Fig. 3g) . Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 intoxication induces the transcription of IL-6 gene in vivo in the lung via NF-\u03baB activation. Accordingly, we found marked increase in IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 2c) and protein (Fig. 2e) as well as another proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2) mRNA (Fig. 2d) in lungs of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice as compared to control mice receiving only saline. SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 intoxication also increased the level of IL-6 in serum (Fig. 2f) . These results are consistent with the finding that in some COVID-19 patients, disease progression leads to \"cytokine storm\" and that among these cytokines, IL-6 plays an important role as elevated levels of IL-6 closely correlates to critical illness (Costela-Ruiz et al. 2020) . It has been suggested that C-reactive protein (CRP) could be a promising biomarker for assessing the lethality of COVID-19 (Sahu et al. 2020) . Accordingly, we noticed marked upregulation of CRP in serum of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice (Fig. 2g) .",

Cell counting as well as assessment of lung injury using a scale (Matute-Bello et al. 2011) (Table S1) indicated a loss of lung epithelial cells (Fig. 2i) , a marked increase in lung neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 2j-k) and an overall increase in lung injury (Fig. 2l) after SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxication. One of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 is fever (Machhi et al. 2020; Pahan and Pahan 2020) . Interestingly, daily intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 at a very low dose (Fig. 2a) led to increase in body temperature (Fig. 2m) .

As evident from body temperature (Fig. 5b) , nasal wtAIDS treatment significantly reduced fever. Similarly, assay of cardiac features by non-invasive ECG showed that spike S1-intoxicated mice receiving wtAIDS from 1 d after the initiation of the disease displayed very little cardiac arrhythmias ( Fig. 5c-e) , stabilization of heart rate ( Fig. 5f ) and RR interval (Fig. 5g) , and normalization of heart rate variability (Fig. 5h) and QRS interval (Fig. 5i) .

Therefore, untangling the mechanism of the disease process of COVID-19 and designing an effective therapeutic approach to slow down the disease and stop the death are of paramount importance. ACE2 being the main player of the classical renin-angiotensin pathway plays an important role in vascular diseases (Zaman et al. 2002) . Since SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 and causes its internalization to enter into human cells, COVID-19 is particularly deleterious to patients with underlying cardiovascular issues. Although ACE2 inhibitors are available (Jiang et al. 2014) and such inhibitors may stop the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, it is not possible to inhibit this beneficial molecule. Therefore, through structural analysis of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, we have designed a small hexapeptide corresponding to the ACE2-interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS). Since the spike S1 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with ACE2, wtAIDS peptide unsettled the association between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1.",

Marked induction of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) in human A549 lung cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 even at a very low dose suggests that this spike subunit may contribute to cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Consistent to the inhibition of association between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1, wtAIDS peptide inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated A549 lung cells. In contrast, wtAIDS peptide did not inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by poly IC (viral doublestranded RNA mimic), Tat (transactivator of HIV-1 transcription) and flagellin (a component of bacterial infection), indicating the selective nature of wtAIDS peptide. Most importantly, the beauty of our finding is that wtAIDS peptide corresponds to peptide sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it will only inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 without affecting basal level and beneficial functions of ACE2. Moreover, it will function only in the presence of SARS-CoV-2.",

In normal mice, SARS-CoV-2 does not easily bind to ACE2, making it difficult to study the course of infection. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 (Bao et al. 2020) . Although regular SARS-CoV-2 does not infect BALB/c mice, N501Y mutated SARS-CoV-2 readily infects BALB/c mice (Gu et al. 2020 ). However, these mouse models do not display fever and cardiac problems (arrhythmias), two important characteristics of COVID-19. Therefore, drugs generated from these mouse models may not be effective for severe COVID-19 patients in the ICU.

            "text": "Moreover, handling live SARS-CoV-2 has many biosafety requirements. Here, we describe the development of a very simple and live virus-free model of mimicking important cardiac and respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 in mice. SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 containing the RBD sequence is located at the N-terminus of the spike protein. Since most of the neutralizing epitopes are located within the spike S1, this spike subunit has become an important candidate for vaccine development.Interestingly, here, we demonstrated that intranasal administration of the same spike S1 was capable of inducing many key features of COVID-19 (fever, lung inflammation, lung neutrophil infiltration, increase in serum IL-6, upregulation of serum CRP, and arrhythmias) in normal mice. Therefore, nasally SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice could be used as a virus-free mouse model for evaluating different therapeutic options against COVID-19.Until now, there is no effective therapy for COVID-19. Although vaccine will be soon available, COVID-19 might stay on the earth as a seasonal and an opportunistic event. For example, despite flu vaccination, about 40,000 to 50,000 people die each year in USA from flu. Therefore, a specific medicine for reducing SARS-CoV-2-related inflammatory events and taking care of respiratory and cardiac issues of COVID-19 will be necessary for better management of COVID-19 even in the postvaccine era. Although hydroxychloroquine showed some promise in the beginning, several clinical trials have ruled out the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (Pahan and Pahan 2020). Only, Remdesivir has been approved for emergency use in COVID-19 (Lamb 2020). Although s.c. injection of some ICU patients with IFN \u03b2-1b led to decrease in mortality rate (Rahmani et al. 2020) , further randomized clinical trials with large sample size are needed for the exact estimation of survival benefit by this multiple sclerosis drug. Reduction of fever, decrease in serum IL-6 and CRP, protection of lungs, normalization of heart functions, and improvement in locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice by intranasal treatment with wtAIDS peptide suggest that selective targeting of the SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 contact by wtAIDS peptide may be beneficial for COVID-19. The wtAIDS peptide should target only the SARS-CoV-2dependent ACE2 pathway without inhibiting normal physiological functions of ACE2. Accordingly, in a group of control mice, we also did not notice any drug-related side effect (e.g. hair loss, appetite loss, weight loss, untoward infection and irritation, etc.) upon treatment with intranasal wtAIDS peptide. In summary, our preclinical studies have identified intranasal AIDS peptide as a primary or adjunct therapeutic option for COVID-19 patients.",
