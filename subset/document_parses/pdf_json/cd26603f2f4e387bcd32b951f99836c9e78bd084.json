The vulnerability faced by nurses is heightened by gender inequalities, in addition to social class, ethnicity/race (and caste), age and migrant status, that are inequality axes that explain why nurses' workers, and often their families, are exposed to multiple risks and/or poorer health. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, informalization of nurses' employment and working conditions were unfair and harmed their health. During COVID-19 pandemic, there is evidence that the employment and working conditions of nurses are associated to poor physical and mental health.",

This responsibility has turned to be particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic, where nurses in the public and private sectors are leading COVID-19 care, testing, triage, and management [1] , placing them to a unique position able to deal with vaccination and near-future health challenges. With all, nurses had been one of the most affected collectives by the COVID-19. According to the International Council of Nurses (ICN), millions of nurses have been infected with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Cumulative number of reported COVID-19 deaths in nurses in 59 countries was 2262 at the end of 2020 [2] . However, this number is likely to be underestimated as the actual number of fatalities of health workers is unknown due to the absence of a comprehensive systematic surveillance system. Although great efforts have been made in recent years to build up an international health information system with a key set of indicators focused on achieving an adequate size and skill mix of nursing personnel to attain various population health goals [3] , the last ICN press release reports that standardized and systematic collection of data on infectious and deaths of health workers is not yet happening [4] .",

Compared to other health workers, professional nurses and nurse aides are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. CDC data, from six states of the US, show that among the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32.1% were nurse aides and 29.5% were professional nurses, compared to 3.2% of physicians [5] . Amongst COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in 13 States of the US, professional nurses account for the largest group (35%), followed by nurse aides (15%) compared to physicians (5%) [6] . These inequalities on COVID-19 infection and deaths by country are due in part to a lack or shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), where is higher in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) [7, 8] .",

Today, employment and working conditions of many nurses worldwide are precarious [12] , and the current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted more visibility to the vulnerability to health-damaging factors of nurses' globally. Based on the general framework of employment, work and health of Juli\u00e0 adapted from Benach and Muntaner [13] [14] [15] , nurses' health is influenced by several factors. This conceptual framework shows how labour market and welfare state policies influenced by power relations impact on employment conditions. Thus, labour regulations influence how employment conditions are regulated through the different types of contract. Labour relations are the ones that influence the process of precarious employment conditions. Precarious employment measured through different dimensions is present to a greater or lesser extent in the different employment conditions that, directly or through working conditions or material deprivation, produce an impact on mental health, the selfperceived health and health inequalities. Furthermore, unpaid household and care work also has an influence on health and health inequalities. As for social and family networks, they also have an impact on health, depending on whether they are present or not. Inequality axes like gender, age, social class, ethnicity/race and migrant status are key relational mechanisms of generating inequalities.",

            "text": "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a marked increase in precarization and/or informalization of nurses' employment globally that had an impact on working hours and conditions, minimum wage, social protection, and job insecurity. For example, in Mexico during the period 2005-2018 they reported an increase of informalization among the group of nurses analysed in relation to: (a) the percentage of people without a written contract; (b) the percentage of people with incomes lower than two times the minimum wage; (c) the percentage of nurses without social security, and (d) the percentage of nurses without social benefits [16] . In Catalonia, results of a study show that the highest level of job insecurity occurs among nurse aides and in privately managed nursing homes [17] . In the growing private sector in India where permanent contracts are rare, nurses were often paid less or just above the minimum wage [18] . Similar to the case of Australia, where the employment conditions are worse in the private sector which lead to increased mortality in nursing homes [19] . Also, nurses were already facing structural challenges in many countries as lack of energy and water supply, internet access, enough clean uniforms, appropriate space for breaks, lockers or changing rooms and laundry services, as well as lack of safety, for example during night shifts in isolated areas [12] . Evidence from countries in South Africa [20] , Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda [21] , Catalonia [17, 22] , Brazil [23] , Chile [24] , Colombia [25] , Mexico [26] [27] [28] , and Thailand [29] show that employment and working conditions of nurses before this pandemic were already associated to poor physical and mental health, and in some cases leading to fatality outcomes as suicide [30, 31] . A particular mention to the nurses working in conflict and war zones. For example, previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses in Palestine reported continuous exposure to traumatic events, and a related feeling of general powerlessness [32] . As the pandemic spread, these occurrences interlinked with additional problems and continuous blockades, including lack of PPE, guidelines and long working hours [33] .",

Lack of PPE was commonly reported by many health workers globally, also in rural areas and the private health sector [43] . They had to purchase their own PPE, when available outside the hospital, reuse old PPE and collaborate together to develop alternative tools for protection [44, 45] . Furthermore, some units such as maternity wards or primary health care facilities have been considered \"low risk settings\" despite the possibility of positive cases, which again influenced the accessibility of adequate PPE. A report from the United States shows that primary care physicians are the largest subset of physician deaths [46] , but data on nursing is unavailable. Evidence shows that nurses who do not consider the availability and quality of PPE to be adequate had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress [35, 36, 47] .",

This may raise questions as for example who is more exposed during health care related work? Power relations and the social positioning in health systems have traditionally valued medical doctors over nurses, and medical structures over communities [56, 57] . This is illustrated by the extraordinary financial compensations provided to healthcare workers exposed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in some European countries where professional nurses and nurse aides received less, or nothing, compared to their fellow medical doctors. For example, in Catalonia (Spain), compared to medical doctors, professional nurses received 200 euros less, and nurse aides 650 euros less, based on supposed \"productivity\" criteria [58] . Another example is the United Kingdom that directly overlooked nurses explicitly saying: \"reflecting the vital contributions public sector workers make to our country, these pay rises cover the armed forces, teachers, police officers, the National Crime Agency, prison officers, doctors and dentists, the judiciary, senior civil servants and senior military personnel\" [59] . Also, in India, doctors were given accommodation best-quality hotels near the hospital while nurses stayed in unsanitary dormitories [60] . Finally, nurses from different countries has reported that the distribution of the PPE has been based on the medical hierarchy rather than the needs of the health workers or the community itself [61] . This hierarchy has been replicated with the administration of vaccines in countries as UK, Italy and Spain.",

For example, in Croatia it resulted in overburdening employed nurses; the inability of newly graduated professional nurses to access employment and, therefore, an increase in migration and a deepening of the serious shortage of nursing personnel [91, 92] . Other effects of the economy in the current nursing workforce can be found in Mexico, where prioritization in hiring nurses' aides instead of professional nurses started as a response to the economic development plans of the 1970s that resulted in policies set by Mexico state [93] . Several countries in South Asia also followed a similar trajectory [94] .

Yet, the pandemic has also exposed historic vulnerabilities faced by many nurses' workers worldwide which resulted in an unacceptable number of infections and deaths among nurses. The neoliberal austerity measures promote precarization and informalization of nursing work and worsened the vulnerability to healthdamaging factors, with many countries still to ratify the ILO Nursing Personnel Convention, 1977 (No. 149) on fair employment conditions. However, the current body of evidence lacks a detailed understanding of the pathways and mechanisms on how precariousness might affect nurses' health. This might be linked to the current limited capacity of health information systems, and the inability to collect, analyse and monitor precarious employment and the impact in terms of health, wellbeing, and equity.",
