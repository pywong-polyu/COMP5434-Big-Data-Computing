In line with the growing knowledge about specific pathophysiologic mechanisms, COVID-19 has increasingly been associated with bacterial coinfections, exhibiting high rates in intensive care units (ICUs) [1] [2] [3] [4] . It is estimated that around 50% of fatalities associated with COVID-19 had secondary infections contributing to the disease course with a relevant impact on patient outcomes [5, 6] . Treating critically ill COVID-19 patients often involves mechanical ventilation, which poses a high risk for droplet and aerosol transmission. In addition to the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contamination of surfaces and medical equipment, bacterial pathogens complicating the disease course can be transmitted to the environment surrounding the patient. Equipment and surfaces (e.g. respirators, beds) are well known for contributing to the transmission of bacterial pathogens promoting nosocomial infections [7, 8] .",

All surfaces, devices and floors in ICU 1 were disinfected by nurses and cleaning staff with aldehydebased Kohrsolin \u00ae 1% (Wilbert Hygiene, Germany). In addition, a dry mist hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) nebulisation technique (Dosymist XL, SolidFog Technologies \u00ae , Belgium and H 2 O 2 \u00e0 12% Fisher Scientific \u00ae , USA) was used in ICU 1 in the ICU pharmacy room. The purpose to use this relatively novel technique in the present study was to gain more experience with it and to test it in a small, designated area. With the aid of the hydrogen peroxide technology, a dry aerosol is generated, with the oxidative action of hydroxyl radicals leading to antimicrobial properties. Quality control of the H 2 O 2 disinfection was performed with chemical indicators (3M Healthcare \u00ae , USA) [successful decontamination indicated by color change on test kit] and biological indicators (Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Crosstex \u00ae , USA) [successful decontamination indicated by 6-log reduction between positive and negative control]. Surfaces, devices and floors in ICU 2 were disinfected by nurses and cleaning staff with Kohrsolin \u00ae 1% (Wilbert Hygiene, Germany) only. To minimize biases, nurses and cleaning staff were not aware that this study would be conducted in both ICUs. Cleaning and disinfection were not supervised by the study team.",
