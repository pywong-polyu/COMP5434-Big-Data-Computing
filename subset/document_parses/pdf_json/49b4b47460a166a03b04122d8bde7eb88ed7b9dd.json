While numerous studies have shown that both patients and parents in these families can experience a variety of challenges and concerns, the experience of siblings is less well understood. The focus of this scoping review was on research addressing the experiences and well-being of siblings of children with CKD. Methods Following scoping review methodology, five databases were searched for peer-reviewed research or graduate theses published in English that addressed the experience or well-being of siblings aged 25 years or younger (biological, step or foster) of children with CKD; studies from any year or location were included. Two independent coders identified relevant studies. Findings were summarized and synthesized.",

Five of the selected studies were qualitative, two were quantitative and one used mixed-methods. Four broad themes across studies were identified including family functioning, significant relationships, psychological well-being, and coping strategies. While there was some convergence between qualitative and quantitative findings, these linkages were weak. Conclusions Several unmet needs of siblings were uncovered by this review. Sibling perceptions of differential parental treatment and desire for information about CKD emerged as priorities for practice. Using a strength-based approach in order to better understand sibling experiences and well-being was also recommended for future research.",

This is surprising as the course and scope of CKD can differ markedly from other pediatric illnesses. For example, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis can demand daily treatment lasting several hours or overnight therapy [7] . While diverse pediatric chronic illnesses share some characteristics [8, 9] , it is important to understand the specific contexts that families experience in order to design effective support programs. Therefore, we undertook a scoping review of studies focused on sibling experiences and well-being in families affected by CKD in order to: (1) summarize and synthesize current findings with a view to identifying potential avenues for support programs, and (2) to identify current gaps in order to provide directions for future research. Our review was broadly defined; it included all aspects of sibling experience as reported by siblings themselves, or by their parents. Our approach to well-being included adjustment difficulties and mental health issues, as well as positive aspects such as resilient characteristics, processes and outcomes [10] , and posttraumatic growth.",

In contrast, a more recent study that utilized a standardized self-report health-related quality of life measure (KIDSCREEN-54) which assessed ten dimensions found that siblings reported significantly lower autonomy (opportunities to create leisure and social time) and financial resources (perceptions of their own financial resources, such as enough money to do the same activities as their friends), but higher social acceptance (feeling less rejected by peers) in comparison to children with CKD [14] . In comparison to controls, siblings reported lower physical well-being (level of physical activity, energy and fitness), lower autonomy, lower parent relations and home life (quality of parent-child relationships and atmosphere at home), and lower financial resources [14] .",

Daily routine disruptions were most likely to occur when the child with CKD was hospitalized, while broader restrictions of family activities, such as taking a vacation or travel, were due to treatment demands or availability. Disruptions to routine are common for families of children with chronic conditions [5] ; however, missing out on shared family time during vacation or travel experiences may be more specific to families who manage significant daily treatment demands such as peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis [5, 6] . The importance of maintaining family routines and rituals for adaptive individual and family functioning and resilience has been well established [20] . Therefore, the significance of these disruptions for siblings should not only be acknowledged, but mitigated as much as possible. Some siblings expressed anger about conflicts between their parents and their brother or sister with CKD concerning medication, diet and other non-adherence issues. While the psychosocial and medical consequences of nonadherence for young people with CKD [21, 22] and their parents are well documented, the consequences for siblings are less well understood. Developmental research has shown that prolonged exposure to chronic interparental conflict can exacerbate adjustment issues for children and adolescents [23] . It is currently unknown if exposure to chronic parent-child conflict about non-adherence can also amplify sibling psychosocial adjustment issues; future research needs to address this issue.",

The importance of sibling relationships emerged frequently across studies, and included both positive and negative aspects of the relationship. It should be noted that most studies focused on the relationship between one target sibling and their brother or sister with CKD, with other sibling relationships within the family rarely addressed. Regardless of their age, siblings were well aware of and sensitive to the health status of their sister or brother with CKD; this included closely monitoring their adherence to medication and self-care practices. Some siblings actively participated in caregiving -some to the degree where it significantly curtailed their ability to spend time with friends or attend school [16] . In contrast, recent research has suggested that caretaking by siblings may benefit their own well-being [24] . This difference may be due to variation in relationship norms and expectations based on ethno-cultural or societal differences. It should be noted that the eight selected studies were conducted in four countries where these norms may have varied considerably. Taken together, these findings highlighted sibling warmth and prosocial interaction [25] in families affected by CKD, which may not only enhance the quality of the sibling relationship [24] but also siblings' resilience characteristics and behaviors.",

What remains unknown is how sibling perceptions of PDT are related to their own well-being or to their relationship with their sister or brother with CKD. While research examining family-related risk factors for psychological functioning of pediatric kidney transplant patients have routinely included parental psychosocial functioning, few if any have investigated the potential impact of sibling well-being for patient mental and physical health outcomes [2] .

As noted, parental differential treatment was a highly salient issue for siblings, particularly when parents were physically absent from the home due to hospitalization of their child with CKD. However, this concern was somewhat mitigated if they were included in care, including overnight hospital stays. Unfortunately, not all hospitals accommodate overnight stays for family members, and during the COVID-19 pandemic hospital visitations have often been canceled or restricted to a single family member, exacerbating the negative impact of family separations [27] . Findings of qualitative and quantitative studies converged to show that siblings of children with CKD perceived the quality of their relationships with parents and the atmosphere at home to be significantly poorer than siblings in unaffected families. Previous research has found that parents are aware of sibling differential treatment concerns, and worry about feelings of jealousy and neglect [22] . How parents address and reduce sibling perceptions of PDT in families affected by CKD would be critically important -not only for sibling well-being [28] , but also for the quality of the sibling and parent-child relationships and family functioning overall. While some previous interventions targeting families of children with chronic conditions have addressed the quality of communication between family members [29] , it is less common for sibling-specific issues such as PDT to be addressed, and even more rare for the quality of the sibling relationship itself to be investigated [30] .",

These supports should also emphasize minimizing disruptions to family routine, as well as sibling concerns regarding parent-child conflict about adherence issues. Given that recent findings indicated a substantial minority of parents and children with CKD experience posttraumatic stress [41] , it makes sense to adopt a trauma-informed approach for programming with siblings of children with CKD [42] . Currently, there are a handful of interventions that focus on the needs of siblings of children with illnesses or disorders [43] ; however, these programs commonly target parent-child communication which may or may not address sibling perceptions of PDT. Given the marked negative perceptions of PDT by siblings across the studies reviewed and the potential for significant negative impact on sibling psychosocial adjustment and the quality of family relationships, addressing PDT should be a high priority in any educational or support program designed for siblings in families affected by CKD.",

Parent-child conflict management style concerning adherence, as well as strategies for minimizing disruptions to routine also emerged as significant directions for future research. Perhaps even more importantly, if or how parents engage with siblings regarding their perceptions of PDT needs further exploration, as do differences in perceptions of PDT across children in the family and how these perceptions impact their well-being [26] . A longitudinal examination of the development and effectiveness of sibling coping strategies needs to be undertaken, as well as the availability of supportive relationships within the family and support systems outside the home. Related to supports, research addressing positive aspects of sibling well-being in families affected by CKD, including aspects of individual, relational and family resilience, as well as posttraumatic growth, is sorely needed. Given that only one of the selected studies utilized a mixed-methods approach, more studies incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods with larger and more diverse samples should be undertaken. Research also needs to address differences in timing of diagnosis (e.g., at birth as compared to during childhood) as well as the timing of transplant, including the potential role of siblings as pediatric donors, although this is rare [44] . Gender and cultural differences were not addressed in the studies reviewed due to small sample sizes; therefore, future work should be conducted in a variety of geographic locations and take ethno-cultural influences into account. Potential sources of stress for families, such as socioeconomic strain, geographic relocation for health care, adaptation as a refugee or newcomer family, and experiences of systemic racism within the health care system are also important factors influencing the well-being of siblings that future research should address [45] .",
