            "text": "Design education has traditionally been deemed a face-to-face endeavor causing online learning to be disregarded as a viable teaching option. Nonetheless, the recent impact of COVID-19 pressured design schools to rapidly migrate online, impelling many educators to utilize this unfamiliar and largely dismissed methodology. The impending problems exposed with this sudden shift point to a significant gap in research. Accordingly, this study proposes a set of guidelines targeting design knowledge-building, based on an in-depth look at student experience during an online design course. Data were collected through a 63-item course efficiency survey (n = 59) and a series of semi-structured focus group interviews (n = 16) with the enrolled students. The following overarching themes emerged through iterative thematic analysis of the interview data: (1) flexibility and handling stress, (2) managing self-pacing issues (3) formal conversation platform, (4) content variety and access options. The themes were interpreted in relation to the survey findings and the broader research on learning. The proposed guidelines emphasize initially clear goals and objectives, pacing flexibility with progress guidance, content and communication variety, sense of presence and peer exposure, and individualized feedback. It is expected that the guidelines will be helpful in building, conducting, and evaluating future online design knowledge-building experiences.",

            "text": "The research on online design learning spans 30 years back, with the term virtual design studio being coined in the early 1990s (Wojtowicz, 1995) and the groundwork on online design learning being laid at the very beginning of the twenty-first century (Broadfoot & Bennett, 2003; Kvan, 2001; Maher & Simoff, 1999) . However, unlike the exponentially growing literature on online learning, the number of studies on online design learning has been lagging. This may be partly due to the assumption that design learning is first and foremost a face-toface endeavor with a master-apprentice dynamic rooted in the mimetic learning practices of the past (Billett, 2014; Efland, 1990; MacDonald, 2004) , some studies describing examples from as early as Ancient Greece (Efland, 1990; Green & Bonollo, 2003) . Furthermore, previous research draws attention to the difficulties associated with the adoption and integration of technology by students (Akar et al., 2004) , as well as the instructors (Pektas, 2007) . Today, online design learning research covers a range of issues concerning distance collaboration (Akar et al., 2004; Bohemia et al., 2009a Bohemia et al., , 2009b Rodriguez et al., 2018) , blended learning solutions (Hill, 2017; Masdeu & Fuses, 2017; Pektas, 2012 Pektas, , 2015 , comparison with physical studios (Gogu & Kumar, 2021; Saghafi et al., 2012) , online sense of presence (Lotz et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2021) , virtual worlds (Dadakoglu & Ozsoy, 2020; Grove & Steventon, 2008) , social media (Fleischmann, 2014; Guler, 2015; Schadewitz & Zamenopoulos, 2009) , to utilizing virtual reality and augmented reality (Maher et al., 2012; Nisha, 2019) . Nevertheless, the existing literature is limited in number and scope, falling short of covering the breadth of problems that online design education faces (Cho & Cho, 2019; Fleischmann, 2020a; Jones et al., 2021; Lotz et al., 2018) .",

Other research predicted that the advancing technology and expanding user interest to adopt and interact online should justify such an expansion for design learning as well (Guler, 2012; Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005) . However, the current reality of a slow-growing base of research on online design learning depicts a stark contrast and points to a significant need for robust scientific output. Considering the prevalent tendency of design education to align itself with the changes in industry and society (Hall, 2016; Sireesha, 2018) , the need for students to develop online collaboration and interaction competencies (Fleischmann, 2020a) , as well as the high cost of physical design studio learning (Daalhuizen & Schoormans, 2018; Richburg, 2013) and the paradigm shift brought in by COVID-19, design education will surely transform moving forward. This is a strong indication that there is a need for further research on online design learning, especially with regard to curriculum design and structuring.",

However, many studies identify another set of courses in design curricula, in addition to the design studio, often referred to as support, theory, lecture, or non-studio courses. Demirbas and Demirkan (2007, p. 346) identify four different course categories based on their specific focus on theory and practice: fundamental courses with a theory focus, technology-based courses with a balanced focus, artistic courses with a practice focus, and design studios as the fourth category. The existing online design learning literature have an overwhelming emphasis on studio learning, and non-studio courses are very rarely the subject of online design learning research, even though the credit and content standards established by leading educational accreditation organizations repeatedly underline their significance (Council of Interior Design Accreditation [CIDA], 2018; National Architectural Accrediting Board [NAAB] , 2020; National Association of Schools of Art and Design [NASAD] , 2020).

It was previously claimed that students tend to perceive non-studio learning as a mere academic obstacle, often staying passive and disengaged (Allen, 1997) . Typical nonstudio teaching practices were described as front-loading skills and competencies that contradicted the more non-sequential nature of design learning, displaying weak ties to the projects running in parallel in the design studio (Gelernter, 1988; Rodriguez Bernal, 2017) . Another common criticism has been the reliance on the ability of and the effort required from the instructor to impart the knowledge, which was believed to impede the consistency of learner experience. Online learning environments can address the passive nature of the learner and the lack of social interactions, as well as the consistency issues by providing a platform that inherently cultivates interaction and collaboration, an epistemology defined as collaborativism or the Online Collaborative Learning Theory by Harasim (2017) .",

Demirkan (2016) argues that knowledge-building covers \"all\" learning activities including but not limited to learning-by-doing endeavors such as those encountered in studio learning. Knowledge-building features a very strong community component; the interactions with community members contribute to the transformation, advancement, and consumption of the knowledge by members (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2014) . When considered in relation to the collaborativist theory outlined by Harasim (2017) , the emphasis on the strong community interaction is revealed to be a common ground, which was also identified among the success factors of online knowledge-building by Swan et al., (2000, p. 379) : transparent interface, robust instructor interaction, valued and dynamic discussion. Accordingly, in the context of this study, knowledge building is defined as the constructive learning process shaped by community interactions and collaboration that leads to the formation of a knowledge base in service of design problem solving.",

Each installment ran for eight consecutive weeks, equaling to 6 class hours per week. The course featured materiality content in support of design studio courses, covering significant issues related to history, specification, application, sustainability, health, and safety. The content is associated with 20 accreditation criteria amongst the 118 stated in the accreditation guidebook published by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA, 2018) . According to the classification described in Demirbas and Demirkan (2007) , this course can be classified as technology based, with a combined focus on both theoretical and practical knowledge. Over the three years, the course enrollment was between 20 and 27 students (24.3 on avg.), of ages 19-26 (20.4 on avg.), and on average 19.2% male to 80.8% female. The way the course was delivered stayed strictly the same through the threeyear period during which data were collected.

These are intended to give students an opportunity to experience various modes of learning and gain credit through a variety of assignments. The theoretical knowledge component comprised 30% of the final grade, and delivered through 12 separate modules. The content involved a wide selection of text, images, and videos and the assessment method involved quizzes, with questions varying between 5 to 10 based on module content length (7.5 on average per module). The spatial analysis and professional roundtable components comprised 30% of the final grade. Students were expected to form inquiries and author essays on the analysis of image and video content provided, based on the acquired foundation with the modules. The material board design assignment comprised 30% of the final grade. Students were expected to creatively solve a design problem that required them to utilize the entirety of the knowledge gathered during the course to design a complex material scheme of a commercial space, considering the associated corporate identity, while addressing related sustainability, health, and safety concerns. This final assignment is in line with the research of Allen (1997), Armstrong (1997) , and Bridges (2007) which suggest that students learn technical skills and incorporate them more readily into the design process when the skills are acquired on an as-needed basis. Students were expected to seek 2 written feedback from the course instructor, provided through email. Participation in discussion boards comprised 10% of the final grade. Each student was expected to post 10 comments, 1 grade point was received per comment, a word limit of 150 was expected to be met. The participations were posted in discussion boards that were tied to theoretical knowledge modules, analysis assignments, and the final material board assignment. Excluding the instructor's comments, on average 301.3 comments were posted during each installment of the course and students typically went over the minimum of 10 posts, contributing 12.4 posts on average per individual.",

The 63-item course efficiency survey utilized a 5-point semantic differential scale system of response (Finstuen, 1977; Osgood et al., 1957) , instead of the typical Likert scale. Semantic differential scale enabled identifying bipolar concepts that focused on the connotative meaning associated with positive and negative sentiments deeply related to the question at hand, positively affecting respondent engagement, as opposed to a vague and persistent agree/disagree scale (Rocereto et al., 2011) . Previous research indicates extreme responses and additional bias with Likert scale usage; and the bias, even though still present, is more controlled in semantic differential scale use (Friborg et al, 2006; Wirtz & Lee, 2003) .",

The entirety of the focus group interviews was recorded as audio and video. The multiple focus groups enabled a more robust identification of themes (Krueger, 2014) .

Flexibility and stress relationship emerged to be a significant sub-theme during the analysis. Participating students expressed an appreciation for the flexibility attained with the soft deadlines, while the delivery method was still perceived as efficient. Survey results support this tendency (Table 1, Q15) . A significant number of the students were either working a full-time job, dealing a personal/family matter or health issues at various points during the course. Students communicated repeatedly that flexibility helped to manage their own time and impede the build-up of stress, which was apparent on the survey results as well (Table 1 , Q52). It should be noted that flexibility also aids the course adaptation period which can further mitigate the build-up of stress (Schafer, 2012) . Students also expressed an appreciation for asynchronous alternatives to various activities, as blocking time created issues and stress. MU's following comment is one example among several -MU -\"\u2026with our Zoom [meeting] and everything, like, I was lucky that I was able to talk to my boss and like, like hey for these two or three hours, like I'm going to be away from my desk\u2026 I was so stressed out\u2026\"",

Existing research suggests that flexibility correlates with student motivation (Ferrer-Caja & Weiss, 2000) , conversely, a rigid and controlling learning environment cause students to lose initiative and can deteriorate learning efficacy (Amabile, 1996; Utman, 1997) . Luskin and Hirsen's (2010) research associated students' perception of control with increased feelings of satisfaction, enjoyment, and confidence. Learning efficacy was also claimed to be positively correlated to learner control and responsibility (Kay, 2001) , and correspondingly, design students should make better use of flexibility and an elevated sense of control considering the constructivist nature of design learning. Survey data reflects the perception of a more uniform distribution of workload during the course, a total workload that is in line with other similar courses, and a tendency to rate motivation as high (Table 1 , Q14, Q04, Q26). Some participating students related flexibility to motivation cycles they experienced and claimed that flexibility helped them to adapt their schedule, and set up the pacing in accordance with their psychological state. OS's following comment was one example -OS -\"There were some weeks I took a little bit longer to do things and some weeks I was feeling more productive and I would knock out like five modules at once.

Successful self-pacing as it relates to self-regulated learning has been tied to a conscious effort in understanding, planning, and monitoring course tasks and the ability to devise appropriate strategies to follow (Corno & Mandinach, 1983; Ridley et al., 1992) . Self-directed learning demands management, monitoring, and motivation as core qualities (Fisher et al., 2001; Garrison, 1997) , and accordingly, some students show great skill in self-regulated learning whereas others need support in varying forms. The analysis revealed that participating students were aware of the challenges self-pacing presented and the possibility to easily overwhelm oneself from the get-go. DC's following comment summarizes the problem -DC -\"I feel like if you tried to do it all at once, if you didn't make yourself a schedule to go through, it's pretty easy to, like overwhelm yourself with the amount of work or [fall] really behind and then be overwhelmed at the end.\"",

Therefore, it can be claimed that a simple schedule with suggested deadlines should be useful. Considering the visual tendencies of design students (Guler & Atalayer, 2016; Mostafa & Mostafa, 2010) a visual schedule might prove more useful. The survey results indicate that students understood the course objectives and expectations and had a clear trajectory from the get go (Table 2, Q22, Q23) , however, the analysis of the interview data revealed these were not necessarily sufficient for organizing a self-pacing strategy. For time management issues, students proposed and largely agreed that a well laid out schedule would alleviate some self-pacing problems. ED's following comment is one among several on a need for a well laid-out schedule -ED -\"Hey, it's a good time to work on your material boards or where [the instructor] would say, I think that you should get this module done at least by now\u2026 I think if people were to have issues with time management that might be good for them to see like a laid out schedule in advance.\"",

Numerous research relate higher sense of social presence to improved learning interactions, critical thinking skills, and overall satisfaction with a course (Garrison et al., 2010; Gunawardena & Zittle, 1997; Wei & Chen, 2012; Weinel et al., 2011) . However, establishing social presence requires student participation, and reluctant students might need various incentives. Peterson (2001) suggests that turning participations into assignments might create a perception of responsibility, and Shea et al. (2000) suggest that assigning a greater percentage of grade points on discussion helps with student learning and satisfaction. On the other hand, Bates (2015 as cited in Harasim, 2017, p. 126) argued that awarding grades to participation diminished the extrinsic value of contribution and emphasized extrinsic motivations (see also . For this study, participation was incentivized with grade points based on the number of words and contributive merit during the course. According to the survey data, even though not very firmly, students expressed a sense of community (Table 3 , Q40). One sub-theme that emerged during the analysis was the clear assessment of peer contributions. DC's comment below is one example of students' appreciation for clear participation assessment guidelines -DC -\"Yeah, I think it's nice to have the parameters to at least have like a base level for people who may not have otherwise written as much, you know, maybe it makes them go back and research something or read through something again\u2026\"",

The correlation between the perception of being part of a learning community and course satisfaction and completion rates underlines the significance of online interactions. The sustained interaction between the peers and the instructor is key to engaging students with the language, vocabulary, and activities associated with the target discipline (Harasim, 2017) . It is especially important for design learning, as the proficiency of using professional terminology plays a significant role in career success. Participating students expressed that they perceived the peer interaction on the learning platform as a contributing factor to their learning experience, and a parallel claim can be made based on survey data (Table 3, Q43) . Analysis of interview data indicates that students acknowledged that they were learning more efficiently as a communicating group compared to their self-research efforts. MS's comment below encapsulates the perception of peer interactions -MS -\"I actually had to do a little bit of research to, like say for the spatial analysis I had to look up, like brick possibilities with translating it to the floor or something. I learned things that I shouldn't, I wouldn't have learned if I only did that for a research paper and then I got some things wrong and people corrected me and [the instructor] corrected me and then I learned and so now I know like some things that I wouldn't have known if I only had to like research brick by myself\u2026\"",

            "text": "Other researchers claim that writing is associated with high-order and deeper learning (Garrison et al., 1999; Thomas, 2002) . Martin (2001) states that in written communication, such as in discussion boards, subjects strive to compensate for missing communication traits by being more descriptive and transparent. In addition, learner discussions can be built around images and videos elevating the quality of peer contributions (De Choudhury & Sundaram, 2011; Shirky, 2009). Moreover, an asynchronous system can provide moderators more flexibility and control over events (Guler, 2015; Poynter, 2010) . Lastly, in an online platform there's no peer competition for opportunities to talk (Althaus, 1997) , and as a result, every voice to be heard equally. According to the survey, students express comfort with sharing ideas, however, their belief in the contributions of their participation was somewhat limited (Table 3 , Q44, Q47, Q49). The analysis of the focus group interviews reveals many parallels in student experience with the existing research. The below comment of NS shows one example of participants' view on asynchronous participation -NS -\"I think like I was able to go more in depth because I had more time to think about it and I think people, like just in general, people post a lot more than they would have said like in a classroom environment.\" (2015) elaborate on how social media use can strengthen the sense of community and enhance peer exposure, interaction, dialogue and exchange. However, the research on social media trends suggest a transformation of the perception of social media as an extension of daily life and circle of friends, increased association with privacy and social life and users displaying a tendency towards separating it from educational platforms (Dahlstrom et al., 2015) . The survey data indicates a similar trend among the participating students (Table 3, Q60) . Furthermore, there is some serious criticism associated with the current functionality and use of social media. Research suggests that social media content revolves around short bursts of attention, that hinder deep and critical thought needed for education (Carr, 2010 as cited in Harasim, 2017, p. 139) . Even though indicating a positive impact on learning of design, the limitations of social media have also been outlined by the research (Schnabel & Ham, 2012) , including incompatibility with design content as well as noise and clutter created by posts. Another significant problem appears to be the limited means to organize and access information heap built through an educational process (Guler, 2015) . Budge (2013), argued that social media primarily serves an augmentative role. More recent data from Marshalsey and Sclater (2020) , also indicates low density of use for social media channels dedicated to personal use compared to the official learning or conferencing platforms. Parallel to the survey data, a general negative outlook on social media as an educational platform was apparent in the focus group analysis. Even though students utilized social media services, specifically GroupMe, to communicate with peers along with the course platform Canvas, these services were repeatedly deemed as less formal, less organized, and oftentimes distracting. Below comments from MU and NX encapsulate this claim -MU -\"And then we found ways to communicate with each other, like with our GroupMe and stuff to, like figure out what was successful and what wasn't successful.\" NX -\"GroupMe is easy to use, it's very casual but it's not good for organization because it's all chronological\u2026 AO (interjects) -casual stuff in there, it was just, it was a lot sift through\u2026\"",

In relation to learning styles and strategies, choice has been identified as one major contributor to learner success , and content aligning with student preferences were found to be easily understandable and motivating (Fleming & Baume, 2006; Dunn et al., 2002; Dunn et al., 1981) . Even though providing content aligning with learner preferences has been shown to be beneficial, critical research argues that outcome and performance benefits do not justify the financial and time costs (Coffield et al., 2004; Papanagnou et al., 2016; Pashler et al., 2009; Reiner & Willingham, 2010) . Kraemer et al. (2014) suggest that students somehow convert the provided information into content that is aligned with their learning preferences. Another critical research claims that excessive choice can be confusing, distracting, and mentally taxing for the learner (Van Merri\u00ebnboer & Sluijsmans, 2009 ). The analysis of the focus group data indicates that students benefited from and appreciated the different types of content provided. It should be noted that the scientific accuracy and exact alignment with students' learning preference claims were disregarded. The survey data support this finding ( Critiques, as a type of feedback, are a foundational component of design education (Guler, 2015) , crucial for grounding the knowledge base and relating it to the design problems students face (Green & Bonollo, 2003) . Design students are familiar with the benefits and shortcomings of critiques which ultimately shape their educational expectations. On the other hand, research has associated feedback with a reduced sense of autonomy and suggested that it should be carefully regulated. According to the analysis, it is found that students appreciated the individualized critiques they received for their design assignment. According to the survey data, the number of feedbacks was perceived as moderate, however, the quality was high, supporting the previous finding ( One of the major disadvantages of synchronous systems has been identified as the excessive leftover data heap and difficulties in backtracking (Chi & Lieberman, 2011) . In online design learning where freedom from time and space limitations can be attained, the ease of archival and backtracking affects student performance positively (Guler, 2015) . Allowing for a variety of ways to access the course material as well as a clear hierarchy was also deemed as helpful strategies to support learning (Zapalska & Brozik, 2006) . The analysis of the focus group data shows parallels to the findings in previous research: a strategy involving clear subdivision and hierarchy of module content coupled with images and Table 4 Survey data related to content variety and access options videos as markers may contribute to the successful backtracking of content. The survey results also corroborate ease of access (Table 4, Q55) . ED's following comment summarizes the advantages of easy backtracking -ED -\"I mean all of the different modules that [were provided], it was easy to follow along with because it was very, like subcategorized\u2026 if I went through [the quiz] and I missed one question, I kind of knew which one that was. I could go back and be like, okay I remember, it was in this section and it was underneath this subcategory. So I could go back and kind of review it a little better.\"",

            "text": "This research investigated a group of design students' experiences pertaining to an online design knowledge-building process that featured modules for theoretical knowledge base building, analysis modules for forming queries based on the newly acquired theoretical foundation, and a creative problem solving assignment that called for the utilization of this knowledge to design a material scheme, requiring students to express spatial design intent as well as address related sustainability, health, and safety concerns. Communication was built into all facets of the learning process and participation efforts impacted the final grade. The data for the study were collected through a 63-item course efficiency survey (n = 59) and a series of semi-structured focus group interviews (n = 16) with the enrolled students. The following overarching themes emerged through iterative thematic analysis of the interview data: (1) Soft deadlines, pacing flexibility, and asynchronous alternatives to course activities prevent stress build-up and improve knowledge retention 1a Learning effectiveness positively correlates with learner control and responsibility (Kay, 2001) 1b In a more controlling environment, students lose initiative and learn less effectively (Amabile, 1996; Utman, 1997) 1c Granting more flexibility results in improved student self-determination (Ferrer-Caja & Weiss, 2000) 1d The sense of control established while interacting with instructional media and content results in increased learner satisfaction, enjoyment, and confidence (Luskin & Hirsen, 2010) 2 Flexibility creates self-pacing issues for some students. Goals and expectations should be communicated clearly, visual schedules and intermittent personal follow-up communication should be provided 2a Setting clear educational, goals, guidelines, and schedules is key in online learning (Rollag, 2010;  Schroeder-Moreno, 2010) 2b For effective self-learning planning, clear and concise expectations should be set (Zimmerman, 2008) , to help the student set up personal goals and develop a personal motivation strategy (Roper, 2007) 2c The directness and immediacy of instructor interactions are tied to student satisfaction, motivation, and course outcomes (Ondrey, 2017; Schutt et al., 2009) 3 Accommodating various student learning preferences and planning for an initial adaptation period is essential 3a Students are often conscious about their learning preferences and they actively shape their behavior accordingly (Hussman & O'Loughlin, 2006) 3b If the content is aligned with learning preferences, student motivation is increased (Dunn et al., 1981 (Dunn et al., , 1989 Fleming & Baume, 2006) 3c Students adapt by converting the content to their preferred learning type (Kraemer et al., 2014) 3d Excessive choice can be confusing, distracting, and mentally taxing for the learner (Van Merri\u00ebnboer & Sluijsmans, 2009) 3e Offline learning should be supported through downloadable and printable content options (Netolicky, 2020; Nugroho et al., 2020) 4 The course should be divided into sub-modules/tabs and important points should be marked with images and videos to help with self-pacing as well as backtracking 4a Effective subdivision of content is crucial in terms of increasing student motivation and completion rates (Bonk et al., 2002; Pomales-Garc\u00eda & Liu, 2006) 4b A multiplicity of ways to access learning material supported by a clear hierarchy and unlimited movement is important (Zapalka and Brozik, 2006) 4c Logical archiving and ease of backtracking coupled with freedom from time/space limitations positively affects student performance (Guler, 2015) 5 Asynchronous discussion boards should be utilized to cultivate thoughtful and in-depth conversation, to incentivize further research on the target topic, to help with tracking peer progress, benefiting from peer ideas, and addressing self-pacing issues 5a Regarding online participations as assignments create a perception of responsibility and increase engagement (Peterson, 2001; Shea et al., 2000) 5b Missing communication traits in asynchronous communication compel writers to be more explicit and transparent (Martin, 2001) 5c Asynchronous communication minimizes the competition for opportunities to be heard (Althaus, 1997) while providing moderators more control and flexibility (Guler, 2015; Poynter, 2010) 5d The ability to track peer progress positively impacts learner experience and motivation (Hsiao et al., 2012; Jin, 2017) 6 Social media platforms with personal use focus should not be incorporated as part of the official course flow as it is perceived as less formal, less organized, and distracting flexibility and handling stress, (2) managing self-pacing issues (3) formal conversation platform, (4) content variety and access options. The themes were interpreted in relation to the survey findings and the broader research on learning. A 7-item guideline was proposed to inform the development of improved online design knowledge-building experiences. A number of the findings reaffirm and ground previously established knowledge by the broader online learning research within design education context, other findings highlight design education specific methods and approaches. The proposed guidelines underline the need for initially clear goals and objectives, pacing flexibility with progress guidance, content and communication variety, sense of presence and peer exposure, and individualized feedback. It is expected that this guideline will be part of a foundation that will become relevant with the very possible surge in published research on online design learning within the post-COVID-context, and also be helpful in building, conducting, and evaluating future online design knowledge-building experiences.",

By changing learning dynamics, such emerging technologies will necessitate the expansion and refinement of the proposed guideline.
