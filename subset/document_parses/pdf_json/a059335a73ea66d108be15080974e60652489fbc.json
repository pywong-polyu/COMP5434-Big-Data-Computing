PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have the highest sensitivity in lower respiratory tract samples [2] . Because bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, alternative sampling methods with a similar sensitivity are of value. Previously, it has been demonstrated that heat moisture exchanger (HME) filter fluid had a composition approximating that of the fluid in the distal airspace (which is obtained during bronchoalveolar lavage) and can be used to test for pathogens [3] [4] [5] .",
