For example, patients in PCORI-funded research have assisted in developing patient-centered study websites and selecting patient-reported outcome measures. 7 A key role for patient partners is identifying the topics, measures, procedures, outcomes, and communication strategies most relevant to them. 8 Engagement may be influenced by patient partners' motivations to participate in research: dissatisfaction with previous or current healthcare experiences, 9 strong opinions on improvement for the benefit of others, 10 beliefs in the value of the health intervention, 10 or to fulfill their own desire to learn. 10 The authors are collaborators on a large, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial designed to improve care and outcomes for people managing multiple chronic conditions (MCC). The study tested whether a structured quality improvement (QI) process undertaken at primary care practices seeking to integrate behavioral health and primary care (IBH-PC) would produce superior patient health and clinical outcomes when compared to practices undergoing no structured QI process. 11 The research team included three patient co-investigators (co-authors JL, PR, and DP) from the inception of the study's aims in 2015 through dissemination of its results in 2021. Each patient co-investigator had ongoing experiences with diverse presentations of MCCs and responded to invitations from providers to participate. The research team used a \"study-focused\" framework for involving patients in research, 12 practicing thoughtful engagement processes tied to study activities to support collaborative work. Patient co-investigators, considered study key personnel, influenced study activities across three domains of engagement, 1 including the following: (1) planning the study, by identifying meaningful patient-reported outcomes, inclusion criteria, and patient-centeredness themes and tools, and developing the Patient Partner Guide (PPG, described below);",

[13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The goal of the PPG was to help clinics gain essential, patient-based insight to achieve patient-centered integrated BH services for patients managing MCC. Our patient co-investigators led the design of the PPG, bringing together diverse research team members. This report uses the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) 21 format to describe the development of the PPG and its use by clinics undertaking the QI project.",

The Engagement Team included additional patient coinvestigators (PR, DP) and worked with stakeholders with personal or professional MCC experiences to learn about engagement. This team drew from demonstrations of healthcare organizations that engaged stakeholders in advisory groups, shared governance, and internal quality improvement teams. 20, [22] [23] [24] The Engagement Team was guided by sources that emphasized shared leadership as the peak of a graduated scale of partnerships built on a foundation of co-learning, trust, transparency, and honesty. 14, [25] [26] [27] Engagement Team members assessed, practiced, and improved on methods to engage as multi-stakeholder partners, creating and using an approach to identify common values and goals. Patient co-investigators and stakeholders provided guidance on what matters most when including diverse stakeholders with MCC in QI efforts. Throughout the PPG's development, team members created affinity diagrams, 28 shared lived experiences, and used an appreciative response process to receive and provide feedback (see Appendix: \"Offering Feedback\"). These processes became part of the PPG to create a healthy, equitable, inclusive, and cooperative environment for all members of clinic QI teams.",

Clinics noted that finding a patient partner with MCC required discussion among many clinic members, some of whom resisted the idea or expressed doubts about whether a patient would commit to regular meeting attendance. Although some teams worked diligently to recruit two patient partners, per the PPG, all six clinics engaged a single patient on a long-term basis. Typically, the patient who joined the team was someone well known to the clinic, who had previously volunteered, or who served as an advisor to the clinic or health system. QI team members commented on the length of the PPG, technical challenges in downloading from a private website, and the positive value of the materials. Templates, for example, provided useful starting points for contracts with patients joining a QI team. In all six sites, patients operated as full participants in the QI teams. They attended regular meetings and, in four clinics, were paid for their efforts. They shared their own and family members' experiences as patients at the clinic, asked clarifying questions, and expressed opinions about decisions the teams faced. Across all six clinics, QI patient partner input and feedback were valued, with one team reporting: \"We changed our plan because of our Patient Partner.\" Impact on the Engagement Team. The effect of collaborating on this aspect of the research study as patient co-investigators and academic researchers was new learning for the authors, especially as the act of engaging patients as partners required a shift in understanding that affected everyone. In the words of one of the patient co-investigators (PR), If you want transformation then you have to transform. Your organization, your process and your thinking must transform. The traditions and beliefs you may have will only be barriers if they are not allowing the patient to the table and to the meaningful transformation work that must be done.",

This was the first researcher-patient partnership for this team, and over time, sensitivity to dynamics needing attention, such as symptoms of disengagement or imbalances in power, increased. Regular check-ins and needs assessments helped prevent and address these symptoms and have informed the PPG. Taking time at the start or close of meetings to acknowledge each person was essential to the development of reciprocal relationships. The team depended upon individuals having the confidence to bring their best whole person health to the work. Checking in with each team member regularly became a norm for the Engagement Team.

All authors agree that the communication methods used and compensation provided in the IBH-PC study were supportive of commitment, a culture of sharing, and the practice of dialogue that created the PPG. Understanding and improving key processes of patient engagement in research will continue to lead to new opportunities to standardize research practice. For example, developing a standard process to engage patient partners in examining a proposed intervention and its interface with study participants is a potential step that can build on comparative effectiveness research standards, as proposed by Esmail et al. 41 The PPG is freely available as part of the study intervention to help QI teams in primary care clinics engage diverse stakeholders at https://sites.google.com/view/ibhpc/workbooks/patient-partnering.",

This example of a multistakeholder research team's development of an intervention component to engage clinic patients in QI demonstrates that patients can do more than contribute to research. They can take leadership in identifying gaps in research concepts and tools and in responding to them, thereby making engagement successful and rewarding for all team partners involved.",
