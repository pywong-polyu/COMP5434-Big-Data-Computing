            "text": "Over the last 18 months, much has been learned about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. The results are sobering; higher rates of severe disease and complications have been documented amongst pregnant people in both highincome countries and low-and middle-income countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In addition, severe and critical COVID-19 in pregnancy has been associated with elevated rates of premature birth and neonatal morbidities. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The management of pregnant people with COVID-19 presents unique clinical and ethical challenges, which are amplified by the relative scarcity of rigorous, high-quality data about safety and efficacy of interventions in this population. 8, 9 Despite a clear medical need, pregnant people continue to be routinely excluded from biomedical research, hampering efforts to provide evidence-based care. 9 Remdesivir is a nucleoside prodrug with broad-spectrum activity against human and zoonotic coronaviruses. 10 It was the first drug licensed for the treatment of COVID-19 and has been shown to shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients requiring oxygen therapy. 11 Its impact on mortality, however, is uncertain [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and this uncertainty is reflected in the heterogeneity of consensus treatment guidelines, with some recommending for, and others against, its use in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Pregnant and breastfeeding people were specifically excluded from all clinical trials evaluating remdesivir for COVID-19, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and as such, there is no direct evidence of efficacy in this population. Pregnant people were eligible for an earlier Phase III trial evaluating remdesivir for Ebola virus infection; six pregnant patients were enrolled in the remdesivir arm (3.4% of the participants who were randomized to remdesivir) and there were no significant maternal, fetal or newborn adverse events reported in this subgroup. 21 Remdesivir has been used outside of clinical trials in pregnant people with COVID-19 and data on safety are accumulating from post-marketing registries, compassionate use programmes and case series/reports. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] The aim of this review was to summarize and synthesize these data to help inform clinical decision-making about remdesivir's use in pregnancy and lactation. To set the evidence in context, we briefly review background information on adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes in general, and the effect that COVID-19 has on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.",

The estimated global preterm birth rate in 2014 was 10.6%, with significant differences by region, from 8.7% in Europe to 13.4% in North Africa. 38 Maternal mortality refers to deaths due to complications of pregnancy or childbirth as well as deaths occurring within 42 days of pregnancy termination. 35 It is standardized as the maternal mortality ratio, defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100 000 live births during a given time period. Globally, the annual maternal mortality ratio was 211 in 2017 but varied widely from 5 in Western Europe to 533 in sub-Saharan Africa. 35 Important adverse fetal outcomes include low birth weight (<2.5 kg) and birth defects. 34 Low birth weight affects approximately 15% of live births globally and tracks with prematurity. 39 The overall background prevalence of birth defects is between 3% and 4%, depending on the definition used, population studied and time period of follow-up. 34, 40 Birth defects secondary to drug exposure account for less than 1% of all birth defects. 34 The embryonic period, between Weeks 3 and 8, marks the period of greatest sensitivity to the effects of teratogens. 34 ",

            "text": "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic it was unclear whether pregnancy was a risk factor for more severe illness. Initial data, mainly in the form of case series and centre experiences, were difficult to interpret, lacked appropriate comparator groups and were limited by other potential biases. Now that larger datasets are available, it is clear that pregnant people are at heightened risk of severe COVID-19-related complications compared with their non-pregnant counterparts, particularly when infection occurs in the third trimester. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] For example, the risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation are approximately 2-4 times higher than those of nonpregnant populations of the same age. 1, 2, 4 In addition, although the absolute risk of death in pregnant people with COVID-19 is low, it is many times higher than that of non-infected people of similar gestation. 1,2 The majority of deaths have been concentrated in less-developed regions where comprehensive intensive care resources may be limited. 2 The emergence of new variants has been linked to trends of increasing illness severity in pregnant and peripartum people, but a fulsome understanding of this association is still evolving. 41 Similar to the general population, pre-existing comorbidities such as chronic hypertension, diabetes and obesity are additional risk factors for severe disease in pregnant people. 1, 2, 5, 7 The magnitude of risk to pregnant people is also amplified in minority populations. 1, 2, 5 Multiple studies have shown that severe or critical COVID-19 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and neonatal respiratory morbidity. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The majority of preterm deliveries in severe and critical COVID-19 cases appear to be iatrogenic rather than due to direct effects of infection or maternal illness. 42 In keeping with elevated rates of prematurity, neonatal ICU admissions and respiratory disorders have also been increased. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 7 Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been linked to birth defects, although data on infection in early pregnancy are limited. Some, but not all, studies have suggested that stillbirths are more common among pregnant people with COVID-19, although the numbers overall are low and estimates are imprecise. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 43 Data regarding intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 transmission have been reassuring. Although it has been reported, 44 intrauterine transmission appears to be rare. 2, 4, 45 Similarly, transmission via breastmilk seems to be unlikely. 46 Finally, when appropriate precautions are taken, the risk of mother-to-infant postnatal transmission appears to be low. 47 ",

For animal studies, remdesivir has been assessed in rat fertility and prenatal and postnatal studies, as well as rat and rabbit embryo-fetal developmental studies. 48 In a prenatal study in rats, female rats exposed to remdesivir 10 mg/kg/day (1-fold exposure of regular human doses) exhibited a lower mean number of corpora lutea, and consequently lower mean numbers of implantation sites and viable embryos accompanied by lower mean ovary and uterus/cervix/ oviduct weights. These findings were considered to be related to remdesivir exposure and the 'no observed adverse effect level' (NOAEL) for female reproductive and embryonic toxicity was deemed to be 3 mg/kg/day, which provides approximately 0.34fold exposure to regular human doses. No adverse effects on intrauterine growth, survival and fetal morphology were observed in embryo-fetal development studies in pregnant rats and rabbits with exposures up to four times higher than those achieved in humans with recommended dosing. 48 Remdesivir transplacental transfer studies have not been completed; however, reasonable predictions can be made based on its chemistry and pharmacokinetics. Remdesivir is a monophosphoramidate prodrug; following IV administration it is rapidly hydrolysed by intracellular esterases to a nucleoside monophosphate analogue and requires several additional steps of metabolism to generate the active intracellular nucleotide triphosphate analogue. 10 This suggests that remdesivir itself is unlikely to cross the placenta in clinically important amounts, but characteristics of major circulating metabolites, such as long half-lives, low molecular weights and high unbound fractions, 10 suggest that they may have greater placental transfer.",

Of the 13 cases with adverse pregnancy outcomes, 9 were reported in pregnant patients treated with remdesivir for Ebola virus infection and 4 received remdesivir for COVID-19. All patients with COVID-19 who experienced adverse pregnancy outcomes were critically ill and required invasive mechanical ventilation within 24 h of remdesivir initiation. Five cases of congenital abnormalities were also identified; in all cases, remdesivir exposure occurred after the first trimester. Sixty-seven pregnant people received remdesivir through the COVID-19 compassionate use programme during a 1 month period early in the pandemic (March-April 2020). 23 Most (>90%) were enrolled in the USA. The median gestational age was 28 weeks (range 14-39 weeks) with no first trimester exposures. A high proportion of critically ill pregnant patients were included: 67% were admitted to the ICU and 40% received invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, 93% recovered within 28 days. In keeping with results in non-pregnant patients, pregnant patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation had the highest rates of recovery (98%) and the shortest median time to recovery (5 days). Amongst 26 deliveries, 69% were delivered very preterm (24-32 weeks gestation). No neonatal deaths occurred during the observation period and there were no congenital abnormalities observed at birth (M. Das, Gilead Sciences; personal communication, 3 May 2021). There was one spontaneous abortion at 17 weeks' gestation in a woman with concurrent Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, endocarditis and septic arthritis and one maternal death after delivery, which was attributed to COVID-19.",

Sparse pharmacokinetic results from three critically ill patients with COVID-19 have also been reported, 50, 51 but no data describing remdesivir pharmacokinetics in pregnancy are available. Simulation studies suggest pregnancyrelated increases in glomerular filtration rate and renal tubular secretion may increase elimination of remdesivir's major active extracellular metabolite. 52 Additionally, pregnancy-related changes in plasma protein concentrations due to displacement from protein binding sites and volume expansion may alter unbound concentrations of remdesivir and its metabolites, 52 potentially leading to more rapid clearance. Higher doses or more frequent administration may be required during pregnancy to match exposure seen in nonpregnant populations. However, the clinical importance of altered exposure is unclear since pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic efficacy and toxicity targets have not been established.",

Since remdesivir undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, infants are unlikely to absorb clinically important amounts of remdesivir from breastmilk. 53 However, systemic exposure to metabolites could result from breastfeeding. Reassuringly, no adverse effects were documented in the small number of infants who received remdesivir for treatment of Ebola virus infection or COVID-19. 54, 55 Conclusions Pregnant people have been recognized as a medically complex population during infectious disease pandemics since the preantibiotic era and continue to be disproportionately impacted during the current pandemic. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Prevention and treatment strategies are therefore critically important to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, there has been little progress in the equitable inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding people in biomedical research, forcing clinicians and their pregnant patients to weigh potential benefits and harms of interventions based on very little information. 8, 9 To assist in this decision-making, we reviewed data on remdesivir in pregnancy and lactation from a variety of sources. Although our review does not reveal serious safety signals, it is clear that the available data have serious limitations and are insufficient to delineate the complete spectrum of potential adverse outcomes associated with exposure to remdesivir during pregnancy and lactation. Importantly, there are very few data on remdesivir exposure in the first trimester, when organogenesis occurs. In addition, requisite pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy are currently lacking. The role of remdesivir in preventing vertical or postnatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission is also unclear. Diligent follow-up and documentation of outcomes in pregnant people with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir will be important moving forward. Greater regulatory push is clearly needed to ensure studies to obtain pregnancy data are expedited.",
