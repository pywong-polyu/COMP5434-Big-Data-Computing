Such data can be utilized to infer different variations, such as the dynamics of city dwellers and their spatial and temporal variability. This work focuses on such applications to explore the underlying association between socioeconomic characteristics of different geographical regions in Dublin, Ireland, and the number of confirmed COVID cases in each area. Our aim is to implement a machine learning approach to identify demographic characteristics and spatial patterns. Spatial analysis was used to describe the pattern of interest in Electoral Divisions (ED), which are the legally defined administrative areas in the Republic of Ireland for which population statistics are published from the census data. We used the most informative variables of the census data to model the number of infected people in different regions at ED level. Seven clusters detected by implementing an unsupervised neural network method. The distribution of people who have contracted the virus was studied. * Corresponding author sepehr.ghahramani@ucd.ie (M. Ghahramani); francesco.pilla@ucd.ie (F. Pilla) ORCID(s):",

            "text": "In March 11th, 2020, the Republic of Ireland's government launched a national action plan in response to COVID-19, a widespread lock-down in order to minimize the risk of illness. The impacts of pandemics such as the current COVID-19 should be explored extensively. To mitigate and recover from the negative repercussions, it is of paramount importance to study the effects on the social tissue in cities. It seems that various research is needed to thoroughly investigate, understand, mitigate and recover from the effect of this pandemic. Some studies have been focused on providing risk assessment frameworks based on artificial intelligence and leveraging data generated from heterogeneous sources such as disease-related data, demographic, mobility, and social media data [31, 35, 12, 3, 34] . The exposure risk of the pandemic in different environments has been assessed. Many researchers are exploring the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to mitigate effects and understand the impacts of COVID-19 on cities [28, 35, 7] . In this area of research, four distinctive categories have received significant attention: environmental quality, socio-economic impacts, management and governance, and transportation and urban design [32] . As far as the socio-economic impacts are concerned, pandemics can substantially negatively affect people at the bottom of the socio-economic hierarchy, those with low education, low income, and low-status jobs. For instance, it has been discussed that the Black and Latino people's mortality rate is twice that of the Whites in the US [40] . The pandemics can also hit vulnerable groups of people in poor sanitary conditions. Moreover, various factors such as high density, inadequate access to health services and infrastructure facilities can exacerbate the situation [9, 27] .",

They can be used to provide different platforms for social distance tracking [1, 25, 13] , monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 [4, 46] . Such technology has been used in this study. We assess the association between the demographic features and the number of confirmed cases at Electoral Divisions (i.e., ED) in Dublin, Ireland based on an optimized self-organizing neural network. It should be mentioned that the number of cases until September 10, 2020, have been considered in this work. Our aim is to understand the impacts of the pandemic on Dublin city given associated characteristics and study the related patterns in different clusters obtaining from demographic information, i.e., census data. We used a machine learning method based on an unsupervised learning approach to group spatial data into meaningful clusters [20] . In doing so, the similarities among spatial objects were taken into account. Given the implemented model, the implicit information about different EDs were extracted, and all associated relations were examined. Such data exploration can help us extract demographic information related to various clusters. First, a feature selection method was used to extract the most relevant variables since the census data includes over 700 features, and redundant features can significantly affect the model accuracy. Feature extraction aims to project high-dimensional data sets into lower-dimensional ones in which relevant features can be preserved. These features, then, were used to distinguish patterns. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection/extraction methods [14] , e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), play a critical role in dealing with noise and redundant features. These methods were used as a pre-processing phase of data analysis and helped us obtain better insights and robust decisions.",

            "text": "Broadly speaking, dimensionality reduction is considered as a method to remove redundant variables. This technique can be regarded as two distinctive approaches, i.e., feature extraction and feature selection. Feature extraction refers to those techniques that project original variables to a new latent space with lower dimensionality, while feature selection methods aim to choose a subset of variables such that a trained model minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevance to the target feature. In this work, we deal with a clustering problem and high-dimensionality issue; hence, a feature extraction technique was used. Since interpreting associated patterns in feature extraction methods can be a subjective process, different tests were implemented to deal with related issues such as readability and interpretability. PCA is a classic approach to dimensionality reduction (feature extraction) and has been implemented in various research studies. However, it suffers from a global linearity issue. Thus, to address this concern, a nonlinear technique (i.e., kernel PCA [21] ) was used in this work.",

The goal in this phase is to cluster EDs (including various demographic variables) such that similarities among them within each group are maximized. The model is based on an advanced spatial clustering technique and can deal with non-linear relationships between features of a high dimensional data set. To do so, we implemented an unsupervised approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can properly transform geo-referenced data into information. The main property of ANNs is their ability to learn and model nonlinear and complex relationships. The model employ a competition-based learning mechanism to generate insights from unlabelled data. It leverages a multilayer clustering approach, i.e., a self-organizing neural network [8, 45] , to transform a complex high-dimensional input space into low dimensional output space while preserving the topology of the data. Given a set of EDs, the model groups together different spatial objects that are similar with other (i.e., the distance among observations is minimized in a given cluster). Different validity measures were also applied and the results are illustrated. For visualization, we use the shapefile of Dublin.

            "text": "Due to the global spread of coronavirus, many researchers across the world are working to understand the underlying patterns of the pandemic from different perspectives. They are looking for effective ways to manage the flow of people and prevent new viral infections. As expected, numerous research has been undertaken as to medical concerns (e.g., diagnosis and treatment of the disease like lung disease, lung nodules, chronic inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) to ensure all required measures are in place. Different strategies, such as chest computed tomography imaging [44] and polymerase chain reaction [19] , have been discussed for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infections. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have also been used in the field of medical data analysis [4] , and different algorithms have been implemented for such analysis and patients' classification. Different neural network techniques have been utilized for diagnosis based on identified clinical characteristics such as cough, fever, sputum development, and pleuritic chest pain [22, 26] . Various impacts of the pandemic on urban areas have also attracted the attention of researchers. In [2] , the authors have introduced a novel method to identify regions with high human density and mobility, which are at risk for spreading COVID-19 by exploiting cellular-network functionalities. In doing so, they have used the frequency of handover and cell selection events to identify the density of congestion. Several visualization techniques like Class Activation Mapping (CAM) [39] , Class-specific Saliency Map, and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) [18] has been used to generate localization heatmaps in order to highlight crucial areas that are closely associated with the pandemic. Rustam et al., have implemented four Machine Learning models, such as linear regression, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator, support vector machine, and exponential smoothing to understand the threatening factors of COVID-19 [29] . Different features, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries have been taken into account in their model.",

Associated demographic databases, such as census data, can be used to understand population diversity better since they include characteristics of a country's inhabitants. Generally speaking, Spatio-temporal datasets can be divided into different categories, such as geo-referenced data points, georeferenced time series, moving objects, and trajectories. The estimation of a region's population has been a critical application of geospatial science in demography. In this sense, geodemographic clustering can be considered as a tool to understand spatially dependent datasets. This kind of clustering is unsupervised learning that groups spatial data into meaningful clusters based on similarities among various areas. The learning procedure is correlated to the tendency of people to associate themselves with others who have common characteristics. Census data can be considered as a reference for overall population estimation. It includes information about individuals who have been counted within households in different regions. Such data sets have some special characteristics such as geospatial features. They consist of measurements or observations taken at specific locations, referenced by latitude and longitude coordinates and/or associated within specific regions (in this work Electoral Divisions). Census data for the population living in the Republic of Ireland are available at a different level, i.e., Small Area and Electoral Division (ED), from a survey taken in 2016. However, since the number of confirmed cases are available at EDs, the census data at such administrative areas were incorporated.",

In Ireland, a census is conducted at five-year periods by the government, with the most recent census prior to this work occurring in 2016. The census of Ireland is disseminated by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and provides a vast amount of information. Spatial data like a census typically involves a large number of observations, meaning analysis of this nature tends to involve complex multivariate analysis and machine learning methods [17, 16, 15] . There are 322 EDs in Dublin, and the census consists of 764 features (relating to, for example, age, household size, marriage status, and education levels etc.) for each of 322 EDs. The census reports the features as a count of people. We converted these features to percentages of the population within each ED. Some sample records are presented in Table 1 . The number of Covid cases are also aggregated in this Table. There are no missing values or outliers in the census data. The dataset were normalized; the variables were scaled and transformed so that they each make an approximately equal contribution to the results. For example, there are about 100 variables relating to age information in the raw census data that they are summarized into percentages of different age bands; and there are about 40 variables relating to education levels that are converted to percentages of people holding a third-level higher education degree and above for each area. Take some variables demonstrated in Table 1 as an example. The variables T1-1AGE0M, T1-1AGE1M, T1-1AGE2M, T1-1AGE3M, and T1-1AGE4M, which refer to the number of people in different age bands (infants to four years old) have been merged, and a new feature Age0-4 has been created. In total, we extracted 53 variables that are synthesized from the census data, and a subset of these variables is presented in Table 2 . For the sake of brevity, not all summarized census variables are presented and discussed in detail. All the features created in this phase are used in a dimensionality reduction phase to be explained later. It should be mentioned that spatial features cannot be illustrated or modelled in a simple way due to their complex characteristics, e.g., size, boundaries, direction and connectivity. Hence, spatial analysis is more sophisticated than relational data processing in terms of algorithmic efficiency and the complexity of possible patterns because interrelated information at a spatial scale has to be considered. Therefore, spatial or geodemographic clustering is used for grouping and labelling geographical neighbourhoods in terms of their social and economic characteristics. Such an approach can be used to understand our spatially dependent data and the potential underlying associations between this data and confirmed number of Covid cases. Such applications allow similarities between patient structures in different EDs to be highlighted, geodemographically speaking.",

Generally speaking, feature extraction and feature selection techniques are applied to reduce data dimensionality. In the former approach, original features are mapped to a new feature space with lower dimensionality. The latter refers to those methods that identify and select a subset of features such that the trained model (based on the selected features) minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevance to the target feature. PCA is the most common dimensionality reduction approach; however, the transformation applied is linear. But when data follow a nonlinear structure, as in our case, approximating the model by a linear method like PCA will not perform well on the original data. Likewise, Multidimensional Scaling [30] and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [11, 33] suffer from the linearity issue. To address this shortcoming, nonlinear techniques such as Kernel PCA, Laplacian Eigenmaps [38] , and Semidefinite Embedding [42] can be used. The two first-mentioned methods have been applied in this work. The result of the Kernel PCA is illustrated to save space. We can define the variance-covariance matrix as",

It should be mentioned that most neural network approaches operate based on the non-linear optimization of a criterion, which may result in the local minimum issue and/or the convergence may take a long time. It has been discussed that self-organizing maps are less sensitive to such concerns. This approach is motivated by retina-cortex mapping and considered as an optimal technique for vector quantization problems. The topographic mechanism used in this method can enable us to study relationships among spatial and non-spatial features and identify associated patterns. The model is self-organized and operates based on learning rules and neuron interactions. The learning process is based on cooperation and competition among neurons. Moreover, neurons maintain proximity relationships during the learning process. The idea is to quantize the input space into a finite number of vectors. All observations in the input space (census vectors, together with the number of Covid cases in each spatial area) are projected to post-synaptic neurons in the latent space. The implemented model can transform all the census features in the input space into a lowdimensional discrete output space while preserving the relationships among variables. To do so, all vectors are mapped to neurons based on synaptic connections, each of which is assigned with weights. These weights are updated such that adjacent neurons on the lattice have similar values.

To do so, the spatial location of a topological neighbourhood of the excited neuron is detected. Several neighbourhood functions can be used to calculate the neighbourhood radius, i.e., Rectangular, Mexican hat, and Gaussian functions. The latter (i.e., Gaussian function) is the most commonly used one and has been utilized in this work. The cooperative process in this phase starts with defining an initial neighbourhood radius, which shrinks throughout different iterations based on the neighbourhood function. For each neuron ( ) in the neighborhood of the th winning neuron ( ), the algorithm updates all the weights associated with the th neuron based on a learning rate.

The proposed method includes various phases. As the census data used in this work consists of numerous features, and such characteristics can make a predictive modelling task challenging, a feature selection ap-proach has been implemented based on a non-linear method. Different tests have also been applied to make sure the most relevant features are selected. Then, an advanced geodemographic clustering algorithm was implemented based on a self-organizing feature map to extract clusters given the selected features. The quality of the generated map was analyzed. It should be noted that there is no universal definition of what is good clustering, and this notion is relative. As discussed throughout the paper, an SOM was considered in this work due to the inherent non-linear characteristics of the spatial dataset. Different validity measures were employed to make sure the results of the method used are reliable. We demonstrated that the algorithm has converged properly. According to the analysis, we have detected seven clusters based on the census data and the spatial distribution of the people were explored using the unsupervised neural network method. The distribution of people who have contracted the virus was studied. The use of the proposed geodemographic approach incorporating spatial data of a geodemographic nature means that clusters can be interpreted in terms of real-life infected people attributes.",
