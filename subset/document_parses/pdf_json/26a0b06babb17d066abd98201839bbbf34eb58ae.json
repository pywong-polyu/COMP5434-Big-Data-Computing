            "text": "The number of people aged 65 years and older reached 703 million in 2019 and is estimated to be 1.5 billion by 2050. 1 In Canada, the proportion of people aged 65 + years exceeded 17.5% in 2019, with an annual increase of 0.4%. 2 A large portion of older Canadian (over 90%) live with one or more chronic conditions 3 and nearly 23% of these individuals are frail 4,5 based on Rockwood and Mitnitski's accumulation of deficits model. 6, 7 Meanwhile, the majority of older adults prefer to live at home as they age. 8 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further highlights improving home care of older adults as a priority now more than ever. [9] [10] [11] Notwithstanding the biopsychosocial benefit to home living, putting this in practice for community-dwelling frail older adults can prove a challenging task -especially with reduced social contact. 12, 13 Home care recipients with frailty incur greater annual health care costs compared with nonfrail age-matched individuals, driven by a greater magnitude of health care utilization. 13, 14 Determining what makes a home appropriate for aging requires practical knowledge of frailty management and adverse outcome prevention, all while meeting individual needs. [13] [14] [15] Homecare technology (ie, the use of devices, such as computers, telephones, and monitoring bracelets to access health care at home), has long been touted as a solution to link primary care and home health care. [16] [17] [18] [19] However, the adoption of telehealth technology may challenge older individuals who grew up before its conception. The level of comfort and willingness to share personal health information from home with telehealth can vary by demographical factors. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Meanwhile, physician \"buy-in\" to virtual care may not always echo consumers' opinions, and the time frame to come to consensus on telehealth implementation has been curtailed by COVID-19. [26] [27] [28] Despite the volume of work dedicated to exploring attitudes of older adults with utilizing technologies of specific designs, little research has explicitly contrasted how care receivers and care providers view barriers to home care success while giving attention to frailty and virtual home care needs. This information is critical for successful home care in the present era. 26, 29 To this end, we conducted a focus group study involving both community-dwelling older adults and primary care providers, and integrated the attitudes of both parties toward the use of virtual health care in supporting at-home living for frail older adults.",

            "text": "Realizing practical virtual assessments of frailty in home care can also allow health professionals to contribute to clinical evaluation completion, reducing time commitments, and engaging family members with setting up the virtual assessment technologies and being involved in the care meetings when desired.9 Effective control of secure information management, easy access, and clinical usability are important.Based on the result, we propose a hierarchical framework to encapsulate what can influence proactive home health care (Figure 2). The base layer of the model involves implementing frailty awareness and advocacy with holistic care planning. Critical for adoption is advancing capacities of home health care technologies and an intermediary to assist usage and privacy handling through an integrated health care team (Figure 2). Maintaining trust and transparency via strict system control is a prerequisite so that misgivings related to the intrusive nature of frequent monitoring are avoided. 47,48 Instigating a system that enables the confidentiality of any recorded telephone / video calls will facilitate implementation. Family members are often reliable advocates and including them in care planning is essential. Finally, timely and rigorous checks following telehealth are crucial (Figure 2). Before the pandemic, health care relied upon doctors' office visits 49,50 ; in this new era, taking advantage of home-visits and community resources will make all the difference. In conclusion, this study represents an updated understanding of supporting home care of older adults in the new era by involving both care providers and receivers. The insight of what aspects of home care are valued by older adults and practitioners is useful for improving virtual technology and services for care of home-living frail older adults with complex health care needs.
