            "text": "Intellectual disability is a condition characterised by significant impairments of both intellectual and adaptive functioning and an onset before 18 years of age. 1 The UK Government uses the term 'learning disability' for this condition. Intellectual disability affects almost 1-2% of the general population. 2 The degree of intellectual disability is classified as mild, moderate, severe or profound, with over 90% of those affected falling within the mild range. 3 People with an intellectual disability have a high rate of mental health comorbidity, with a point prevalence of around 30%. 4 They develop psychiatric conditions at rates similar to or higher than the general population. 5 They also have high rates of physical health comorbidity and premature mortality. 6,7 A significant proportion of people with intellectual disability display 'behaviours that challenge', defined as 'behaviours of an intensity, frequency, or duration that threaten the physical safety of the person or others or restrict access to community facilities'. 8 Psychotropic medication is widely used to treat mental and behavioural disorders in people with intellectual disability. There are concerns that these drugs, in particular antipsychotics, are being used inappropriately in people with intellectual disability for the treatment of behaviours that challenge. [9] [10] [11] [12] These concerns were amplified by the Department of Health inquiry into Winterbourne View Hospital, which highlighted the inappropriate use of psychotropic medication. 13 Inappropriate medication use in in people with intellectual disabilities was highlighted by the National Health Service (NHS) England 14 15 and pledged to work with its partners to promote the campaign in leading to a reduction in the use of psychotropic medication in people with intellectual disability. 16 It included the prescription of any psychotropic medication, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics and mood stabilisers, setting out a framework for clinicians on how to rationalise prescribing and, where appropriate, taper and stop psychotropic medications. 16 ",

However, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has changed the environment and social circumstances of patients with intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder, with consequent potential impact on their mental health and behaviours. It was anticipated that lockdown restrictions, such as closure of day centres, inability to access community for routine activities, and other factors like carer/staff time off owing to health/issues with shielding, were likely to have a negative effect on patient mental well-being, leading to stress and worsening of mental health and behaviours that challenge. COVID-19 restrictions have also limited the form in which local mental health services are delivered, making provision of face-to-face psychological interventions more difficult. Consequently, it was anticipated that the use of psychotropic medication could increase during this time, to manage behavioural crisis, prevent placement breakdown and maintain the safety of people with intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder, carers and families.",

Data was collected by emailing a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (office 365 for Windows) to all psychiatrists in community CAMHS and adult intellectual disability services in the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust. Clinicians were asked to provide information for each patient reviewed during working hours for the pre-lockdown and lockdown period. This included date reviewed; medications used and if they increased, commenced or changed; summary of clinical decision, including the main reason for medication alteration (if planned beforehand or related to COVID-19); and other multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement (planned or COVID-19related). Clinicians were also requested to provide total numbers of psychiatry consultations carried out during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. This survey was deemed to be a service evaluation, and so ethics approval was not sought. This study was an observational study/survey based on patients data with no direct patient involvement/intervention hence patients consent was not required.",

During the pandemic, patients continued to have routine psychiatric follow-up via telephone, face-to-face and video consultations. Psychiatric consultations increased by 14.5% per week in the lockdown period because of an increase in urgent assessments, as routine appointments remained the same during both periods. The reasons for urgent psychiatric assessments were worsening of mental health and behaviour of patients with intellectual disability with or without autism spectrum disorder that was attributed by carers to changes in their environment and daily routine, secondary to restrictions owing to lockdown. Other factors influencing the increase in psychiatry consultations and medication prescription included limited availability of service provision because of lockdown restrictions that resulted in reduction in face-to-face contacts from other professionals (including therapy groups conducted by psychologists and nurses), and redeployment of community professionals to in-patient services. Intellectual disability prescription during COVID-19",

Sleep disturbance and increased anxiety resulted in increased commencement and use of higher doses of hypnotics and benzodiazepines. The nature and severity of urgent consultations requiring medication intervention were mainly to prevent placement breakdown and hospital admissions, and to maintain the safety of patients and/or carers. However, in some CAMHS patients with intellectual disability, overall clinical presentation was improved, possibly because of reduced demands and expectations during the lockdown period. Hence for children, medication for ADHD and sleep (such as melatonin) was either reduced or stopped. During pre-lockdown, worsening of mental health and/or behaviour was observed in some, possibly because of anticipatory anxiety related to COVID-19, the expected lockdown and its effect on day-to-day life. This increase in the number of medications being commenced or increased during both periods reflects a possible reversing the gains achieved after the launch of the STOMP initiative.",

Although community nursing accounted for most of the extra input, followed by psychology and then occupational therapy, these data may not be an accurate reflection because some teams were unable to provide the details of input by individual discipline. Increased demand for community nursing support may reflect an increased in need to review changes in mental health and behaviour, and monitoring response to and side-effects of medication changes. Intensified psychology input could be an expected response to increased demand for behavioural support and anxiety management related to COVID-19 restrictions. Increased occupational therapy input could be linked to advising patients and carers how to develop or access appropriate in-house and online daily activities during lockdown. During the lockdown period, in some community teams, there was also an increase in number of intensive support team contacts and care and treatment review requests, to prevent possible hospital admissions or to hasten discharge.",

Second, complete data for MDT intensification was not available from all teams, especially with regards to the input of different professionals in the MDT.

            "text": "We make several recommendations based on the results of this study. First, the reduction of overprescribing of antipsychotic medication in people with intellectual disability achieved after the launch of the STOMP campaign should not be lost during the pandemic. Clinicians should continue to conduct regular multidisciplinary reviews to support reduction and possible withdrawal of medication that has been commenced or increased during the COVID-19 period without clear agreed diagnostic justification. The development of a shared formulation and a behaviour support plan could avoid excessive reliance on medication. There needs to be improved monitoring of potential short-and long-term neurologic and metabolic sideeffects from psychotropic medications. Second, in view of continuing restrictions during the pandemic, intellectual disability services should be prepared to implement effective remote video consultation for routine appointments and provide adequate personal protective equipment to enable better assessments, observations and treatments. Third, maintaining adequate numbers of community psychiatrists, supported by appropriate MDTs, should be a priority to meet the expected increase in consultations and requests for medication interventions to prevent placement breakdowns and hospital admissions, and to maintain the safety of patients and carers. The wider implications of redeploying skilled community intellectual disability staff needs to be carefully considered as it could reduce availability of appropriate psychosocial interventions in preference to medication. Finally, the study should be replicated with the same sample being monitored over a longer period of time through the ongoing pandemic and beyond, to look at factors that could lead to unnecessary use of psychotropic medication in preference to psychological, behavioural and environmental measures to deal with distress experienced by people with intellectual disability living through the pandemic. This could enable identification of patient, carer and environmental factors that influence the nature of support and treatment provided. ",
