Here, we report a decoy nanoparticle against COVID-19 through a powerful two-step neutralization approach: virus neutralization in the first step followed by cytokine neutralization in the second step. The nanodecoy, made by fusing cellular membrane nanovesicles derived from human monocytes and genetically engineered cells stably expressing angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors, possesses an antigenic exterior the same as source cells. By competing with host cells for virus binding, these nanodecoys effectively protect host cells from the infection of pseudoviruses and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, relying on abundant cytokine receptors on the surface, the nanodecoys efficiently bind and neutralize inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and granulocyte\u2212macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and significantly suppress immune disorder and lung injury in an acute pneumonia mouse model.

For instance, engineered liposomes, cell membrane nanosponges, and exosomes have been demonstrated to bind and neutralize bacterial toxin (19, 20, 26) . Additionally, we have recently shown that biomimetic synthetic strategies involving synchronous synthesis and display of proteins on cell surface enable efficient development of cellular nanovesicles displaying proteins with native orientation, structure, and activity (22, 25, 27) . Therefore, we hypothesize that we can genetically engineer ACE2 on cell surface and efficiently produce cellular nanovesicles displaying ACE2 to compete with host cells for SARS-CoV-2 binding (28) (29) (30) . More importantly, recent reports involving cell membrane-coated nanoparticles for neutralization of broad-spectrum cytokines further promise the employment of engineered cellular nanovesicles for COVID-19 (18, 31) .",

Subsequently, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) characterization revealed that the nanodecoys were round lipid droplets with an average size of 100 nm ( Fig. 2D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). Through Western blotting analysis, we confirmed that the nanodecoys preserved critical receptor proteins responsible for virus and cytokine binding, including ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2, CD130 for IL-6, and CD116 for GM-CSF (Fig. 2E ).

We found that PsV infection was significantly inhibited by ACE2-Ves and nanodecoys, but not by 293T-Ves and THP1-Ves (Fig. 3A ), suggesting that high-level ACE2 displayed on the surface of nanodecoys can hijack the S protein-mediated viral infection. SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) also rely on human ACE2 receptor to gain the cell entry (34) ; therefore, we further tested the antiviral ability of nanodecoys based on pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV, including strains of WIV1 and Rs3367. The nanodecoys exhibited potent inhibitory activity against pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV in a manner similar to that of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 3 B-D), indicating the promising broadspectrum antiviral capability of nanodecoys for SARSr-CoV, which may cause an outbreak similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the future.",

Similar to PsV infection results, ACE2-Ves and nanodecoys showed better antiviral effects, as characterized by a reduction in viral particles ( Fig. 3E and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). We further examined viral copy numbers in the supernatant with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (35) , and demonstrated that the viral RNA level significantly decreased in a dosedependent manner after treatment with nanodecoys (Fig. 3F) . Meanwhile, the nanodecoys effectively inhibited pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection on human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial Caco-2 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 ), suggesting the potent antiviral effects of nanodecoys.

However, due to the lack of ACE2, THP-1 cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 (36) . To mimic the infection-induced inflammatory states, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate THP-1 cells to up-regulate inflammatory cytokines (37) . After the LPS treatment, both IL-6 and GM-CSF levels were significantly promoted ( Fig. 4 C and D) , confirming the activated inflammatory responses in this model. We then tested the cytokine neutralization performance of nanodecoys based on this model and found that the protein levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF significantly decreased after treatment with nanodecoys ( Fig. 4 C and D) , demonstrating effective intervention of activated inflammatory states by the nanodecoy treatment. While the current design involves IL-6 and GM-CSF, the cytokine neutralization capability of nanodecoys is also applicable to many other types of cytokines, because of the abundant cytokine receptors on the nanodecoy surface.",

A single dose of nanodecoys showed excellent retention in the lungs even after 72 h (Fig. 5A) , indicating the potential of downstream inhalation delivery of nanodecoys for cytokine neutralization in vivo.

To induce ALI, the mice were first intratracheally was collected for cytokine measurement. In the BALF, IL-6 and GM-CSF levels were significantly higher after the LPS challenge (Fig. 5 B and C) , demonstrating severe inflammatory status in the lung. Remarkably, the nanodecoys effectively decreased the IL-6, GM-CSF, and total protein levels in the BALF (Fig. 5 B  and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ), suggesting the encouraging effects of nanodecoys on broad-spectrum neutralization of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, all mice were killed for histological examination at 24 h post the LPS challenge. Alveolar wall incrassation, alveolar cavity disappearance, vascular dilation and congestion, and alveolar inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the lung of LPS-challenged mice (Fig. 5D) , confirming the severe lung injury in this ALI model.

At 4 h post the challenge, the mice received i.t. inhalation of 50 \u03bcL of HBSS or HBSS containing the indicated concentration of nanodecoys (i.e., 100, 200, and 400 \u03bcg). At 8 h after the nanodecoy injection, lung lavage was carried out by introducing 0.5 mL of HBSS into the lungs, and BALF was carefully withdrawn by inserting a needle into the upper trachea. The BALF was centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min to pellet the nanodecoys. The IL-6 and GM-CSF in the BALF supernatant were determined by IL-6 and GM-CSF ELISA Kit (eBioscience) according to manufacturer's guidelines. The total proteins in the BALF supernatant were measured by a Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). At 24 h post the LPS challenge, all mice were killed, and the lungs were routinely collected, fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin, processed into paraffin, and sectioned at 4 \u03bcm.
