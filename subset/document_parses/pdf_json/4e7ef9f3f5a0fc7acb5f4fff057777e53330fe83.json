In 6% of cases, patients are hospitalized [1] , and 20% of whom develop acute respiratory distress syndrome for which they are admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) [1] . Hospitalization in ICU is highly associated with health-care infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infections (BSI). In France, the first COVID-19 patients, all from Wuhan (China), were hospitalized at the end of January 2020 [2] . One of them, admitted to the medical ICU of our hospital, was surprisingly co-infected upon arrival with an unexpected antibiotic susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii. Two meta-analyses reported bacterial infection rates in COVID-19 ICU patients of 8.1% [3] and 14% [4] . But data on bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients are still sparse and not always consistent. Moreover, several studies highlight the over-prescription of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients and the risk of a global increase of antimicrobial resistance [5, 6] . It is thus essential to know the incidence and epidemiology of bacterial infections in such patients, in order to manage antibiotic prescriptions.",

More than half of these were considered as contaminants that may be due to changes in guidelines and safety equipment of nursing staff due to the COVID-19 crisis. Bacteria causing BSI were mainly Enterococci (35.5%), Staphylococci (32.2%) and Streptococci (12.9%) which is unusual in ICU patients. Indeed, the bacteria causing BSI in the same ICUs last year were rather Enterobacterales (33.3%), then Staphylococci (30.3%) and Enterococci (18%), (personal data). Interestingly, in 54.8% of episodes, no origin of the BSI could be determined and translocation of bacteria from digestive or oropharyngeal microbiota was suspected. One hypothesis is that the hyper-inflammatory status of COVID-19 patients may increase the permeability of the intestinal or oropharyngeal barriers and thus bacterial translocations. The description of the composition of the intestinal and oropharyngeal microbiota would be helpful to understand the origin of these unusual BSIs [11] .",

The distribution of bacteria causing VAP did not show any particularity, however, we observed a high rate of multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDRB). This could be explained by an increased use of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients (91%), associated with an increase of MDRB dissemination in the ICUs. Surprisingly, we observed that VAP bacteria clearance from the lungs was exceptionally slow despite adequate antibiotic therapy. The cause of antimicrobial failures remains speculative. The main reasons advocated by experts are (i) pharmacodynamic alterations due to frequent glomerular hyperfiltration, even though in our study we did not find any difference in renal function between the patients, (ii) pharmacodynamic alterations due to a high BMI, which seems to be the case in this study, (iii) a probable decrease in the antimicrobial lung is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
