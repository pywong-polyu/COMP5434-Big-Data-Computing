Induction and analysis of short message texts generated by students' online learning can fully understand students, make effective adjustments to the classroom, guide teachers' teaching practice, and optimize the classroom, thereby improving students' learning ability, practical ability, innovation ability, and collaboration. To study the effect of virtual simulation education on improving the skills of medical students, this paper is based on video training and education of virtual reality side-cut high-simulation simulator using case analysis and literature analysis methods. It collects data from databases and builds on online education. e model was developed, and a large number of relevant pieces of literature were read and analyzed through the literature survey method. e research results show that virtual simulation teaching can effectively improve students' technical thinking and ability. Students' technical thinking and ability are about 30% higher than traditional teaching methods, and the cooperation consciousness between students reaches 0.8 consciousness, which can solve the contradiction between popularization and improvement. And to solve the problems of polarization and transformation of underachievers, students' personalities can be fully displayed and developed, and education and teaching will be on the track of quality education. is shows that training videos based on virtual reality technology can play a very good role in improving students' technical mastery.",

Low-level doctors are not competent without proper training [1] . According to the statistics of the Red Cross Society of our country, the number of deaths caused by medical injury accidents in China is about 400,000 each year, which is four times the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents. In particular, such delicate, complex, and difficult surgical operations as neurosurgery are easy to directly or indirectly cause varying degrees of harm to the patient. At present, the surgical skills of most surgeons are gradually mastered in the operating room by continuously performing actual surgical operations on real patients [2] . is traditional apprenticeship model of \"pass, support, and bring-in\" takes about 5-7 years to train surgeons with strong surgical and qualified skills. Obviously, such a training cycle cannot meet the needs of modern medical surgeons. e virtual surgery simulation system developed on the virtual reality technology has opened up a whole new field for solving the surgical skills training of junior doctors. Different from the traditional training methods of doctors, the virtual surgery simulation system is a new type of virtual reality application system that specializes in \"distortion-free\" simulation of various phenomena that may occur during surgery [3] . is type of surgical simulation system, with the help of a computer, provides trained physicians with threedimensional anatomical and biomechanical properties that can be manipulated repeatedly without being restricted by time and space. We can provide various virtual \"test materials.\" is will greatly improve surgery. e efficiency of training and cost reduction provide new directions and ways to solve the problem of surgical training for medical students, interns, or junior doctors. With the continuous improvement of people's understanding of virtual surgery simulation systems, it has also been widely used in surgical navigation, surgical assistance, postoperative recovery training, and training videos [4] .",

            "text": "In recent years, researchers have developed targeted virtual systems that can be used to simulate different operations based on the characteristics of different types of surgery. For example, Stanford University developed the virtual surgery simulation system for small blood vessels (usually 1 mm) and nerve sutures under the microscope, the Boston Surgical Planning Laboratory in the United States developed a virtual simulation system for simulating inner ear endoscopy, and the Canadian National Research Council developed the successful brain surgery virtual surgery simulation system, the Karlsruhe Laboratory in Germany developed a virtual minimally invasive surgery simulation training system using commercial simulation software, and the Swiss Tuchschmid et al. successfully developed a virtual hysteroscopy system after six years [5, 6] . At the same time, in order to further enhance the immersion and realism of the system, some scholars have introduced technologies such as augmented reality, boundary element, and automatic waves into the virtual surgery simulation system. Domestic virtual surgery started relatively late, and Xiong Yueshan and others developed a knee arthroscopic surgery simulation training system. e key problems of virtual surgery simulation such as geometric modeling, deformation calculation, and collision detection were studied deeply, and an improved spring particle model was proposed. It solves the phenomenon of \"superelasticity\" when the spring bears a large external force and has a good deformation visual effect. At the same time, the simulation of bleeding is added to the model, which further enhances the fidelity of the system [7] . On the one hand, these studies have enriched our understanding of college sports, but on the other hand, the conclusions of the experiment are not completely reasonable. e research samples are small and the conclusions are not universal enough to be convincing. e innovation of this paper is that, in order to further enhance the immersion and interactivity of the virtual surgery simulation system, this paper designs a general virtual surgery simulation platform. e platform is designed according to the physiological structure of the human body, allowing users to be completely immersed in the virtual operation process, free from external light, sound, and other uncontrollable factors. A surface cutting method based on boundary splitting is proposed. e difficulty of realizing surface patch splitting based on edge splitting points is to record the cutting state and maintain the consistency of the vertex state in the physical model. e cutting trajectory can be well described by recording the position and sequence of the boundary split points. is is the basis for the later insertion of internal vertices and the generation of new surfaces, as well as the basis for the topological reconstruction of internal point sets.",

In this study, the combined use of a heated humidifier and a closed sputum suction method was compared with the traditional artificial nose combined with an open sputum suction method. e research was comprehensively considered from the patient's sputum viscosity, moisturizing effect, sputum, incidence of lung infection, artificial airway indwelling time, NSICU hospitalization time, and other indicators [19] . e closed suction method avoids the problem of lung collapse caused by the open suction system in patients with high-risk hypoxic saturation and reduces the risk of contamination. Adequate moisturization and effective sputum suction are beneficial to reduce sputum, pulmonary infection, and so on and provide a good moisturizing effect, thereby promoting patient recovery, shortening the length of hospitalization, and reducing hospitalization costs [20] .",

With the rapid development of large-scale medical imaging equipment and the improvement of three-dimensional object shape detection technology, the three-dimensional geometric modeling of human soft tissue has become an important subject in the field of modern graphics and imaging, which has attracted extensive attention and in-depth research [22] . e reconstruction technology of the 3D geometric model of human tissue is to study how to obtain 3D information of soft tissue shape and position in space through the two-dimensional medical image information of human soft tissue and finally obtain the spatial 3D model of soft tissue [23] . Contrary to the general model building process, the three-dimensional reconstruction of soft tissue is to map the existing real human soft tissue to the three-dimensional geometric model in the computer to construct the threedimensional virtual model of the computer, which is called reverse engineering or reverse technology. e equation is transformed into the following formula:",

Figure 7 , we can see that the satisfaction of traditional teaching is not high, which is much lower than that of simulation teaching. Simulation teaching is a kind of teaching. According to the development of main media and information technology, multimedia network teaching belongs to the third generation of distance teaching. Simulated online teaching is the product of the development of modern computer network technology and multimedia technology to a certain extent, and it is extremely attractive to students.",
