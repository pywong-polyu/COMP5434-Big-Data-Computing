When the process is placed in the mainstream area, the particle concentration can be smaller than the room average concentration by 30 % or a half, which is shown in Table 14 .1. This means when the particle concentration in the mainstream area is designed with the room average concentration, the air change rate will be reduced by 30-50 %. It has been improved with practice that the effect of these schemes was quite good. Figure 14 .1 shows the layout of the cleanroom by a foreign company, where HEPA filters were placed fully on two sides of the ceiling so that mainstream area with air cleanliness level Class 100 was achieved below. The clean air concentrated towards the room center. With the further effect of air supply outlet with a few HEPA filters placed in the center of the ceiling, the air cleanliness level in the middle space can reach Class 1000. For the application where the processes are mainly placed at two sides, this method is much economical compared with the method to achieve the air cleanliness level Class 100 by placing air filters fully on the ceiling. Note: N and N v are the room average particle concentrations calculated with the uniform and the nonuniform distribution theories, respectively. N a is the particle concentration in the mainstream area calculated with the nonuniform distribution theory",

The triangular region surrounded by two dotted lines is equivalent to the boundary layer. Because the external airflow is induced, the particle concentration will be higher than that of the supplied air in the mainstream area. The isoconcentration line with the concentration ratio between outside and inside N/N 0 \u00bc 1 % can be calculated, which starts from two ends of the air supply outlet and has an inclination angle 10.7 from the plumb line [2, 3] . The observed expansion angle by domestic study showed it is smaller than 10 [4] . The concentration variation in the mainstream area from place B to A can be expressed with the curve in the figure. This conclusion is valid in the region which is about four times of the air supply outlet size below the air supply outlet (except the region near the floor). Obviously, the clean area formed with this kind of air supply mode is relative narrow. When the air supply diffuser plate is 2.4 m above the floor, at the height of 0.8 m above the floor, each side of the airstream boundary border in the mainstream area will contract (2.4-0.8) \u00c2 tg 10.7 % 0.3 m.

Its specific concentration field can be expressed with the analytical expression, which has already been verified by experiment [2, 3] . When the number of centralized placed air supply outlets increases, the area of the mainstream area also increases, whenever the air supply volume increases or not. The particle concentration in the mainstream area at this time does not rise but appears a declining trend, which is the expect result of engineering applications. Simulation results show that the particle concentration in the mainstream area with two air supply outlets is the lowest when the air supply volume is less than 15 h \u00c01 , which has the best effect, while the particle concentration in the mainstream area with three or four air supply outlets is the lowest when the air supply volume is larger than 25 h \u00c01 .

In this case, people began to think the scheme with elevated surrounding air velocity to protect the central mainstream area, which is the combination of surrounding air curtain and the vertical unidirectional flow. It can be called the air curtain cleaning booth.",

The area of perforated plate is 2.4 m \u00c2 3.3 m. When the air change rate in the mainstream area is 130 h \u00c01 , the size of the clean area available can be 3.6 m \u00c2 4.5 m, which is shown in Fig. 14. 30 [18] . It is worthy noticed that the air velocities in both the air curtain and the center of the device are not large, and the decay of velocity field is also not fast. But particles are easily deposited on the perforated plate, which is difficult to clean, so the appearance is rather poor. These devices with air curtain belong to the centralized placed air supply mode, and they are not local purification equipments. Neither the design data nor the theoretical analysis is provided. Shen Jinming developed this combination form into local purification equipment, and theoretical study was performed [19] . The quantitative indicators for the isolation performance of air curtain were obtained. The idea for application in large space was proposed, which was shown in Fig. 14. 31. This can be used to overcome the shortcomings that cleanroom was divided into small rooms as mentioned in Section one of this chapter. Figure 14 .32 is one form of the device (for vacuum coating machine).",

Therefore, the isolation effect of air curtain is realized with the continuous induction of air at both sides, which is unlike the prevention of particle penetration by solid wall. Dirty air is continuously diluted and removed (because clean air is supplied from the nozzle of the air curtain), so that particles cannot penetrate the air curtain. Only a few particles may enter the central area because of the lateral fluctuation of airflow. Therefore, with the same amount of flow rate, the larger the nozzle width is, the less the induction flow rate is, and the less the penetrated particles are. It is more difficult for particles to penetrate when the lateral distance is larger. At this time, the isolation effect is much better (Fig. 14.34) . ",

For the former case, the total flow rate is much larger when the width of the air curtain is larger, so the energy consumption becomes larger and both the structure and the weight are correspondingly enlarged, which is not practical.

When the filtration velocity was 0.01 m/s, the penetration was 3.2 %. It was equivalent with the performance of sub-HEPA filter in China. Since this kind of filter medium was thick, it was not easily folded but could be pasted. So flexible pipe with diameter 400 mm was made with \u03a6\u041f-15-17 filter cloth. It was applied in the cleanroom in the late of 1960s. They were uniformly placed on the ceiling to form the transversely placed air supply surface. Air was supplied into the cleanroom through the flexible pipe and the perforated ceiling below made of organic glass (it was not cleaning booth, but in essence it was the same).

The important design principle for this new type of cleaning booth was that when circulation mode was used, only sub-HEPA tubular filter was needed according to theoretical analysis, while the previous prefilter can be omitted. 2. One side air supply mode is changed into bilateral air supply mode. Since the diameter of filter tube cannot be very large, the static pressure inside the tube cannot be stable and the filtration velocity along the whole filter tube cannot be very uniform. It also means that it is impossible to improve the uniformity of the air velocity inside the filter tube. Another way is that although there is nonuniformity in the tube, the whole flow field becomes uniform with the overlap of the uniform flow from single filter tube, when half of the filter tube supply air from one side and the other half of the filter tube supply air from the other side. 3. The circular filter tube becomes the wedge filter tube. It is known that for a certain area, the edge length of circle is the minimum, and the effective filtration area is only the low half of the circumference. For the given cross-sectional area, when the filtration area should be increased, and both the internal space of filter tube and the resistance of the airflow after filtration are required to be reduced, the best way is to change the circular filter tube into wedge filter tube, which is . Partition support is used to fix the filter tube. In order to avoid the collision between filter tubes, the partition supports are used to separate and fix each filter tube. They can be placed one by one, which increases the filtration area and avoids the high air velocity between tubes. The other important purpose is to change circular tubes into wedge tubes. 5. When multiple rows of filter tubes are combined to one row, the partition support can provide a good solution to this problem. 6. The ceiling height where air filters are installed can be further reduced. When two rows are combined to one row, the height only reduces to 250 mm, which is only half of the height of the device abroad.",

Not only the application requirements are met but also the device structure is simplified and the cost is reduced. 2. Because self-circulation is very important for the device, the leakage rate should be reduced as much as possible. The leakage rate is almost proportional to the particle concentration N v . This also applies for the situation when \u03b7 n \u00bc 0.99. So if fresh air is supplied into this device, sub-HEPA filter must be placed along the passage of fresh air. If fresh air is supplied into the buffer chamber to maintain the positive pressure, \u03b5 \u00bc 0, and the air cleanliness level in the cleaning booth will be greatly improved. It is better to use this device together with the fresh air handling unit containing sub-HEPA filter. 3. The larger the buffer chamber is, the smaller the particle generation rate G 2 per unit volume is. When equilibrium state is reached, it will contribute to the air cleanliness. From Fig. 14 .30, when a \u00bc 0.5, namely, the area of the buffer chamber is larger than that of the cleaning booth by one time, the particle concentration inside the cleaning booth reduces by half, and the volume of the buffer chamber is inversely proportional to the particle concentration in the cleaning booth. When more outdoor fresh air infiltrates into the buffer room, G 2 becomes larger and the particle concentration inside the cleaning booth increases faster. 4. If the airflow in the cleaning booth can be approximated as unidirectional flow, when the particle generation rate G per unit volume of air increases by 22 times, the increase of particle concentration is still less. In the condition \u03b7 n \u00bc 0.999, it increases only by 1/10 to 1/3. When \u03b7 n \u00bc 0.99, it increases by 1-3 times. When the airflow is much closer to the unidirectional flow, the performance is much better. Table 14 .11 shows the experimental data after the system operated for half an hour in the cleaning booth where are two testing people inside. The cleaning booth was placed inside the ordinary room. From the measurement result, when sub-HEPA filter tube was used, the particle concentration was sensitive to the inlet particle concentration. Even so, when the cleaning booth operates with self-circulation mode in the buffer chamber with concentration 50,000 #/L, the air cleanliness level inside the buffer chamber can reach Class 10000 and that inside the cleaning booth can reach Class 1000000. If the initial concentration corresponds with Class 100000, the air cleanliness inside the buffer chamber can also reach Class several thousands.",

In the process area, comprehensive unidirectional flow is supplied from laminar flow hood. In the operation channel area, turbulent air is supplied. Partition board is usually used to separate the process area from the operation channel area (Fig. 14.42 ). Since the production line with air cleanliness level Class 100, especially Class 10 or higher, is extremely sensitive to the disturbance of pollution. The clean area in the process area with this kind of conventional cleaning tunnel reduces, so it is difficult to reach the prescribed air cleanliness level. This is because when turbulent flow is supplied in the operation channel, vortex circulation is easily formed by the airflow between the ceiling and the partition board in front of the hood. Pollution, especially the pollutants generated at the head of the operational personnel, will retain for a long term. Airflow will be easily induced below the partition board and vortex will be produced, which increases the risk of the pollutant invasion from the operation channel into the cleaning area. During operation, hands will be swing back and forth, which will cause disturbance and reduce the air cleanliness inside the hood. Therefore, the following three requirements are proposed for the antidisturbance ability of the laminar flow hood applied in the cleaning tunnel.",

In terms of the total effect, the performance of the hood with inclination angle 30 is better than that with partition board only and without hood. The hood with inclination angle 60 is better than that with inclination angle 30 . The hood with inclination angle 45 and regulating board is better than that with inclination angle 60 . Curves a, b, and c in Fig. 14.45 show the theoretical boundaries under the above three situations with air cleanliness Class 100. It is shown that the range of Curve c is the largest. Fig. 14 .46 shows the boundary of clean area (better than air cleanliness level Class 100000) obtained by experiment with the same total flow rate. 2. In terms of anti-disturbance from the lateral (horizontal) velocity, when lateral air pollution (simulated with hair dryer) exists at the working height where is 730 mm from the operation surface, the hood with inclination angle 30 and 60 can completely resistant the intrusion of disturbance, and their performances are not different from each other. When no hood is placed, the polluted air will invade to a certain range. 3. From the pollution near the front partition board, particles can be removed quickly when the hood is placed in front. When there is no hood, vortex area will be formed near the partition board and induction could be found inside the hood.",
