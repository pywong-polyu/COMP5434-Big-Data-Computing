The present research investigated the impact of the individual differences in propensity to experience shame (or shame-proneness) on two emotion regulation strategies-perspective taking and positive reappraisal. A total of 228 participants, undergraduate students, were allocated randomly to one of the eight experimental conditions. The results revealed that for high shame-prone participants, the use of perspective taking, without positive reappraisal, led to a heightened experience of shame. In contrast, the combination of perspective taking and positive reappraisal led to reductions in shame among high shame-prone participants. The findings highlight the relationship between individual differences, and the separate and combined effects of affect regulation strategies on the experience of shame.",

Such findings have illuminated the need for a richer understanding of the emotional phenomenology of mental health conditions and investigations of the role of specific emotions. One emotion that has been the subject of extensive research is shame. Shame is commonly defined as an intense negative emotion characterized by the perception of a global devaluation of the self (Tangney and Dearing 2003) . Shame has been conceptualized as being fundamentally different from other emotions, such as guilt, as it results from attributing information about a specific situation to characterological defects (e.g. a person feeling ashamed may think, 'I am bad') rather than to situational factors (e.g. a person feeling guilty may think, 'I did something bad') (Lewis 1987, p. 42) .",

With evidence on the role of shame in psychopathology accumulating, new research is focusing on ways individuals may more effectively regulate shame. Studies on the emotion regulation of shame have focused on those who are 'shame-prone'-individuals who experience shame on a frequent basis (Whittle et al. 2016; Stuewig et al. 2015; Tangney and Dearing 2003) . 'Shame-proneness' has been conceptualized as a dispositional trait (as opposed to an experience or state) and shame has been shown to be a pervasive aspect of the identities of shame-prone individuals (Tangney and Dearing 2003) . Theories on the links between shame and psychopathology have focused on the ways in which the emotion regulation strategies of perspective taking and positive reappraisal have mitigated the effects of shame (Webb et al. 2012) .",

Recalling and thinking about experiences of anger and sadness from a third-person perspective has been found to lead to a attenuation of negative emotions, compared to taking a firstperson perspective, which often leads to more ruminative styles of thinking (Kross and Ayduk 2008; Kross, Ayduk & Mischel, 2005) . For example, in a series of experimental studies, Libby et al. (2005) manipulated the memory perspective (first-person vs. thirdperson) that individuals used to visually recall autobiographical events and examined its effects on assessments of personal change in psychotherapy. The results revealed that participants told to recall their first appointment from the third-person perspective thought they had changed more than those told to recall the event from the first-person perceptive. Thus, the authors concluded that recalling significant autobiographical events from different visual perspectives led to different judgements over time. In their meta-analysis, Webb et al. (2012) identified perspective taking as one of the most effective techniques for facilitating emotion regulation.",

Positive reappraisal has been found to be effective for regulating affect and physiological arousal without the costs, such as increased negative affect, associated with other strategies such as rumination (Gross, 1998) . Positive reappraisal also has longer-lasting effects than attention-focused strategies (e.g. distraction) (Ochsner et al. 2012; Silvers et al. 2015) and is a core component of several therapeutic modalities, including cognitive behavioural therapy (Beck 2005) .

In particular, this cognitive style has been linked to shame-proneness and has been found to be independently associated with depression, beyond the effects of a depressogenic attributional style (Tangney et al. 1992 ). Although no studies identified to date have assessed the impact of shame-proneness on positive reappraisal, several studies have found that experimentally induced positive reappraisal leads to a reduction in reports of negative emotions in both clinical and nonclinical samples (e.g. Ehring et al. 2010; Rood et al. 2012) . However, some studies have found that individuals scoring high on indicators of neuroticism (Jylh\u00e4 & Isomets\u00e4, 2006 )-characterized by proneness to anxiety, emotional instability and self-consciousness-have difficulty reappraising negative emotions.",

            "text": "Similarly, individuals identified as having a self-critical cognitive style-similar to those who are highly shame-prone-are seen as being less responsive to cognitive interventions (e.g. Castilho et al. 2017) . Such research highlights that those who are shame prone have difficulty with using and benefiting from positive reappraisal. The findings also raise concerns about whether the efficacy of such cognitive intervention can be enhanced by the combined use of shame mitigation strategies. Interventions aimed at promoting the benefits of perspective taking while preventing self-critical cognition-particularly among shame-prone individuals-have led to the development of therapeutic techniques such as self-compassion (Neff 2003; Gilbert, 2010) . While several studies on such practices have reported beneficial effects for shame-prone individuals (e.g. Woods and Proeve 2014; Mosewich et al. 2011) , few experimental studies to date have investigated the unique contributions of positive reappraisal and perspective taking to attenuation of shame in such interventions. Katzir and Eyal (2013) evaluated the efficacy of perspective taking and positive reappraisal on the experience of shame and other emotions (e.g. guilt, anger and sadness). Two hundred forty-eight university students completed the experiment individually, guided by pre-recorded audio instructions adapted from Kross et al. (2005) . It was predicted that due to the experience of shame involving self-evaluation as well as the evaluation of the self from the perspective of others, a third-person perspective may exacerbate these emotions and fail to attenuate the experience of shame. The results revealed that while a third-person perspective attenuated feelings of sadness and anger, such benefits were not replicated for feelings of shame. In particular, Katzir and Eyal (2013) found that participants who adopted the perspective of a third-person, neutral observer when thinking about a shameful event failed to experience any attenuation in their experience of shame. They argued that perspective taking not accompanied by positive reappraisal leads to an increase in self-critical evaluations and rumination on others' negative evaluations of them (Katzir and Eyal 2013) . Katzir and Eyal's (2013) study is significant as it illustrates the differential efficacy of perspective taking on the regulation of self-conscious emotions like shame, compared to other emotions like fear. The study also highlights the need for a further understanding of the individual differences that influence the combined and separate effects of these emotion regulation strategies on shame.",

The TOSCA is a scenario-based measure in which 15 common situations are posed to respondents, followed by descriptions of shame, guilt and other emotional (e.g. alpha and beta pride) and defensive (e.g. externalization and detachment) responses to the situation, without use of emotion labels. The TOSCA has demonstrated good internal consistency for shame-proneness and guilt-proneness (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .76 and .66, respectively; Tangney, 1990 Tangney, , 1991 Tangney et al., 1996) . In our sample, internal consistency for TOSCA was satisfactory with Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.74.

This difference between the two perspectives was due to differences in the trajectory of shame between the free recall and instructed recall phases. Specifically, from the first-person perspective, shame ratings remained unchanged. For the thirdperson perspective condition, however, shame ratings increased between the free recall and instructed recall phases. Finally, support was found, for hypothesis 5, with high shame-prone participants reporting higher levels of shame than the low shame groups during both the free recall and instructed recall phases. The result reveal that ratings of shame remained the same between the free recall and instructed recall phases for the first-person perspective groups in both the positive and no positive reappraisal conditions (see Fig. 4 ). The results of this analysis are thus consistent with the view that perspective is important for high shame-prone individuals. When recalling a shameful event from a first-person perspective, positive reappraisal makes no difference, as levels of shame remain unchanged from those experienced during the initial recall of the event. In other words, a first-person perspective is neither beneficial nor detrimental.",

The third-person perspective provides individuals with increased perspective (or social distance) and the capacity to review difficulties by considering additional features of the situation, leading to appraisals that attenuate negative affect (McIsaac and Eich 2002; Robinson and Swanson 1993) . Given these findings, it was expected that among low-shame groups, a first-person perspective would compromise the benefits of cognitive construal while compounding the adverse effects of not using positive appraisals. Similarly, it was expected that a third-person perspective would help alleviate the negative influence of not using positive reappraisal and further attenuate shame when used in conjunction with positive reappraisal.",

Because low shame-prone individuals do not possess as many cognitive vulnerabilities or the negative attributional style of high shame-prone individuals (Tangney, 1995) , the use of positive reappraisal potentially represents a more powerful emotion regulation strategy than changing one's memory perspective. With low-shame individuals reporting lower levels of shame than high-shame participants, it is possible that the use of positive reappraisal on its own is effective in attenuating relatively lower levels of shame.",

However, no research has examined the effects of perspective taking on thoughts and memories specifically related to shameful experiences. Shame differs from other negative emotions in that it involves a greater focus on the self as bad or inadequate (Tangney, 1995) , and it may be this aspect of shame that is influenced by perspective in ways that other negative emotions are not. Further research examining the effects of first-versus third-person perspective taking, in the absence of positive reappraisal, on thoughts about multiple negative emotions (e.g. anger, sadness, shame) may shed light on this. Interestingly, the use of positive reappraisal and the third-person perspective by low shame-prone individuals was also found to be beneficial, with lower ratings of shame reported during the instructed recall phase than during the free recall phase. Similarly, low-shame individuals benefited from maintaining a moderate level of positive emotion between these two phases when using positive reappraisal from the third-person perspective. Thus, positive reappraisal of shame experiences from a thirdperson perspective led to decreased feelings of shame for both low-and high-shame individuals, revealing it to be an effective affect regulation strategy for reducing feelings of shame, irrespective of individual differences in the propensity to experience shame.",

            "text": "Turning now to the high shame-prone participants, no reliable differences were found between the first-and third-person perspective in levels of shame reported by those in the positive reappraisal condition. In other words, in the presence of encouragement to cognitively reframe the shame experienced, differences in perspective appear not to matter. However, in the absence of suggestions of positive reappraisal, levels of shame remained unchanged (relative to the free recall phase) in high-shame participants adopting a first-person perspective and increased substantially when the third-person perspective was used, leading to a marked difference in the intensity of shame between the two perspectives. How can this pattern of results be accounted for? The distinction between internal and external shame (Gilbert, 1998) is of particular relevance here. Internal shame reflects criticism and negative evaluation directed toward the self. In contrast, external shame is attributable to heightened attention to the interpersonal world, together with increased sensitivity to others' evaluations of the self and knowledge that others view the self negatively. In other words, external shame 'involves negative views of self as seen through the eye of others' (Kim et al. 2011, p. 87) . It is possible that when thinking of a shame-eliciting event from one's own point of view (first-person perspective), feelings of internal shame may be triggered, while thinking about the event from the perspective of another person may trigger feelings of external shame (Kim et al. 2011) . Although episodes of shame likely involve mutually reinforcing external and internal elements, external shame has been identified as a more potent source of distress, showing greater associations with depression symptoms than internal shame (Gilbert, 1998; Kim et al. 2011) . The present results are clearly consistent with this conceptualization.",

Over time, based on a person's experiences of relational interactions, the individual develops expectations about the behaviour of others (Baldwin & Sinclair, 1996; Baldwin, 1992) .

Furthermore, although differences in shame between positive reappraisal from the first-versus third-person perspective failed to reach conventional levels of statistical significance, levels of shame in the third-person perspective condition (M = 2.89) were lower than those in the first-person perspective condition (M = 3.80, t = 1.50, p = 0.14).

Moreover, this difference cannot only be attributed to appraisal differences, since a similar pattern was not apparent across the two appraisal conditions from a first-person perspective.
