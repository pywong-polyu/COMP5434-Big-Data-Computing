The assay utilizes isothermal amplification and can reportedly deliver results in approximately 5 to 13 min. As this assay could provide significant improvements to workflow in our hospital system, we sought to compare the performance of this test with our current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) assay, the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) (ACOV) assay performed on the Abbott m2000 system (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "We compared the results from 524 paired foam nasal swabs (NS) tested on IDNCOV with nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) placed in viral transport media tested on ACOV collected consecutively from symptomatic patients meeting current criteria for a diagnosis of COVID-19 (1). Five locations were included in the evaluation including three emergency departments (ED) and two immediate care centers (IMCC). IMCC A and ED 2 were experienced users of the IDNow platform. The other sites were new users of the platform and received training specifically for the IDNCOV. All ACOV testing was performed by one central clinical laboratory, and all NPS were heat inactivated for 30 min at 60\u00b0C prior to testing. NS were tested directly on the IDNCOV from IMCCs, and the tests were performed on-site. NS from the EDs were transported to the clinical microbiology laboratory in sterile transport containers (urine cups or conical tubes) and tested by laboratory personnel at each separate location.

Agreement at individual sites varied (Table 1) . Two subjects tested positive on IDNCOV that were initially negative on ACOV. In case one, a repeat sample was positive on ACOV (repeat IDNCOV was not performed), and the case was resolved as a true positive result.
