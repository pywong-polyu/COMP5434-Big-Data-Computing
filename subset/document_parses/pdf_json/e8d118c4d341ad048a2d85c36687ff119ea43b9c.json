In particular, given the recognised benefits of multidisciplinary research, it may be important to map schools or communities of diverse research topics, and to understand the multidisciplinary role that topics play within and between these communities. This work proposes Field of Study (FoS) networks as a novel network representation for use in scientometric analysis. We describe the formation of FoS networks, which relate research topics according to the authors who publish in them, from corpora of articles in which fields of study can be identified. FoS networks are particularly useful for the distant reading of large datasets of research papers when analysed through the lens of exploring multidisciplinary science. In an evolving scientific landscape, modular communities in FoS networks offer an alternative categorisation strategy for research topics and sub-disciplines, when compared to traditional prescribed discipline classification schemes. Furthermore, structural role analysis of FoS networks can highlight important characteristics of topics in such communities. To support this, we present two case studies which explore multidisciplinary research in corpora of varying size and scope; namely, 6,323 articles relating to network science research and 4,184,011 articles relating to research on the COVID-19-pandemic.",

A common approach for understanding these research processes is through the lens of network analysis. For instance, given a corpus of research papers and their associated metadata, we can construct a variety of network representations to reveal different aspects of the underlying data, such as co-authorship networks [4, 5] , citation networks [6] , and co-citation networks [7] . These different representations can help us to identify collaboration patterns between individual researchers at a micro level. In other cases we might be more interested in examining collaboration patterns between researchers coming from different disciplines at the macro level. For example, we might wish to study how these patterns evolve over time in response to a changing research funding landscape or impactful exogenous events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Distant reading has been used in other contexts, such as digital humanities, as a means of exploring large volumes of data from a macro level view, in order to identify specific areas of interest for closer examination [8] . As the core contribution of this work, we present a novel graph representation, referred to as the Field of Study (FoS) network, which facilitates the investigation of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in corpora of scientific research articles at the macro level. A key aspect of field of study networks is the use of author-topic relations. Specifically, a FoS network is populated by fields of study (or research topics), which are related to one another according to the authors who publish in them. In Section 3 we describe how these networks can be constructed from the topics/fields of study that have been assigned to research papers. Later in Section 4 we describe two cases studies, which analyse the FoS networks arising from datasets of differing scope and size. The first case study in Section 4.1 relates to multidisciplinary research in the area of applied network science, while the second study in Section 4.2 pertains to the changing nature of author multidisciplinarity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These case studies demonstrate that FoS networks can provide a useful tool for the distant reading of large collections of research articles. In particular, we show how simple characteristics computed on a FoS network can highlight important topics in the research corpus. Further, we use community detection methods to identify specific multidisciplinary schools within a larger body of research, and we conduct a 'role analysis' of the topics within these communities to understand the role that they play in multidisciplinary collaborations. Crucially, we demonstrate our methods using datasets or varying size and scope, and, finally, we discuss some techniques that may be employed to drill-down on interesting interactions in the graph for further \"close-reading\".",

Most formal definitions distinguish interdisciplinary research as an extension of multidisciplinary research, which involves the integration of methods from the contributing disciplines [9] . There are numerous analyses which have explored multi-or interdisciplinary research, and investigated the relationship between different scientific disciplines. Many of these studies proposed metrics to quantify research interdisciplinarity, either at the author or at the paper level [10, 11] , often in order to investigate a correlation between interdisciplinarity and research impact [1, 2] , productivity or visibility [12] . Typically, works which integrate methods and ideas from a diverse set of disciplines are found to have greater research impact and visibility compared to those that do not [2, 12] . Notably, there are several examples of works which have investigated cross-disciplinary collaboration, often drawing on representations and methods from network science [4, 6, 13, 14, 15] .",

Sub-disciplines of Mathematics and Computer Science, such as 'Theoretical Computer Science' and 'Topology', have high degree centrality (ranked 1st and 4th respectively), because they are identified across the majority of network science research papers. Modern network science methods, such as 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning' and applications, such as 'Information Retrieval', have similarly high degree centrality (ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 6th respectively). Some fields beyond the disciplines of Computer Science and Mathematics, such as 'Applied Psychology', 'Econometrics', and 'Neuroscience' have high betweenness centrality in the FoS Network (ranked 3rd, 5th and 8th, respectively). This is likely because they represent interdisciplinary applications of network science published by authors who have backgrounds in other, more distant topics.

In addition to categorising ANS-related topics according to (i) a traditional disciplinary hierarchy (Figure 3b) , and (ii) author-related communities (Figure 4) , it is also possible to group fields according to the \"role\" they play within the Field of Study network. Using the popular struc2vec algorithm [22] , we learn dense vector representations for the fields in the FoS network, which preserve structural equivalence between nodes. That is, nodes having similar structural features in the graph will have similar representations (commonly known as their role embedding) [23] . We then cluster the embedding space to identify a discrete set of disciplinary roles. Figure 5 illustrates the role assignments learned in the ANS graph according to a k-means clustering (k = 9) of struc2vec role embeddings, where k = 9 represents the elbow of the curve when silhouette scores are plotted for clusterings of increasing values of k. Table 2 shows the mean network centrality scores computed for the different clusters such that we can explain the roles that they represent. Fields in cluster #1 exhibit \"hub-like\" behaviour, as they score highly for all centrality measures. For each of the largest Louvain communities (i.e. excluding communities (v) and (vii)), the most central node was assigned to role #1. We will refer to these as the \"core\" nodes since they represent the fields most commonly identified in ANS research and are the most central in the FoS graph. Clusters #6, #7, #8 and #9 all represent peripheral/leaf nodes with degree 1 and very low centrality scores. None of the topics in the peripheral clusters can be identified in ANS published research. Instead, these topics appear in the 2016-2018 portion of the data and we refer to them as \"distant background\" topics.",

These topics occur in COVID-19-related research that is published by authors with research backgrounds that are more peripheral in the graph. We hypothesise that topics attributed to this bridging role occur in multidisciplinary applications of one or more fields to a external problem. A similar bridging role may be described by role #9, which has high betweenness centrality (ranked 4th), but relatively low eigenvector centrality (ranked 9th). With lower eigenvector centrality, it is unlikely that nodes in role #9 are adjacent to highly central topics in the graph and, as such, likely represent more peripheral \"bridging\" disciplines.

Modular communities in FoS networks offer an alternative categorisation strategy for research topics and sub-disciplines, when compared to traditional prescribed discipline classification schemes. Such communities represent the broader, multidisciplinary trends in a body of research, together the different backgrounds and expertise with which authors contribute to them. Furthermore, role analysis, using methods such as struc2vec role embeddings, can be employed to parse the respective roles of topics within and between these communities. In particular, we have highlighted core and background roles, which serves to distinguish the central topics in a field from the background expertise of the authors. In addition, less central topics with high betweenness centrality may highlight multidisciplinary applications in the body of research.
