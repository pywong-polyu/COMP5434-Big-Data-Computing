These countries are among those most affected by the first wave, i.e. where daily-death data series may closely resemble a solution of the basic SIR equations. The SIR equations are solved parametrically using the proper time as parameter. Some general properties of the SIR solutions are studied such as time-scaling and asymmetry. Additionally, we use approximations to the SIR solutions through Gumbel functions, which present a very similar behavior. The parameters of the SIR model and the Gumbel function are extracted from the data and compared for the different countries. It is found that ten of the selected countries are very well described by the solutions of the SIR model, with a basic reproduction number between 3 and 8.",

From very simple models [18, 19] to numerous variants of compartmental models based on the SIR model (susceptible, infected, removed) have been proposed [20] [21] [22] [23] . Additional models have been employed such as the SEIR model [24] , which adds the exposed compartment of individuals, the uncertain SIR model [25] , and others that include different parameters that statistically describe the many factors that may influence the pandemic dynamics. More sophisticated approaches include deterministic or stochastic spacetime models [26] [27] [28] [29] . Nonetheless, it has been argued Email address: amaro@ugr.es (J.E.

Indeed, in this section we will define a parameter that uniquely characterizes the asymmetry and we will see that said asymmetry increases linearly with the basic reproduction number \u03c1 We begin by mentioning an important property of the i(t) solution concerning the scaling property with respect to time. It is clearly seen in equation (25) that the physical time as a function of proper time, t(\u03c4), is inversely proportional to \u03b2 . Therefore any change in \u03b2 translates into a change in the time scale. The natural scale of time is thus \u03b2 t, that is, measuring time in units of 1/\u03b2 . Thus, from the solutions of the SIR equations for \u03b2 = 1, all the others are obtained simply by re-scaling the time with a factor 1/\u03b2 . Therefore in Fig. 7 , where we represent the solutions of the SIR equations for a range of \u03c1 values from 1.5 to 500, and for \u03b2 = 1, all the solutions are included if they are represented as a function of \u03b2 t. Note that here we use the initial condition s 0 = 0.99. But this does not detract from the generality of our affirmations, because a change in the initial condition ultimately translates into a shift of the time origin such that i(0) = 0.01. Figure 7 shows that as \u03c1 increases, the epidemic progresses faster, that is, it ends earlier. As a function of natural time (or for \u03b2 = 1 day \u22121 ), it lasts from about 20 days for \u03c1 = 1.5, to less than a week for \u03c1 > 10, and only a few days if \u03c1 > 20. Moreover for very large values of \u03c1 > 10, the epidemic grows very quickly in a short time interval and then decreases exponentiallylike regardless of the value of \u03c1, with i(t) \u2243 e \u2212\u03b2 t . In Fig. 7 (top panel) it is also evident that the asymmetry of i(t) increases with \u03c1. The recovered function, or proper time, \u03c4(t) = r(t), is displayed in the bottom panel of Fig. 7 . For small values of \u03c1, it quite resembles a Gumbel function, but for very large values of the basic reproduction number, \u03c1 > 10, it departs from the family of Gumbel functions and approaches the function r(t) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b2 t), as the limit for \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e.",

This happens because the least-squares fit of the Gumbel function does not exactly approach the maximum value of \u03c4(t). To remedy this, starting \u03c1 = 6, we set the value of the a parameter of G(t) so that G(t) = \u03c4(t) for large t, and then fit the two parameters b and t 0 .

The only tabulated parameter in the second column of Table 2 is the value of the b parameter in days. Note that the value of a in the Gumbel function is simply a normalization constant, and the value of t 0 is a shift in time. Thus what really characterizes the dynamics is the value of the b, which is related to the duration of the epidemic. Note that the USA data have been fitted until day 150, when the second wave starts to appear. In the case of Brazil and India the fit is performed until day 250. Note that Spain, France and Belgium and Switzerland have similar b-values in the range b \u223c 12-13 days. Cumulative deaths, D(t), are fairly smooth distributions and very similar among different countries because we are dealing with sums -or integrals on the continuous limit. More detailed information is obtained by describing the daily death data \u2206D(t), shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Although these data show more fluctuations, they can be fitted well with the Gumbel g(t) distribution, although the fit parameters differ somewhat from those obtained by fitting the Gumbel function G(t), since different functions and data are being involved. the fitted parameter b is in the third column of Table 2 . Again we only tabulate the parameter b, because a and t 0 give simply the relative height and the position of the peaks. in the case of the USA, Brazil and India, we fit two Gumbel distributions, since it is apparent that there are at least two overlapping waves. In these cases, in Table 2 we tabulate the two values b 1 and b 2 of the two adjusted waves.",

We know from the last section that there is a linear relationship between the asymmetry of data and the basic reproduction number, \u03c1.

If we exclude the 'outsider' countries, Belgium and Switzerland (which have small values of \u03c1 = 3 or 4) and Sweden and USA (with large values of \u03c1 = 7, 8), we are left with six countries with similar parameters, in the central zone, around \u03c1 = 6 and 1/\u03b2 = 20 d -Spain, France, Italy, UK, Canada and Germany. In these countries a relationship between \u03b2 and \u03c1 is not found. On the other hand, the fact that \u03b2 is similar in these six countries indicates that the probability of recovery is similar in all of them. The recovery probability \u03b2 for an individual should in principle be independent of location.

An important consequence of the SIR equations for these high values of \u03c1 is that the total number of people infected during the epidemic reaches almost 100%. Indeed, this is mathematically given by the value of the proper time \u03c4 at the end of the epidemic, which is the solution of Eq. (16) . Numerically it is easy to verify that this end value is practically one, for \u03c1 > 5. This can also be seen in the lower panel of Fig. 7 , where the value of \u03c4(t) = r(t) for large t is practically one. As a consequence, our results indicate that the data from these countries where \u03c1 > 5 are compatible with an epidemic where practically all initially susceptible individuals were infected, according to the SIR model.",

According to the meta-data study of Ref. [33] , the NPI had practically no effect on mortality. This seems to be corroborated in our study for three reasons: (i) that the data are compatible with SIR solutions with high value (R 0 = \u03c1 \u2243 6) of the basic reproduction number, which implies that all the susceptible individuals were infected; (ii) that the SIR parameters do not depend on time, but if there were some NPI effects the parameters should be time dependent and the epidemiological curves should differ from the SIR solutions; (iii) there does not seem to be a relationship between the intensity of the lock-down measures and the basic reproduction number. For example, Spain, which had very harsh restrictions, is fitted with the same reproduction number as Sweden, which practically did not have, and is greater than Italy, where the measures were introduced a week earlier.",
