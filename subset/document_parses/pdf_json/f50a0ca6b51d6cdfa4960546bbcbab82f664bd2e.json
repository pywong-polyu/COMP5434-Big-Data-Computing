            "text": "Knowledge of the antibody-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to understand virus immunogenicity, establish seroprevalence, and determine whether subjects or recovered patients are at risk for infection/reinfection and would therefore benefit from vaccination. Here, we describe a novel and simple cell-ELISA specifically designed to measure viral spike S1-specific IgG produced in vitro by B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from a cohort of 45 asymptomatic (n = 24) and symptomatic (n = 21) individuals, with age ranging from 8 to 99 years. All subjects underwent ELISA serological screening twice, at the same time as the cell-ELISA (T2) as well as 35-60 days earlier (T1). Cryopreserved PBMCs of healthy donors obtained years before the COVID-19 pandemic were also included in the analysis. The preliminary results presented here show that out of 45 tested subjects, 16 individuals (35.5%) were positive to the cell-ELISA, 11 (24.5%) were concomitantly positive in the serological screening (T1 and/or T2), and only one person was exclusively positive in ELISA (T1) and negative in cell-ELISA, though values were close to the cutoff. Of note, five individuals (11.2%) tested negative in ELISA but positive in cell-ELISA and thus, they appear to have circulating B cells that produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, likely at levels that are undetectable in the serum, which challenges the negative results of the serological screening. The relative level of in vitro secreted IgG was measurable in positive subjects, ranging from 7 to 50 ng/well. Accordingly, all anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects previously reported moderate to severe symptoms attributable to COVID-19, even though the RT-PCR data were rarely available to confirm viral infection. Overall, the described cell-ELISA might be an effective method for detecting subjects who encountered the virus in the past, and thus helpful to improve serological ELISA tests in the case of undetectable/equivocal circulating IgG levels, and a suitable and improved tool to better evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Memory B cells and/or circulating plasma cells can be identified by their capability to secrete antigen-specific antibodies long after first encountering an antigen [1] ; thus, they can provide important information related to past exposure. This feature has been employed to setup in vitro assays to detect and count antibody-secreting B cells through ELISPOT platforms [2] . With this method, antibody-producing cells secrete antibodies that bind to an antigen-coated plastic surface. The antigen-antibody complex is subsequently detected by a secondary antibody or substances covalently linked to enzyme/fluorochromes, and it is visualized as spots and can be counted using colorimetric or fluorescent methods [3] . ELISPOT has been successfully applied in vitro to measure the number of antibody-producing B cells, employing immobilized antigens from various pathogens including viral antigens [4, 5] . Direct measurement of memory B-cells in peripheral blood can establish the magnitude and longevity of protection against infections and may be used in different fields of biomedical research, including epidemiology and vaccine development. We previously modified ELISPOT into a cell-based ELISA (cell-ELISA) that does not require the spot counting step, since the leukocytes are removed after incubation with the immobilized antigen, and the antigen-bound specific IgGs secreted in vitro by plasma cells are assayed by immunoenzymatic analysis [6] . Of note, quantification of B-cell secreted antibodies, if applicable in the clinical context, might be important for recognizing subjects who have encountered pathogens and identifying the occurrence of a disease. The latter is especially crucial during a pandemic, as in the case of the ongoing outbreak caused by the novel betacoronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), first isolated in China in December 2019 and responsible for a highly transmissible disease named COVID-19. It is generally more severe in older age and is characterized by a range of mild respiratory symptoms that may advance to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction [7] . Following host cell infection, SARS-CoV-2 triggers both innate and specific immune responses, but the precise immune pathways involved in activating the antivirus host defense mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To verify whether infection is ongoing, viral presence is diagnosed by analyzing the expression of viral genes via real-time PCR in biological material collected through nasopharyngeal swabs. The immune response can instead be measured by screening for the presence of specific antibodies in the blood using ELISA serological analyses [8] . The coronavirus envelope spike S1 protein is responsible for receptor binding and fusion to host cells, and it is involved in tropism and transmission capability [9] . The S1 protein has been shown to be a serological marker for COVID-19 [10] . Consequently, serological analyses via ELISA evaluate the presence of specific IgM/IgG by employing the recombinant spike protein S1 as adsorbed antigen. Antibody titers can be measured in intermediate and later stages of the infection (from day 7-10 onward) and are indicative of an antibody response [11] . The importance and robustness of ELISA systems in monitoring serum antibody response to the COVID-19 virus are confirmed by the number of diagnostic kit brands that are present on the market. However, a major limitation of ELISA-based platforms is circulating antibodies may become less and less detectable over time following vaccination or infection. On the other hand, circulating antigen-specific memory B cells can be present and persist long after immunization [4] . Upon reactivation, memory B cells are able to mount an antibody response decades after first encountering an antigen; hence, providing critical information regarding previous pathogen exposure. This feature is exploited by monitoring the humoral response of B cells, i.e., their capability to secrete in vitro specific IgG antibodies when restimulated with immunization antigen(s) [3] .",

The subjects of the study were consecutively enrolled in the study from the end of April to June 2020. The enrolled volunteers, who were asked to undergo serological tests and agreed to participate in the research project by signing an informed consent, were either asymptomatic or with mild to severe symptoms ascribable to COVID-19. The included subjects asked for ELISA (timepoint ELISA 1), either independently or after suggestion from their physician, in order to have a serology assessment of their infection status. All specimen and handling procedures were conducted taking precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel and using a class II biosafety cabinet (BSC). The following data were collected from each patient: age, sex, previous serology IgG screening, quantitative RT-PCR screening (nasopharyngeal swabs) when available, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms, as described in Table 1 . Table 1 . Demographic and clinical characteristics of the recruited patients in the whole sample and by age group. The asymptomatics declared no symptoms attributable to COVID-19 before serology testing by ELISA. They were tested to obtain their anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological response as contacts of confirmed cases. The symptomatics declared either mild symptoms (one or more of the listed symptoms below) not requiring medical assistance, or severe symptoms and received medical assistance at home, or hospitalized. The main symptoms associated with COVID-19 were: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea.",

Cells were obtained by diluting whole blood (1:4) with saline physiological buffer (0.14 M NaCl), and 4 mL of diluted blood was loaded over 4 mL of a Lympholyte solution (Cedarlane, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 20 min at room temperature. The PBMC layer was collected with a Pasteur pipette, and cells were washed with 10 mL of saline by centrifuging at 450\u00d7 g for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, PBMCs were resuspended in 5 mL of RPMI medium containing 10% foetal calf serum FCS and antibiotics, and cells were counted in a hemocytometer with trypan blue. PBMCs collected in 2017 from healthy donors and cryoconserved in liquid nitrogen were thawed, resuspended in complete RPMI medium, and counted in trypan blue. The cell concentration was adjusted to 9 \u00d7 10 6 /mL, and 100 \u00b5L cell dilutions were plated into polystyrene wells pre-coated with recombinant spike S1 protein as antigen, supplied from a commercial ELISA kit (Dia.Pro Diagnostics Bioprobes srl, Milano, Italy. Lot 0420/5AA, ref: COV19G.CE.192). As controls, PBMCs were added to 10 \u00b5g/mL of cycloheximide (CXM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, cat C4859) to block protein synthesis, or plated in complete RPMI (110 \u00b5L/well) into a 96-well culture plate (Corning-Costar cat CLS3474, Sigma) to assess spontaneous release of IgG from PBMCs. Each experiment was conducted in duplicate. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 \u2022 C in a humidified incubator with occasional gentle shaking, and after incubation the cells were removed, and the wells washed three times with 150 \u00b5L of saline. The RPMI medium from the cells plated in the absence of antigen (spontaneous releases) was collected after centrifuging the plate at 450\u00d7 g for 5 min and added (100 \u00b5L) to ELISA wells coated with antigen (Dia.Pro). The polystyrene wells were incubated for one hour at 25 \u2022 C and processed following the ELISA kit instructions and materials as described above. Briefly, the wells were washed three times with 150 \u00b5L of saline and incubated for one hour at 25 \u2022 C with a peroxidated anti-human IgG dilution contained in the kit, washed again as above, and enzyme reaction was visualized with a tetramethylbenzidine solution kit for 15 min at 25 \u2022 C. The reaction was then stopped with 3N sulfuric acid, and optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm in a plate reader. To evaluate the amount of IgG produced in vitro by cell-ELISA, human \u03b3-globulins (Sigma G4386-5G) were dissolved in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.4, from 100 \u00b5g/mL to 4 ng/mL) and were adsorbed overnight at 100 \u00b5L/well in duplicate wells of a polystyrene ELISA plate. The wells were then washed with Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.15 M NaCl (TTN). Binding sites were saturated with 3% bovine serum albumin in TTN for 30 min.

The table summarizes data from the 16 donors who tested positive by cell-ELISA, who underwent complete serological analysis of IgG twice-a single ELISA (ELISA 1) at baseline and a second ELISA at least 35 days later (ELISA 2)-accompanied by cell-ELISA using serum and PBMCs from the same donor's blood, respectively. The ELISA values are expressed as the ratio between OD450 of sample/cutoff value (*), considered negatives for <0.9, equivocal between 0.9-1.1, and considered positives for >1.1. A relative IgG concentration in cell-ELISA is indicated\u02c6, as deduced from a reference \u03b3-globulin ELISA. ELISA data are expressed as the ratio between the OD450 nm and cutoff values, as reported in the ELISA kit procedure (Dia.Pro). Cell-ELISA data are expressed as net OD450 values. The table shows the donors testing as negative (N = 5), equivocal (N = 1), and positive (N = 10) by ELISA 1 at day 0; the same donors tested as negative (N = 9), equivocal (N = 2), and positive (N = 5) by ELISA 2 after 35-60 days. By comparing serological and cell-ELISA data, Table 2 shows some donors were double-negative for both ELISA 1 and ELISA 2 (N = 5) but were positive by cell-ELISA; other donors positive by ELISA 1 were negative/equivocal in ELISA 2 (N = 5) but were indeed positive in cell-ELISA. Donors double-positive by both ELISA 1 and ELISA 2 (N = 4) were also positive in cell-ELISA.

Diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 is currently performed after running qRT-PCR of selected viral genes from nasal/respiratory tract swabs, monitoring the immune humoral response by serological assays, and/or measuring circulating IgM/IgG antibodies using various immunoenzymatic ELISA platforms available on the market. Previous studies have reported that serological testing may be useful to identify asymptomatic or subclinical infection with SARS-CoV-2 among medical workers in close contact with patients with COVID-19 [12] . However, in another study conducted on healthcare workers at risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the majority of participants with positive IgG had a significant decline in antibody levels after one month [13] . In this context, information on the presence of memory B cells can be pivotal, since some studies have shown that circulating antibodies can shift to undetectable levels after vaccination or infection, while circulating antigen-specific memory B cells are still present [4, 14, 15] . In order to acquire information on the mounting of a B cell memory response for SARS-CoV-2, in this study, we adapted a simplified ELISPOT platform [5] to detect in vitro produced IgG for the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has already shown to be antigenic in humans and has been employed as an antigen in serological ELISAs [7] . The principle of this cell-ELISA is based on the use of PBMCs cultured in plastic wells pre-coated with recombinant S1 protein, as supplied in commercial ELISA kits. The cell-ELISA platform was tested with PBMCs obtained from donors whose plasma was already probed by ELISA 35-60 days earlier (ELISA 1). This timing was selected, taking into consideration recent data on the production of neutralizing antibodies at 39 days after infection [16, 17] , to discriminate between the reported half-life of IgG, being less than 30 days [18] , and the presence of memory B cells and plasma cells, detected as early as 7 days after primary immunization [19] , even in the absence of stimulatory factors (such as R848 and IL-2), as already reported for viral antigens [5] .",

Importantly, only one of the positive samples by ELISA 1 and ELISA 2 tested negative (at borderline) by cell-ELISA, and thus confirming the robustness of the assay. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an assay measuring IgG produced in vitro by B cells and specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein, an antigen shown to induce specific anti-COVID-19 IgG [10] .",

This challenges the negative results from serological screening and suggests that the cell-ELISA may detect S1-specific IgG secreted by B cells even when a serological ELISA does not. This assumption is reinforced by the observation that all 16 subjects tested positive by cell-ELISA, including those who ELISA tested as negative and claimed to have had symptoms attributable to COVID-19.",

Net values were calculated for each sample by subtracting values obtained from adding the protein synthesis inhibitor CXM to cells. Spontaneous IgG release for each sample reached lower OD values than those obtained in the presence of CXM (not shown). As additional control, thawed PBMCs from four healthy control subjects, cryopreserved in 2017 (trypan blue viability > 90%), showed a mean OD450 value of 0.014 \u00b1 0.01 when tested by cell-ELISA. A cutoff value for negative samples was arbitrarily established at an OD450 value of 0.065, calculated by adding two SDs on top of the mean OD450 of CXM samples (0.023 \u00b1 0.021, N = 30).

Spontaneous IgG release for each sample reached lower OD values than those obtained in the presence of CXM (not shown).
