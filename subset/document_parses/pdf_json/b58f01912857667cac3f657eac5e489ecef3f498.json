The lack of a clinically approved vaccine or drug remains the biggest bottleneck in combating the pandemic. Drug repurposing can expedite the process of drug development by identifying known drugs which are effective against SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a promising drug target due to its indispensable role in viral multiplication inside the host. In the present study an E-pharmacophore hypothesis was generated using a crystal structure of the viral protease in complex with an imidazole carbaximide inhibitor. Drugs available in the superDRUG2 database were used to identify candidate drugs for repurposing. The hits obtained from the pharmacophore based screening were further screened using a structure based approach involving molecular docking at different precisions. The binding energies of the most promising compounds were estimated using MM-GBSA. The stability of the interactions between the selected drugs and the target were further explored using molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. The results showed that the drugs Binifibrate and Bamifylline bind strongly to the enzyme active site and hence they can be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. However, U.S Food and Drug Administration have withdrawn Binifibrate from the market as it was having some adverse health effects on patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "ARTICLE HISTORY", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "COVID-19, a severe viral pneumonia, was first reported on December 31, 2019, from the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CDC, China). The causative virus was shortly identified as a novel beta-coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2. The virus belongs to the order Nidovirales of the Coronaviridae family comprising of the alpha-and beta-coronaviruses. These are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses with comparatively large genomes among known RNA viruses (26.4-31.7 kb) (Zheng, 2020; Su et al., 2016) . Six members of the family are previously known to infect humans including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are known to cause severe respiratory ailments in the host (Paules et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2018) . SARS-CoV-2 is the latest addition to the group and has presented itself as a potent human respiratory pathogen due to a mutation in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of its spike protein that enables high affinity binding to the ACE2 receptor in humans and a polybasic furin cleavage site at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein (Andersen et al., 2020; Hasan et al., 2020) . Since the first report on the virus, it has spread across continents inflicting a global health-care and economic emergency. In view of the global spread of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a pandemic in January 2020. As of 28th May 2020, the number of infections reported was 5,596,550 and the number of deaths is 353,373. The numbers are increasing relentlessly despite concerted efforts to contain the spread of the virus using rigorous diagnostic testing, isolation of positive cases and tracing of contacts. The scenario is further made grim by the fact that there are no specific drugs or vaccines against the virus currently. The current treatments focus on symptom management and supportive therapy . Government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and research institutes across the globe have taken up the formidable challenge of inventing a specific, viable and validated therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 as it is probably the only solution to the ongoing crisis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 530, "text": "(Zheng, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 531, "end": 547, "text": "Su et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 712, "end": 733, "text": "(Paules et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 734, "end": 754, "text": "Corman et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1132, "text": "(Andersen et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1152, "text": "Hasan et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Drug repurposing refers to the identification of novel applications/targets for an approved or investigational drug outside the premise of its medical indication (Ashburn & Thor, 2004) . At present, the strategy would be a logical choice for developing a therapy for COVID-19 considering the substantial time-scales and attrition rates associated with new drug discovery and the trial-based validation of its safety and efficacy. The major advantage lies in the fact that a repurposed drug has been already evaluated for its safety by pre-clinical and clinical trials, which would save significant amounts of time and money (Pushpakom et al., 2019) , a priority concern in SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery. Indeed, most of the drugs that are currently under investigation for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are repurposed known medicines. Drugs that are either under development or prescribed off-label against COVID-19 include ribavirin, interferon-a, mycophenolic acid, ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir and remdesivir (Mitj a & Clotet, 2020; Baden & Rubin, 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Hendaus, 2020; Arya & Dwivedi, 2020) . Among these, hydroxychloroquine, an approved antimalarial drug and two known antivirals ritonavir and remdesivir have been reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Yan, 2020) . However, more recent studies have reported harmful effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Inhibition of autophagy by these drugs may induce tissue damage and worsen organ injury in COVID-19 patients (Edelstein et al., 2020) .

The enzyme has similar structural fold and cleavage site specificity as that of the picornavirus 3 C protease (Huang et al., 2004) . The M pro is an attractive and well characterized drug target in corona viruses owing to the pivotal role it plays in the propagation of the virus inside the host Boopathi et al., 2020) . The non-structural proteins of the virus (n \u00bc 16) is encoded in the ORF1a/b of the RNA genome and gets transcribed and translated into two polyproteins (PP1a and PP1ab). Proteolytic cleavage of the PPs into its components is required to derive functionally active proteins. After its auto-cleavage from PP1a and PP1ab, M pro cleaves PP1ab at about 11 sites. PP1ab contains the subunits of the replicase complex including the RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRP) and hence the cleavage becomes an essential requirement for viral replication Mousavizadeh & Ghasemi, 2020) . Thus, the inhibition of M pro would effectively stop viral spread by preventing its replication. Since, human proteases with the same cleavage specificity as the SARS-CoV-2 protease (Leu-Gln#Ser,Ala,Gly) are not known, it is unlikely that an inhibitor would cross react with a human protease . Very recently, Jin and co-workers reported the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with a potent inhibitor (Jin et al., 2020) . The protein is 306 residues long and has a molecular weight 33.8 KDa.

The conformational changes of the protein and the ligand from the initial structure during the simulation can be expressed in terms of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). Any RMSD within 3 \u00c5 is perfectly acceptable for globular proteins. Larger deviations indicate that the protein is undergoing large conformational changes during the simulation and it means that the protein-ligand complex is unstable. The four complexes that were subjected to MD simulations showed deviations in protein RMSD is below 3 \u00c5 when compared to initial frame ( Figure 6 ). The overall values of Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), (which specifies the flexibility of protein residues during the interaction with the drug) falls within 3 \u00c5 and hence indicates that the protein is stable while in complex with the drugs in the active site.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 727, "end": 735, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Molecular dynamics"}, {"text": "Analysis of the ligand RMSD shows that Binifibrate and Bamifylline do not exhibit large deviations from the initial position indicating that their binding is stable. However, Macimorelin acetate and Rilmazafone displayed larger RMSDs during the MD run indicating that they have less stable binding. Taken together, it is clear that Binifibrate and Bamifylline possess better binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 M pro active site compared to the other two drugs. The interactions of drugs with specific residues of M pro during the MD run were shown in Figure 7 . The major hydrogen bonds which stabilize the binding of Binifibrate (Gly 143 and Glu 166) and Bamifylline (Gly143, and Glu 166) were persistent during the entire course of the MD simulations. The hydrogen bonding interactions established by Macimorelin acetate (with Gly 143, His 164, Glu 166, Thr 190) and Rilmazafone (with Thr 26, Gly 143, His 163, Glu 166) were eventually lost during the course of the simulation and that accounts for the lower stability of the binding. After the MD run, binding energy of the selected frames from MD trajectory was calculated by MM-GBSA. For this, the structure of each 10 ns frame from the 100 ns (total 10 structures) MD trajectory was exported and binding energy was calculated for each complex. The binding energies obtained were averaged and standard deviations were determined (Table 3) . Binifibrate showed highest average binding energy during the MD run (-67.78 \u00b1 5.97 kcal/mol) and the energy value was similar to the binding energy before the MD run (-69. 04 kcal/mol). The binding energy values of Bamifylline before and after the MD run (-63.19 kcal/mol and -65.24 \u00b1 6.20 kcal/mol respectively) were also similar indicating that the drug interacts with the M pro active site with high stability. Rilmazafone which had an initial binding free energy of -61.37 kcal/mol showed a significantly lower energy (-39.05 \u00b1 6.15 kcal/mol) after the MD run. Likewise Macimorelin acetate showed a large deviation in binding energy before (-64.25 kcal/mol) and after the MD run (-17.362 \u00b1 14.53 kcal/mol). Also, the RMSD of Macimorelin acetate showed a huge variation (15-40 \u00c5). The MD simulation indicates that binding of Macimorelin to M pro was not stable. Figure 8 summarises the comparison of binding energy values before and after MD simulation and Table 3 summarises the contribution of each energy parameters to the binding energy of the simulated systems. The MD data indicates that the drugs Binifirbate and Bamifylline might bind to the active site SARS-CoV-2 M pro and inhibit its activity. Hence, these drugs have the potential to be repurposed against COVID-19. However, Binifibrate, a hypolipidemic fibrate drug co-administered along with statins, has been presently withdrawn from the market. The reason cited for the withdrawal is that the risks associated with the drug outweighs its efficacy as an agent that reduces triglycerides and increases high density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) (Abb Vie Inc, 2016). A rational assessment of the benefits of using binifibrate against COVID-19 and the potential side effects should be made before considering it for drug repurposing against COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 552, "end": 560, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1394, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2270, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2364, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Molecular dynamics"}, {"text": "Drug repurposing is perhaps the best way to combat the medical emergency poised by the SARS-CoV-2 infections that grows in magnitude with the passing of each day. Repurposing involves screening and identification of known bio-actives against specific therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2. Repurposed drugs gets to the market at relatively lesser time periods and costs compared to novel drugs. The M pro of SARS-CoV-2 is involved in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins to form key non-structural components involved in viral multiplication and hence is an attractive target for drug development. In the present study using a combination of E-pharmacophore and structure based virtual screening followed by binding energy estimation; a subset of known drugs from the superDRUG2 database was repurposed against COVID-19. Out of 4600 drugs from the database, after a series of screening, four drugs were selected for molecular dynamic simulation studies to check their binding stabilities in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Based on the MD results, it was found that Binifibrate and Bamifylline may bind to the SARS-CoV-2 M pro active site and inhibit its activity. Hence, Binifibrate and Bamifylline are two drugs that could be repurposed against COVID-19. However, it is important to note that Binifibrate is currently withdrawn from the drug market because of its side effects. It is suggested that a rational risk-benefit analysis should be performed before the drug can be used for repurposing against COVID-19.
