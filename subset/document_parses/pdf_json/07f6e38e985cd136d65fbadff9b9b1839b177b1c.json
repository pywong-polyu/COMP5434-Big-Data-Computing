Each US state and territory and the District of Columbia has a central public health laboratory that provides diagnostic testing and highly specialized services for human, animal, environmental, agricultural samples and food products. Newborn screening programs offer an example of specialized testing done primarily at PHLs. Ninety-seven percent of the 4 million babies born each year have their first laboratory test analyzed for genetic and metabolic disorders, providing critical information necessary for early intervention. Many health departments also manage laboratory services through a network of local public health laboratories located in metropolitan areas, counties, or regionally within a state. Local PHLs are an intrinsic part of the safety network in underserved populations-they are highly integrated with Public Health Department (PHD) clinics, providing routine diagnostic testing as well as screening tests for disease prevention. Lead abatement programs and monitoring of sexually transmitted diseases are other examples of the community support functions of a local PHL. Their work informs public health officials in state government, allowing for targeted disease surveillance and quicker response to disease outbreak, as well as population based data that may lead to new guidelines or policies to protect residents.",

Surge capacity agreements create a safety net for the laboratories during outbreaks and emergency response periods by allowing a PHL to transfer excess test volume to a partner PHL. Shared services agreements provide PHLs an opportunity to reduce or share cost and increase efficiencies by referring low volume, high cost/high complexity testing to a partner lab that has the capacity and capability to perform that testing. Since PHLs provide many unique or critical services to the public, these laboratories have also established continuity of care agreements to ensure that, in the event one PHL is affected by a natural or manmade disaster, another lab or group of laboratories can assume the responsibilities and duties of the affected PHL. Figure 15 .2 illustrates these and other use cases in the Public Health Laboratory. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina put these agreements to the test-particularly within the newborn screening program. These specimens and test requests were successfully transferred to partner PHLs, assuring that timely screening was performed to detect hereditary disorders that depend on early intervention to prevent longterm disability and death.

Water samples are also tested at the PHL for a variety of reasons under EPA Safe Drinking Water Act Standards, but most importantly, the PHL monitors both well water and public water systems. Food, be it peanut butter or spinach, is tested on a regular basis to detect pathogenic bacteria. Soil, building materials, and even cups and plates are tested to protect citizens from high levels of toxic chemicals such as lead and, in some cases, radionuclides.

PHLs provide support to the public health department in identifying the cause of the latest foodborne outbreak that may have been first detected at a clinical laboratory. PHLs also spend a significant amount of time developing new assays and test methods for emerging infectious diseases, such as the detection of the newest influenza virus strain that may cause the next epidemic or even a pandemic. Because of their efficacy, some of these newly developed tests are adopted by commercial laboratories and offered to their customers at a later point in time.

            "text": "Since the advent of computers, the laboratory, with its capacity to produce and manage important data, has been at the forefront of health informatics. What initially began as a database for local results, over time developed into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that provides capacity for improved workflow management, inventory tracking, and most importantly, patient management. Testing is often performed on stand-alone instruments. These results need to be incorporated into the LIMS, in order to be included in the final result sent to the submitter. In the beginning, the LIMS captured those results; yet these had to be printed to be sent back to the submitter. With the improvement of PHL informatics knowledge and instrumentation capabilities, more instruments are being interfaced using industry developed standards. This greatly improves the quality of data and workflow efficiency. Informatics practice has transformed several laboratory workflows as organizations migrate from paper-based to electronic system-based tracking. Being able to draw data from a database in an electronic format facilitates secondary use of this information for forecasting or event detection. This information can then be shared with partners in the Public Health Laboratory system (e.g., the public health department, a regional taskforce, preparedness coordinators, policy makers, and federal agencies). The capability of the laboratory and its public health partners to share data in the same format, through adoption of an electronic data interchange (EDI), can greatly reduce communication delays between partners, resulting in faster, better outcomes for both patient and population-based responses compared to paper or even facsimiles. In 2019, 90% of reportable laboratory results in the US are shared with state public health departments electronically, due to the adoption of national standards like HL7 \u00ae v2.5.1, LOINC \u00ae and SNOMED CT \u00ae being incentivized by meaningful use regulation [7, 8] . This functional requirements document describes interdependencies between the lab and outside partners and using the informatics principle of separating each of the core business processes into their individual steps with related functional requirements for the system, based on detailed laboratory workflow analysis [9] . The publication of this requirements document has created a functional standard vendors can utilize to build more useful systems that are conformant with these requirements. Although much variability between information systems still exists, this document still stands as a solid basis to identify and pinpoint these variations.",

In order to make data comparable across locations, the PHLs map their local codes to national data standards. These data standards include the Logical Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC \u00ae ) [10] for the tests they perform, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED \u00ae ) [11] to identify organisms and ordinal results, and codes from Health Level Seven (HL7 \u00ae ) [12] for patient demographics like gender, race, and ethnicity. To exchange standardized data between PHLs and their partners, the order and format of the data to be exchanged needs to be defined. For individual point-topoint exchanges, simpler formats can be agreed upon; for example, comma-separated files (CSV) or MS Excel spreadsheets can be exchanged. However, in order to accommodate larger scale data exchange with multiple partners across multiple information systems, standards such as HL7 \u00ae messages (in version 2.x) or the XMLbased clinical document architecture (CDA) formats should always be considered as part of the normal business process. In addition to utilizing these standards, transport mechanisms need to be defined and agreed upon by electronic data interchange (EDI) partners [13] . All these functions are covered by informatics principles-from database design to queries, as well as application of format and content standards. As discussed earlier, in order to support these critical public health functions, PHLs create support networks among themselves. These PHL networks form alliances between laboratories that perform the same kinds of tests and exchange results within the same networks, usually under the guidance of a federal program. Utilization of the requirements document among PHLs has advanced the application of informatics in the PHL realm, and has made several of these networks quite successful. Examples of functional PHL networks in the US are summarized in Table 15 .3.",

The mission of the LRN is \"to maintain an integrated national and international network of laboratories that are fully equipped to respond quickly to acts of chemical and biological terrorism, emerging infectious diseases, and other public health threats and emergencies\" [5] . Due to the sensitive nature of CDC's bioterrorism preparedness activities, details of LRN-B operations are protected against general public access and distribution. These details, designated as \"Sensitive But Unclassified,\" are maintained at CDC, and require coordination with the LRN LIMS Integration team to obtain. The LRN provides specifications about the message format (HL7 \u00ae v2.x) and data content, including standardized vocabulary (for example LOINC \u00ae and SNOMED CT \u00ae ) ELRN [14] The Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN) is managed by EPA. The ERLN consists of federal, state, and commercial laboratories that focus on responding quickly to an environmental chemical, biological, or radiological terrorist attack, as well as natural disasters affecting human health and the environment. The ERLN provides an Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD), which can be either a spreadsheet or the recommended XML format and a Data Exchange Template (DET) with data element definitions and groupings. The ERLN also provides a web-based electronic data review tool that automates the assessment of EDDs by providing web access for upload by the laboratory and review by project personnel FERN [15] The Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) is managed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The primary objectives of FERN are to help prevent attacks on the food supply through utilization of targeted food surveillance; prepare for emergencies by strengthening laboratory capabilities to respond to threats, attacks, and emergencies in the food supply; and assist in recovery from such an incident. FERN uses the Electronic Laboratory Exchange Network (eLEXNET) that allows multiple government agencies engaged in food safety activities to compare, communicate, and coordinate findings of laboratory analyses (continued) methods. ARLN, LRN and NAHLN use HL7 \u00ae v2.x messages as a data exchange standard, while FERN and ERLN use XML-based Electronic Data Deliverables (EDDs). This forces the PHL to support a variety of formats and vocabularies in order to properly report to the respective partners during an investigation. A significant obstacle to the development of consistent data exchange deliverables is the sheer number of networks and reporting requirements. Table 15 .4 shows what a laboratory must do, after the discovery of a foodborne illness outbreak due to consumption of tainted hamburgers.",
