Supply of doctors is low by international standards (180 per 100,000 population in 2013 [3] ) with large geographic distributional inequalities. Many doctors work in the private hospital sector in urban areas rather than the public system where working conditions and career prospects are perceived to be poor [4, 5] . In 2012, over 42% of the population lived in areas with fewer than 25 doctors per 100,000 [6] comparable to doctor densities in countries of sub-Saharan Africa (20 per 100,000) [7] . HRH shortages in primary care are especially problematic and contribute to suboptimal health outcomes and continued health inequalities in the country [8] . Brazil's Estrat\u00e9gia Sa\u00fade da Fam\u00edlia (ESF) is a globally-renowned public primary care system that has delivered improvements in health outcomes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, expansion of the ESF in urban or remote areas has stalled in recent years due to HRH shortages [14] .",

            "text": "In 2013, the Brazil government initiated the Programa Mais M\u00e9dicos (PMM) (More Doctors Programme) to expand the number of doctors in under-served areas. In addition to funds for clinic construction and refurbishment, and new medical schools in areas lacking doctors, there was a politically-contentious \"emergency expansion\" of primary care doctors. These were predominantly Cuban doctors who entered Brazil following an agreement between Cuba and Brazil, organised by the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO). One year later, in July 2014, there were 14,462 PMM doctors: 79.0% Cubans (11, 429) , 15 .9% Brazilians (2302) and 5.1% other foreigners (731) [15] . By Sept 2015, the total had increased to 17,625 doctors [3] . Studies show that following the PMM there are now fewer municipalities with primary care doctor shortages [16, 17] , access to doctors has increased, users are more satisfied, and services have improved including patient-doctor relations, continuity, and coordination [18, 19] . There is also evidence of reductions in hospitalisations, but no effect on infant mortality [20, 21] . However, little is known about PMM's impact on existing primary care services or adult mortality. Primary care expansion in Brazil led to reductions in child and amenable adult mortality [10] , health inequalities [11] , and ambulatory care sensitive hospitalisations [9] , and therefore health improvements from PMM are anticipated.",

PMM implementation provides important policy learning opportunity about prioritising scarce HRH to maximise health system performance and health outcomes [23] . This study examined the impact of PMM on primary care doctor supply and amenable mortality using longitudinal data from 5565 Brazilian municipalities between 2008 and 2017.

An international cooperation agreement between Brazil and Cuba facilitated by PAHO provided Cuban doctors to fill these vacancies following basic training in primary care and supervision from an accredited university [3, 24] . Municipalities were prioritized to receive PMM doctors using federally-set criteria: municipalities with 20% or more of the population in extreme poverty; 100 municipalities with more than 80,000 population and the lowest income per capita; state capitals, metropolitan regions, and other municipalities encompassing areas with extreme poverty; and municipalities with low/ very low human development index or considered vulnerable (e.g. semi-arid or Quilombo communities) [6] .

Thus, Q5 (highest baseline doctor density) received the greatest increase in PMM doctors, but there was near complete substitution of non-PMM doctors and no significant change in overall primary care doctor density following PMM introduction.

            "text": "Allocation of doctors to non-priority areas and local substitution effects likely undermined potential health benefits of PMM. Any municipality requesting a PMM doctor received at least one doctor. The substitution of existing doctors, particularly in areas with the greater primary care doctors at baseline, may be explained by a few factors. Although formal substitution was not allowed, more stringent attendance, training and supervision requirements for PMM doctors (particularly the Cubans) may have prompted existing doctors with high rates of absenteeism to leave [34] . Additionally, existing Brazilian doctors may have joined PMM due to higher remuneration and reliable salaries (from federal as opposed to municipal governments). Another factor is that participation in PMM by Brazilian doctors for a minimum of one year conferred an advantage in competition to enter residency in other, \"more prestigious\" medical specialties. The finding that expanding supply of primary care doctors is associated with reductions in amenable mortality is concordant with evidence showing mortality reductions (including amenable [10] , cardiovascular [12] and infant mortality [35, 36] ) following ESF expansion. It is also inline with broader international evidence on health benefits from expanding primary care services [37, 38] and the relationship between HRH and health outcomes [39] . The findings also align with evidence showing reductions in hospitalisations following PMM introduction [20, 21, 28, 29] and support a causal interpretation of population health improvement. Mortality reductions could come from a range of mechanisms. Primary care's role in prevention and resolving basic health needs is important and evidence shows PMM improved access, satisfaction, service quality, and utilisation [18, 19, 21] . Specifically, reductions in respiratory mortality identified could stem from vaccination and access to antibiotics [40, 41] . Mortality benefits could also accrue through increased referral to hospitals with evidence demonstrating PMM's role in increasing referrals [21] . However, reductions in mortality were small and there may be reasons why other causes of death were not significantly associated with PMM introduction. A few new doctors across a large area may not have substantially improved healthcare access or quality if there were existing health professionals (including nurses and community health workers) already providing care. Some amenable conditions, such as neoplasms and maternal outcomes may be more amenable to secondary care. Also, wider factors likely constrained primary care effectiveness including weak secondary care and a need to address wider social determinants of health [42] .",

            "text": "There are limitations pertinent to this study. Firstly, the analytical approach was ecological, prohibiting individual inference and limiting causal interpretation. However, the approach was robust, has been employed by similar studies [10, 11, 21, 28, 29, 43] , exploits the quasi-experimental nature of the programme, and provides stronger evidence over most other observational studies. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of the findings to alternative specifications in covariates and time trends. Using municipalities as the unit of analysis may also underestimate programme effects if there is targeting to certain populations in municipalities, and smaller units of analysis such as health units could be appropriate in future studies [44] . Secondly, there is potential for bias from data errors and manipulation, and modelling specifications. All data sources come from administrative sources considered of high quality, and sensitivity analyses point to the robustness of the findings. Thirdly, potential bias can come from comparing PMM and non-PMM receiving municipalities given they may be different in certain respects. Other studies employing the same methods point to the validity of the assumptions underpinning the analysis [21, 29] , and descriptive trends show parallel trends at baseline (see Additional file 1). Event study approaches further demonstrate the validity of these assumptions (see Additional file 1). Fourthly, the amenable mortality metric is limited as it also includes conditions sensitive to secondary care and may have limited identification of mortality effects directly related to primary care. Fifthly, the PMM may have prompted better recording and doctor allocation by local health system managers, and the substitution effect could partly have come from absent doctors being removed from the system. Evidence is growing that large-scale health system interventions to address HRH supply shortages can deliver health gains [1, 20] . However, this study demonstrates the importance of developing and adhering to comprehensive needs-based criteria for HRH allocation. The PMM could have delivered a near 30% increase in primary care doctors (a peak of 18,000 PMM doctors added to the 61,000 primary care doctor workforce in Brazil during 2013), but the actual increase was only 12.2% as nearly two thirds of PMM doctors substituted existing primary care doctors. The programme did not deploy a formal, comprehensive needs-based approach for doctor allocation [22] and widespread allocation of PMM doctors to non-prioritised municipalities in addition to local substitution effects mean full health benefits of PMM were not realised. Improved targeting and implementation of HRH interventions is needed to maximize benefits and to drive progress towards UHC and the SDGsespecially in LMICs.",

            "text": "Political, administrative and financial factors likely undermined the PMM's effectiveness in Brazil, but a wider question remains around the longer-term sustainability of programmes which import foreign health professionals to address domestic shortages in HRH. This was an issue for the PMM with the withdrawal of all Cuban doctors by the Cuban government in November 2018. The introduction of Cuban doctors was an \"emergency\" component of the PMM, and there were efforts to primary care clinics and training positions for doctors. Despite funding shortages, these longer-term sustainable solutions to appropriately train and distribute sufficient high-quality professionals domestically must remain a key priority. In December 2019, Brazil introduced the \"Medicos Pelo Brasil\" (Doctors for Brazil) programme to replace the PMM. It aims fill 18,000 positions with Brazilian doctors in underserved areas incentivized with higher salaries for Brazilian doctors and increased training. However, the despite the departure of the Cuban doctors, many positions remain unfilled and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil has significantly disrupted plans to recruit Brazilian doctors, with some Cuban doctors returning to take over empty positions. Great uncertaintly remains over how future policies will tackle Brazil's sizeable inequalities in HRH. Furthermore, the Brazilian government has introduced deep austerity measures restricting public health expenditures for the next 20 years [45] . This is likely to a have major impact on financing for HRH in the future and, combined with withdrawal of Cuban doctors, negative impacts on population health [46, 47] .",

The widespread allocation of PMM doctors to non-priority areas and local substitution effects undermined programme impacts, including contributing to relatively modest reductions in amenable mortality. Policymakers should recognize the importance of developing policies to expand HRH provision in improving health, but must prioritize actions to maximize the benefits and ensure policy effectiveness including developing and implementing comprehensive needs-based criteria.",
