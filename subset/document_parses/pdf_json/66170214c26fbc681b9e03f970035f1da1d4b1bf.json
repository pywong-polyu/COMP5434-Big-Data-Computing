Moreover, the risk communication protocol was developed, prevention and protection messages were disseminated in local languages, and case investigation and contact tracing were carried out. The surveillance systems, screening at point of entries, and community level screening and testing were also strengthened, and the Rapid Response Team was mobilised. 9 On 20 March 2020, the government of Nepal enforced a complete lockdown of the country that included the suspension of international and domestic flights, restrictions on movement and mass gathering, and closures of the schools and colleges, businesses and services apart from those considered essential. People were urged to stay at home maintaining social distance. 10 The unintended effects among people at all levels are many, ranging from anxiety/stress to reduced freedom on daily living, and from fear of the unknown to loss of income sources. 11 It has been reported that the strict and prolonged lockdown has various effects such as effects on maternity services and rise in maternal deaths, effects on mental health and rise in suicide cases, effects on children and adolescents, rise in domestic violence, impact on routine health services like child health and immunisation, impacts on logistics and supply management, and impacts on farming. 12 A study conducted in Nepal showed that 41.9% of health workers had symptoms of anxiety, 37.5% had depressive symptoms, 33.9% had symptoms of insomnia and more than half of the health workers faced stigma. 13 A study in India reported that the knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic among people is good but still there was a gap in right perception. 14 Similarly, in the USA and the UK, people had important misconceptions about COVID-19 whereas, in Nepal, a study reported that the overall knowledge of COVID-19 was high and the majority of people had a positive perception towards universal safety measures. 15 The future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic largely depends on the behaviour of people. 16 With increasing number of researches conducted on COVID-19, some evidence have been generated regarding the transmission of COVID-19, risk factors, preventive methods and health-seeking behaviour of people. [14] [15] [16] [17] However, there is still a dearth of relevant populationlevel research in the context of Nepal, that addresses people's real experiences of living in the pandemic situation. 18 Understanding the perceptions that people have about the disease, hearing about people's experiences during this pandemic and using this evidence to inform policy could help the country design preparedness plans and preventive strategies for the future. Therefore, this study aims to explore the perceptions that people have towards COVID- 19 and their experiences about the social distancing measures applied by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.",

The study showed that participants possessed good knowledge about the origin, transmission, cause and prevention of COVID-19. They were aware that using masks and sanitisers, washing hands and maintaining social distance could help them prevent the disease, and they believed that awareness campaigns in rural areas were necessary. Mass media played a vital role in raising awareness among people; however, the need of checking the credibility of all information spread by social media was stressed upon by some participants. The finding of this research is in line with the study conducted in Bangladesh 21 where most of the participants were aware of the COVID-19 pandemic, and their source of information was mass media. In the USA, 16 most people exhibited good knowledge about the mode of transmission, causes and symptoms of the COVID-19. In this study, participants mentioned the potential risk factors of the disease, such as age and comorbidities, which were similar to the report published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 22 Similarly, the study conducted in Uganda 23 reported that awareness and attitude played an important role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Safe water, sanitation and hygiene are a must for defending against this virus. 24 However, debates are still ongoing on the evidence of effectiveness of face masks as a prevention measure. 25 One of the studies Open access suggests that early public interest in face masks may be an independently important factor in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic on a population scale. One illustrative region is Hong Kong, where the public interest in face masks is among the highest due to the perception of masks preventing the disease transfer. 26 The use of surgical masks in high risk and crowded areas can provide effective protection. 25 Accurate information shared by media plays a role in shaping people's perceptions towards risk of contracting COVID-19; lack of accessibility to this information can serve as a barrier which in turn, can increase the probability of the infection. 27 Similarly, a study conducted in India reported that most people have good knowledge and right practice towards COVID-19, but gaps persist in the right perception of myths and misconceptions. It suggests providing educational programmes to rectify misconceptions about COVID-19 and improving the knowledge, perception and practices. 14 Moreover, there was good knowledge on the situation of COVID-19 but poor perceived knowledge on preventive measures. 28 A study conducted in Nepal revealed that the knowledge of people about COVID-19 was high, but there was a gap in knowledge on social distancing and quarantine. There was a positive perception towards universal safety measures of COVID-19, but negative perceptions also existed such as: COVID-19 attacked only older people; and coughing into the elbow was not good practice to prevent the spread of the virus. 15 Participants also believed in: survival of the virus in hot temperatures, meat and egg consumption causing the disease, and the potential role of turmeric, onion, tea and alcohol in preventing it. Similar to it, a study in Afghanistan showed that 89% of the participants believed that during the outbreak, eating well-cooked and safely handled meat is safe. 29 Similarly, a study conducted in India showed that social media played a major role in spreading awareness among the public, however, the spread of fake news was also reported, highlighting racism issues during the epidemic which created panic and negative influence on people's mental health and psychological well-being. 30 31 Similarly, one study revealed a misconception that exposure to the sun or temperature more than 25\u00b0C prevents the disease which then cannot spread further in hot and humid climates. Other studies also reported misconceptions around the disease such as: people cannot completely recover from the COVID-19 once they suffer; drinking alcohol prevents the disease; coronavirus is transmitted through mosquito bites; hand dryers are enough for killing SARS-CoV-2; antibiotics are effective for the treatment of COVID-19; garlic and honey help in curing the disease; the acid in our stomach kills the virus if we drink enough water; clapping hands create vibrations that destroy the virus; religious chants can kill the virus; 32 33 and low-income countries are more immune to COVID-19. 34 Also in a study from Australia, 42% of participants thought that being unable to hold your breath for 10 seconds without coughing was an indication of having the virus. Among the participants, 83% held at least one COVID-19-related misconception with the most frequent being that the virus was created in a laboratory (36%). 35 This research has also highlighted the expectations of the people and challenges of the government to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Inadequate PPE for health workforce, health system mismanagement, lack of sufficient and effective quarantine centres, and the violation of lockdown were some of the challenges during this pandemic situation that were put forward by the participants. Similar to this study, the lack of protective equipment and transportation were the difficulties experienced by rural residents in China during the epidemic. 36 A study conducted in Nepal showed that a shortage of test kit and medical supplies including PPE, poor coordination among different tiers of government and poor reporting were the major challenges in containing COVID-19. The high population density in the urban areas of South Asia makes it difficult for people to maintain social distancing and proper personal hygiene. 37 PPE is essential to reduce viral transmission and prevent the spread of the disease among the healthcare workers and patients, 38 39 but shortage, inappropriate use and misuse of PPE were identified as the major problems in the UK, 38 and shortage of PPE in high-demand areas like triage and isolation wards of India has resulted in severe problems. 39 A study conducted in Italy revealed that only 13% of physicians reported having access to PPE every time they needed them. 40 In Thailand, contact tracing is most effective but mass screening cannot be afforded by the government. 41 Similarly, a study conducted in Taiwan revealed that testing only symptomatic cases can miss many asymptomatic infections and render contact tracing less effective. 42 Tackling the violation of lockdown rules is one of the biggest challenges for the government. A study has shown that strict mitigation measures, if implemented in a timely manner, greatly outperform lengthy quarantines and lockdowns. 43 Social distancing is regarded as the most effective measure for mitigation of the disease 44 ; additionally, early lockdown reduces the effects of the disease. 45 The experience of China suggested that social distancing is a deliberate effort to slow down the spread of infectious or contagious diseases. Keeping that in mind, most of the countries focused on social distancing and lockdown systems to prevent the spread of the disease. 46 Similarly, participants from a study believed that quarantine, social distancing and the use of face masks can actually break the chain of COVID-19 spread. 47 In Pakistan, the forced lockdown was not feasible, so it changed into a partial lockdown first and then into a smart lockdown. 48 Therefore, lockdown is a hard choice and challenging in order to maintain essential services. 49 According to a study conducted in Nepal, a long and strict lockdown had negative effects on many health aspects of people and the community: many women are facing barrier in accessing maternal health services; data have shown an increase in suicide attempts; children Open access and students felt stressed due to uncertainty about the future. 12 Quarantine is effective to control the COVID-19, 50 but its effective management is a challenge for the government. However, increase in abusive behavior highlights the negative aspects of isolation and quarantine at home. 12 The impact of the pandemic and lockdown on public is enormous: people opined that the disease and its consequences reduced social interaction, exacerbated the economic crisis, increased psychological effects (fear, anxiety and depression) and also changed the lifestyle of the people in many ways. In rural areas, however COVID-19 wasn't reported to bring considerable changes in lifestyle. Interestingly, for some participants, lockdown had some positive impacts as well as it helped them to have quality time with their family members and helped them feel refreshed.",

According to UNICEF, COVID-19 is a new disease with many unknowns; these unknown factors have led to anxiety among the public, 51 which has in turn fueled stigma and discrimination. 52 Other studies also showed that healthcare workers, people released from quarantine, people returning from travel, and people with the disease and their families also faced social stigma. 53 A study revealed that healthcare providers working in hospitals and laboratories are discriminated against and are facing difficulties for food and shelters, with the neighbours refusing to interact with them while showing their displeasure. 54 Similar to this study, in Nepal also, health workers were expelled from their rooms and were faced with the difficulty of getting food in the hotel. This kind of discrimination makes people socially isolated, and can leave them angry and depressed. 53 A qualitative study was conducted in Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Iran to explore the perception of nurses on taking care of patients with COVID-19, which revealed that nurses experienced many challenges such as physical fatigue, stress, anxiety, feeling of insufficiency, and being enclosed in protective equipment during caretaking; all these led to a decrease in the quality of patients' care. 55 Social distancing and social isolation during COVID-19 have affected most people in a negative way. It has reduced social interactions, changed lifestyle, led to economic loss and resulted in psychological crises. Social isolation increases loneliness which is a risk factor for various psychological conditions. 56 A study conducted in the UK also showed that social distancing and isolation had negative impacts on the mental health and well-being of people. It also affects employment, economy, individual's worthiness, and daily routines of people leading to psychological and emotional loss. 57",

A large number of participants were interviewed in a short period of time abiding preventive measures and safety guidelines. Furthermore, the use of the phenomenological approach was instrumental in translating messages from people's lived experiences during this pandemic situation in this research. This study has a wide geographical coverage of study sites covering three out of seven provinces including the capital city of Nepal. The use of qualitative methods may render the findings not generalisable, however, the evidence generated is useful to design quantitative research to understand the burden of issues and the impact of the COVID-19 on the population at large. Other limitations include the possibility of having interviews and data collection being influenced by the experiences of the research team regarding COVID-19. Due to different stages of lockdown and disease outbreak in different parts of the country, people were hesitant to participate in FGDs and somewhere they were discouraged by the authorities. To address this issue, government-set rules and regulations for the public gathering were followed, that is, maintenance of 1-metre distance, use of masks and sanitisers; and they were ensured of safety and free will to withdraw any time. Similarly, since the children and elderly population were excluded from the study due to the possibility of an increased risk of COVID-19, their views and experiences could not be understood. Moreover, this was a short-term study conducted over a period of 2 weeks. The long-term experience of the participants may provide a better understanding of people's experiences during the pandemic.",

Similarly, social distancing, isolation and economic loss during lockdown increase the risk of psychological problems, implying the need for professional counselling.
