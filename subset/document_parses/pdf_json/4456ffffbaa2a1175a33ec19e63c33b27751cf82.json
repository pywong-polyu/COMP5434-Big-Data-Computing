[1] [2] [3] One of the first healthcare professionals to raise the alarm was the Chinese ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the young age of 33, after being infected by one of his patients. 4 In general, ophthalmologists are at great risk because of close patient contact while performing a significant number of examinations and interventions. Despite the question, whether SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to be transmitted using ocular fluids, it is of special interest for the cornea and eye banking specialists to know whether corneal tissues are potentially infectious and possibly mediate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from corneal donors to recipients. Currently, there is a lot of discussion among corneal specialists regarding acute adjustments and changes to standard procedures in tissue procurement, processing, and transplantation (personal communication, tissue transplant section of the German Ophthalmological Society). A recent study confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the conjunctival epithelium and cause a full-blown picture of viral conjunctivitis. 5 The objective of this study was to evaluate corneal involvement in COVID-19 postmortem donors in the following tissues: corneal stroma and endothelium, bulbar-limbal conjunctiva, conjunctival fluid swabs, anterior chamber fluid, and corneal epithelium. Findings may have implications for corneal transplantation and in particular corneal tissue procurement and processing. Our secondary objective was to describe precautions taken and personal protective equipment (PPE) used during these tissue procurements. 6 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 251, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 252, "end": 255, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 256, "end": 259, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 485, "end": 486, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1366, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1878, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Informed consent, adherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval of an independent ethics committee (institutional review board) was obtained before commencement of the study (241/2020BO2).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Informed Consent and Approval of Independent Institutional Review Board"}, {"text": "Specific Guidelines, Assessment of the Environment for Tissue Procurement, and Personal Protective Equipment Guidelines for the enucleation team (2 persons): To be checked before the enucleation of a COVID-19 postmortem donor:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tissue Procurement"}, {"text": "1.
