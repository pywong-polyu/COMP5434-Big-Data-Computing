We believe that clinicians should direct care and engage in shared decision-making with patients when appropriate. Although patients may choose to decline therapies or to seek treatment elsewhere, a clinician should not be compelled to administer treatments that they believe to be harmful. The doctor has a professional responsibility to use their expertise to act in the best interest of their patients. Although administration of an unproven medicine for a critically ill patient may be well-intentioned, we do not know at this time if ivermectin makes the course of the disease better, worse, or has no effect.",

ACMT has previously cautioned against harms of off-label prescribing when not supported by evidence [11] . Diversion of a medication for an unproven indication reduces availability for those who need the drug. Ivermectin is included in the World Health Organization list of essential medicines for parasitic disease worldwide [12] . Another concern is the practice of hoarding, which has been seen previously with unproven COVID-19 therapies such as hydroxychloroquine. At a time when supply chains are already compromised, hoarding unjustly encourages allocation of a limited resource without consideration for need. Off-label prescribing does not just impact drug supply, but also affects clinical research, which remains the best way to understand if therapies work. When patients take ivermectin outside of the research setting, we do not gain understanding about whether the medication is helpful or harmful. Moreover, patients who take ivermectin may be unable to receive other potentially beneficial remedies in clinical trials. Patients who desire ivermectin should receive the drug in the context of clinical research and should be encouraged to accept approved therapies such as COVID-19 vaccination.",
