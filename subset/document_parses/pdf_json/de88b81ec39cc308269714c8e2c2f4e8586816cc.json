In addition, to constraint the spread of the virus, economies have been shut down, curfews and restrictions have interrupted the social lives. Currently, the key question in minds is the future impacts of the virus on the people. It is a fact that the parametric modelling and analyses of the pandemic viruses are able to provide crucial information about the character and also future behaviour of the viruses. This paper initially reviews and analyses the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, which is extensively considered for the estimation of the COVID-19 casualties. Then, this paper introduces a novel comprehensive higher-order, multi-dimensional, strongly coupled, and parametric Suspicious-Infected-Death (SpID) model. The mathematical analysis results performed by using the casualties in Turkey show that the COVID-19 dynamics are inside the slightly oscillatory, stable (bounded) region, although some of the dynamics are close to the instability region (unbounded). However, analysis with the data just after lifting the restrictions reveals that the dynamics of the COVID-19 are moderately unstable, which would blow up if no actions are taken. The developed model estimates that the number of the infected and death individuals will converge zero around 300 days whereas the number of the suspicious individuals will require about a thousand days to be minimized under the current conditions. Even though the developed model is used to estimate the casualties in Turkey, it can be easily trained with the data from the other countries and used for the estimation of the corresponding COVID-19 casualties.",

The COVID-19 is transmitted from human to human through droplets that spread from the coughs or sneezes of people with the disease. The virus may have different effects on the infected people where some people show mild symptoms and recover without hospitalization. The most common symptoms of the COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Difficult breathing, chest pain, and loss of speech are some of the more severe symptoms as well. Since, there are no drugs or vaccines that have been proven to protect people from the COVID-19, it is still uncontrollable [13] .",

It is possible to use mathematical and statistical methods to model the pandemic, analyse its characteristics and evaluate its control mechanisms [14] , [15] . Modelling the pandemic enables to examine the dynamics of the infectious diseases in detail and estimate the infection parameters.

In addition, the estimated solution can correspond to a local region instead of the global where the estimates are only valid in a small region. Since they are generally iterative approaches, it is likely for them to converge somewhere in the parameter space which might not be the optimum, especially in the stochastic cases. Moreover, even though the statistical analysis approaches are available for the non-parametric modelling approaches, they are usually not rigorous as the exact model parameters are unavailable.

Therefore, they require initial observations and analysis of the source data. However, when the model structure is constructed, performing a parametric modelling approach is straightforward. The linear and non-linear models can be obtained easily and extensive analyses of them can be achieved by using the well-known mathematical approaches such as the roots, eigenvalues, and imaginary components. Since the batch type optimization approaches together with the iterative ones are available for the parametric modelling, it is possible to reach the terminal parametric solution in one step. More importantly, the detrimental impacts of the stochasticity in the data can be eliminated as the batch type optimizations can able to ignore the random variables. Lastly, the parametric models can reveal key knowledge about the strong and weak sides of the real systems such as failing treatments, so that policies can be developed to control the behaviour of them as desired under uncertainties [18] .",

In the rest of the paper, Section II reviews the SIR model, Section III introduces the proposed SpID model, Section IV formulates the LS based parameter learning approach, Section V analysis the COVID-19 casualties in Turkey, Section VI provides the key insights of the SpID model, Section VII presents the predicted future casualties for Turkey and finally, Section VIII summarizes the work.",

This data is used for determining the unknown parameters of the model in Section V and also is used for the analysis of the model and predicted future casualties in Sections VI and VII. Fig. 2 shows the daily suspicious casualties (tested due to appearance of the symptoms) reported by the Health Ministry of Turkey. As can be seen, initially no suspicious casualties have been reported even though the deaths have been reported. The number of the suspicious casualties has increased quite sharply for about 40 days and then due to mostly imposed curfews and lockdowns for about 30 days duration, the number of the suspicious casualties has reduced moderately. However, it continues climbing after lifting the restrictions. Fig. 3 shows the daily infected casualties reported by the Health Ministry of Turkey. It is clear that the number of the infected people sharply reaches the peak after around 30 days of 12 of March 2020. The number of the infected casualties reduces from 5000 to under 1000 after imposing restrictions and raising social awareness against the virus. Nevertheless, the number of the infected people slightly increases after releasing the restrictions. However, it is noticeable that despite the large increase in the number of the suspicious people (Fig. 2) , increase in the number of the infected people is limited (Fig. 3) . This is likely because the latest tests are for protection purpose rather than the existence of the strong evidences of the COVID-19 symptoms. Fig. 4 shows the number of the deaths stemmed from the COVID-19 virus in Turkey. It is clear that the character of the deaths (Fig. 4) is strongly correlated with the number of the infected people (Fig. 3 ), but not with the number of the suspicious people (Fig. 2) . It is clear that the number of the deaths has reduced from 130s to 20s, but it has not minimized.",

The other eigenvalues of the whole data will disappear, but the dominant eigenvalue will be insignificant around 900 days later if there are no disturbances or changes in the conditions. Insight 4: When the late data (after the lockdowns) is considered, the two of the real eigenvalues in rectangle 3 of Fig. 6 are just larger than 1. Henceforth, the response is unstable and the casualties explode unboundedly if no action is taken against them. However, since the unstable eigenvalues are slightly larger than 1, the casualties will increase sluggishly.",

The results show that the developed model can closely estimate the casualties in Turkey. In addition, the model predicts that the number of the infected and death people will be minimized in 300 days, whereas the number of the suspicious casualties will reach their minimum around 1000 days.
