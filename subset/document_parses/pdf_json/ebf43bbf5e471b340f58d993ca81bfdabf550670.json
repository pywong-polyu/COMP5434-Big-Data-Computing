            "text": "There is great need for therapeutics against multidrug-resistant, Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Recently, darobactin A, a novel bicyclic heptapeptide that selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer membrane protein BamA, was discovered. Its efficacy was proven in animal infection models of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus promoting darobactin A as a promising lead compound. Originally discovered from members of the nematode-symbiotic genus Photorhabdus, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding the synthesis of darobactin A can also be found in other members of the class Gammaproteobacteria. Therein, the precursor peptides DarB to -F, which differ in their core sequence from darobactin A, were identified in silico. Even though production of these analogs was not observed in the putative producer strains, we were able to generate them by mutasynthetic derivatization of a heterologous expression system. The analogs generated were isolated and tested for their bioactivity. The most potent compound, darobactin B, was used for cocrystallization with the target BamA, revealing a binding site identical to that of darobactin A. Despite its potency, darobactin B did not exhibit cytotoxicity, and it was slightly more active against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates than darobactin A. Furthermore, we evaluated the plasma protein binding of darobactin A and B, indicating their different pharmacokinetic properties. This is the first report on new members of this new antibiotic class, which is likely to expand to several promising therapeutic candidates. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic options to combat Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are dwindling with increasing antibiotic resistance. This study presents a proof of concept for the heterologous-expression approach to expand on the novel antibiotic class of darobactins and to generate analogs with different activities and pharmacokinetic properties. In combination with the structural data of the target BamA, this approach may contribute to structure-activity relationship (SAR) data to optimize inhibitors of this essential outer membrane protein of Gram-negative pathogens.",

To monitor this threat, the WHO started curating and evaluating data from all member states to create a priority list of bacterial pathogens, ranked according to criteria like treatability, preventability, prevalence of resistance, and more (2) . The top half of this priority list is almost entirely composed of Gram-negative pathogens, and only 4 of the 25 bacterial species listed are Gram positive. This list is led by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Horizontal gene transfer on small genetic elements, such as plasmids, is common among Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating the rapid spread of newly evolved resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane (OM), which vastly restricts the accessibility of targets for drugs with intracellular modes of action. A dried-up antibiotic development pipeline is aggravating this situation and drastically illustrates that new, resistance-breaking antibiotics active against these highly threatening pathogens need to be discovered and developed now (3).",

During biosynthesis, the heptapeptide core is cleaved from the precursor peptide DarA and the radical SAM (RaS) enzyme DarE catalyzes the formation of two fused macrocyclic ring systems that endow DAR A with its rigid scaffold. Recently, we could show by heterologous expression experiments that DarA and DarE are solely essential for DAR biosynthesis (5) . Using the amino acid sequence of DarE as the query, homologues were discovered in the BLAST database. This enabled the identification of DAR BGCs in the genera Yersinia, Vibrio, and Pseudoalteromonas of the gammaproteobacteria clade (4) . Comparison of the DarA precursor sequences in the identified BGCs revealed that the DAR A heptapeptide core sequence (W 1 -N 2 -W 3 -S 4 -K 5 -S 6 -F 7 ) is overall dominant. However, a few genes were identified that encode precursor peptides with one or two amino acid substitutions within the heptapeptide core. Among those, the sequence predicted to encode DAR B (W 1 -N 2 -W 3 -T 4 -K 5 -R 6 -F 7 ) particularly caught our attention, since it was a precursor peptide gene that was present in addition to a DAR A-encoding gene within multiple Photorhabdus strains. Precursor-encoding genes that should result in DAR C (W 1 -S 2 -W 3 -S 4 -R 5 -S 6 -F 7 ), DAR D (W 1 -N 2 -W 3 -S 4 -R 5 -S 6 -F 7 ), and DAR E (W 1 -S 2 -W 3 -S 4 -K 5 -S 6 -F 7 ) instead of the Dar A precursor were identified in Yersinia strains. In addition, the sequence W 1 -K 2 -W 3 -S 4 -K 5 -N 6 -L 7 , which we termed DAR F, was discovered in Photorhabdus thracensis (formerly temperata) strain DSM15199. In this case, a DAR A precursor was also present, and alignment of the precursors from various Photorhabdus strains indicated the DAR F sequence to be related to the DAR B precursor (Table 1) .",

To get access to the DAR analogs identified in silico, the original heterologous expression system based on the Photorhabdus khanii DSM3369 BGC was modified. The darA sequence encoding the core amino acids was exchanged against a lacZ spacer derived from pCRISPOMYCES-2 (6), and Goldengate assembly was used to incorporate the sequences of the desired core amino acids (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). However, exchanging the core amino acids of DarA while maintaining the Q-E-I follower did not result in detectable formation of DAR analogues. Therefore, we tested whether the three follower amino acids Q-E-I are essential for the heterologous production of DAR A in this system. Removal of these amino acids resulted in a comparable production yield (Fig. S2) , as was also observed for a different expression vector system (5) . Hence, the follower peptide was omitted in the following constructs and chimeric precursors without the follower peptide were generated, consisting of the P. khanii DSM3369 leader and the sequences of DAR B to F, respectively.

The DAR F precursor peptide sequence (gray shading) is displayed in the alignment; however, due to strong sequence aberration, it was not taken into account for the amino acid identity, which is indicated by the asterisks. natural derivatives were detected by high-resolution ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HR-UHPLC-MS) analysis. The identity of the molecules was corroborated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation analysis. In general, the OH-b 1 * and OH-b 2 * fragments, indicative of hydroxylated tryptophan (W 1 ; cleavage of the C-O-C ether bridge), as well as the C-terminal fragments y 1 and y 2 , could be observed (Fig. S3 ). DAR C alone could not be fragmented, due to a poor production titer. The retention times were similar to that of DAR A, with DAR B and F eluting slightly earlier. However, the intensities of the ions corresponding to the desired molecules showed a high degree of variation (Fig. 2 ). Due to the similarity of the derivative ions, the peak intensity could be approximately correlated with the expression level. The second highest expression level following that of DAR A was observed for DAR B (m/z = 525.2533 [M 1 2H] 1 , Dppm = 4) (Fig. 2) . DAR F and E showed intensities of ,10% compared to the DAR A peak. DAR C and D (carrying the K 5 R exchange [a change of K to R at position 5], one of the three amino acids undergoing posttranslational modification) were only detected in traces, with DAR C showing the lowest intensity of all (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, the production yield observed for DAR F was in the same range as for DAR B, thereby showing that even multiple modifications are possible without impairing the production drastically. After corroboration of the identity of the molecules by MS/MS fragmentation analysis, the BGCs were recloned into the optimized heterologous expression system (5) to reach higher production titers. However, even using this system, DAR C could not be obtained due to the poor production yield, and only ;1 mg of DAR D and E was isolated to enable the initial MIC testing.

Heteronuclear multiple-bond coherence (HMBC) correlations further confirmed ring closure between C b of Trp 2 (d H = 6.24 ppm) and the aromatic ring of Trp 1 (d C = 149.59 ppm) via a bridging oxygen atom, as well as the C-C bond between C b of lysine (d C = 52.40 ppm) and the aromatic ring of Trp 2 (d H = 6.99 ppm). Characteristic 1 H signals in this respect are the doublet of doublets at 6.99 ppm for Trp 23 and the doublet at 6.24 ppm for Trp 17. In addition, the 13 C shift of Lys 32 at 52.40 ppm is quite typical for the DAR derivatives. Due to the proximity of the observed heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) correlations, assignment of the proton signals for the lysine residue proved difficult. On the other hand, the 13 C signal of Lys 33 was identified by its HMBC coupling with the proton of Lys 31, while the 13 C signal of Lys 35 was mainly assigned based on its chemical shift (and a comparison with other DAR derivatives, as well as a spectral simulation) (Fig. 3) . Distinction of the proton signals for Lys 33 and Lys 34 was based on the observed rotating-frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) correlation between Lys 33 and Trp 21, which is in agreement with the data reported for DAR A (4). The 13 C NMR spectrum additionally indicates the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which is probably derived from the purification procedure and might form a salt with the alkaline amino acid residues present in the molecule. The key nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and ROESY correlations are in accordance with those published for DAR A (4).",

DAR B displayed comparable or even better activities (Table 2 ). In a next step, DAR B was further evaluated in comparison to DAR A by using an expanded panel of test organisms (Table 3 ).

E. coli strains with an altered bamA sequence showed resistance to both derivatives. Peculiarly, we observed DAR B to be slightly more potent against A. baumannii strains. Therefore, additional clinical isolates of A. baumannii were tested. In this panel, DAR B maintained its 2-fold-increased activity against all clinical isolates of A. baumannii, including five MDR strains.

A similar mode of action could be expected for DAR B, based upon the similar activity data even against DAR A-resistant E. coli strains (Table 3 ).

Photorhabdus strains colonize the gut of the nematode, like other Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., E. coli), and are released by the nematode. The latter mechanism will also release potential competitors, which are then inhibited by DAR.

            "text": "Interestingly, some of the Photorhabdus strains were found to carry a second precursor peptide with an altered core and follower amino acid sequence, already hinting toward more molecules of the DAR class to be discovered. Furthermore, some of the in silico-identified precursors in orthologous clusters in Yersinia strains also showed altered core amino acid sequences (of DAR B and DAR E), despite being the only precursor in the respective BGC. The predicted derivatives were not directly accessible by fermentation approaches. However, heterologous expression opens up the possibility to biosynthesize specialized metabolites, even though the BGC is silent under laboratory conditions. Previously reported DAR A expression constructs were successfully modified to generate the desired analogs. However, DAR B alone was isolated in a scale of several mg, while heterologous expression of DAR D and E resulted in ;1 mg of pure compound from ;100 liters of fermentation broth, and DAR C was not isolated at all. The identity of the molecules could be confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation analysis and was verified by NMR experiments in the case of DAR B. However, this synthetic biology approach does not clarify whether these analogs are real natural products or if these sequences only represent snap shots in evolution that will be deselected, since they are not easy to biosynthesize. It also might be that the modifying DarE is not adapted to the altered sequence of the core heptapeptide yet, so that much of the precursor is not converted into the final bicyclic compound. It can be assumed that it will depend on the bioactivity of the analog whether it is worthwhile from an evolutionary point of view to keep the sequence and to optimize biosynthesis of the metabolite. For DAR C and E, the K-to-R shift at position 5, an amino acid that participates in the aromatic-aliphatic covalent C-C bond, resulted in severely impeded production compared to the production of DAR A. Further investigation of DarE's flexibility will be part of future research. Concerning their mode of action, the DARs bind to the promising target BamA, which is located in the OM of Gram-negative bacteria and not yet employed for any antibiotics in application. The MICs observed for DAR A and B proved the compounds to possess activity against MDR pathogens. Clinical isolates resistant to rifampicin (E. coli strain NRZ14408), tetracycline (E. coli strains NRZ14408, MMGI1, and K0416), gentamicin (E. coli strains NRZ14408 and MMGI1) and last-resort carbapenems (E. coli strains NRZ14408, K0416, and Survcare052) showed MICs similar to those of wild-type E. coli. According to the 2019 CDC report on antimicrobial resistance, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter in particular, are \"urgent threats\" to the modern health care system (15) . Treatment options are needed, since prevention measures are not enough; e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of NDM-1 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an intensive care unit in Paris (March 2021) could not be prevented, although strict additional infection control procedures were applied.",

            "text": "New antibiotics, such as darobactin, with potency against these pathogens are desperately needed. In contrast, DAR D and E had significantly lower activities against the whole panel of test strains, with 8-to 16-fold-elevated MICs compared to those of DAR A. Hence, either these analogs target as-yet-unidentified bacteria or they indicate a degeneration process of the BGC in these strains. DAR F, which is part of a second precursor in addition to DAR A, points in this direction, since this bicyclic heptapeptide showed no activity. This can be explained by the fact that this is the only derivative investigated not ending with the amino acid phenylalanine, which represents the most frequent amino acid of known and putative b signals from bacterial OM proteins (7) . Therefore, DAR F would not block the b signal binding site and, thus, would not inhibit the function of BamA. The N 2 S exchange, present in DAR C, E, and F, results in 8-to FIG 5 In vitro binding of darobactin A and B to plasma protein. The percentages of DAR A and DAR B that either bound to human plasma protein (pink bar) or were unbound in the buffer (black bar) are given. 16 -fold decreases in the potency of the tested DAR E compared to that of DAR A against various E. coli strains. Since Ser2 should eliminate the side chain interactions existing between Asn2 and Lys808 and Asn427 of the BamA b1 strand, it is likely that this greatly reduces DAR E's affinity for the target and, thus, reduces its potency. In contrast to DAR A, DAR D carries an arginine in position 5 instead of lysine. If DAR A is bound to BamA, the Lys5 side chain points away from BamA, thereby enabling interaction with the negatively charged phosphate groups of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin lipids (7) . Supposedly, arginine could act similarly in the place of lysine, as arginine attracts more phosphate than lysine in membranes and can form more hydrogen bonds with phosphate clusters than lysine (16) . Arginine is also capable of cardiolipin binding, a further important aspect of DAR and BamA binding (17) . Therefore, the 16fold-lower potency of DAR D was unexpected, and further molecular docking studies of DAR analogs and BamA in combination with experimental data will likely provide evidence as to why this derivative has reduced activity.",

            "text": "DAR B shares a similar spectrum of activity with DAR A, with a 2-fold increase in activity against A. baumannii, which was observed across multiple strains in both wildtype and clinical isolates. Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii is currently one of the most threatening bacterial pathogens, with certain infections reaching 60% mortality (18) (19) (20) (21) . Even though the MICs for the clinical isolates varied by 14-fold, they were consistent between DAR A and DAR B. It appears that certain resistance mechanisms in MDR isolates may apply to DARs, but not in all cases, such as the hypervirulent and MDR A. baumannii clinical isolate LAC-4, which as we show has MICs of 8 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml for DAR A and B, respectively. Comparing the resistance determinants between the DAR-susceptible strain LAC-4 and the DAR-resistant A. baumannii strain AYE, an explanation may lie in A. baumannii's unique colistin resistance mechanism of removing the lipid A-containing lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Lipid A biosynthesis is essential for most Gram-negative bacteria, but certain colistin-resistant strains of A. baumannii, including AYE, are capable of survival without lipid A (22) . These changes in the OMs' compositions will alter their properties. In addition, Moraxella strains that are less affected by DARs than E. coli also possess another OM structure, e.g., fewer or no LPSs and fewer OM proteins. Whether such less-complex OMs may reduce the need of a functional b-barrel assembly machinery and thereby affect the potency of DAR should be further tested in future.",
