After treatment with intravenous antihistamines and glucocorticoids, the symptoms resolved. The second case, a 31 years old woman, developed an urticarial rash and subsequently a swelling of tongue and upper eye lids 10 days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine (Fig. 1) . The symptoms reoccurred during the period of 9 days but resolved after 7 days of treatment with oral glucocorticoids as well as oral antihistamines. The patient reported on no other allergies apart from a type IV-sensitization to nickel. In both patients, serological quantifications of total IgE, specific IgE to aeroallergens and tryptase levels revealed no hints of pre-existing type I-sensitizations or mast cell activation disorders (Table 1) .",

Hence, the immunological mechanisms behind the anaphylactoid reactions remain unclear. Acute allergic reactions to the novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been described based on self-reports. 2 However, so far no type I-sensitization has been proven. Several publications reported on the efficacy of omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, in preventing hypersensitivity reactions even in cases without known triggers. 3 Against this background, both patients were pretreated with a single dose of 300 mg omalizumab 2 and 7 days, respectively, prior to the second vaccination. Neither patient experienced angiooedema or urticarial rashes as immediate reactions after the second dose of the vaccine. The second patient showed a delayed reaction with fever and subsequent development of urticaria 8 days following the vaccination. However, this time the rash was by far less severe and thus no treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was required. Based on the clinical course and allergologic examinations, one could argue that the urticaria in the second case was most likely triggered by the delayed reactogenicity symptoms the patient experienced after the vaccination. Further, McMahon et al. 4 reported on urticarial rashes showing low second-dose recurrences. Hence, we cannot rule out that our second patient would have experienced less symptoms even without pretreatment with omalizumab.",
