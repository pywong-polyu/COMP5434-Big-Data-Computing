Although COVID-19 can affect all ages regardless of medical comorbidities, hospitalized patients are more likely to be older and demonstrate at least 1 medical comorbidity [2] . It has also become increasingly evident that in addition to traditional risk factors, there are widespread racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates, with disproportionately higher impact in vulnerable racial and ethnic minority populations [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . A recent study based on US Department of Veterans Affairs data showed an excess burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in African American (AA) and Hispanic populations that was not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions, residence, or site of care; however, the study did not find disparities in excess 30-day mortality across racial and ethnic subgroups [8] . This observation however is not aligned with a prior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, which showed poor outcomes in the AA population with 1.4 times increased risk of hospitalization, twice the risk of ICU care or ventilator support, and 1.36 times increased risk of death compared to Whites [9] . Gross et al, found a robust association between AA race, Latinx ethnicity, and estimated age adjusted COVID-19 mortality [3] . Overall mortality was highest in AAs with 1 in 1020 faced death attributed to COVID-19, followed by Indigenous Americans, Pacific Islanders and Latinos [3] . In addition, a study based on community level disparities in urban US counties in large metropolitan areas showed excess infections and mortality that are not explained by income, bolstering the complex causal pathways that culminate into these striking disparities [10] .",

We also observed higher infection and mortality in AI/AN and Asians in some states. We acknowledge that the assessment of disparities in groups such as in AI/AN and Asians can be underestimated in states with <1% population representation of these group and that lack of age adjusted mortality estimates can underestimate mortality in groups with younger populations such as the Hispanic population.",
