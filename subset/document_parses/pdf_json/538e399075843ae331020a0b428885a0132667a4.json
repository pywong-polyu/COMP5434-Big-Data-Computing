In less than one month the outbreak has since resulted in an epidemic throughout China (Hui et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020) . The new coronavirus rapidly spread across Asian countries and subsequently all around the world within a month of its onset. Malaysia announced the first three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 25 January 2020. At a later date, with increasing cases, various measures were undertaken by the Malaysian government to contain the spread of COVID-19, including extending travel bans for nationals from Iran, Italy and South Korea. On 17 March 2020 the number of confirmed cases in Malaysia had reached 673; this is also the date when the first two fatalities was reported. Subsequently, the country implemented a nationwide movement control order (MCO) to curb the outbreak on 18 March 2020.",

Monitoring of psychobehavioural response, Abstract Monitoring public psychological and behavioural responses during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is important for the management and control of infection. This study aims to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey was carried out for 10 weeks and the responses were divided into three periods of around 3 weeks: 25 January-21 February, 22 February-17 March and 18 March-3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25 January-21 February) and second periods, and high psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A total of 72.1% (95%CI = 69.2-75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (OR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.48-2.94), high perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.71; 95%CI = 1.17-2.50), high impact score (OR = 1.63; 95%CI = 1.17-2.26) and high particularly during the early phase of an outbreak, plays an important role in identifying behavioural gaps and provides important insights for immediate intervention, helping to bring the outbreak under control (Opare et al., 2000; Leung et al., 2005; Leppin & Aro, 2009 ). Empirical studies have provided some conceptual-theoretical frameworks regarding psychobehavioural responses during infectious disease outbreaks. For instance, during the SARS outbreaks, a positive association between anxiety level and personal protective behaviour was found (Seto et al., 2003; Leung et al., 2005) . During infectious disease outbreaks, tension may surge in the entire community and result in a significant disruption of general well-being, health and economy (Wishnick, 2010; Qiu et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019) . It is important to note that the public often judges personal risk based on their impressions of disease prevalence and death rates, therefore assessment of risk perception is important and changes in risk perception throughout the epidemic warrant appropriate understanding (Herrera & Meyers, 2019) . Most recently, with the current COVID-19 outbreak, the psychological impact of the outbreak intensified when the community was placed under controlled movement or quarantine (Brooks et al., 2020) .",

The community response to an epidemic follows a pattern in which anxiety is highest and behavioral responses are more intense at the beginning of an epidemic (Gaygisiz et al., 2012) . Understanding the association between psychobehavioural responses and anxiety during the early phase of the epidemic is important to provide information for timely public health intervention (Leung et al., 2003) . The health belief model (HBM) is a social psychological health behavior change model developed to explain and predict health-related behaviors (Janz & Becker, 1984) and is also an important model used in the development and designing education intervention program (Shahnazi et al., 2015) . It is hypothesized that an individual's perception of threats, a construct in the HBM model, influences anxiety (Robinson et al., 2013) . Education intervention programs based on the HBM constructs were found to be effective in alleviating anxiety (Ji et al., 2019; Shahnazi et al., 2015) . The association between the threat perception of the HBM construct and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak has never been reported, hence warrants rigorous investigation. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to determine the temporal change in psychobehavioural issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak, namely avoidance and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection, fear, impact, and anxiety levels. Secondly, factors (the psychobehavioral factors and threat perception) influencing the level of anxiety, were investigated. These findings will provide insights for the formulation of mitigation measures to manage the negative impact in a timely manner.",

The six items of the STAI in Bahasa Malaysia language was adapted from the validated full 20-item STAI (Hashim et al., 2018) . Respondents rated the frequency of experiencing six emotional states, namely being calm, tense, upset, relaxed, content and worried, connected with the current COVID-19 outbreak. A four-point scale was used (1, not at all; 2, somewhat; 3, moderately; 4, very much). The scores on the three positively worded items were reverse coded. The total summed scores were pro-rated (multiplied by 20/6) to obtain scores that were comparable with those from the full 20-item STAI (giving a range of 20-80) (Marteau & Bekker, 1992) . A cut-off score of 44 was used to indicate moderate to severe symptoms (Knight et al., 1983; Leung et al., 2005) .",

We hope that the results from this study will provide insights for the health authorities to use when developing risk communication messages during the current escalating COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia, so that appropriate intervention can be carried out to help curb the current escalating outbreak and also ensure the well-being of the public while the outbreak is ongoing. The MCO order included the closure of schools and higher education institutions, and general prohibition of mass movements and gatherings across the country including religious, sports, social and cultural activities. Although many industries and businesses were not allowed to operate, however, restaurants and cafes were allowed but the regulations only allowed takeaways and deliveries. During the MCO, Malaysians were confined to a 10 km radius from homes. Violators of the MCO's regulation were subjected to various penalties under the Penal Code. In general, the study respondents from 18 March-3 April, which covers the first 2 weeks of the MCO, have a higher level of avoidance behaviour compared to respondents in the two earlier periods of the study. As such, the MCO has resulted in a surge in avoidance practices among respondents including eating outside, taking public transportation, and going out to public places. Of important note, during the MCO period, Malaysia has put China, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran on a travel ban list. Imposing travel bans have most likely lead to a high proportion of study participants reported avoiding travel abroad. The increase in avoidance behavior along with the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak found in the current study was similar to the study done during the previous H1N1 outbreak in the Malaysia in year 2009 study (Wong & Sam, 2010) .",

Less than one-third of participants before the MCO period were found to wear masks when they were out in public. Nearly 27% reported not wearing masks when out in public during the MCO period, which deserves serious attention. It should be noted that during the study period, using a face mask was encouraged but it is not compulsory. This perhaps led to a lower proportion reported using mask during the two earlier time periods where the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases were relatively low. Subsequently, the proportion of face mask use increased in line with the increase of confirmed cases. Of note, the increase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in China and subsequently in Malaysia has caused a surge in demand, leading to a shortage of mask supply in the market during the two earlier time periods. This perhaps was one of the reasons people not wearing face masks.",

However, its latest recommendation advises wearing face masks in public areas where social distancing can be difficult (WHO, 2020b) , and this should be made known to the public. It is widely known that the shortage of face masks could be the reason why people are not using them, therefore the public should be advised to use another form of facial protection, such as cloth masks, when a face mask is not available. Although they are not as effective as surgical masks, research suggests that they can limit droplet transmission from infected individuals (Davies et al., 2013) .",

Importantly, this study has found that the feeling of fear was relatively low among the study respondents, particularly the fear of going to public eateries from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak up to and during the MCO period. Community messages encouraging people to stay at home, avoid visiting public places, practise social distancing and pack their food instead of eating outside have been widely circulated since the beginning of the MCO period. The public therefore should be enlightened to avoid public places, as it has been widely recommended that sustainable social distancing and rigorous implementation of social distancing are needed to contain the COVID-19 outbreak (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020) .",

Although official data on the economic impact of COVID-19 in Malaysia are not yet available, nationwide movement control has had a big impact on work-related travel and jobs, as found in this study. At the moment, with slightly over 2 weeks of the MCO, the financial impact is approaching 50%, indicating the potential catastrophic impact of COVID-19 to the economics of Malaysia in the coming future. There is thus an urgent need to mitigate any potential economic fallout of the coronavirus economic crisis. Furthermore, the trend line of the total impact scores showed a slightly greater upward slope over time compared to other psychobehavioural variables, implying increasing social and economic impact as the outbreak progresses. These findings warrant immediate mitigations to strengthen community resilience in order to endure these impacts during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Importantly, the perceived severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher than the perception of susceptibility. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in the epicentre, Wuhan, the escalating confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus in China have received extensive coverage in Malaysia. Of note, this survey commences on the day that the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in Malaysia.

Currently, the number of COVID-19 cases is still increasing in Malaysia and the pandemic has yet to reach its peak. This may indicate that a higher proportion of the public may experience anxiety disorders as the epidemic progresses. Multivariable analysis showed that having a high perception of severity and susceptibility is an important determinant of a high anxiety level. The public is more likely to express higher anxiety levels if they perceive they are at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2: for instance, if someone in their community is infected. This finding supports the hypothesis that risk perception is higher when a health threat is high, uncontrollable or dreaded (Ferrer & Klein, 2015) . Previous studies have reported the benefit of a higher perception of susceptibility and severity in triggering a higher practice of recommended prevention measures during disease outbreak (Lau et al., 2005; Leung et al., 2005; Rubin et al., 2009) . There is therefore a need to develop appropriate public educational messages that impart accurate information about the new COVID-19 outbreak yet at the same time do not overestimate the likelihood of infection or underestimate the risk of infection.",

Firstly, due to the cross-sectional design, the directionality of the association or the causal relationship between risk perception, fear, impact and anxiety levels could not be established; however, the findings provide a basis for acquiring and testing a causal hypothesis. Due to various resource limitations during the disease crisis and movement restriction in Malaysia, convenient sampling using an online web-based survey via a social media platform may lead to selection bias, as reflected in the large sample of females, people of higher education and the majority being from the Central region. Hence, the lower-educated people and people living in remote areas were under-represented. Despite the lack of general population representativeness, which may affect the generalisability of our findings, the current study provides useful first-hand information on public psychobehavioural responses during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak. It is also noteworthy to mention that the STAI is a measure of people's general level of anxiety. Hence, other sources of anxiety not related COVID-19 outbreak cannot be ruled out. In view of the above limitations, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution.",

A sizeable proportion of study participants were greatly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak in their family's daily routine and both non-work and work-related travel. The larger increase in social and economic impact as the outbreak progresses warrants immediate mitigations to strengthen community resilience in order to endure these impacts during the COVID-19 outbreak. A high anxiety level was observed during all three time periods. The factor influencing higher anxiety was a high perception of severity and susceptibility, impact and fear. This timely psychobehavioural assessment during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic among the Malaysian public is valuable for providing insights into strategies for health risk communication and mental health intervention as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.",
