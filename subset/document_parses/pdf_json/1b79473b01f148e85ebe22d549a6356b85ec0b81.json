These incidents comprise about 8% of the police department's workload that originates from the public. Calls appear to be highly concentrated in a few areas, and specifically the Center City and Kensington neighborhoods. They are also more likely to occur late afternoon and evening. The article shows that some medical or public health activity initially masquerades as crime or other policing work and some events eventually determined to be police/crime activity can initially appear to be public health related. About 20% of activity in this area does not appear predictable from the initial call type as handled by police dispatch.",

Public health issues are also 'inseparable' from policing (Wood, 2020) . Police regularly encounter vulnerable groups, including people struggling with mental illness, domestic and sexual violence, challenges related to sex work and drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and human trafficking (Dijk & Crofts 2017) . These conditions can present together in multiple ways that challenge police officers to address the complexity of co-morbidity issues, often within a 'vacuum' of support from other organizations (Wood et al., 2021) . Given numerous cities are discussing police involvement in public health-related incidents, this brief contribution describes a year's worth of public health related calls to police in one city, as evidenced through police administrative records.",

In discussions with CAD supervisors and PPD personnel, four CAD codes were associated with a public health nexus (see footnote 4). A category for reports of people in one of the city's rivers (144 such incidents in 2019), a 'sick assist' call for general assistance, a welfare check (check on well-being), and a large catch-all category for 'hospital case' .
