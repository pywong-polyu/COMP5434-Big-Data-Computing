If Biden wins the election, should you advocate for Biden to apologize for what you consider the offenses of the Trump administration? Trump supporters will of course object to the notion that anyone should apologize for the President, and this is instructive: we only expect apologies for things we find blameworthy, and what counts as an offense deserving of an apology is highly contested and an appropriate subject of political debate. An incoming president apologizing for an outgoing president might seem rather odd in a well-functioning democracy-opposing parties are supposed to disagree, so why would they bother with such rituals? Yet as we see most days in the news, apologies have increasingly become a battleground where moral boundaries are publicly policed, defended, and sometimes overtaken.",

Often when I receive an invitation to speak or write on political apologies, these discussions occur in the context of transitional justice where a war-ravaged or otherwise traumatized region hopes that an apology from the state for past wrongs will help facilitate a transition into a more just and stable period. Complexities abound, but similar questions tend to arise. Sometimes political apologies relate to events in the distant past such that no living people deserve obvious and uncontested blame for personally harming others. Apologies and reparations for the African slave trade, for example, present many complex issues distinct from, and often in addition to, the sorts of apologies needed in the context of transitional justice.",

As a political philosopher with a background in law and the judiciary, I spend considerable effort trying to be evenhanded. When Barack Obama was president, I remember the visceral fear of some-not social media bots, but real people that break bread with me at my table-that he would take all the guns, institute sharia law, and become a communist dictator. They had been poisoned by so much vitriol that President Obama became dehumanized into a demonic caricature.

Even for the most sober analysts, existential questions seem like reasonable concerns rather than classroom hypotheticals. The health of democracy in the United States has long been in question, but to what extent will it survive this election? Right and left both seriously doubt that the voting process will be legitimate. At such an explosive time when many children cannot even set foot in their school buildings, will COVID-19 sow further chaos and undermine the election process? Civil unrest related to police brutality and racial injustice further divides, and President Trump suggests that his heavily armed vigilante supporters who put down these \"riots\" should also \"enlist\" as \"poll watchers.\" President Trump urges his Election Day Team Army to \"cover every polling place in the country with people like you\" to stop Democrats who will be \"up to their old dirty tricks on Election Day.\" 2 And perhaps the most dangerous elephant in the room: even if the election process is clearly legitimate according to international standards, will there be a peaceful transition of power if Biden wins? Georgetown Law professor Rosa Brooks, founder of the bipartisan Transition Integrity Project, has \"war gamed\" possible election outcomes and concluded: President Trump is likely to contest the result by both legal and extra-legal means, in an attempt to hold onto power. Recent events, including the President's own unwillingness to commit to abiding by the results of the election, the Attorney General's embrace of the President's groundless electoral fraud claims, and the unprecedented deployment of federal agents to put down leftwing protests, underscore the extreme lengths to which President Trump may be willing to go in order to stay in office. 3 With Bush v. Gore as a precedent, do the judicial and legislative branches have the independence to enforce democratic processes? How will the police and military respond? We can forget that democracy is rare in human history, and when it does bloom it can seem like a rare and fragile flower in a field of robust authoritarianism. Usually we have other war-torn nations in mind when we speak of transitional justice, but that term is fluid. It isn't clear where the United States falls in 2020 on the spectrum of political turmoil, and future political theorists may treat us as a case study for any number of scenarios.",

It is easy to imagine Biden, with all of his mannerisms, uttering the words: \"To my fellow Americans, you are owed an apology\u2026. To the rest of the world, you also deserve better from the United States\u2026.\" Usually I am rather skeptical of collective apologies. As much as a nation needs to \"heal\" from political trauma, too often apologies are snake oil. Whether from a corporate leader or a head of state, apologies from collectives often suffer from serious credibility problems. They can do more harm than good as they distort ancient traditions of interpersonal remorse to offer little more than ambiguous and cultic rebranding. With that healthy skepticism in mind, however, I do think Biden would be wise to offer a specific kind of apology for the Trump administration.",

That book considers a wide variety of apologetic meanings and warns against thinking of apologies in binary \"all or nothing\" terms. Instead, we should be clear about what we seek in apologies and evaluate them accordingly. In order to determine how close an act of contrition comes to a categorical apology, we can ask: Did the offender explain what she did with an appropriate degree of specificity? Does she accept blame rather than mere sympathy? Does she cast the offense as an accident or otherwise deny that it was her intention to harm? Does she make clear why her actions were wrong and identify the principles she violated? Does she promise not to do it again and redress the problem she caused? Does she fulfill those promises? There are many other relevant considerations-consider, for example, complex issues regarding emotions and apologetic meaning-but we can appreciate that collective apologies rarely provide the substantive moral transformation associated with categorical apologies from individuals. According to these guiding questions, an apology from Biden for Trump seems misplaced. Biden, it seems, cannot meaningfully apologize for Trump according to our basic intuitions regarding how apologies and blameworthiness work.",

            "text": "We can unpack these intuitions by considering how issues related to standing and consensus present especially serious problems for collective apologies from heads of state. Usually we think of the person deserving of blame for wrongdoing as the person having \"standing\" to apologize, in part because the process of recognizing one's wrongdoing leads to changes in behavior, the need to remedy the harm, the appropriate emotional states, etc. But if Biden apologizes for Trump, we can appreciate just how different this would be than an apology from Trump-especially if Trump remains emphatically unapologetic and even ridicules Biden's apology. If Biden apologizes for the \"United States,\" the problem of consensus arises quite forcefully. If I apologize to my wife, she has good reason to think that I am speaking univocally and that I agree with my own apology. If Biden apologizes for the \"United States,\" a significant portion of the population will disagree with, oppose, and resent the apology. This is crucial for several reasons, including the possibility that the dissenters will continue committing the very offenses that Biden renounces and promises not to repeat. The stronger the consensus supporting the apology, the greater the likelihood the principles in the apology will be advanced rather than undermined by the members of the collective. If Trump supporters continue to wield political power with Biden as president, Biden's apology may not have much force in some jurisdictions. If an anti-Biden candidate takes the Presidency in 2024, the principles in Biden's apology might be reversed outright. These dynamics are quite different from those of apologies from individual people who hopefully speak with one mind and who amplify the meaning of their apology by honoring it and not reoffending over time.",

We should not expect to see President Trump on a bent knee apologizing for disparaging wounded veterans, for example. Whatever Biden does or says to address this will be quite distinct from expression of remorse from Trump for these insults.

The backlash to this might further factionalize the country and create even further instability as a sizable minority feels backed into a corner. We often need to finesse the issue of how to assign blame and responsibility for wrongdoing by the previous regime while preventing that very process from deepening wounds and political divides. However you understand justice, sometimes the process of \"administering justice\" can decrease political stability at a time when the threat of splintering into sectarian violence is especially dangerous. If moral accounting and punishment risks contributing to civil war, we might want to instead focus on describing and denouncing the wrongs of the past more generally, declaring the principles for the future, and providing remedies for those harmed. Value-declaring apologies can also accomplish systematic reform better than even exceptionally meaningful apologies between individuals.

            "text": "Intertwined questions arise regarding political branding and the potential timing of such an apology. Would it be preferable for Biden to provide an apology during the election season or, if he wins the presidency, sometime after the election? For prudential and strategic reasons, I would advise a postelection apology for two reasons. First, having won the election would demonstrably increase the size of the consensus for which he speaks and add credibility to the assertion that he represents the majority of voters. Second, a pre-election apology from Biden would likely speak primarily to the converted. His supporters and those generally inclined from center to left would likely welcome such a gesture. But how would it be received by moderates, Republicans who disfavor Trump, and others who are not especially impressed by Biden and who may either not vote or cast a lukewarm party-line vote for Trump? I cannot predict with any precision the impact of a Biden apology on his electability, but conservatives in the United States have a long history of viewing apologies as weak, emasculating, and unpatriotic. President George H.W. Bush repeated versions of this talking point whenever he could: \"I will never apologize for the United States-I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy.\" 5 One does not, on this view, want to be the \"kind of guy\" who grovels. This is an absolute belief held regardless of the facts. No matter how grotesque the offense, you do not want to be the kind of person who would ever adopt the posture of supplication. It is better, in this worldview, to be like cultural founding father John Wayne: \"Never apologize. It's a sign of weakness.\" 6 Apologizing, as President Trump might say, is for losers. Even Mitt Romney, who many see as a conservative ally against Trump, titled his vision for the country No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. 7 Some might think these are rather minor concerns considering everything else in play, but I would not underestimate the impact of these optics for Biden. The Democratic nominee has tried to walk the line between being an old-school tough guy with \"law and order\" gravitas and being an empathic statesman with a compelling bedside manner for victims of injustice. But for many, Biden is primarily Obama's vice president. And conservatives cast Obama as the \"Apologizer in Chief\" who went on various \"Apology Tours\" around the world \"apologizing for America.\" 8 Should Biden open himself to such unpatriotic labels?",

Powerful people command others to apologize and bow before them. Authoritarians have long demanded apologies, forced confessions, and other means to assert dominance over and dehumanize opponents. President Trump regularly tweets about who owes him an apology. It can seem odd that arguably the most powerful person in the world would take the time to demand an apology from a sportscaster, a newspaper, or Broadway performers.

This would require a much more thorough and lengthy analysis, including how Biden will frame his own policies as corrections to Trump. There are many offenses that Biden might wish to identify as especially wrong or damaging, but leftist and centrist supporters will disagree about which issues should be prioritized and whether Biden should address broad principles or specific incidents. The broader he frames the values identified-such as restoring civility, empathy, racial equality, and democratic institutions-the more likely he will appeal to a broader constituency. Usually I look for precision in how an apology corroborates a factual record and attributes blame to culpable individuals, but such findings will likely require lengthy investigations to understand what happened, how it was allowed to happen, who did what exactly, and how to prevent it from happening again. Biden can use an apology early in his administration to announce the opening of these investigations. I would also advise against a general \"airing of grievances\" that attempts to identify and correct every problem with the Trump administration and with U.S. history. There are many compelling arguments for a robust apology and reparations for U.S. involvement in the slave trade, for example, and these underlie the racial tension and white nationalism that have erupted. But an apology for slavery deserves its own occasion. 10 I would, however, pay special attention to how Biden addresses what many consider one of the greatest failures of the Trump administration: the dehumanization of minorities and those who oppose him. A central feature of meaningful apologies, I argue, is their ability to treat those who have been victimized as moral interlocutors. This means that a good apology can transform those who have been injured, demeaned, and treated as beneath the offender into someone recognized as having equal moral value. Biden is often described as empathic, and this plays to his strengths when contrasted with President Trump. Biden can help to restore the dignity of large groups of immigrants and minorities from the disparagement of these groups as \"thugs\" and other slurs, and he can make explicit that such name-calling is not acceptable. This seems like rather basic etiquette one learns in preschool, but its basicness speaks to how fundamental assumptions have deteriorated and require reinstatement. To return to issues related to standing, Biden elevating the humanity of immigrants can accomplish important meanings. But this is not the same as President Trump himself denouncing his own dehumanizing habits and recognizing those whom he disparaged as fellow humans of equal worth, just as it is different when your mom tells you that you are not a loser after the bully repeatedly tells you that you are.",

If Biden denounces failed leadership from the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, does he ultimately direct sufficient resources toward the education and public health systems? Value-declaring apologies can write checks as well as categorical apologies, and surely the Trump administration caused financial damages along many vectors. Should a Biden administration foot the bill for these financial wrongs caused by their predecessors? Even though Biden does not deserve blame for these harms, his official position makes him responsible for remedying the harms in the same sense that a janitor is responsible for cleaning someone else's mess. The post-COVID economy promises to further strain the resources and the political will required to provide redress.",

With origins at least as old as Aristotle's Politics, Alexander Nahun Sack described the odious debt doctrine: when a despotic regime contracts a debt, not for the needs or in the interest of the state, but rather to strengthen itself, to support popular insurrection, etc., this debt is odious for the people of the entire state. The debt does not bind the nation; it is the debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently it falls with the demise of the regime. 12 Usually such an argument would seem incompatible with democratic transferals of power between parties, but President Trump has presented a rather unique set of facts to analyze in this regard. It is tempting to expand the concept to \"odious moral debt\" in the context of value-declaring apologies, but that is a paper for another time. We can watch for answers to simpler questions and the more complex issues play out: Who pays? Who gets paid? How much?",

As with any apology, intentions matter. The public generally and rightfully will view a political apology like they perceive corporate apologies built to raise stock values and please focus groups. If Biden's apology looks like a transparent means to score points with various constituencies, it can backfire. His audience might perceive that not only is he \"apologizing for America,\" but clumsily pandering and betraying national pride for cheap wins. Credibility, likability, and stature can suffer. Biden must be mindful of these risks and not fumble the opportunity.",
