            "text": "Asthma is a respiratory disease with complex pathogenesis. Sterol-responsive element-binding proteins 2 (SREBP2) was found to bind to promoter sequences of ABCA1 to suppress ABCA1 promoter activity. This study aimed to explore the expression level of SREBP2 and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and their effects on the development of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) in asthma. ASMCs were treated with different concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 (0, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 ng/mL). Short hairpin SREBP2 (shSREBP2), SREBP2, shABCA1 or ABCA1 were transfected into ASMCs. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and the expression of SREBP2, ABCA1 and related pathway proteins were detected by MTT assay, Brdu staining, flow cytometer, Transwell assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, respectively. The results showed that TGF-\u03b21 increased the viability, proliferation, migration and inhibited apoptosis in ASMCs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 also decreased the expression of ABCA1, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin, TLR2, p-p65 and NFATc1. SREBP2 knockdown alleviated these TGF-\u03b21-induced changes. SREBP2 overexpression inhibited ABCA1 expression and apoptosis, and promoted cell migration and the expression of TLR2, p-p65, NFATc1 in ASMCs. ABCA1 overexpression alleviated these SREBP2-induced promoting and inhibition effects. In conclusion, SREBP2 activates TLR2/NF-\u03baB/NFATc1 regulatory network and promotes TGF-\u03b21-induced cell movement through inhibiting ABCA1 expression.",

In airway remodeling, airway wall thickening leads to airway stenosis and increased airway resistance [5] . When the airway wall thickens, airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) proliferate [6] . Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 is involved in the fibrosis of severe asthma by promoting fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of fibronectin. Moreover, the mRNA level of TGF-\u03b21 expressed in the airway mucosal layer of asthmatic patients was significantly decreased, indicating that TGF-\u03b21 could induce the occurrence of asthma. However, in vitro experiment has shown that TGF-\u03b21 also stimulates the proliferation and migration of ASMCs [7] . Therefore, studying ASMCs in vitro is an important way to study the pathogenesis of asthma, and TGF-\u03b21 can be used to establish in vitro asthma cell models.",

SREBP2 forms a complex with nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby increasing inflammation in vitro and in vivo [10] . Inhibition of SREBP2 expression can prevent lung injury caused by viral infection [11] . In addition, SREBP2 actively participates in lipid metabolism. Interestingly, asthma is also associated with lipid metabolism, such as phospholipid and eicosanoids. Almstrand AC et al. found that patients with smokinginduced asthma exhale significantly lower unsaturated or saturated phospholipid species in respiratory particles than healthy patients who do not smoke. Moreover, asthma leads to abnormal arachidonic acid metabolic pathways [12] . Therefore, we speculated that SREBP2 may be associated with asthma, but the specific mechanism of SREBP2 in asthma is unknown.",

The transfection efficiency of shSREBP2 was detected by qRT-PCR and as shown in Figure 2 (a), SREBP2 expression was down-regulated in shSREBP2 group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the ABCA1 expression level was increased in the TGF-\u03b21 + shSREBP2 group compared with TGF-\u03b21 + shNC group (p < 0.05, Figure 2 (a)), demonstrating that SREBP2 targeted the expression of ABCA1. Moreover, Figure 2 (b) shows that shSREBP2 alleviated the TGF-\u03b21-induced increase in cell viability (p < 0.05). Similarly, Brdu staining result also showed that shSREBP2 inhibited TGF-\u03b21 stimulated cell proliferation (p < 0.05, Figure 2(c) ). The apoptotic rate of ASMCs was decreased after TGF-\u03b21 treatment, while these decreases were reversed by SREBP2 knockdown (p < 0.05, Figure 3(a) ). Compared with control group, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP expression levels were significantly reduced in TGF-\u03b21 group. Then, the reduction of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP expression were alleviated in shSREBP2 transfected ASMCs (p < 0.05, Figure 3(b) ). In addition, Figure 4 (a) shows that TGF-\u03b21 increased the number of migrating cells, whereas shSREBP2 inhibited these increases in ASMCs (p < 0.05). The Western blotting results in Figure 4 (b) also shows that E-cad and vimentin (the proteins related to cell migration) expression was affected by TGF-\u03b21 and shSREBP2. Specifically, TGF-\u03b21 increased vimentin level and decreased E-cad level, whereas shSREBP2 markedly alleviated these changes (p < 0.05, Figure 4(b) ). In contrast, TGF-\u03b21-induced increases in cell viability and migration were continuously enhanced when SREBP2 was overexpressed in ASMCs (p < 0.01, Figure 5(a,c) ). Meanwhile, TGF-\u03b21-induced decreases in apoptosis were alleviated by the transfection of SREBP2 in ASMCs (p < 0.01, Figure 5 (b)). Therefore, the above results suggested that SREBP2 knockdown attenuates TGF-\u03b21-induced the increases in cell proliferation and migration, as well as the reduction in apoptosis in ASMCs. .

In addition, TGF-\u03b21 significantly up-regulated the expression of TLR2, p-p65 and NFATc1.

Then, SREBP2 vector and ABCA1 vector were transfected into ASMCs to verify the regulatory relationship and mechanism of SREBP2 and ABCA1. Figure 6 (b) shows that SREBP2 decreased ABCA1 expression levels. After simultaneous transfection of SREBP2 and ABCA1, the reduction of ABCA1 was restored, but the expression of SREBP2 did not change, indicating that the addition of ABCA1 cannot change the expression of SREBP2, but SREBP2 can change the expression of ABCA1. Thus, the target gene of SREBP2 is ABCA1. Moreover, TLR2, p-p65 and NFATc1 levels were increased by SREBP2 overexpression, whereas these increases were inhibited when ABCA1 was overexpressed in ASMCs (p < 0.05).

The proliferation and migration of ASMCs is an important pathological base for airway remodeling in asthma [19] . TGF-\u03b21 is able to stimulate the proliferation and migration of ASMCs [7] . Notability, the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway is a classic pathway regulating the involvement of ASMC in the pathogenesis of asthma [20] . Chen et al. reported that inhibition of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway effectively reduced the level of airway remodeling in asthma [21] . Therefore, the above studies are sufficient to show that TGF-\u03b21 causes asthma. In this study, we established an in vitro asthmatic cell model by stimulation with different concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 and found that TGF-\u03b21 could dose-dependently increase the viability, proliferation, and migration of ASMCs.",

The inflammatory factors can interfere with the negative feedback regulation of LDL receptors by regulating SREBP2, leading to the formation of foam cells [24] . ASMCs are one of the important sources of foam cells [8, 9] . Therefore, we hypothesized that SREBP2 is regulated by TGF-\u03b21 and involved in ASMC motility and even in the phenotypic transformation of ASMCs. In the present study, the results confirmed that SREBP2 expression could be up-regulated by TGF-\u03b21, and SREBP2 enhanced TGF-\u03b21-induced cell motility, suggesting that SREBP2 may be a proinflammatory factor for asthmatic ASMCs.",

In addition, SREBP2 was found to positively regulate ABCA1 promoter activity and promote ABCA1 expression [27] . Therefore, we speculated that SREBP2 might alter cell motility by regulating ABCA1 in asthma. In contrast to the above reports, we found that TGF-\u03b21 decreased ABCA1 levels in ASMCs, and ABCA1 is a target gene of SREBP2. Specifically, overexpression of ABCA1 alleviated the SREBP2induced increase or decrease in intracellular parameters, but it was unable to change the expression of SREBP2 in AMSCs.",

NF-\u03baB is involved in a variety of signaling pathways during inflammation [28] . Inhibition of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation reduces microglial inflammation [29] . NFATc1 is an important member of the nuclear factor family of activated T cells and primarily affects lymphocyte proliferation and TH2-type immune responses in airway inflammation [30, 31] . The imbalance of Th1/Th2 immune response plays an important role in the development of asthma [30] . Loss of NFATc1 results in impaired lymphocyte proliferation and inhibits lymphocyte differentiation [32, 33] . Therefore, we speculated that TLR2/NF-\u03baB/NFATc1 pathway may be involved in SREBP2 regulation in asthma. In this study, we found that SREBP2 could activate TLR2/NF-\u03baB/NFATc1, and ABCA1 could inhibit SREBP2-induced activation, illustrating that SREBP2 may increase inflammation and airway remodeling. Yuan et al. reported that activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway leads to increased lung inflammation, alveolar damage, and airway remodeling, which is consistent with the findings of this study and further confirms that SREBP2 has a proinflammatory effect in asthma [34] .",
