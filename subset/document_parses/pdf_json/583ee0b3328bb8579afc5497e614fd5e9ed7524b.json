Due to the atypical cells on bronchoscopy, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed one month later which showed mild glucose avidity in the right middle lobe and lingula consistent with resolving inflammation but no other pulmonary lesions. Skin prick and intradermal testing to the Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine showed no immediate reaction but a large 38x45mm intradermal reaction to the 1:10 dilution of the vaccine was seen at 48 hours, consistent with delayed hypersensitivity. This case demonstrates a previously undescribed delayed hypersensitivity to the Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine presenting with pneumonitis and a fixed rash. Whilst other causes for the patient's presentation were considered, the lack of microbiological findings on bronchial fluid and minimal response to antibiotic therapy supported an inflammatory rather than infective cause, and no evidence of malignancy was subsequently found. Although positive delayed skin testing reactions can indicate a normal cellular immune response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines 4 , the profound intradermal reaction seen in our patient, along with morphological similarities to the original rash and skin biopsy findings supported vaccine related hypersensitivity.",

Unlike the majority of delayed localised cutaneous reactions, our patient's presentation occurred after the second dose of the vaccine but this phenomenon is well described in delayed drug hypersensitivity and it is established that cellular responses are greater following the second vaccine dose. 10 The mechanism by which reactive lymphocytes may be generated remains unclear but immediate and delayed skin testing to polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350), one of the excipients in the Comirnaty vaccine, was negative at several concentrations. This suggests that the process was possibly driven by other components, including the lipid-based nanoparticle carrier. We therefore recommended that our patient avoid all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but can receive non-mRNA based vaccines if booster doses are required.",
