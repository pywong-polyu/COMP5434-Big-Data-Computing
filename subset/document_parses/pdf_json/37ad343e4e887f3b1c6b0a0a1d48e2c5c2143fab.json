The scale of this effort means that safety signals suggesting adverse effects may only be detectable using passive reporting. This paper examines reports to the CDC/FDA's VAERS system in the first six months of 2021, using an empirical Bayesian model with a gamma Poisson shrinker to identify potential safety signals from COVID-19 vaccines currently on the U.S. market. Based on this preliminary data, it is concluded that the COVID-19 vaccine's safety significantly exceeds that of previously marketed vaccines, and other than a known risk of thrombotic events, no safety signals of concern emerge. * Starschema Inc., Arlington, VA.

            "text": "The introduction of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has lent the response to the COVID-19 a new string to its bow. In the world's largest mass vaccination campaign to date, [1] [2] [3] over two million doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been administered by the end of May 2021 -over 300 million of these just in the United States. As with any medical intervention, it is indispensible for public confidence that any potential risks be identified and corrected early. Adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) have been documented in the context of every known vaccine, and are mostly benign (such as pyrexia, transient nonspecific malaise and injection site discomfort). In the context of the COVID-19 vaccines, identifying particular clinically significant safety signals is made more difficult by the scale of the pandemic. The logistics of active surveillance within a pandemic are daunting at best, limiting us primarily to deriving insights from passive surveillance.",

            "text": "In passive surveillance of AEFIs, persons who experience AEFIs volunteer information about their experience. In the United States, the leading system for this purpose is VAERS, jointly maintained by the CDC and the FDA. Passive surveillance, however, suffers from both over-and underreporting: while some patients do not report their AEFIs (especially if these are mild and transient), many who report various ailments do so regardless of a determination of causality. VAERS was intentionally designed to be 'over-inclusive': anyone can submit reports, and there is no requirement for evidence to claim a particular AEFI. Moreover, the structure of VAERS allows for a wide range of information to be included as 'symptoms', including tests carried out and tests with normal results. There is also an inherent awareness bias: patients with more severe AEFIs are more likely to make an effort to report their symptoms than those experiencing mild reactions, skewing the relative reporting rate to over-estimate the real occurrence of serious AEFIs. [4] The COVID-19 global vaccination campaign adds another layer of complexity onto a field already fraught with difficulties. Because of the sheer number of vaccines administered, even an exceedingly rare side effect may create a large enough number of affected patients. In order to address the growing concern of vaccine hesitancy, [5] [6] [7] it is crucial to analyse and present AEFIs in the context of the overall number of vaccinations. Estimating risks using appropriate metrics and comparing it to can play a very significant role in dispelling misinformation and supporting evidence-based decision-making by patients and physicians alike. [8, 9] This paper focuses on the early evidence from the first six months of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States, from 1 January to 28 May 2021, and concludes that the safety record of the COVID-19 vaccines appears to be solid at this time based on the available evidence from VAERS. Using a Bayesian framework for isolating potential safety signals, data submitted to VAERS is compared to other vaccines during the same time period, concluding with an evaluation of the COVID-19 vaccines' overall safety.",

            "text": "The PRR commends itself by relative mathematical simplicity and ease of implementation, but is subject to a disproportional reporting bias. In other words, the PRR does not indicate whether a certain side effect is more or less frequent compared to another, or with another drug. In particular, it does not reflect relative risk. It often eludes even trained professionals that the correct interpretation of P RR i,j is not the relative probability that a certain adverse effect will be reported with this particular drug compared with the reference drugs. Thus, a P RR anaphylaxis,j of 3.0 does not indicate that anaphylaxis is three times more likely with j than any other drug. Instead, it indicates that the probability of reporting anaphylaxis rather than any other event with j is three times higher than the probability of reporting anaphylaxis rather than any other event with other drugs. [13] A better indicator of possible safety signals is the empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) or modified DuMouchel's method. [14] Since its first publication in 1999, this method has been widely used in analysing 'market basket' type problems -that is, identifying combinations of elements on each axis that occur with unusual frequency, where a Bayesian baseline is calculated through an expectation prior. [15] [16] [17] The EBGM approach builds on the relative reporting ratio R rep (occasionally also RR), defined as Ni,j Ei,j , where N i, j is the actual number of reported instances of the adverse effect i given the drug j. One would thus expect a value of 1.0 if no association existed, i.e. if rows and columns were independent from each other. Higher values would thus increasingly militate away from the null hypothesis and towards an association between i and j.",

There is a risk that the overall much higher number of vaccines administered, and as such the higher number of reports (during the period under examination, 1,252,858 distinct symptom reports were made, with 1,242,557, or 99.18%, of these being for a COVID-19 vaccine) presents some distortion, enhancing the central tendency of data on the COVID-19 vaccine. Nonetheless, Table 1 provides a convincing comparison that attests to the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines vis-a-vis other vaccine types.",

From an analytical perspective, the disproportionate volume of COVID-19 vaccines when compared with all other vaccines poses a challenge. Typically, vaccines are administered to an age limited spectrum of the population -for instance, children typically receive their second TDaP vaccine between the ages of 4 and 6. Emergency vaccination campaigns that encompass the entire population may pose unique analytical problems. Thus, for instance, the number of reported instances of a certain AEFI may give a misleading indication of 6 .

The clinical experience so far appears to confirm this.
