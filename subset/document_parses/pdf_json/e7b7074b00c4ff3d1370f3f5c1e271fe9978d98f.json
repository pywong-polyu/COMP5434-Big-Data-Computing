This article describes developments of the CSAVR tool to more flexibly model diagnosis rates over time, estimate incidence patterns by sex and age group and by key population group. Methods: We modelled HIV diagnosis rate trends as a mixture of three factors, including temporal and opportunistic infection components. The tool was expanded to estimate incidence rate ratios by sex and age for countries with disaggregated reporting of new HIV diagnoses and AIDS deaths, and to account for information on key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM), males who inject drugs (MWID), female sex workers (FSW) and females who inject drugs (FWID). We used a Bayesian framework to calibrate the tool in 71 high-income or low-HIV burden countries. Results: Across countries, an estimated median 89% (interquartile range [IQR]: 78%-96%) of HIV-positive adults knew their status in 2019. Mean CD4 counts at diagnosis were stable over time, with a median of 456 cells/\u03bcl (IQR: 391-508) across countries in 2019. In European countries reporting new HIV diagnoses among key populations, median estimated proportions of males that are MSM and MWID was 1.3% (IQR: 0.9%-2.0%) and 0.56% (IQR: 0.51%-0.64%), respectively. The median estimated proportions of females that are FSW and FWID were 0.36% (IQR: 0.27%-0.45%) and 0.14 (IQR: 0.13%-0.15%), respectively. HIV incidence per 100 person-years increased among MSM, with median estimates reaching 0.43 (IQR: 0.29-1.73) in 2019, but remained stable in MWID, FSW and FWID, at around 0.12 (IQR: 0.04-1.9), 0.09 (IQR: 0.06-0.69) and 0.13% (IQR: 0.08%-0.91%) in 2019, respectively. Knowledge of HIV status among HIV-positive adults gradually increased since the early 1990s to exceed 75% in more than 75% of countries in 2019 among each key population. Conclusions: CSAVR offers an approach to using routine surveillance and vital registration data to estimate and project trends in both HIV incidence and knowledge of HIV status.",

The specific modelling approaches utilized depend on the type of surveillance data available and the characteristics of the HIV epidemic. In most high-and middle-income countries with relatively lowlevel HIV epidemics, the most consistently available data are reported numbers of new HIV diagnoses (recorded through case surveillance) and HIV-related deaths (recorded through vital registration). The Case Surveillance and Vital Registration (CSAVR) tool, part of the Spectrum suite, uses these data to estimate trends in new HIV infections and HIV diagnosis rates consistent with these data, accounting for HIV disease progression and impacts of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on survival [1, 4] . The model outputs estimate the number of new HIV infections, the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV), and the proportion of PLHIV who know their HIV status.",

First, diagnosis rates depended only on HIV-related mortality rates and were assumed to increase over time. Second, estimates of HIV status awareness were not stratified by sex, CD4 count, or age. These strata are important for assessing the impact of interventions to monitor the HIV epidemic. The tool estimates incidence in the age group 15-49, which Spectrum then disaggregates using incidence rate ratios by sex and age estimated from published studies [5] .

For each country, one of the four options for HIV incidence models was selected using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, the lower the better) [21, 22] . Following selection of the incidence model, the full joint posterior distribution was estimated using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm [23] starting from the mode estimated at the previous step. Uncertainty intervals for quantities of interest were obtained by sampling 1000 sets of parameter values, with 10,000 burn-in samples and discarding 14 in 15 samples.

The initial version made relatively strong assumptions regarding diagnosis trends and deaths rates and did not provide disaggregated estimates [1, 4] . The updated model allows estimating key indicators by age and sex. Furthermore, the model has also been expanded to fit data and provide estimates for key populations. However, high-quality case surveillance data, consisting of relatively long and completed time series of surveillance data, are needed for the model to provide reliable estimates.

The Shiny90 diagnosis model accounts for testing in the HIV-negative population and retesting, leveraging the national population-based surveys and HIV testing data available. This component is not incorporated in CSAVR because the model was designed for use in countries where these data are not available. Furthermore, Shiny90 builds on prior information available in the literature to model diagnosis rate as a function of both age and sex. Many countries using CSAVR do not disaggregate new diagnoses by sex in their Spectrum files. In addition, Shiny90 assumes that diagnosis rates are negligible before 1995, whereas many countries that use CSAVR reported new HIV diagnoses in earlier years.",

However, the effect of this could be minimal if the epidemic is concentrated in one group, for example. More complex relations could express incidence trends among key populations as a function of incidence in the general populations. Also, the source of infection was selfreported. This makes our estimates subject to bias, because some individuals may not disclose their behaviour or might have acquired HIV before or after they joined a key population group. Nevertheless, our size estimates are generally within the range of published estimates in Europe. For example, our overall median size of MSM is in the range 0.03%-5.6% found in Europe [14] ; similarly, our median size estimate of MWID is between 0.49% and 2.0% estimated in western and eastern Europe, respectively [10] , while our median size estimates of FWID is slightly lower than 0.2% and 0.64% estimated in western and eastern Europe, respectively [10] ; and our median size estimate of FSW is between 0.4% and 0.6% reported in western and eastern Europe, respectively. However, discrepancies between our estimates and published values occur in some countries. In fact, our approach combines available information on size estimates, HIV prevalence and new HIV diagnoses in key populations.
