Several researchers have examined and developed studies regarding concerns on air pollution being considered a major risk factor causing respiratory infections. Such infections are carried out by microorganisms, thus further affecting the immune system. The present study involves the relationship between air pollutants and the total COVID-19 infections along with the estimation of death rates in several regions of Saudi Arabia. The major goal of this study comprises the analysis of the relationship between air pollutants concentration, such as PM10, NO 2 , CO, SO 2 , and O 3 , and the widespread outbreak of COVID-19. This scenario involves the transmission, number of patients, critical cases, and death rates. Results show that the estimation of recorded COVID-19 cases was in the most polluted regions; the mortality rate and critical cases were also more distinct in these regions than in other regions in Saudi Arabia. The finding of this study demonstrates a positive correlation between the mean values of PM10, NO 2 , CO, and SO 2 pollutants. The results represent the significant relationship between air pollution resulting from a high concentration of NO 2 and COVID-19 infections and deaths. In addition, a null hypothesis of the relation between other pollutants and COVID-19 infections cannot be rejected. The study also indicates a significant correlation between the means of NO 2 and CO and the total number of critical cases. Negative correlations are obtained between the mean of O 3 and the total number of cases, total deaths, and critical case per cumulative days.",

It affected almost 70,000 individuals and caused the deaths of more than 1,800 people within 50 days before the crisis was declared a pandemic. The novel coronavirus has affected 183,934,913 people and deaths of 3,985,022 people around the world as of 6 July 2021, and the figures are still rising. This situation has revealed that the transmission rate of the virus is much higher due to the occurrence of a genetic combination that has enhanced its transmission ability.",

Some of the research studies revealed that the initial infected individuals consumed seafood; however, studies also found that some of the infected individuals did not consume any seafood. These observations proved the spreading capability of the virus among human beings, which has affected almost the whole world at exponential rates. Hence, the severity of the disease has been considered high. The high transmission rates are due to the close contact of one person with an infected person; transmission can occur through coughing, respiratory droplets, and aerosols. These aerosols have the capability of penetrating into the human body, mainly affecting the lungs by inhaling through the nose or the mouth (Phan et al. 2020; Riou and Althaus 2020; Parry 2020; Li et al. 2020) .",

Another study analyzed the involvement of PM10 emerging from an industrial site of Bergamo Province, which has been considered the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy (Setti et al. 2020) . The results from these sites have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has shown its presence in the PM during atmospheric stability and at higher concentrations of PM10; these findings represent the first experimental proof for COVID-19 being transmitted through PM (Distante et al. 2020) . Researchers have also found that populations dwelling in regions with high concentrations of air pollutants are prone to developing chronic respiratory infections and are more sensitive to infectious agents. Moreover, exposure to air pollution for longer durations results in chronic inflammatory stimulus among young and healthy individuals (Conticini et al. 2020) .

ANG II is converted by ACE-2 to other molecules that mitigate its effects. ANG II can exacerbate inflammation and kill cells in the alveoli, which are essential for the body to take in oxygen; ACE-2 can counteract the debilitating effects of ANG II.

In COVID-19 patients, this \"reduced braking\" likely leads to injury, especially to the lungs and heart.

Table 3 shows the population density and percentage of the elderly population in the different geographical areas in Saudi Arabia. It also includes the distribution of COVID-19 cases in each region in terms of the total number of cases, deaths, and critical cases per 100,000 people. Table 3 shows that the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths was detected in the four most polluted regions in Saudi Arabia. However, no clear relationship between the population density and the severity of the epidemic could be inferred. For example, the highest number of total COVID-19 infections, as well as critical cases per 100,000 people, was monitored in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. The same table shows that the population density in the Eastern Region ranks eighth out of the Kingdom's 13 regions. Thus, the population density factor has a weak impact on the spread and severity of COVID-19. This finding is in agreement with the findings of several studies, some of which found that the rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths are not related to population density (Carozzi et al. 2020; Hamidi et al. 2020) . Other studies indicated a moderate association between the spread of COVID-19 and population density (Bhadra et al. 2021) . Another findings reported that air pollution could be worsen in the highly populated regions (Shen et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021) , and therefore air pollution control measures must be adopted in those regions to counteract air pollution.",

Such density is due to the increase in the rates of migration from rural to urban areas, which have witnessed a significant increase in recent years, and also due to urban areas becoming an important center for industrial and commercial activities. This situation is often accompanied by strong emissions from household activities (e.g., cooking, heating, and smoking) and local transportations. Furthermore, traffic congestion produced by human urbanization has made the complete combustion of vehicle gasoline difficult. Consequently, the levels of the ambient air pollution have increased tremendously.",

It also serves as Saudi Arabia's main oil production center. This study showed that the highest level of CO concentration was detected in the Eastern Region. The increased concentrations of CO pollutants in this area could be attributed to a diverse range of industrial activities that produce varying emission rates (Anil and Alagha, 2021) . COVID-19 cases and casualties had more CO in their arteries and veins than uninfected healthy people, thus making them more vulnerable to infections and complications. Although the increased concentration of NO 2 in the ambient air was associated with a remarkable increase of COVID-19 infections, deaths, and severity, CO was more associated with COVID-19 severity than NO 2 . The highest concentration of CO was observed in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia, which was equal to 1.67 ppm; this concentration was associated with 815 critical cases, which constitute about 43% of the total critical cases in all regions. Population density and the percentage of the elderly population could be possible reasons for the noticeable increase in the total number of infections and critical cases per 100,000 people in Asir. Given that the impact of air pollution was insignificant in this region, other possible factors should be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion.",

The correlation of air pollution with the COVID-19 pandemic has been presented, as respiratory diseases are among the major outcomes of COVID-19. In addition, COVID-19 tends to affect the respiratory system in humans; individuals that have been exposed to air pollutants are more prone to becoming infected. Hence, to show its relevancy, the present study explores the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the total COVID-19-related infection and death rates in Saudi Arabian regions. The relationship between air pollutant concentration (PM10, NO 2 , CO, SO 2 , and O 3 ) and COVID-19 transmissions, patients, critical cases, and deaths has been analyzed in this study. The highest number of COVID-19 cases has been recorded in the most polluted regions, and the mortality rates and critical cases have been found to be more distinct in these regions than other regions in Saudi Arabia. Hence, a positive correlation among the mean values of PM10, NO 2 , CO, and SO 2 pollutants is obtained, thus showing a significant relationship between air pollution resulting from a high concentration of NO 2 and COVID-19 infections and deaths. Regions with intensive industrial activities have more CO emissions, thus leading to an increase in critical COVID-19 cases.",
