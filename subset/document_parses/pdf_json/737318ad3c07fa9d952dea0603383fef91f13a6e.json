[2] [3] [4] Studies of patients infected during the SARS pandemic of 2003 suggest that antibody response from infection persists over 2 years. 5 In contrast, infection with common seasonal strains of human coronavirus does not confer lasting protection against reinfection, although reinfection within 6 months is uncommon. 6 There are now several vaccines that have been licensed in various countries. Vaccine efficacy ranges from 62% to 95%. 7, 8 Due to shortages in vaccine supply, almost all countries have created prioritization schemes to ensure that those at highest risk from the virus (i.e. elderly patients and those with co-morbidities) and front-line healthcare workers receive the vaccine first. But demand remains high and additional strategies, such as administering only one dose of the twodose regimen, have been proposed. 9, 10 Given the widespread nature of the pandemic and the lack of available testing, it is likely that a substantial portion of the population has already been infected with COVID-19. If such infection offered long-term protection, then vaccination of previously infected persons could be delayed until there is sufficient supply to vaccinate the entire population. Unfortunately, information on the long-term immunity conferred by infection with SARS-CoV-2 is scant. Current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines make no exceptions for persons with prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 11 However, if infection provides substantial long-lasting immunity, it may be .

It is possible that patients were tested for COVID-19 outside the health system, especially if they were asymptomatic, since Cleveland Clinic does not test asymptomatic patients unless they were admitted to hospital or undergoing a procedure/surgery. This would result in an underestimate of the reinfection rate. However, there is no reason to suspect that previously positive patients would be more likely to be retested outside the system than would previously negative patients, which is one reason we included the comparison group. Repeat positive tests could have represented persistent shedding, in which case our estimates of protective effectiveness against true reinfection are too low. Further studies are needed to determine if other SARS-CoV-2 lineages, such as those found in Brazil, South Africa and the United Kingdom, are susceptible to immunity generated from previous infection or vaccination.",

After at least 90 days, 974 (11%) of the positive patients were retested and 57 (5.9%) were reviewed for possible reinfection. One patient had an immediate negative test and was excluded due to a presumed false positive test. Of the 56 reinfections, 26 were symptomatic-shortness of breath was the most common symptom, and interestingly, no patient lost the sense of smell (Figure 1). Seventeen symptomatic patients were hospitalized within 30 days of the positive test, 5 with symptoms considered possibly related to COVID-19. Of those 5, none required intensive care or needed mechanical ventilation. Many reinfections occurred close to 90 days after initial infection, and average time to reinfection was 131.4 \u00b1 40.4 days (range 90.2 -269.0 days) (Figure 2). Of those with negative initial tests, 22.8% (32,208/141,480) were retested and 4,163 (12.9%) were positive; 1703 (40.9%) positive tests were performed for pre-procedural screening or had an asymptomatic indication.
