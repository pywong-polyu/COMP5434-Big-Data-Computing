The main focus of this paper is to investigate the effect of polynomial trajectories on the vibration of the cable-suspended payload and to show which polynomial trajectory results in less vibration. A mathematical analysis and a parametric study were carried out to investigate the effect of the degree of the polynomial trajectory on its kinematic behavior. A conjecture relates the degree of the polynomial trajectory and its kinematic behavior to the corresponding payload vibration was introduced. The base excitation model of vibratory systems was proposed as the model of the transportation system of interest. The vibration analysis of both the transportation system and the polynomial trajectories was conducted analytically to show which polynomial trajectory has the least payload vibration. A second stage of payload vibration reduction was provided by introducing a method to reduce the transmitted vibration from the quadrotor to the payload for any quadrotor trajectory. A roadmap to design the transportation task that can reduce the payload vibration was proposed. Both the simulation and the experimental results were presented, discussed and analyzed to verify the findings of this paper.",

            "text": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered to be one of the revolutionary inventions. They changed, and will change, our lifestyle as they have a wide range of applications that varies from military applications to even entertainment and children toys. One of these important applications is using the UAVs in transportation, e.g., package delivery [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In these publications, many advantages can be found; however, it becomes more vital in pandemic times, such as COVID-19, since it provides a means for contactless delivery. Generally speaking, the transportation task using a UAV can be categorized into two main categories: grasped payload transportation and cable-suspended payload transportation [7, 8] . For the grasped payload transportation method, the payload is rigidly attached to the UAV. The resultant system can be treated, dynamically, as a new UAV with a larger mass, different dimensions, and a new center of mass [7] [8] [9] [10] . As for the second transportation method, which grasped our attention, the payload is attached to the UAV through a cable, or cables. In contrast with the grasped payload method, the cable-suspended payload method adds underactuated degrees of freedom (DoFs) to the dynamics model, which makes the dynamics of the transportation system more complex. Additionally, the vibration of the cablesuspended payload is a big challenge that requires a lot of effort to resolve [8] . In addition to the danger of carrying a vibrating payload, the vibration may add some excessive force components and moments to the system, which can lead to undesired motions.",

            "text": "This paper focuses on designing trajectories that can reduce the payload vibration during transportation. In [18] , a dynamic programming approach was used to generate a trajectory that is swing-free. In [19] , an online trajectory generation approach was used to design an acceleration trajectory, which eliminated the payload vibration. In [20] , the authors used the framework of optimal control to generate trajectories for different tasks. The differential flatness of the quadrotor was used in trajectory generation in [21] [22] [23] . In [21] , the authors found that part of the attitude control inputs are functions of the snap, i.e., the 4th time derivative of the position. Consequently, they designed a trajectory that minimized the snap assuming that this may minimize the control input. This approach was extended in [24] to consider the collision avoidance in cluttered environments. In [25] , a polynomial trajectory that minimized the pop, i.e., the 6th time derivative of the position, was generated. A minimum time trajectory was designed, while considering reducing the swing motion in [26] . In [27] , a real-time predictive control trajectory considering the shortest route with reduced payload vibration and obstacle avoidance was proposed. Reinforcement learning was applied to generate trajectories that reduce the cable vibration in [28, 29] . In [30] , the trajectory tracking problem for quadcopters was discussed considering the external disturbances and less sensors. In [31] , an optimal model-free back stepping controller has been developed for the quadcopter. Implementing this control approach with a cuckoo search algorithm dealt with the uncertainties of the system dynamics and the external disturbances. A very similar dynamics system is the gantry crane. One of the popular ways to reduce the residual payload vibration is to apply the input shaping techniques, which was used in quadrotors in [4] and in gantry cranes in [32, 33] .",

The payload is attached to the quadrotor through a cable of length l. The magnitudes of the propellers' thrusts in the direction of Z B are f 1 , f 2 , f 3 and f 4 at the center of mass of each propeller, respectively. The resultant of these four thrusts is the total thrust Q in the direction of Z B at the centroid of the quadrotor. Throughout this paper, a point mass payload has been assumed. The center of mass of the quadrotor is the centroid of the quadrotor, and the cable is attached to this center of mass. The cable is non-deformable, non-stretchable, massless and always under tension. Although the center of mass may be either difficult to be accurately specified or not practical to attach the cable to, the assumption of attaching the cable to the center of mass is still reasonable because the offset is considerably small [38] . However, the interested readers can find the dynamics models that consider the offset between the center of mass and the attaching point in [39] and [40] .",

In the PID, there is only the position error e p . In the PIV, however, there are the position and velocity errors, e p and e v , respectively as shown in Fig. 2 .

The parametric study is designed to simulate a pick-up and drop-off transportation task. Consequently, the stationary boundary conditions are considered. The task is a 3D motion from an initial position [0, 0, 0] to a final position [1, 1, 1] and is required to be done in a total time T tot = 3 s. The parametric study considered the MJT, MST, MCT and the minimum pop trajectory (MPT). Figure 4 pictates the effect of the degree of the polynomial trajectory on the position, velocity and acceleration profiles in a 3D transportation task. Looking at the position profile in Fig. 4 , one can notice that increasing the degree of the polynomial trajectory leads the position profile to become more steep and approaches the behavior of the step function. The increase in the slope of the position profile greatly affects the velocity profile as shown in the middle graph in Fig. 4 . As the degree of the polynomial trajectory increases, the peak velocity increases and the velocity profile becomes narrower and steeper. This matches with the results of Eqs. (16) and (17) and the results in [41] . Similarly, the peak value of the acceleration increases with the increase in the degree of the polynomial trajectory, and it reaches zero at the middle of the time span, which is corresponding to the turning point in the velocity profile. It is worth mentioning that these graphs are applicable to the motion in any of the three directions, i.e., x, y or z motion. This parametric study shows that the MJT has the lowest peak velocity and acceleration, and its profiles are less steep. Based on our conjecture, the MJT may result in less vibration. However, this conjecture requires to be investigated and proven, which is conducted in Sect. 4.",

In fact, this is due to the way of defining the cable angles, \u03b1 and \u03b2, as shown in Fig. 1b. The system in Eq. (19) is neither completely linear nor completely decoupled because Eq. (18) was not linearized about the input operating point, i.e., the operating point of q Q . However, the system will be completely linear and decoupled in the states and the inputs if the quadrotor's motion is constrained to have a constant acceleration in the inertial vertical direction Z I , e.g.,z Q = 0. In such a case, the system will be a linear time-invariant (LTI) vibratory system. Equation (21) shows that the natural frequency, \u03c9 n , increases with the increase inz Q , and it is inversely proportional to the square root of the cable length, \u221a l. Figure 5a illustrates the effect of the trajectory's vertical acceleration,z Q , on the natural frequency, \u03c9 n , at different cable length, l. It is obvious that the effect ofz Q becomes less important when the cable length gets longer. Throughout this paper, the vertical acceleration will be set toz Q = 0, so Fig. 5b shows the effect of the cable length on the natural frequency for the case ofz Q = 0. Figure 5b starts from l = 0.1 m because shorter cable lengths will results in higher frequencies, which approaches infinity at l = 0 based on Eq. (21) .

(19) isq Q 1,2 , while the generalized coordinates vector, i.e., the state vector, is \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7. -Mathematically, the dynamics system in Eq. (19) can be thought of as either a forced vibratory system or a vibratory system with base excitation. In the former description, the excitation force isq Q 1,2 , while in the latter description, the base motion follows the trajectory q Q 1,2 . Although there is no mathematical difference between either description, thinking of the transportation system as a base excitation model makes more sense because, practically, the payload vibration comes from the motion of the quadrotor, which is the base in the latter description. Thus, throughout this paper, the payload vibration will be dealt with as a base excited vibration. More details about the vibratory systems with base excitation can be found, for example, in [42, 43] .",

Consequently, a deep frequency analysis of these trajectories is required to determine their frequencies, the magnitudes of these frequencies, and how related they are to the natural frequencies of the trans-portation system indicated in Eq. (21) . The frequency analysis will be done by obtaining the Fourier series of the accelerations of the trajectories, which represent the base excitation. This way, the trajectories' frequencies and their corresponding magnitudes will be obtained analytically, which allows for further rigorous analysis and comparisons between these trajectories. For the sake of conveying the fundamentals and the logic of the vibration analysis of the polynomial trajectories without getting the readers involved in unnecessary complex mathematics, the very common transportation task with stationary boundary conditions is considered. In other words, the considered transportation task is between two points, where it starts from rest and ends at rest. This implies that all the boundary conditions of the position time derivatives in the specifications vector S are set to zero. Without loss of generality, the initial time and position are set to zero, i.e., t 0 = 0 and x 0 = 0. The main equations in this subsection are presented under general boundary conditions in Appendix 1. From there, it is found that the polynomial trajectories show similar vibration behavior under any arbitrary boundary conditions. The Fourier series of a general function, f (t), which is periodic over the period \u03b4 can be found as an infinite sum of sines and cosines as follows [44] ",

It is obvious that due to the stationary boundary conditions, Eq.

Consequently, the range of the x-axis in the error graphs, i.e., Fig. 7d-f , is modified to start at t 0 = 0.1 s, and ends at t f = 0.9 s to avoid the infinite or undefined values at the beginning and the end of the motion. Obviously, x 1\u21924 is a good approximation of\u1e8d. The main conclusion from Eqs.

The transmissibility ratio, T R, is defined as the ratio between the transmitted vibration to the suspended payload and the base excitation [42, 43] . It is worth mentioning that the concept of the transmissibility ratio is presented, in most cases in literature, as a dimensionless scalar quantity, T R. This is because in most cases the concept of the transmissibility ratio is presented for single DoF systems with the same dimensions and units for both the excitation and the response, e.g., distances in meter [42, 43] . Recall that the transportation system of interest in this paper is not a single DoF system. Additionally, the excitation and the response have different dimensions and units, i.e.,q Q 1,2 in m/s 2 is the excitation and \u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7 in rad is the response. Consequently, the transmissibility ratio is extended in this paper to consider multiple DoFs systems; therefore, it will be a matrix, TR, with units of rad\u00b7s 2 /m. The extended transmissibility ratio matrix, TR, is derived by extending the procedure in [42] . The subscripts 1 and 2 in the definition of the matrices in Eq.

(32) is more suitable for the considered application because it relates the amplitudes of the quadrotor's trajectory to the cable angles straightforwardly. Considering the transportation system of interest, where there is no viscous damping, Fig. 8 is the graphical representation of Eq. (32), which can be used to specify the frequency ratio required to achieve a desired transmissibility ratio. It shows that if the system is close to the resonance, i.e., 0.95 \u2264 r \u2264 1.05, the transmissibility ratio, T R, will be more than 1, which means that the transmitted vibration is more than the excitation. However, it is guaranteed to get T R < 1 g , which is T R < 0.1 rad\u00b7s 2 /m, if r > 1.421, which means r > \u221a 2. In two DoFs, this can be expressed as the transmissibility matrix is guaranteed to satisfy TR < 0.1I rad\u00b7s 2 /m, if",

(34) is acceptable. Second, practically, it may not be allowed to freely choose both l and \u03b4. For example, the transportation system may be constrained with a certain cable length l or certain range of l, which means that it is not allowed to choose l freely. On the other hand, the transportation task may be required to be completed in a certain amount of time, which means that \u03b4 is constrained and cannot be chosen freely. Consequently, it is important to investigate the cases, in which, only one of the two parameters, l and \u03b4, can be changed freely. Third, for a certain transportation system, there is only one cable with a certain cable length, so l 1 and l 2 must be equal. Consequently, there is a need to find a way to choose if Eq. (34) results in different values of l 1 and l 2 . The same concept is applied to the flight times \u03b4 1 and \u03b4 2 . Fourth, the trajectory is represented as an infinite sum of linear combinations of sines and cosines based on Eq. (24), so changing k in Eq. (34) has a great effect on the way we choose l and \u03b4, since their values will change at each time k changes.",

Third, in case of two different values of l 1 and l 2 , or \u03b4 1 and \u03b4 2 , it is important to propose a method to choose which value should be used. The key point here is to rearrange Eq.

            "text": "g are all constants. Therefore, in Eq. (35) the flight time and frequency ratio are constrained, i.e., \u03b4 and r are given. On the other hand, in Eq. (36) the cable length and frequency ratio are constrained, i.e., l and r are given. From Eq. (35) , it is obvious that specifying l using k = 1 guarantees that this l satisfies the transmissibility requirements for all k. Similarly, from Eq. (36), the value of \u03b4 at k = 1 guarantees that this \u03b4 satisfies the transmissibility requirements for all k. If it happened that l 1 = l 2 , the largest of them should be chosen as it satisfies the transmissibility requirements for both DoFs. Similarly, if it happened that \u03b4 1 = \u03b4 2 , the smallest of them should be chosen. It is worth noting that based on Eq. (29), decreasing \u03b4 leads to increasing the amplitude, b k , which leads to more vibration. So, it is important to emphasize the difference between the effect of the amplitude, b k , and the transmissibility ratio, TR. The amplitude, b k , is the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave itself. This means that increasing this amplitude will increase the base vibration, i.e., the vibration of the quadrotor's trajectory. The transmissibility, TR, however, indicates how much of the base vibration will transfer to the suspended payload, regardless of the amount of the base vibration itself. It is also important to notice that \u03b4, in Eq. (29) , is squared, while it is just \u03b4 in Eq. (31) . This means that decreasing \u03b4 is not a suggested method to reduce the vibration since the effect of increasing the amplitude, b k , will be more than the effect of decreasing the transmissibility, TR, which will lead, in most cases, to more payload vibrations.",

            "text": "At the end of this discussion, it is important to sum up some points. First, the transportation task can be designed so that it can satisfy the vibration level requirements. To achieve that, a clear and straightforward design method was proposed and explained. The flowchart in Fig. 9 summarizes this transportation task design process. Second, if the trajectory flight time, \u03b4, is not specified as a requirement, Eq. (29) can be used to determine \u03b4 that can achieve certain amplitude b k . Third, it is possible to achieve a two-stage vibration reduction. The first stage is achieved by choosing the MJT as a desired trajectory. The second stage can be achieved, if possible, by decreasing the transmissibility ratio. The best way to decrease the transmissibility ratio is by changing the cable length, l, not the trajectory flight time \u03b4. Fourth, although the analysis in Sect. 4.2 Fig. 9 The transportation task design process have been conducted for a 1D trajectory, the results are still applicable to any 3D trajectory, which has a constant vertical accelerationz Q . This is because the analysis in Sect. 4.1 showed that the system has a unit modal matrix, which means that the vibratory dynamics model in Eq. (19) is decoupled. For the sake of accuracy, it is worth mentioning that the transmissibility ratio calculations depend on the linearized dynamics model in Eq. (19) , so if the cable angles are large enough and the dynamics goes into the nonlinear range, the transmissibility calculations will not be as accurate as it is when the cable angles are small.",

This means assuming zero initial condition at each way point, i.e., zero cable angles and zero cable angles rates. Contrarily, in the actual case, each trajectory segment starts with a nonzero initial conditions, which are equal to the actual final conditions of the previous segment because the suspended payload reaches the intermediate waypoints with oscillations, i.e., nonzero cable angles and angle rates. Figure 14 shows the cable angles and the cable angles' rates at each of the intermediate waypoints, i.e., t = {3.5, 7, 10.5} second, which are indicated by the vertical dashed lines.

After reducing the payload vibration by designing a MJT, the transmissibility ratio can be used to provide a second stage of vibration reduction. In our case, Fig. 8 and Eq. (32) Fig. 13 The simulation results of the cable angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 (fivepoint trajectory, l = 1 m) tell that it is possible to reduce the suspended payload vibration level by reducing the transmissibility ratio, TR, through two different methods. The first method is by reducing the frequency ratio, R, to be less than diag(0.5015, 0.5015) in case of the two-point trajectory, and less than diag(0.5732, 0.5732) in case of the five-point trajectory. Alternatively, the payload vibration level can be reduced by increasing the frequency ratio, R, to be more than diag(1.3223, 1.3223) in case of the two-point trajectory, and more than diag(1.2929, 1.2929) in case of the five-point trajectory. In this paper, we would like to demonstrate the case where TR < 0.1I rad\u00b7s 2 /m, so R > diag( \u221a 2, \u221a 2) is considered for both trajectories. As discussed in Sect. 4.3, the selected method to achieve that is to change the cable length. Consequently, there are two different ways to provide a second stage of vibration reduction. For the two-point trajectory, these two ways are either l < 1 m or l > 7.95 m, while for the five-point trajectories, the two ways are either l < 1 m Table 2 . Due to the space limitations, the experiments for the long cable case cannot be conducted, so only the simulation results are included for the long cable case.",

These experimental results confirm that the MJT results in the lowest payload vibration compared to the rest of the polynomial trajectories. Table 3 confirms the same conclusion with numbers; however, the experimental results are not as close to the calculated results as the simulation results. One of the main reasons is that the calculated results are based on the linearized dynamics model, which is not the actual case, especially for large angles, e.g., the MCT. Additionally, a deeper look at the results shows that the larger angles in the experimental results are near the end of the motion, whereas in the rest of the motion the cable angles are almost similar to the calculated cable angles. This is mainly due to the inertia of the system and actual control commands. Near the end of the motion, the quadrotor has to change its attitude aggressively to stop, which leads to this larger angles near the end of the motion. This can be noticed obviously in the experimental results near 4 seconds and in the test videos at https://youtu.be/6umbq97AK00. This may be improved by improving the controller; however, this is not the objective of this paper. The main conclusion is that it is validated experimentally that the MJT results in the lowest payload vibration among the rest of the polynomial trajectories regardless of the quality of the controller.",

It investigates the effect of the polynomial trajectories on the suspended payload vibration and provides a method to design a polynomial trajectory that can reduce the suspended payload vibration. The vibration analysis of the transportation system and the polynomial trajectories showed that the MJT results in the lowest payload vibration compared to the rest of the polynomial trajectories. A second stage of payload vibration reduction was provided by applying the concept of the transmissibility ratio to reduce the transmitted vibration from the quadrotor to the payload regardless the vibration level of the quadrotor itself. The proposed approach depends on the inherent features of the MJTs to reduce the payload vibration for any certain controller and path regardless the type of the controller and/or the geom-etry of the path themselves. Two different trajectories were considered in this paper: a two-point planar trajectory and a multi-segment five-point 3D trajectory with sharp corners. Both the simulation and the experimental results of these two trajectories were discussed. It was verified that the MJT has the lowest payload vibration among the rest of the polynomial trajectories, and the transmissibility ratio can be used to provide a second stage of payload vibration reduction. Investigating the effect of the offset between the center of mass of the quadrotor and the attaching point on the payload vibration is a topic for future exploration.",
