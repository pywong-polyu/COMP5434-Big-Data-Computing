During the emergency state declared in Portugal in the months of March and April 2020, there was a severe reduction in medical activity in order to reduce the pressure on health systems. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology departments across Portugal and the strategies developed to overcome this challenge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on an online survey. A detailed questionnaire concerning different aspects of gastroenterology department activity was sent via e-mail to the heads of gastroenterology departments of Portuguese District Hospitals (N\u00facleo de Gastroenterologia dos Hospitais Distritais). Two periods were assessed, i.e., the emergency state and the recovery period between May and September. The responses were collected between September and October 2020.

Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o impacto da COV-ID-19 nos Servi\u00e7os de Gastroenterologia portugueses e as estrat\u00e9gias implementadas para fazer face a este desafio. M\u00e9todos: Tratou-se de um estudo transversal baseado num inqu\u00e9rito online. Um question\u00e1rio pormenorizado acerca de diferentes aspetos da atividade dum Servi\u00e7o de Gastroenterologia foi enviado por email para os Diretores de Servi\u00e7o de Gastroenterologia dos Hospitais Distritais. Foram avaliados dois per\u00edodos: o estado de emerg\u00eancia e o per\u00edodo de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o entre maio e setembro. Foram registadas as respostas entre setembro e outubro 2020. Resultados: Responderam 21 Hospitais (taxa de resposta: 80,8%). Vinte e oito porcento dos inquiridos tiveram profissionais da sua unidade infectados com COVID-19. Pelo menos um elemento foi mobilizado para outro local de trabalho em 66,7% dos hospitais, maioritariamente internos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica de Gastroenterologia.

Relativamente ao per\u00edodo de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o, os procedimentos n\u00e3o urgentes foram retomados na maioria dos centros. O mesmo se verificou para o programa de rastreio do cancro colorectal. Salienta-se que 81% dos inquiridos confirmaram que adiaram exames a pedido dos doentes por \"medo de ficarem infetados\". Mantiveram-se consultas n\u00e3opresenciais em 81% dos Hospitais. De modo geral, as atividades de forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos internos foram progressivamente retomadas. Discuss\u00e3o/Conclus\u00e3o: Este estudo oferece o retrato do impacto e consequ\u00eancias da primeira vaga da pandemia nos Hospitais portugueses. \u00c9 importante compreender como os Servi\u00e7os de Gastrenterologia nacionais lidaram com o primeiro impacto da COVID-19 e que estrat\u00e9gias foram implementadas de forma a melhor preparar o que se segue.",

At least 1 member (mostly fellows) of the department was deployed to another workplace in 66.7% of the hospitals. During the emergency state, 47.6% of the hospitals only performed urgent/emergent endoscopic procedures. In 38.5% of the hospitals the need to ration personal protective equipment led to the suspension of endoscopic training. Regarding the recovery period, nonurgent procedures were restarted in almost all of the centers. The same was reported for the colorectal cancer screening program. Remarkably, 81% of the responders confirmed that they had postponed procedures at patients' request for \"fear of getting infected.\" Remote consultation was maintained in 81% of the hospitals. Globally, the fellows had resumed their training. Discussion/Conclusion: This study provides a snapshot of the impact and consequences of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic across Portuguese hospitals.

In fact, endoscopic practice has suffered tremendously, especially in the most severely hit areas. Reports from New York mention an 80-90% procedural volume reduction [7] . In addition to the health hazard, human and logistics resources reallocation in the midst of the pandemic led to this endoscopic \"lockdown.\" Indeed, both international and national recommendations [8, 9] advised postponement of elective, nonurgent procedures in the beginning of the pandemic due to a high risk of infection for both patients and healthcare professionals. Consequently, almost half of the study's responders only performed emergent/urgent endoscopies during the emergency state. These necessary restrictions imposed by the new coronavirus are expected to have dire consequences. The reduction in endoscopically detected cancers was reported to be around 58% [10] . Moreover, in a predictive model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis on cancer survival, a 15% increase in the 5-year mortality rate was calculated for 6 DOI: 10.1159/000516019 colorectal cancer and a 6% increase was found for esophageal cancer [11] . Analysis of the recovery period revealed that the majority of hospitals were yet able to achieve a normal procedure volume. On the other hand, almost all of the centers participating in a colorectal cancer screening program had resumed this activity. This delay is likewise expected to have consequences, as it has been determined that performing colonoscopy more than 6 months after a fecal immunochemical test is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer diagnosis and in a more advanced stage [12] . Finally, it is important to emphasize that a gastroenterologist was infected only in 1 hospital. This could indicate that endoscopic activity is safe when all of the necessary precautions are taken.",

Since the start of the pandemic, we have witnessed a remarkable increase in this model of care [15] . It proved to be a valuable tool to keep healthcare providers in contact with their patients while avoiding the risk of infection. Recent studies assessing patients' perspectives have reported high acceptability and satisfaction rates for this model [16, 17] . However, it might not be appropriate for certain patients and specific situations, which require individual adaptations. Not all elderly patients will adjust to this approach due to sensory or cognitive impediments [18] , and remote consultation cannot be an option when physical examination or direct patient contact is required. Thus, 71% of hospitals maintained some face-to-face consultations even in the emergency state. Nevertheless, there is a general feeling, which is mirrored in our study, that telemedicine will persist in the future and have an important role in gastrointestinal practice [19] .",

There is general concern regarding gastroenterology training around the world. In a large international survey, comprising more than 700 trainees, 93.8% of respondents reported a reduction in endoscopy case volume [20] . In a US study, 64% of fellows felt that endoscopic restrictions will impact endoscopic skills at the end of training [21] . Alas, external fellowships at different institutions, which are a much expected and valuable experience, were enduringly affected by the pandemic. Lastly, praise is due to the gastroenterology fellows who, as stated in our paper, were frequently deployed to the front line, putting aside their training to contribute to dealing with the public health threat.",
