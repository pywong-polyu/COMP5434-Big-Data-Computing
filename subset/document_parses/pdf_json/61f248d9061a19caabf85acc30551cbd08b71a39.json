            "text": "occurred in the United Kingdom. Here we present the first large-scale 27 serological survey of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in dogs and cats in the UK. Results 28 are reported for 688 sera (454 canine, 234 feline) collected by a large veterinary diagnostic 29 laboratory for routine haematology during three time periods; pre-COVID-19 (January 30 2020), during the first wave of UK human infections (April-May 2020) and during the second 31 wave of UK human infections (September 2020-February 2021). Both pre-COVID-19 sera 32 and those from the first wave tested negative. However, in sera collected during the second 33 wave, 1.4% (n=4) of dogs and 2.2% (n=2) of cats tested positive for neutralising antibodies. 34The low numbers of animals testing positive suggests pet animals are unlikely to be a major 35 reservoir for human infection in the UK. However, continued surveillance of in-contact 36 susceptible animals should be performed as part of ongoing population health the UK[11]. Evidence of infection of cats and dogs has also been provided by 52 the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in several studies worldwide[12][13][14][15][16][17]. 53 Experimental infections have shown that cats and, to a lesser extent, dogs are susceptible to 54 SARS-CoV-2 and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats [18-20]. Infections in 55 companion animals appear to have occurred as a result of human-to-animal transmission; 56 however, the reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from farmed mink to in-contact humans, 57 cats and dogs [21, 22] and the detection of the virus in stray dogs and cats [23, 24], suggest 58it is important to continue surveillance in companion animals. Here we conducted a survey 59 of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in cats and dogs attending UK veterinary practices. feline sera used in this study were obtained from the UK Virtual Biobank, which 64 uses health data from commercial diagnostic laboratories participating in the Small Animal 65Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET) to target left over diagnostic samples in the 66 same laboratories for enhanced phenotypic and genomic analyses[25]. All samples were 67 residual sera remaining after routine diagnostic testing and were sent by one contributing 68 laboratory based on convenience within the following parameters: samples were requested 69 from UK cats and dogs collected over two time periods; March and April 2020 (during the 70 first wave in humans) for both cats and dogs, then September 2020 to February 2021 for 71 dogs, and January 2021 for cats (during the second wave in humans). Serum samples 72 controls. All samples were linked to electronic health data for that sample (species, breed, 74 sex, postcode of the submitting veterinary practice, date received by the diagnostic 75 laboratory) held in the SAVSNET database, using a unique anonymised identifier. Data on 76 SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptoms was not available. Ethical approval to collect electronic 77 health data (SAVSNET) and physical samples from participating laboratories (National Virtual 78 Biobank) was granted by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of were screened for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies using the plaque 83 reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) as previously described[15], with the SARS-CoV-84 2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020 isolate cultured in Vero E6 cells [26]. Briefly, sera 85 were heat inactivated at 56\uf0b0C for 30 mins and stored at -20\uf0b0C until use. DMEM containing 86 Studies of companion animals have shown that they can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [2]. In 121 the UK, there have been sporadic reports of infection in cats and dogs, including one that 122 tested 387 cats showing respiratory signs using RT-PCR and found one cat to be positive for 123 the virus [11, 29]. However, there has been no large scale sero-survey of infection. Here we 124 show that a small proportion of UK dogs and cats, sampled at a time of active human 125 transmission, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. 126 127 Sera from two time points during the pandemic were analysed. Sera collected during March 128 and April 2020 (first wave) from both cats and dogs were negative for neutralising 129 antibodies. Previous studies using European samples have shown a low level of infection, 130 highest in Italy, where 3.3% (15/451) of dog sera and 5.8% (11/191) cat sera collected 131 between March and May 2020 had measurable neutralising antibody titres [15]. These 132 samples were purposefully collected from regions of Italy with a high prevalence of infection 133 in humans, in some cases from households known to contain recently diagnosed human 134 cases. Our results in contrast, are more consistent with a survey from a similar population of 135 cats in Germany, that found 0/221 samples collected in April and May of 2020 to be positive 136 for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA [13], and with a survey in the Netherlands in 137 April-May 2020, that found 0.4% of cats and 0.2% of dogs to be seropositive [30]. The lack of 138 positive samples from March-April 2020 in the UK, that we report here, likely reflects the 139 selection criteria of the animals assayed (undergoing routine haematological testing and not 140 selected based on location), and the relatively low rate of human disease at the in January 2021. This is again broadly in line with a recent German survey 147 conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, showing a seroprevalence of 1.36% 148 (increased from 0.69% earlier in the pandemic), that the authors concluded corresponded 149 with the rise of reported cases in the human population, and was suggestive of ongoing 150 transmission from owners to their cats [14]. The detection of neutralising antibodies in dogs 151 and cats during the second wave in this study also likely reflects the increased numbers of 152 humans that had been infected. However, it is unknown whether the main variant 153 circulating in the UK human population during the second wave (B.1.1.7) has altered 154 transmissibility to cats and dogs as it does in humans [31]. Whilst there is some work in 155 model species testing new variants in e.g. hamsters [32, 33], to our knowledge none of the 156 early experimental infections performed in cats and dogs using the original SARS-CoV-2 157 have been repeated with newer variants. 158 159 Cats and dogs can be infected with other coronaviruses, leading to the possibility that SARS-160 CoV-2 neutralising antibodies detected in this study may result from previous infection with 161 a different virus. We and others have previously demonstrated a lack of cross-reactivity 162 between SARS-CoV-2 and samples containing antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine 163 enteric coronavirus (CeCoV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) [13, 15-17]. The 164 reverse has also been demonstrated whereby cat or dog samples containing antibodies to 165 SARS-CoV-2 did not react with known feline or canine coronavirus antigens [13, 34]. Here 166 we also tested samples from UK cats and dogs collected before the human index case in the 167 serological survey in the Netherlands testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 171 antibodies also found 71% of cat and 40% of dog pandemic sera to have antibodies to other 172 known cat or dog coronaviruses [30]. If cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with antibodies to cat 173 and dog coronaviruses was occurring in the study reported here, this would be apparent in 174 the pre-COVID-19 samples. We would also expect to see higher numbers of animals with 175 SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in the pandemic samples, again suggesting that 176 antibodies produced following infection by endemic cat and dog coronaviruses do not cross-177 react with SARS-CoV-2. 178 179 Here we made use of samples collected from a commercial diagnostic laboratory 180 contributing data to a voluntary national surveillance scheme (SAVSNET) to efficiently test 181 for evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK cats and dogs. The major limitations of such 182 a system are the relatively sparse data available for each sample such that individual 183 animals, that are not identifiable, may have been sampled twice or have come from the 184 same household. In addition, such samples lack detailed information on the health of the 185 animals and whether they were from a COVID-19-positive household. However, acquiring 186 such samples from the UK Virtual Biobank, offers a responsive resource for studying 187 national patterns of disease in UK pets [25]. 188 189 We report here the detection of a low level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in dogs 190 and cats during the second wave of human infections in the UK. The use of a neutralisation 191 assay will not detect animals that have sero-converted but not produced neutralising 192 antibodies (such that might test positive by ELISA but not by PRNT). Indeed, other studies 193 have shown that sera positive by ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may not have 194 detectable neutralising antibodies [13, 34]. As such, our results may underestimate the 195 number of animals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. 196 197 We and others report that cats and dogs can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, likely 198 through their interactions with humans. Although animal-to-animal transmission has been 199 reported, for example on mink farms and in experimental infections [18-20, 22, 38], the 200 small numbers of companion animals testing positive in the field in the UK and elsewhere 201suggest that pets are not currently acting as a significant reservoir for infection, and that the 202 pandemic will be controlled by measures largely focussed on minimising human-to-human 203 transmission. Current UK guidance is that COVID-19 positive humans should limit contact 204 with their pets. Studies like that presented here strongly argue for continued surveillance of 205 in-contact, susceptible animal species, particularly with the emergence of new variants, 206 which will help determine whether in the future, more targeted control measures are 207 needed for pet animals, particularly in regions that are gaining control of infection in the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, the Department of 219Health or Public Health England.
