The \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 is the technical term which was used by the German government to describe nationwide shutdown measures to control the rising infection numbers. These measures included mainly contact restrictions on several level. This study investigates which effects locally dispersed pre-and post-\u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 measures had on the infection dynamics. We analyzed the variability and strength of the rates of the changes of weekly case numbers considering different regions, age groups, and contact restrictions. Regionally diverse measures slowed the rate of weekly increase by about 50% and about 75% in regions with stronger contact restrictions. The 'Bundesnotbremse' induced a coherent reduction of infection numbers across all German federal states and age groups throughout May 2021. The coherence of the infection dynamics after the 'Bundesnotbremse' indicates that these stronger measures induced the decrease of infection numbers. The regionally diverse non-pharmaceutical interventions before could only decelerate further spreading, but not prevent it alone.",

We split the third wave into three different phases, separated by well-defined events: exponential growth during March 2021 before the Easter holidays, slowing down during the Easter period and a reduction phase after initiation of the \"Bundesnotbremse\". The linear shape of the case numbers in semi-logarithmic scaling (Fig. 1) during the rising phase visualizes exponential growth, where the different slopes correspond to different effective reproduction numbers. The data around spring break are strongly influenced by testing and reporting issues around the Easter holidays with huge reporting gaps. Hence, we considered the mean slopes between beginning and end of the Easter holidays for our analysis (Fig. 1 ). As in parallel to NPI's, by March the majority of those ones aged over 80 years were vaccinated, we focused our attention to the age groups between 35 and 79 years [5] .",

Remarkably, the daily growth rates within the Fig. 2 The mean of the daily rate of change of the 7-day incidences among all German states (bar height) was positive across all age groups prior to the \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 and negative afterwards. The low rate of the elderly reflects the immunization among this popula-tion group that was prioritized in the beginning of the German vaccination program. In the reduction phase we found less variance (thin lines, measured by standard error of the mean) across the states than in the slowing down phase characterized by various NPIs slowing down phase have been significantly higher in federal states with moderate contact regulations (red bars) compared to federal states with strong contact regulations (orange bars) (Fig. 3A, B) . This difference disappeared after the \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 where we found strong reduction of incidence independent of prior local regulations (Fig. 3C, D) . These observations are confirmed by statistical significance testing showing highly significant correspondence of hard contact regulations and slowing down of infection dynamics (Suppl. Figure 2) . We could not find any significant correspondence between the contact regulations and infection dynamics in the growth and reduction phases.

Those states with a less than five allowed contacts already at 7-day incidences per 100.000 inhabitants (* 7day/100 k) below 100 exhibited slower rates of increase (A). So did states with a stronger reduction of contacts when 100 was reached (B). During the reduction phase after the \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 we observed similar negative relative changes across all states with decreased standard error of the mean (thin lines) compared to the mean (bar heights).

The infection dynamics after the \u00b4Bun-desnotbremse\u00b4 were characterized by a steep, coherent decline. In contrast, the slowing down phase before the \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 resulting from school holidays, diverse contact restrictions during Easter period and also a changing behavior of the population showed only a slight and inhomogeneous decrease of infection spreading. As vaccination made rapid progress primarily within the age group 80 + and age group 60-79 years, the infection dynamics differences might be driven by vaccination progress. Moreover, testing strategies have been changed within the period for preschool and schoolchildren, such that data for the age groups below 14 years may be affected by changes in testing strategies, less by NPI's. Remarkably, this decline was highly significant in age groups between 15 and 59, where vaccination had minor impact within this timeframe. Within the timespan of our analysis in April and May 2021 weather has been extraordinarily cold and wet with similarly cold temperatures in April and May [11, 12] . Hence we believe that effects of seasonality did not contribute significantly to the observed nationwide decline of the infections in May compared to April 2021. Moreover, the highly significant correlation between strong contact regulations set in place locally before the \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 indicates that even the modest decrease of infection growth in slowing down phase was induced by NPI's. This effect was enforced nationwide by the \u00b4Bun-desnotbremse\u00b4 indicating a significant impact of NPI's on breaking the third infection wave throughout Germany. As coherent decrease of infection dynamics may reduce the chance for local outbreaks, the homogenization of measures by the \u00b4Bundesnotbremse\u00b4 may have contributed significantly to the successful management of the third wave in Germany.",
