In order to flatten the curve, on March 16, 2020, the Government of Bangladesh restricted the active functioning of all educational institutions and public gatherings , and on March 25, 2020, Bangladesh declared a lockdown measure suggesting stay at home (Anwar, Nasrullah, & Hosen, 2020) . To follow this procedure, citizens, as well as students, were bound to stay at home for a long period , which might have heightened the risk of developing mental health difficulties (Ravesloot et al., 2016) . The high prevalence of negative mental health issues in Bangladeshi students has already been reported in different contemporary studies (Anjum, Hossain, Sikder, Uddin, & Rahim, 2019; Hossain, Anjum, Uddin, Rahman, & Hossain, 2019; Sayeed et al., 2020) . A recent study conducted among Bangladeshi college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic has also described a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress symptoms and identified that COVID-19 like symptoms and fear of infection were two strong predictors of this high pervasiveness of mental consequences . Another study in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic found a significant correlation between negative perception and poor mental health . To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have been conducted in Bangladesh exploring the mental health of homequarantined students , though we need more evidence to describe the mental health difficulties of Bangladeshi students during this pandemic to address this research gap adequately. Additionally, very few studies have reported the perception of students towards the pandemic and the potential association with mental health difficulties. This study aimed to explore the mental health difficulties of Bangladeshi students and their perception towards the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The self-rated survey approximately took fifteen minutes, and there was no compensation for the participants. Participants were asked for their perceptions on the pandemic disrupting normal life events, health care systems, mental health, challenges in education, and concern on existing physical problems. A symptom checklist (fever, headache, dry cough, breathing difficulties, sore throat, and fatigue, etc.) within the last 14 days was used. Mental health was assessed using a validated Bangla version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) (Alim et al., 2020) , with scores measured according to previous research Wang et al., 2020a) . The DASS-21 contains 21 total self-report items distributed among three factors aimed at evaluating the negative emotion of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and stress symptoms experienced during the last week (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) . Every item score is on a Likert scale of four points ranging from zero to three, with higher scores suggesting a higher frequency or severity of the item. The total scores for depressive symptoms were categorized into normal (0-9), mild depression (10-12), moderate depression (13-20), severe depression (21-27), and extremely severe depression (28-42) Wang et al., 2020a) . The total anxiety subscale score was categorized into normal (0-6), mild anxiety (7-9), moderate anxiety (10-14), severe anxiety (15-19), and extremely severe anxiety (20-42) Wang et al., 2020a) . The total stress subscale score was categorized into normal (0-10), mild stress (11-18), moderate stress (19-26), severe stress (27-34), and extremely severe stress (35-42) Wang et al., 2020a) . The Bangla DASS-21 has proven to be a reliable and relevant test for the assessment of mental health in the Bangladeshi population (Alim et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2020; Sadiq et al., 2019) . The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for this study was 0.92 for the DASS-21, indicating acceptable internal consistency.",

Findings indicate that 57.05% of students suffered from mild to extremely severe stress levels, similar to a study among adults in Bangladesh (60%) . This finding can potentially be compared with the study by Khan et al. 2020 which reported 28.50% moderate to extremely severe stress levels among Bangladeshi students during the pandemic whereas we categorized and reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress . The study suggests that 26.66% of students reported mild to extremely severe levels of anxiety, which is lower than the Bangladeshi study (33.28% having moderate to extremely severe levels of anxiety) and higher than the China study (7.7%) (Wang et al., 2020c) , but somehow comparable to another China study (24.9%) (Cao et al., 2020) . In the study, 61.97% of students reported mild to extremely severe depressive symptoms that were higher than Bangladesh (46.92% having moderate to extremely severe depressive symptoms) and China (12.2%) (Wang et al., 2020c) . Studies suggest that students might develop mental health difficulties during public health emergencies like this, but we found fewer mental health difficulties among students in China. This might be due to the festive survey time, as the study was conducted during the Chinese biggest traditional 'Chinese New Year' festival (Wang et al., 2020c) . Disrupted educational activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic might be a reason for emerging mental health difficulties in students which can be potentially supported by necessary & adequate arrangements for online classes (Kapasia et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020) .",

This finding is contrary to an earlier study that shows a higher psychological impact for older age . This may be due to the higher COVID-19 knowledge among higher aged university students (Wang et al., 2020c) . In females, higher stress levels, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were observed, which is consistent with previous findings in Bangladeshi students . The potential explanation for female showing higher psychological impact due to the easily negatively affected nature of the female while keeping other variables constant (Elmer, Mepham, & Stadtfeld, 2020) . However, female students in all student groups were a minority group which may lead to their potentially higher vulnerability in our study. We found more anxiety and depression among the students with a lower economic status. Economic stressors have also been found to be positively associated with anxiety in Chinese college students during the epidemic (Cao et al., 2020) which calls for further research. The pandemic also affects the family economy and students might be anxious to maintain the ongoing study & associated cost. Students from the rural areas showed lower anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms and this result is in line with a Bangladeshi study among adults. This may be due to the lower affected rate in rural areas (IEDCR, 2020). We interestingly found that students from those families which had equal or less than four members showed higher anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Further investigation is required to understand the findings.",

More than half of the students assume that \"the health care system will overrun,\" and this proportion is consistent with the previous study among adults in Bangladesh . A recent study reproached that Bangladesh doesn't have the economic or systemic capacity to address COVID-19 adequately, reflecting public perceptions of Bangladesh's rudimentary healthcare systems (Islam & Siddika, 2020) .",

Which of the following do you suspect about the trajectory of COVID-19 in Bangladesh? 5. Do you think COVID-19 will have a negative impact on your education? 6. Do you think COVID-19 will have a negative impact on the mental health of those with existing health conditions? those students who have at least one COVID-19 like symptoms and this outcome is identical to the previous study in Bangladeshi students . Previous studies in China during the COVID-19 also showed that physical symptoms can affect the psychological response significantly (Wang et al., 2020b) . Bangladeshi residents with COVID-19-like symptoms are struggling to access adequate healthcare in a hospital setting. A daily newspaper has reported an increase in deaths from symptoms similar to COVID-19, likely due to too few testing facilities and the resulting hospital refusals (NEW AGE, 2020). This may be the reason for the higher psychological distress among the respondents with COVID-19 like symptoms. This finding suggests that health professionals should provide psychological support with treatment for those who have those COVID-19 like symptoms in the pandemic situation. This study is among the first few studies in Bangladesh context on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among students. This study included students from all divisions across Bangladesh. These results warrant consideration of easily accessible, low-intensity interventions to support mental health for students during and after this pandemic.",

This also limits the generalizability of the findings. This recruitment strategy may also have contributed to the skewed demographic distribution of gender, with the current sample comprised of larger proportions of male students while data from female students are scarce. Limited research on this novel topic hinders the robustness of the conclusion of the study. Additionally, anxiety, depression & stress symptoms were determined by self-reported data and subjected to response bias. The present study does not provide any qualitative information regarding preventive measures and coping strategies of the students which are warranted in future studies. No causality cannot be established due to the cross-sectional study design. In addition, some important confounding factors were overlooked such as part-time employment, physical comorbidity, pre-existing mental illnesses of the students. Lastly, all data were based on self-reported and could have been affected by memory recall of social desirability biases.",

Negative perceptions on the effect of the pandemic on life events, mental health, disruptions in education, health care system, existing physical health conditions, and COVID-19 like symptoms were significantly associated with poor mental outcomes. It is suggested that students ' mental health difficulties should be monitored carefully to provide adequate support during this ongoing pandemic. We will echo with what Khan et al. (2020) suggested, improving the delivery of low intensity psychological intervention, especially community-based, aligning with the clinical field of the health system should be the key. Additionally, educating youth on COVID-19 may improve the perception of this group to fight against a global threat in these trying times.",
