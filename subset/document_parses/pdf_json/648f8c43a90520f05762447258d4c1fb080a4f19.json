Due to the paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of various drug classes in the management of COVID-19, a definitive treatment regimen remains elusive. Therefore, optimized supportive care is the cornerstone of current clinical management [2] . Nevertheless, corticosteroids have remained an integral part of the pharmacological management of patients afflicted with a severe COVID-19 infection in the aftermath of the RECOVERY trial [3] . The guidance issued by the World Health Organization recommends the use of systemic corticosteroids only in cases of severe COVID-19, advising against the uptake of steroids in mild and moderate infection [4] . However, the recommendations against the latter were based merely on the result of a single randomized control trial [3] . While various studies have demonstrated worse clinical outcomes secondary to the use of corticosteroids, the vast majority of the results have been linked to the administration of high-dose corticosteroids for a prolonged duration [5] . At present, there is a dearth of data evaluating the efficacy of a low-dose, short-course corticosteroid regimen in the treatment of a non-severe COVID-19 infection. Some studies have posited that the early administration of low-dose, short-course corticosteroids in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases has the potential to halt the progression of the disease process and improve clinical outcomes with no added adverse effects [6, 7] .",

According to the current medical literature, steroids are effective in decreasing the overall mortality, the length of required oxygen therapy, and the mean length of hospital stay in patients infected with a severe COVID-19 infection [8] . Recent medical literature has further suggested that the short-term administration of low-dose methylprednisolone in the early stages of the disease can ameliorate the prognosis by thwarting the progression of a mild or moderate COVID-19 infection. Currently, there is anecdotal evidence regarding the uptake of steroids in the management of mild COVID-19 infections. Therefore, this retrospective cohort study aims to add to the existing literature by evaluating the early disease outcomes in patients with non-severe COVID-19 infection receiving a short course of low-dose corticosteroids in the initial stages of their infection.",

All patients included in the study were followed up until they recovered and were subsequently discharged. The patients included underwent a uniform therapeutic regimen, including azithromycin 500 mg once daily (OD), acetaminophen 500 mg BD, and cetirizine 10 mg OD. Furthermore, the patient comorbidities among the population were controlled using their routine pharmacological regimens, including antihypertensives. Within our patient population, 12 out of the 25 patients included received a short course of low-dose steroid therapy (prednisolone 5 mg QDS) for seven days while 13 patients did not receive any steroids.",

One cohort study showed that in COVID-19 and ARDS patients, methylprednisolone was associated with a lower risk of death [9] . Similarly, in Spain, methylprednisolone was shown to be associated with reduced mortality [10] . A study in Wuhan further showed that methylprednisolone reduced the duration of supplementary oxygenation by as much as six days in admitted patients [11] . Most notably, the RECOVERY trial showed that in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease, a 6 mg OD dose of dexamethasone for up to 10 days reduced the overall mortality compared to the non-steroid group (22.9% and 25.7%, respectively; p < 0.001) [12] . In general, the guidelines for treatment have vouched for the uptake of steroids only in severe disease forms and especially in intubated patients [13, 14] . Nevertheless, there is paucity of data evaluating the use of lowdose corticosteroids administered for a short duration early in the disease course to thwart the progression of a mild or moderate COVID-19 infection [13] . In contrast, some studies have warned against the use of steroids in COVID-19 early in the disease course, citing their potential immunosuppressive properties as evidenced by their use in the previous pandemics [14] . In MERS-CoV, for instance, there was delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract in patients adhering to a corticosteroid regimen [15] . Similarly, in SARS-CoV-1, hematologic viral RNA clearance was significantly lower in the steroid group, but the effect size was not quantified [16] . Therefore, the efficacy of corticosteroids in the management of non-severe COVID-19 infection remains enigmatic.",

Within the group receiving corticosteroids, the overall mortality was significantly lower, with the use of steroids portending a favorable prognosis in terms of the progression of mild and moderate COVID-19 infection. Similarly, significant differences in various laboratory parameters that correlate strongly with the severity of the disease process were noted. The CRP values in the steroid group were significantly lower at seven days when compared to the non-steroid group (14.53 mg/L and 44.43 mg/L, respectively; p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a marked reduction in the length of hospital stay within the steroid group compared to the control or the non-steroid group (14.23 days and 20.16 days, respectively; p < 0.001).",

If used in excess or in immunocompromised patients, steroids can further downregulate the immune system, thereby impairing its ability to clear the viral load effectively [17] . These immunosuppressive effects of steroids can thus render a patient more susceptible to opportunistic or superimposed infections. This is especially concerning in the context of nosocomial pathogens [17] . Therefore, a low dose of corticosteroids for seven days might confer a therapeutic advantage by curbing the progression of non-severe disease while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary and potentially life-threatening immunosuppression. While the present study analyzed data obtained from merely 25 patients, its results can be extrapolated to shed light on the clinical value that lowdose, short-course steroids hold for thwarting the progression of non-severe COVID-19 infections.",
