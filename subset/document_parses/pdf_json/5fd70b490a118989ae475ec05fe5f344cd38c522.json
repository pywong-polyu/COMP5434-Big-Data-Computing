Since an article was first published in 1996 urging the strengthening of AMR control through antimicrobial stewardship in health systems [1] , continuous efforts have been made [1, 2] . Most recently, in 2019, AMR was proposed for the first time as a specific indicator of Good Health and Wellbeing, which is Goal 3 of the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals [3] . However, lowmiddle-income countries (LMICs) with poor infection control and prevention systems are more vulnerable to the increasing threat posed by AMR [4] . The World Bank Report predicted that increasing AMR is estimated to drive an additional 28 million people to extreme poverty by 2050, mainly in LMICs [5] .",

            "text": "AMR in Nepal has significantly increased, with an increasing trend in the proportion of multidrug-resistant organisms over the past 20 years [6, 7] . In a recent study, more than 50% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates and more than 30% of some Shigella sp. and Vibrio cholerae isolates were resistant to first-line antibiotics, and many other bacterial pathogens were resistant to most first-line and some second-line antibiotics [8] . The lack of AMR control in the Nepali health systems is attributable to the rarity of bacterial confirmation and susceptibility tests, lack of well-equipped facilities [6] , and the low ratio of physicians to patients (0.17 per 1000 population) [9] . These factors may contribute to irrational antibiotic provision, which, in turn, may lead to more self-medication [6] and a high degree of dependency on informal drug dispensers [8] , exacerbating the current AMR situation in Nepal. Inappropriate prescribing patterns of HCPs have been identified as a major determinant of antimicrobial misuse in Nepal [6] ; these actions include prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics at incorrect doses, using antibiotics as a routine course of supportive care, and providing inadequate medication counselling [10] . Given that knowledge, attitudes, and skills are the main factors affecting adequate AMR control [11] , HCPs need to increase and update their knowledge and practices on an ongoing basis to keep pace with the constantly changing multisectoral factors surrounding the AMR threat. To the best of our knowledge, KAP studies on AMR targeting HCPs have rarely been conducted in Nepal. Only two KAP studies on AMR were recently conducted among university students [12] and community members [13] in Nepal. Thus, this study aimed to assess the KAP of HCPs toward AMR and the rational use of antibiotics at a tertiary level hospital in Nepal. Additionally, this study aimed to examine the differences in the KAP levels across subgroups categorized by sociodemographic and professional variables.",

Lastly, for the theme of 'AMR term familiarity', a score of 1 was given to the positive responses: \"I've heard the term and I can explain what it is\", \"I've used the term before\", and \"I use the term in everyday practice\". A score of 0 to the negative responses: \"I've never heard of it\" and \"I've heard the term but I'm not sure what it is\".",

Because the data were not normally distributed by the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney (U) test and Kruskal-Wallis test (\u03c7 2 ) were used to assess the differences between subgroups stratified by sex, age, work experience, position, and department in each domain (K, A and P). Dunn's pairwise comparisons were also used for post hoc tests with the Bonferroni adjustment. All analyses were performed using Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. Overall, nearly twice more women (70.6%) participated as men (29.4%), and half of all the respondents (50.0%) were aged between 25 and 29 years. More than half of the respondents (55.6%) had practiced for less than three years, while 47 (29.4%) had practiced for 3-5 years, and 24 (15.0%) had practiced for more than six years. The respondents included 75 (46.9%) physicians, 76 (47.5%) nurses and 9 (5.6%) pharmacists and pathologists. In total, 151 physicians and nurses were from the medical department, surgical department, anaesthesia department, emergency department, and special care unit. The medical department included internal medicine, paediatrics, and gastrointestinal endoscopy groups, while the surgical department included ear, nose, and throat, obstetrics and gynaecology, orthopaedics, surgery, and post-surgery groups. Nine pathologists and pharmacists were also included in the category of \"others\" with other physicians and nurses from the anaesthesia department, emergency department, and special care unit. Overall, the respondents showed a good level of theoretical knowledge (3.51 \u00b1 0.59), while the practical knowledge level was poor (1.35 \u00b1 1.41) ( Table 2 ). Regarding the theoretical knowledge questions, more than 95% of the respondents provided the correct answers to all questions except regarding the antibiotic combinations. In response to the practical knowledge questions concerning the current local AMR of Klebsiella pneumonia, only 8 (5%) and 48 (30%) respondents provided the correct answers for ciprofloxacin and meropenem, respectively (Table 3) . Regarding ciprofloxacin, almost half (48.8%) of the respondents underestimated, while the other half (46.3%) answered \"I do not know\", as shown in Figure 1 . The proportion of correct answers was higher for meropenem than for ciprofloxacin, although the proportion of respondents who answered, \"I don't know\" (52.5%), was still more than half. Furthermore, most of the participants answered that they had never heard of or were not sure of the practical terms related to AMR (ASP (84.4%) and antibiogram (83.2%)). The attitudes toward the severity of AMR and acceptability of AMR control were at a moderate level (Table 2) . Detailed results regarding the answers to each question are shown in Figure 2 . Of all respondents, 83.7% (134/160) considered AMR to be a serious public health issue at the national level, while 61.9% (99/160) considered it to be a serious issue at the facility level. Furthermore, only 30.5% (49/160) of the respondents agreed (combined \"Strongly Agree\" and \"Agree\") that antibiotics were overused in their facility, in contrast to the result that most strongly agreed or agreed with the need to establish education programs regarding rational antibiotic use and antibiotic policies in their facility (79.4% and 81.9%, respectively). 18.8% (30/160) of the respondents believed that limiting the use of antibiotics could impair patient care, and approximately 50.1% of the participants disagreed. shown in Figure 2 .

Furthermore, only 30.5% (49/160) of the respondents agreed 177 (combined \"Strongly Agree\" and \"Agree\") that antibiotics were overused in their facility, 178 in contrast to the result that most strongly agreed or agreed with the need to establish 179 education programs regarding rational antibiotic use and antibiotic policies in their facil-180 ity (79.4% and 81.9%, respectively). Nevertheless, 18.8% (30/160) of the respondents be-181 lieved that limiting the use of antibiotics could impair patient care, and only approxi-182 mately 50.1% of the participants disagreed. On average, the respondents had a moderate level of accurate practices regarding 187 antibiotics ( Table 2 ). The detailed results regarding the answers to each question are 188 shown in Figure 2 . Regarding the related factors, bacterial confirmation and sensitivity 189 reports were considered important prerequisites for antibiotic prescriptions by 71.3% 190 (114/160) of the respondents. Similarly, almost 70% of the respondents agreed that the cost 191 of an antibiotic should be considered before it was prescribed. Nevertheless, 13.3% (10/75) 192 and 17.3% (13/75) of the physicians strongly agreed that their prescription practices are 193 influenced by patient demands and that they are more influenced by the availability of 194 the antibiotics than by the diseases being treated, respectively. 195 The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant between-sex differences in two domains: 196 practical knowledge (p<0.01) and practices (p<0.001) ( Table 4 ). It also revealed significant 197 differences between age groups (p<0.001) and work experience groups (p<0.05) in practi-198 cal knowledge. Dunn's multiple comparisons test showed that respondents younger than 199 25 years (a) had the lowest level of practical knowledge (a<b, p<0.001; a<c, p<0.001), and 200 On average, the respondents had a moderate level of accurate practices regarding antibiotics ( Table 2 ).

Interestingly, the proportion of correct answers for ciprofloxacin was lower than that for meropenem in our study. This finding implies that the AMR risk of the more commonly used antibiotic, against which the second leading pathogen responsible for HCAIs in Nepal has a higher rate of resistance, is now being underestimated by HCPs. The ciprofloxacin resistance rates of Klebsiella spp [20, 22] . and K. pneumonia [21] are both higher than the meropenem resistance rates in Nepal, while ciprofloxacin is one of the top five antibiotics most commonly dispensed by private pharmacies in Nepal [25] .",

Notably, approximately one-fifth of the HCPs considered limiting the use of antibiotics to be an obstacle to patient care. Regarding the inconsistent perception of the severity of the problem between the national and facility levels, previous KAP studies on AMR have reported similar findings [14, 28] . These results may imply that respondents perceive AMR to be a theoretical and text-based problem rather than a real and tangible problem, possibly creating a barrier to future changes in behaviour [28] . Krockow et al. [29] further explained that the lack of imminence and abstract nature of the threat posed by AMR might lead staff to believe that neither they nor their patients are at risk. Considering this lower perceived severity at their own facility level, each institute might consider some collaborative work with external institutes, at least in its early stages, to elicit their voluntary change based on a reasonably objective understanding of their current status.",

Approximately 70% of the participants considered bacterial confirmation tests, sensitivity reports, and the cost of an antibiotic as important prerequisites to writing prescriptions. Bacterial identification and susceptibility tests can reduce the empiric prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics [31] , and they are highly recommended to maintain the susceptibility of current antimicrobials for as long as possible [2] . However, in resource-limited settings, establishing laboratory facilities for culturing and sensitivity testing may not always be possible because of the associated expense [32] . Even when well-equipped facilities are established, practical availability is another problem. Many barriers may exist preventing them from being utilised, such as financial constraints for the patients, the lack of routine blood sample collection for culturing, the lack of experienced personnel, and a long-time lag between testing and results [33] . Given that this study was conducted at a tertiary level setting in a semi-urban area of Nepal, the empirical use of antibiotics may be even more common in peripheral health facilities.",

Minimizing the financial burden on patients in LMICs has been reported to be essential to ensuring that patients are using qualified antibiotics rather than relying on unregulated drug providers [36] . Especially, in Nepal, the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure for healthcare was shown to account for 55.4% of the total current health expenditure in 2015, much higher than the proportions of other Asian countries and the level of 15-20% recommended by WHO [37] . An analysis of 47 LMICs showed that a 10% increase in OOP health expenditures is associated with a 3.2% increase in AMR [38] . Consequently, to prevent people relying on unregulated drug dispensaries and borrowing medicines from their neighbours which are often unknown chemicals and substandard doses [36] , more emphasis on the price of antibiotics entwined with poverty [36] and other economic factors such as local coverage or co-payment strategies should be considered for their prescription decision-making [35] . If physicians were able to access therapeutically equivalent but less-expensive drugs, a large burden of patients could be saved and they would not delay timely treatment [35] which is very important for controlling AMR.",

The older groups' higher professional standing and longer experience may explain their better practical knowledge. However, no significant difference was observed between those subgroups in terms of theoretical knowledge. This inconsistent knowledge deficit can be partly explained by the fact that AMR has become an important issue in the last 10-15 years, while older HCPs who had finished training before that period have limited theoretical knowledge on this topic [39] . In this regard, apart from reinforcing AMR content in the official undergraduate curricula of medical and nursing schools (Supplementary Figure S1) , keeping working HCPs equipped with the latest AMR knowledge and information also seems necessary. When a continuing AMR education program is organized for HCPs in the field, different focuses on theoretical and practical knowledge should be emphasized according to HCPs' ages and years of work experience.",

Second, this study was performed at a tertiary-level teaching hospital covering more than 5 different districts, and the results cannot necessarily be generalized to all health care settings.",

            "text": "The present study showed a knowledge deficit in the use of combined antibiotics, practical AMR terms, and current AMR rates among HCPs in Nepal. Significant differences in KAP dimensions across subgroups were also found. Our study suggests that educational programs targeting the working HCPs for their continuous learning need to focus on closing the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge and reinforcing better attitudes and practices regarding AMR and rational antibiotic use. Especially for the practical knowledge, which was the weakest dimension from our study; more emphasis should be put on surgical departments and younger professionals. Curricula that are carefully tailored to the differences in the KAP dimensions according to sociodemographic and professional characteristics may increase the acceptance and effectiveness of the programs.",
