The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus.

It is established that SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civet to humans (Wang et al., 2006) and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans, yet the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. The genome sequence analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the closest relative SARS-like SLCoV/RaTG13, found in horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) from Yunnan, China (Zhou et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% overall genome sequence identity to SARS-like coronavirus SLCoV/RaTG13 (Zhou et al., 2020) . Therefore, the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 could be the horseshoe bat. Recent evidence suggests pangolins as host candidates (Lam et al., 2020) , however, the host pangolins are not firmly determined. Not all bat SARS-like CoV can infect humans. For example, bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) found in 2017 (Zhou et al., 2018) , caused millions of piglet deaths, but no human cases. We may postulate that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from its progenitor through mutations and evolutionary fitness in the host-shift and adapting. SARS-CoV-2 are fast-evolving pathogens that continuously undertake mutations in the generations of infection of the host (Yin, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020) .

The reference genome HCoV-229 in the evolutionary analysis was obtained from the infectious HCoV-229E, the 1973-deposited laboratory-adapted prototype strain of HCoV-229E (VR-740). The HCoV-229E prototype strain was originally isolated in 1962 from a patient in Chicago. The first clinical HCoV-229E isolate from a US patient in 2012 was included in this study (Farsani et al., 2012) The result in the periodicity trends of the HCoV-229E coronaviruses demonstrates that both 2periodicity ( Fig.7(a) ) and 3-periodicity ( Fig.7(b) ) in the coronaviruses are increasing with evolutionary time. SARS-CoV-2 has relatively high 2-periodicity and 3-periodicity. This result suggests that the trends of 2-periodicity and 3-periodicity are increasing with time. The evolutionary origin of coronaviruses can be inferred by the trends of 2-periodicity and 3-periodicity. Therefore, we may compare the 2-periodicity and 3-periodicity in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses to understand the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the correlation of dinucleotide repeats with virus virulence in SARS-related coronaviruses, we compare the spectra of the genomic region at coordinates 6k-12k bp of five SARS-related coronaviruses. The genomic regions contain abundant dinucleotide repeats. The region 6k-12k of the genome contains three dinucleotide repeats approximately located at 6k-8k, 8k-10k, and 10k-12k sub-regions. The five SARS-related coronaviruses have different levels of virulence. The most virulent virus is MERS-CoV, followed by SARS-CoV. The 2-periodicity magnitudes, which reflect the distribution of dinucleotides, are compared and shown in (Fig.8 (a,b) ). We may see that MERS-CoV genomic region has the lowest dinucleotide level in all three dinucleotide sub-regions. SARS-CoV also has a low dinucleotide level but is higher than MERS-CoV. We, therefore, may infer that the low dinucleotide level correlates with high virulence. The lower the dinucleotide level is, the higher virus virulence is. This postulation is supported by the observation of the dinucleotide in three SARS-related coronaviruses. Compared with the SARS-CoV, the SARS-like bats-SLOV/Rp3 has similar dinucleotide distributions in sub-regions 1 (6k-8k) and 3 (10k-12k), but higher dinucleotide distribution in sub-region 2 (8k-10k). SLCoV/Rp3 has lower virus virulence than SARS.

The 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L system is an innate immunity pathway that responds to a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to induce degradation of viral and cellular RNAs, thereby blocking viral infection. In higher vertebrates, this process is often regulated by interferons (IFNs). Ribonuclease L (RNase L, L is for latent) is an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral ribonuclease which, upon activation, destroys all RNA within the Table 1. cellular and viral (Silverman, 2007) . RNase L cleaves hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA at single-stranded TT and TA dinucleotides throughout the open reading frame (ORF). An interesting discovery is that in bacterium Mycoplasma pneumonia, which is a respiratory infection agent, the genomes also have relative abundance extremes dinucleotides TT and TA (Karlin, 1998) .
