Many scholars maintain that pubic trust in the government fosters ordinary citizens to comply with government policy [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . When the government was perceived as trustworthy, citizens were likely to comply with the regulations [3, 5, 6] . Moreover, empirical study also suggested that political trust promoted policy compliance and eased policy implementation [8, 9] . More importantly, trust in the government was also conducive for the citizens to comply with policy programs voluntarily [4] . On the other hand, a low level of trust in the government could reduce support for government policy [7] . It could also undermine the legitimacy of policy as well as its implementation and lead to a lower level of compliance [10] . In times of uncertainty, trust could be explained as a factor coming from the salient values and past performance which generated confidence and finally led to cooperation [11] . This cooperation would then finally lead to successful policy implementation and result in satisfactory outcomes. However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, we have witnessed that countries with high and low public trust alike responded effectively to the prevention and control of the epidemic. Thus, this calls for a re-examination of the relationship between public trust and its effect on policy compliance and implementation.",

As found in the H1N1 pandemic, a high level of trust in the government led to the increasing likelihood of citizens adopting protective measures [12, 13] . Despite not knowing much about the nature of the infectious disease, but showing a high level of trust in the government, the majority of Singaporeans followed the control measures, and ultimately, the SARS epidemic has been well controlled and the public felt very satisfied with the government response to the SARS outbreak [14] . If the government managed the crisis properly, their trust could be increased while ineffective management could further deteriorate trust [15] . On the contrary, low trust in the government led to less compliance. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, several studies found the mistrust in the government was associated with the likelihood of citizens to comply less with the government control interventions [16] [17] [18] . If trust was not properly generated, it could lead to a vicious cycle of not complying, hardship, and again back to distrust [16] . This raises alarming concern in a country with low trust in the government of how to increase the likelihood of people complying with the policy intervention in times of crises which finally lead to the success of the epidemic control.",

Professional trust can be defined by the willingness of a person to rely on the skills and abilities of experts [19] . It has been found that health agencies enhance public trust and positively influence people's willingness to adopt recommended behavior [20] . Despite legitimacy and efficacy challenges, vaccination hesitancy could be improved with a higher level of professional trust. Strong recommendations and a higher level of trust placed in professional healthcare workers were associated with a higher acceptance of the vaccine [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . It has been found that parents with higher professional trust are also more likely to have their children vaccinated [24] . By contrast, negative advice from professional healthcare workers was associated with parents' vaccine hesitancy [25] . Likewise, in responding to uncertainty, the tool of information and the involvement of professionals was found to lead to a successful implementation of policy intervention programs [26] [27] [28] . However, little is known about how professional trust, in parallel with public trust in the government, impact policy compliance in times of a public health crisis.

On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic when there were 125,260 globally confirmed cases, and about one-third of these cases were found outside China in 117 countries and territories. By late March, the numbers of confirmed cases increased seven-fold and the graph was rapidly rising [29] . At the end of 2020, there were over 83 million laboratory-confirmed cases and nearly 2 million deaths globally in 218 countries and territories, contributing to a fatality rate of 2% [30]. The US alone accounted for nearly a quarter of global confirmed cases and deaths. American regions were especially hard hit, with half of the global accumulated cases. The situation is highly worrying as new daily confirmed cases are still accelerating at the rate of hundreds of thousands globally [29] . This raises significant concern on how to effectively respond to the pandemic in time, especially in developing countries that have now become the epicenter of the outbreak.",

In fact, Thailand was the first country outside China to report the laboratory-confirmed case of the COVID-19 on 13 January 2020 [29] . On 15 March, the total confirmed cases in Thailand exceeded 100 before the daily new confirmed cases reached a peak of 188 on 22 March. On 26 March 2020, the government enacted the National Emergency Decree to restrict travel and movement. Four months after the first case and two months after the implementation of the lockdown policy, Thailand reported the first zero daily confirmed cases.

            "text": "How did Thailand manage to survive such an outbreak during the early phase of the pandemic? The answer is complex. Apart from medical efforts in testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, compliance with policy control measures from the general public to prevent and safeguard collective safety is of utmost significance. Since the COVID-19 is a preventable respiratory disease, it is crucial for the public to adopt personal protective measures as a means to mitigate the spread of the pandemic when the vaccine is not yet available. Trust and compliance have led to effective containment of the pandemic while lower trust led to less compliance in responding to the COVID-19 [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, different socioeconomic status in different regions results in different levels of compliance [33, 34, 37] . Hence, it is necessary to assess the level of the general public adhering to these safety guidelines from the Asian perspective. More importantly, although most existing studies have emphasized the role of public trust in the prevention and control of public health emergencies, we have seen both traditionally broad public trust countries such as China and Singapore, and others with lower trust in the government like Thailand, effectively responding to the pandemic and achieving decent outcomes in containing the outbreak. Therefore, this raises the question of what is the dynamic relationship between public trust and the prevention and control of the pandemic. At the individual level the question we intend to answer is: How does public trust impact the adoption of personal protective measures? We propose that professional trust could be an alternative approach in mediating the relationship between public trust in the government and policy compliance. In essence, this study aims to assess the compliance of policy control measures from the perspective of public trust. Consequently, the study will not only help to deepen our understanding of the role of public trust during public health crises but also makes an important contribution by offering an experience of a COVID-19 prevention and control strategy.",

For safety concerns, we distributed questionnaire surveys both online and offline to the general public in Thailand using a snowballing technique. Snowball sampling relied on the first group of targeted members to refer to other members [38] . Recruitment of respondents was completed via social media platforms using existing personal and social contacts. The snowball technique was chosen because at the time of the data collection, the general public started to be aware of the COVID-19 outbreak and it was not convenient to come in contact with a large population due to safety concerns, especially in March when the cases started to soar [39] . Inclusion criteria were individuals who resided in Thailand. Exclusion criteria were illiterate individuals since the survey was self-administered. In addition, we made every effort to include a large sample of 809 respondents. The sample characteristic is quite representative, gender and geographical measure of Bangkok and non-Bangkok were distributed nearly equally. During these five weeks, we received 453 complete online questionnaires. From 500 copies circulated, 382 sets were returned of which 356 were complete, corresponding to 71.2% of the complete responding rate. Finally, a sample size of 809 was used for this study.",

Thus, during public health crises, the government and community should pay special attention to the elderly, either by promoting prevention knowledge or helping the elderly to have access to necessary personal protective equipment like surgical masks or cloth masks in time. To further analyze the frequency of respondents adopting personal protective measures, Figure 1 illustrates that 95% of respondents reported having adopted personal protective measures as recommended by the authorities; 60% of respondents reported always practice the four personal protective measures while only 20% of respondents reported practicing the same for two other behaviors. It is clear that respondents were adopting the appropriate safety measures as recommended by health authorities. Despite only 60% of respondents reporting always adopting these safety measures during the early phase of the pandemic, these numbers rose to about 90% by the end of March [31] . Table 3 shows descriptive statistics and pairwise correlation coefficients. All presumed variables were significant and positive, and have preliminarily validated the relationship between public trust and policy compliance. ",

Table 5 reveals a certain impact of professional trust as being a mediating variable on the relationship between trust in the government and the adoption of precautions.

To test whether professional trust was a mediating variable between the relationship of trust in the government and the adoption of personal protective measures, we performed the bootstrapping test using the PROCESS procedure of SPSS and found that trust in the government has been 88.6% indirectly affected by the professional trust at a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval from 0.080 to 0.160. Essentially, this confirmed that professional trust was a full mediator between the relationship between public trust in the government and the willingness of respondents to comply with the safety measures introduced during COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.",

Although low public trust in the Thai government caused alarm, high professional trust has prompted the general public to comply with safety measures. As found in this study, professional trust has dual positive effects on health policy compliance, namely, a direct effect and a mediating effect on the relationship between trust in the government and policy compliance. During the crisis, professional trust served as a supplementary mechanism, empowering the government to increase the likelihood of citizens adopting personal protective measures. It is noticeable that the spokesperson for the CCSA is also a physician who has constantly reminded the general public to wear masks, wash hands often, avoid risk areas, and practice social distancing measures. As citizens placed their trust in physicians and perceived them as equipped with knowledge and compassion, they listened to their advice and tended to adopt these personal protective measures more frequently and this finally contributed to the successful effort in prevention and control of the pandemic. Indeed, knowledge, compassion, and the involvement of professional's communities are keys to promote prevention and overcome epidemics [48] [49] [50] [51] . However, healthcare professionals must be cautious not to influence the policy but remain grounded in their professional advice and fulfilled their fiduciary commitments; otherwise, their trust cannot be maintained [52] .",

Through preliminary outcome assessment of various countries in responding to this public health crisis, we reflected on the important role of public trust in the government and professional trust. When the level of trust in the government is low, professional trust fosters the adoption of personal protective measures and finally produces satisfactory outcomes as illustrated in Thailand. Likewise, in a country with traditionally high trust both in the government and professionals like Singapore, the pandemic is relatively contained. A country with high public trust but low professional trust can also bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control, as in China. In contrast, when the voice of healthcare professionals is being ignored in times of crisis, the consequences can be catastrophic, especially in a developing country with low trust in the government like Brazil which has currently reported the third-highest accumulated confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide [53] .",

Those who favor the current government might place higher trust in the government whereas the opposition might do just the opposite. Nonetheless, the capacity of the government to provide healthcare services is apolitical and, therefore, can represent a more objective appraisal of trust in government. Secondly, the socioeconomic characteristics of our respondents might not be representative, however, half of the respondents residing outside Bangkok was in line with the infected cases.

More importantly, professional trust has a significant role in responding to the crisis and promoting policy compliance as the public strongly need to know how to accurately protect themselves from trusted sources. In a normal situation, professional trust plays a supporting role but in a time of crisis it plays a more prominent role. Francis Bacon once said, \"Knowledge is power\"; when coping with an unprecedented public health crisis that affected millions of lives such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak, knowledge and trust in professional healthcare workers is far more relevant. Meanwhile, the general public must also have a high degree of awareness and are willing to trust and follow these intervention guidelines. While the government still needs to increase public trust for future policy compliance, we propose that policymakers should consider the role of professional trust and wisely employ public trust simultaneously when designing future control interventions for a preventable disease like COVID-19. It is hoped that the finding from Thailand can provide a framework for other countries in promoting policy compliance, especially in times of uncertainty in countries with low public trust in the government.
