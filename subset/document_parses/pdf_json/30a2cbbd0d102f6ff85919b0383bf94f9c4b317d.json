            "text": "When health professions learners' primary pedagogical experience of Black people and how they become patients is through statistics, it becomes very easy for learners to think of Black people as data points rather than as individuals whose health is often at the mercy of racist institutions. When the human dimension of Black people's health is ignored, specifically the ways that poor health affects individual wellbeing, one of the barriers to proper health for Black patients is how to be seen and considered as a part of a larger problem of systemic racism and institutional injustices as well as individuals whose personal lives are affected by such larger problems. I propose an approach to health professions pedagogythe experiential race testimonies (ERT) approach-that can change the way health professions learners understand and treat Black patients, thus changing the future of Black health. The ERT approach pairs population data analysis with analysis of personal testimonies and the experiences they convey. outcomes (Hoberman 2012), such as their higher mortality rates from COVID-19 (\"The COVID Racial Data Tracker\" 2020), higher rates of certain cancers, including breast cancer (Curtis, Quale, and Haggstrom 2008; Haas, Earle, and Orav 2008; Silber, Rosenbaum, and Clark 2013; Ward, Jemal, and Cokkinides 2004) , higher maternal mortality rates (Amankwaa, Records, and Kenner 2018; Krisberg 2019), and their general unjust treatment in healthcare systems (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1985). When the human dimension of Black people's health is ignored, specifically the ways that poor health affects individual wellbeing, one of the barriers to proper health for Black patients becomes how to be seen and thought of as a part of a larger problem of systemic racism and institutional injustices as well as individuals whose personal lives are affected by these larger problems. One solution to better Black people's health and their relationship with health care is to change the way educators teach health professions learners about their health. Now that we have data on the lesser status of Black health, as a matter of justice, we have to explore methods of interrogating and ending it. Here, I propose an approach to health professions pedagogy-the experiential race testimonies (ERT) approach-that can change the way health professions learners understand and treat Black patients, changing the future of Black health. The ERT approach is a bi-level pedagogical tool that explores Black health at the population and individual level. It pairs population data analysis with the analysis of personal testimonies and the experiences they convey. Together, the data on Black health and the testimonies from Black patients that attest to their sometimes racially motivated, unjust, and dehumanizing experiences with health care engages learners to explore the totality of Black health. To accomplish the goal of changing the way we educate health professions learners about Black people and what affects their health, the ERT approach 1) centers patients, not their illness or the provider; 2) situates Black patients' experiences with health care within the context of racism; and 3) amoralizes Black people's health. In this article, using examples of testimonies from Black people attesting to their experience of health and health care, as well as the supporting data, I explore the merits of the ERT approach in health professions pedagogy.",

Although Baldwin was not speaking about health professions education, it too has adopted a narrative of Black people represented as statistics, as people who face injustices rather than as complex humans upon whom injustices have been imposed. Specifically, in the health professions, learners are often taught to view Black people through the lens of statistical data representing disparate rates of disease and disorders.

Narrative medicine uses health stories to transform the clinical experience for patients and caregivers, namely by using literature and various writing, reading, and listening exercises to help caregivers view patients as whole beings, not just as illnesses. Narrative medicine also helps caregivers examine their own relationship to illness (Charon 2006) . Narrative medicine and the ERT approach share at least one goal, which is to provide a more complete picture of the patient. This, however, is generally where the similarities end. For instance, whereas narrative medicine aims to transform the patient-physician relationship as it happens in a clinical setting, the ERT approach aims to transform the way learners think about the lives of Black people before they become patients and how those experiences then mitigate their experience of health and health care once they become patients. The ERT approach also uses testimonies rather than full narratives.",

Testimonies are a short, concise, and often times emotionally charged glimpse into the ways in which individuals experience the world. They don't always have a plot and a specific, intended purpose like more formal narratives. More generally, testimonies affirm and allow patients to claim their own experiences, thoughts, or feelings. Testimonies are personal, and when they are shared with others, tellers invite a listener, in this case the health professions learner, into their world as an observer.

Since most Black patients will have caregivers who are not Black given that in 2018 only 5% of physicians identified as African-American or Black and in 2017 only 6% of registered nurses identified as African-American (American Association of Colleges of Nursing 2019; American Association of Medical Colleges 2019), it is imperative for the proper treatment of Black people not to make Whiteness the standard by which Black people's experience of illness is judged. And if not properly educated, it is very easy for White health professions learners to judge Black people's experiences based on their own limited perspective of illness. But given Black people's different experiences with race, including the biological and psychological effects of racism , making whiteness the standard for judging illness means ignoring the unique social context of the Black experience and its influence on health.",

The idea behind the Health Humanities Portrait, as a pedagogical tool, is that when patients speak about their experiences, they provide learners with their own experiential expertise about illness and health. Centering the patient also minimizes the chance that learners will objectify patients; instead, patients become more than their illness with full lives outside of their it (Sufian et al. 2020) . The ERT approach extends this specifically to Black people who as Baldwin states, too often are viewed only by their losses and the marginalized aspects of being Black rather than as individuals with full lives. Using testimonies from Black people gives them an authority over their own stories in health care, which too often either doesn't trust Black people to be narrators of their own stories or removes their voice from those stories.",

In New York, researchers found that even when Black women have a college degree, their chances of dying during or soon after birth are still three times higher than White women who never completed a high school diploma (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 2016). In the United Kingdom, Black maternal mortality is also a public health concern. In 2016, for every 100,000 deaths during pregnancy, eight White women died compared to forty Black women (Anekwe 2020) . Using the available data on Black maternal mortality for context, the ERT approach examines individual instances of Black maternal death and individual instances of racial bias in Black women's birthing stories as a part of a broader systemic problem of racism in medicine and racism in social institutions that create inequities in social determinants of health.",

Rather, a lack of access within social determinants of health explains Black women's disparate maternal mortality. Additionally, systemic inequalities in health care such as Black women's experiences with providers' racial biases also explains their increased mortality. Specifically, to address Black women's maternal mortality, the CDC recommends that hospitals and healthcare systems \"identify and address implicit bias in healthcare that would likely improve patient-provider interactions, health communication, and health outcomes\" (\"Racial and Ethnic Disparities Continue in Pregnancy Related Deaths\" 2019). With this recommendation, the CDC affirms that health care needs to address the effects of racism, within and outside of the clinical setting.",

The ERT approach helps learners examine the issue of Black maternal mortality as more than a fluke, or something that just happens to a few Black people; rather it reveals it as a systemic problem that is not a normal part of health care. More importantly, the ERT approach shows learners that they are integral to changing this systemic problem.

Often Black people are blamed for their poor health, judged as immoral for participating in unhealthy behaviors that contribute to their illnesses. For example, in his 2015 memoir entitled, Black Man in a White Coat, Damon Tweedy, a Black physician, tells the story of the patients he treated at a free clinic in a rural part of North Carolina. There he frequently saw Black patients diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes. While reflecting on how he interacted with these patients, he recalls assuming that their poor health was made worse by their poor life choices such as eating fast food or lack of exercise. When he learned that these patients either couldn't afford treatment for their chronic diseases, that their rural town did not have a mainstay physician's office, or that despite making healthy lifestyle choices like not smoking or drinking alcohol, he had to confront his biases. Furthermore, he had to consider that if he could have these biases against Black patients, despite being a Black person himself, could his White colleagues have the same biases against Black patients, could they also see Black patients with poor health as moral failures? When reflecting on the social factors that influenced his Black patients' health, Tweedy is not saying that Black people are never to blame for their poor health, but he is acknowledging that sometimes there are external factors beyond their control that influences their health. And instead of making their decisions a matter of morality, we should view their health decisions within the context of social determinants of health, namely within the social and cultural context in which they live and make decisions about their health.",

They used to eat like so many starches all the time, so many beans, so many sweet potatoes, chicken breasts, chicken fried, and we used to eat a lot of fried foods all the time.... sneaking in when I was a kid, sneaking in to make so many sugar sandwiches. Sugar and butter sandwiches, full of sugar like that thick, and I think that is really what got to me.

Since non-Black people can never have first-hand access to the experience of being Black, the freeform, short nature of testimonies that the ERT approach uses may not be enough to accomplish its goals.
