It is also plausible that not all countries have been able to implement and maintain the same containment and control measures for the epidemic over time. Therefore, comparisons are risky, and it is difficult to identify \"winning and effective\" strategies without considering specific national situations (12) (13) (14) (15) as in the recent attempt done in Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Guinea (16) . Often, as in these four countries, the strategies adopted are very similar to those applied in high-income countries, but the contexts are very different, and this seems to lead to suboptimal results.
