Unprecedented policies and strategies are being implement to contain the spread of this disease, that have resulted in around a third of global population being subjected to COVID-19 lockdown. In scientific terminology the word 'Lockdown' means 'Restrictive Mass Quarantine'. Historically in 2003 citywide quarantines were imposed in areas of China and Canada during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Entire villages in many west African countries were quarantined during the 2014 Ebola outbreak [1] . However, current COVID-19 seems to be the largest and most restrictive quarantine till date.",

On the other hand, the loss of freedom, separation from the loved ones, and the uncertainty over the disease status, may pose immense psychological turbulence, even in the more affluent population. These unnatural circumstances have been hypothesized to lead to extreme risk-taking behaviours-including suicidal tendencies. Social isolation and loneliness are recognised risk factors for suicidal attempts [2] . It is imperative to carefully weigh and strategically implement the potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine against the possible odds of psychological distress in the society [3] . A recent textual analysis of 5780 publications enforces the need of global research collaborations, during this pandemic, in order to address the knowledge gaps in a country to country based approach [4] .",

The world health organisation (WHO) officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Soon evidence showed its sustained human-to-human transmission, that became the cause of concern as well as panic. The unique characteristic of COVID -19 is that it is highly contagious though maybe less virulence [6, 7] . Thus the focal point of present strategy to prevent its spread is social isolation. In that attempt several countries including India have gone into a state of complete lockdown. Following up the trend of increasing number of new cases and related deaths as well as looking at the projected models, the future appears uncertain. Researchers and policy makers thus are emphasizing the need of strengthening or supplementing the current measures of containment so as to flatten the curve of spread and to gain time during which a definite treatment or vaccine may be developed [8, 9] .",

This was specially done to reduce the risk of negative psychological outcomes caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and promote social stability [16, 17] .

Telephonic conversations or internet based counselling from a reliable source can be helpful. Structured letter therapy has been suggested as a kind of feasible psychological intervention approach during times of mass quarantine for COVID-19 in China [25] . In this time of crisis, one of the strategies for the practitioners may be to promptly start adopting e-mental health care applications. This would help in two ways-in providing continued care to current patients in need and it will also help as a new strategy to cope with the imminent upsurge in psychological symptoms due to the pandemic and resulting lockdown [26] . In today's world of social media, we should try to use this power effectively for positive mass education and motivation. In this era of mass internet supported communication, this present crisis is the first ever global crisis of this magnitude [27] . We need to turn to the telepsychiatry experts to formulate best processes to address the urgent psychological need of the society [28] . Online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness based therapy will be helpful for patients [29] . Varies psychotherapies to deal with specific psychological issues have been discussed in a recently published review targeting the current pandemic [30] . Implementation of Online mental health services have their own challenges in Asian Countries like India and China [31] . Policies and strategies need to be specific and targeted to the population under focus. Thus more studies and data is required from masses.",

It also tries to identify the high risk population in a relatively large cohort of participants across India. The limitation however is our sampling method which might be biased towards the group of subjects who are more tech savvy. Thus, it might not be a true reflection of entire population in India. However, as our cohort and sampling has been very random across various states of the country, occupations, educational status and age groups, the finding are generalizable to the literate strata of the Indian society.",
