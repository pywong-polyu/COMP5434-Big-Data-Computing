Mobile phones, tablets, and computers are entrenched in everyday family life. Therefore, families face new challenges with problematic internet use, blurring boundaries between the outside world and the domestic sphere. Sometimes these changes in living together lead to suffering. How do therapists respond to these new challenges faced by contemporary families? Considering the emotion regulation strategies underlying the problematic use of technology, we develop an Emotion Regulation Focused Family Therapy. Within the Change Process Research paradigm, which aims to explain how psychotherapy produces change, we examine this innovative therapeutic approach in an exploratory process in order to refine our own practice. We conducted a qualitative research for five families in family therapy under natural clinical conditions to identify the therapist's interventions and the family configurations. The core theme was therapist interventions. The results identified 12 subcategories under this category. We built an emotion regulation focused model with 12 steps from these subcategories. Each of the interventions is illustrated with some excerpts from the sessions. Clinical considerations, methodological issues limiting the current body of work, and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

New ways of \"being a family\" are emerging: more prevalent stepfamilies, same-sex parenting, late adoption, medically assisted reproduction, etc. Families are also facing changes with the rise in the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Smartphone, tablet, computer, connected objects have become part of the family landscape and may be altering aspects of family life, increased even more by the covid-19 pandemic context, with telework and quarantine. Transhumanism asserts the notion that humans can be \"augmented\" by technology (Leary, 1994; Drexler, 2005; Roux and Coeurnelle, 2016) . \"The human being can 'become more human' thanks to technology: longer life, greater intelligence and creativity...\" (Roux and Coeurnelle, 2020) . Others denounce the dangers of these cognitive prostheses (Derian, 2013) . Augmented Man, \"connected self \": information and communication technologies have revolutionized human relations and the organization of families. Can we also talk about \"augmented\" families? The cell phone has become \"an extension of oneself \" and has come to interfere in people's daily life, creating a new relational dynamic. What are the challenges connected families are encountering? Although the internet use facilitates our lives, some individuals seem to show problematic Internet use (PIU). Among a variety of detrimental online behaviors, PIU is defined as \"excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, urges or behaviors regarding Internet use that lead to impairment and distress\" (Weinstein and Lejoyeux, 2010, p. 277) . What are the implications for changing family dynamics, family values, and family processes? In her multitheoretical model describing the process of how technologies are affecting couple and family life, Hertlein (2012) suggests two types of changes in relationships: changes to the family structure of relationships and changes to the family process. If families are changing and technology is part of that change, family clinicians may be challenged by the adoption of emerging technologies. How do family therapists respond to this emerging clinical reality?",

            "text": "From the structural-functional perspective, \"family structure is the invisible set of functional demands that organizes the ways in which family members interact\" (Minuchin, 1974, p. 52) . Family structure is determined by boundaries which are invisible barriers regulating contact between members. When Minuchin (1974) defined boundaries, he was referring to the rules that underpin families' transactional patterns; i.e., how the larger system (the nuclear family) operates, as well as subsystems (parents and children) within it. Subsystems are organized hierarchically: power is distributed appropriately within individuals and between subsystems, making reliance on some members more expected than on others. The parents must assert their authority in a hierarchical structure. The respect of such rules in a family makes belonging possible. Technology use may modify these rules and blur work/family boundaries with negative consequences (Chesley, 2005) . For example, when a parent works from home, the rules specific to their work system may take over family rules. The parent, who is usually attentive to their child, may become upset because they are disturbed by their 6-year-old son in their work. As for the child, the rules of online gambling may take precedence over the rules of the home. The adolescent, who is supposed to join their parents for lunch, refuses to leave their room because they are playing with friends online. These bubbles allowed by technology appear as subsystems with sometimes rigid boundaries within the family system, which are governed by different rules.",

Different affiliations enter into rivalry. The notion of belonging then appears to be obsolete, individuals being linked less by a common belonging than by connections (Gaillard, 2009) . With this possibility of external connections, the modeling of the family as a system seems to be called into question, insofar as family members are no longer bound together by ties that would be hierarchically superior to any other ties (Gaillard et al., 2011) . Submission to paternal authority is no longer relevant, young people are their own judge and have authority over themselves. Parents used to be able to control the games they were offering their children. Today children can \"download their own games without parental knowledge. This may flip the structure in the family to unfavorably honor the youth or place them in a position of higher power, as youth are frequently more knowledgeable about technology than their parents\" (Curtis et al., 2017, p. 114) . \"The family, the first cell of belonging, is subject to permanent reconfigurations and is going through a crisis of educational transmission. We are thus witnessing a generalized mutation of institutions and social and community rituals, which nourished the social bond by giving meaning and regulating individual behavior\" (Lascaux and Couteron, 2015, pp. 165-166) . Technologies amplify the phenomenon of individualization of children, who spend less time with their parents. Family cohesion 1 suffers as a result (Caron and Caronia, 2005) . Escots (2011) speaks of an epistemological crisis linked to the change in the ontological status of families.",

As beings are structured on an \"individual\" mode, the belonging bound is almost totally dissolved into a connective one. This connective mode of binding must leave each one with an intact space of personal development. His space having become vital insofar as they impose themselves as supports of the necessary personal visibility, of the sufficient deployment of the self of the individuals, of the presentation of oneself, would say Fourez (2004) . Young people no longer construct their identity on the basis of belonging but on individuality, which can rely on digital supports that we can refer to the \"technologies of the self, \" described by Foucault (1982) . Young people tell their stories through social networks, recording their moods and the activities that have punctuated their day. Digital tools make it possible to produce a life story (Amri and Vacaflor, 2010) , but the receptors of these messages, traces of the young person's narrative identity, are multiple and uncertain. Computer-mediated social ties, made possible by digital technology, are \"floating\" (Perriault, 2009) and the identity construction induced by this socio-technical logic will be unstable (Coutant, 2011) . New fragilities emerge with these recent processes of individualization: narcissistic disorders, emotional dysregulation, new addictions, etc. (Coutant, 2011; Duriez, 2018a) .",

The relationship to the other is very concrete, subjectivated, and \"affective, \" implying a relationship based on esteem -constantly measured-of the other and of oneself \" (Gaillard et al., 2011) . Regulations within the family are \"no longer in an institutional mode, they are essentially in an emotional mode, so that there is a negotiation process that is as continuous as it is tense\" (Gaillard, 2009, p. 18) . This change in regulation modes can be a source of suffering for some family members who do not adapt to this connective attitude (Duriez, 2019) .",

            "text": "Technology carries changes to the family process, from belonging mode relationships to connective mode relationships. From the interaction-constructionist perspective, family process observes how family members develop relationships and interact with one another through communication, behavior, gestures, rituals (Berger and Kellner, 1970) , and emotion regulation strategies (Duriez, 2017) . Apart from symptomatic situations (addiction, cyberbullying, minor's access to inappropriate content, etc.), the main problem seems to be time spent using ICT with its consequences on family relationships (Hugues and Hans, 2001; Bacigalupe et al., 2014) . With regard to parentchild relationships, for the adolescent, \"too much isolation in the virtual world can mean a diminished attachment to parents and family. A too strong link to a machine to the detriment of other relationships with surrounding people, a too long period of time spent in its presence, substitutes, to a certain extent, for certain relationships that are indispensable in the context of social and emotional development\" (Derian, 2013, p. 356) . The widespread presence of new media technologies in homes may have relational impacts on the couples. Hertlein (2012) examines the consequences for couples and points out the effects of technology in daily family life on intimacy, relationship initiation and formation processes, and relationship maintenance. Chesley (2005) demonstrates that cell phone use over time is linked to increased psychological distress and lower family satisfaction.",

            "text": "For example, during a marital therapy speech, a woman explains that every evening, when the couple could meet once the children went to bed, her husband takes his cell phone to the toilet and disappears for 30 min: \"he is there and he is not there.\" She then experiences a momentary loss. Although this experience can emerge in the context of divorce, it can also exist when all family members are together at home. The oscillations between presence and absence destabilize the entourage, which must learn to cope with the stress due to the fact that we never know if the other person is actually present and available or if they are locked in their technological bubble and inaccessible (Duriez, 2013) . This experience of loss becomes an organizing core of the family dynamic as new hidden games regulate the relationships: one is psychically absent by locking themselves up with the computer, while the other feels the absence, the lack. This experience brings us back to the concept of ambiguous loss described by Boss (1999) . In the context of an ambiguous loss, it is very difficult to integrate the other's absence because the other is present. The person is no longer present psychically but they are physically and can also return psychically. The process of \"progressive detachment, \" the stage of grief for a real loss, is not possible. Connected families must learn to regulate the emotions related to the ambiguity of presence, to the uncertainty of the availability of the other.",

Mesch (2006) proposes a compositional approach which includes work on internet use, self-esteem, family time, and family conflicts to strengthen family cohesiveness. Bacigalupe et al. (2014) propose a strength-based approach to support family relationships. \"The confluence of an ambient intelligence, an environment of advanced technology capable of responding intelligently to human needs (Riva, 2005) a connected presence (Licoppe, 2004) and the continuous awareness of others through wireless tools, is fostering a new way for families to relate\" (Bacigalupe et al., 2014) . He recommends that therapists familiarize themselves with new ICTs. Jordan (2014) proposes to incorporate video games like board games in therapy. Curtis et al. (2017) proposes to accommodate and to highlight the benefits of video games in order to assist the youth in staying engaged and active in the process. They invite parents to do the same. \"The caregiver, while being coached by the therapist, should facilitate a conversation with the child about what games they like to play or are interested in\" Curtis et al.(2017, p. 115) . Liu et al. (2015) explore both the effectiveness of a multi-family group therapy on Internet addiction and the underlying mechanisms of the effectiveness. They identify two mechanisms: (1) improving parent-adolescent communication and closeness, (2) fulfilling adolescents' psychological needs through strengthening their communication and relationship with their parents.",

There may however be a paucity in considering the emotional regulation strategies underlying this miscommunication in family therapy with connected families. Researchers are increasingly studying the correlation of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) with emotional regulation (Zhou et al., 2011; Hormes et al., 2014; Casale et al., 2016; Spada and Marino, 2017; Evren et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2018; Amendola et al., 2019; Hernandez et al., 2019; Karaer and Devrim, 2019; Faghani et al., 2020) . Sideli et al. (2017) demonstrate that low self-esteem, high aggressionhostility, and high sociability are significant risk factors for PIU. The Internet allows escape, distraction, extrication from a relationship (Lee, 2014) or procrastination (Hernandez et al., 2019) , in short \"a form of escapism to avoid certain aspects of their reality\" (Hertlein and Hawkins, 2012) . Schimmenti and Caretti (2017) show that PIU may be considered as a dissociative experience. They propose the clinical construct of Video-terminal Dissociative Trance (VDT) and discuss its potential usefulness for the assessment and treatment of people who display PIU. \"As a defense mechanism, dissociation allows an individual to avoid emotional distress temporarily by screening out excessive or overwhelming stimuli (Bromberg, 1996) \" (Schimmenti and Caretti, 2017, p. 65) . In our practice with connected families these studies invite us to explore the function of problematic internet use in relation to emotional regulation. How does this use maintain the homeostasis of the family system?",

For some researchers, \"it is no longer possible to be satisfied with studies that focus on comparing symptoms before and after treatment or not. It is necessary to open the 'black box' that worked in between\" (Thurin, 2017, p. 57) . This is what Greenberg (1986) proposes with the concept of \"Change Process Research.\" Based on circumstantial study of therapies conducted in \"natural\" conditions, its perspectives are clinical, practical, and theoretical. At this stage of our research, the objective is not the evaluation of psychotherapy as it is not yet formalized. The objective is to identify the experience of families with ICTs through their discourse, what the family requests and how the therapist responds to it in order to build an emotion regulation-focused model for these wired families. Our research isn't an action research either because the data from completed therapies preexisted the research.",

During the therapy we investigate emotion regulation strategies and how the others react to them. If there is an issue, then our therapeutic intent is to bring family members to a greater acceptance of each other's emotion regulating style, without feeling misunderstood or threatened by the differences in emotion regulation strategies (Duriez, 2017) . The hypothesizing process stands out within the therapeutic frame in the context of the intersubjective encounter between the family and the therapist, with the therapist also experiencing her own emotional regulation strategies. We apply the principle of circularity between the therapist and the family, which can be defined as \"the capacity of the therapist to conduct his investigation on the basis of feedback from the family in response to the information he solicits about relationships and, therefore, about difference and change\" (Selvini et al., 1980, p. 6 ).",

Data have been obtained from completed family therapies. But a first data analysis started during the therapy. We work with families with a constant concern to question our practice, according to an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) stance, which gives opportunities to bridge clinical research and practice, enhancing the knowledge base and improving patient care. We have viewed and reviewed the sessions with different groups of psychologists, who are in family therapy training and also with master students in order to allow the emergence of new insights and to gain a general sense of the therapy process. From this exposure and the case notes, which followed each session, we identify relevant moments related to a problematic use of technology. We visualized the significant sessions for the five families and transcribed the relevant passages. Two master students helped transcribing the sessions for families I and S. We started the initial open coding on paper copies of the transcripts, with categories being noted in the margins. Analytic procedures of content analysis are close to the \"line by line\" practice of supervision, which allows therapists to reflect on the meanings of clinical material.

Mr. S., the father, spends a lot of time on the computer. Opale, the 16 years old daughter, spends a lot of time on her smartphone. Logan, the 12 years old son, spends a lot of time playing video games. The father and the children are locked in a technological bubble and the mother suffers from this lack of exchange. She feels abandoned or neglected. The initial request for therapy concerns Opale's excessive use of her cell phone. Opale explains: \"Actually when I'm with my friends, my phone doesn't exist. It's just that when I get home, I start using it to chat with my friends.\" Her mother complains about the lack of communication with her daughter.

If the boundary separating the whole family from other systems is diffuse at home because Opale maintains a virtual contact with her friends, this boundary becomes rigid when Opale is out in her group of friends because she usually cuts off contact with her parents at these times.",

He gambles so that he no longer thinks she can leave. We can observe an escalation of the couple's distress. The therapist highlights the circularity of emotional regulation strategies and the impasse in which the couple or the family is stuck. At this stage, the family begins to understand the urgency of changing the emotional patterns related to the loss so that old patterns are not repeated. The therapist suggests alternative strategies. For example, in the case of the V Family, she helps Ms. V. accept that her sons do not share negative emotions. GAUTHIER: We have very different ways of coping. I don't handle excessive expression of emotions very well. My way of dealing with emotions is rationalism. I rationalize everything. I contain myself by rationalizing. And as a result, I am never on the side of amplification. Ms. V: As a young person, there was a major ban on expressing emotions in my family and I was very unhappy about that. I took French leave.

All the work I had done to free myself from this leaden screed, where it was forbidden to say anything and we had to pretend, seems useless today. I am trapped again. If I can't have intimate, intense conversations with my sons, I'm going to put myself at a distance so as not to get hurt. THERAPIST: Emotional intensity is experienced as a danger for your sons.

For well advanced therapies, some may have reflected on what was passed down to them by their parents or by previous generations. They know that they can refuse this legacy. They have a better understanding of how \"schemas-of-being-with-the-other\" were created during their childhood and are ready to build new ones. This awareness increases the agency in one's own life and goes in the direction of the emergence of a stronger self. In the last session, Ms. V summarized her change as follows:",

We can say that these families are healthy, there are no severe symptoms within these families. The internet use is problematic but life didn't stop. Teenagers go to high school. Young adults and parents go to work. These five families are contemporary families who are challenged by the effects of new technologies on their organization. More severe situations, for example with a teenager locked in his room night and day, would probably require a different approach, more focused on the subject and his psychic vulnerability. The therapist's interventions highlight family dynamics which are consistent with previous research which has shown that PIU and interpersonal relationship problems have a strong correlation. The family approach then seems indicated, which is in line with the recommendations of Young Park et al. (2014) for adolescents.",

The interventions follow the family's focus, not necessarily in a prescribed linear progression but in a systemic fashion. The family therapist looks into family interactions that maintain problematic behaviors: transactional patterns (Minuchin, 1974 and First-Order Cybernetics) , \"official program\" and map of the world (Elkaim, 1986 and Second-Order Cybernetics) and emotion regulation patterns (Duriez, 2017 and Third-Order Cybernectics) . Behavior, cognition and affect work together to create specific interactions which contribute to intergenerational transmission. This consideration of emotion is not new (Bowen, 1978; Johnson, 2004; Greenberg, 2015) but with research in neuroscience and epigenetics, we now have a better knowledge of the complexity of emotional regulation strategies, which is essential for a good perceptivity of circularity in interpersonal relationships. Our work has therefore focused on emotional regulation strategies, whether intentional or automatic, to better identify mechanisms of homeostasis. Bowen (1978) taught us that the lower the level of differentiation is, the more difficult it will be to regulate negative emotions. In the families studied, we observe a low level of differentiation. In fact, we can consider escapism into a technological bubble as a triangulation process that regulates stress, anxiety or tension. Bowen found that tension in a two-person relationship is relieved by focusing on a third person. Today the third party can be a computer, a tablet or a smartphone. Our clinical practice is influenced by the Bowen Model to help the patient identify their relationship to the technological object as a triangulation process, avoiding communication about a problem.",

For the fifth one, the parents are separated. The over-functioning partner was commonly female. We cannot link this underfunctioning to PIU. In the case of the I family, it is the woman who has a PIU but this use does not prevent her from carrying out her parenting responsibilities, at times she could even appear as too invasive according to her children. She builds an intimate emotional cyber relationship with another man to escape from a feeling of abandonment, to forget the lack of connection with her husband and their problem relating to intimacy. Men escape from family responsibilities and rely on women. Women have to cope with a higher mental load and feelings of loneliness. We find the pattern: \"The over-functioning spouse was often other-focused in contrast to the excessive self-focus of the underfunctioning partner\" (Lee, 2014, p. 381) . Within this framework where the woman gives and the man takes, Contextual Family Therapy can help to consider the balance of fairness in family relations. But it's really difficult with the excessive self-focus men. As Lee we were seeing rebuffs and the absence of acknowledgment by the men (M. I. and M. S.). \"Shame and a feeling of unworthiness also curtailed self-disclosures\" (Lee, 2014, p. 379 ). This was not the case for the T couple, perhaps because of their youth. When Ms. S tries to express herself, her husband, unable to connect with her emotion, empathy, ends up leaving the session. It seems biologically impossible for him to take his wife's needs into account. An exploration of the literature on dynamic self-and other-focused emotional intelligence (Pekaar et al., 2020 ) may allow us to refine interventions.",

It facilitates the development of a collective identity and shared experiences\" (Mesch, 2006, p. 125) . Weak family cohesion, lack of communication and loss of rituals reduce the perception of family belonging and increases individuality. This creates suffering (Crosnoe and Elder, 2004; Cavanagh, 2008; King et al., 2016) . This suffering may be amplified by the presence of old wounds. Can we then consider these relational patterns, with a reorganization of family time, as a new challenge for contemporary families? Is this a specific challenge for wired families? We can assume that if there was no such possibility to escape from negative emotions with technology, there would be an escape by other means (working, playing music, reading, practicing sports, gardening, tinkering, housework, etc.). Already 50 years ago teenagers locked themselves in their room to listen to music or read to extricate from the relationship with their parents. Men went out to see friends when they didn't want to spend the evening with their wife. What is new is that technology is within reach, in the household, and offers very attractive and addictive activities.",

As Bowen (1978) , we assume that the past influences the present, as past relational patterns continue to influence the present family system. If the family has become rigid in its organization where avoidance strategies dominate, can it be a way of dealing with grief or separation from previous generations? This refocusing on transgenerational processes helps the system to become more flexible, to stop blaming and to assume its own role in this rigid functioning. As therapist and family members see how patterns repeat over generations, it is possible to identify the automatic reactions of family members toward each other. The ability to act on the basis of more awareness of relationship process can lead to some reduction in problematic internet use.",
