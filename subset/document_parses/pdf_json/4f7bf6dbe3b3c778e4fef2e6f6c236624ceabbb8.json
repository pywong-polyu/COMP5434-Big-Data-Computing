            "text": "Boron doped diamond Biosensor Impedimetric sensor A B S T R A C T Amidst a global pandemic, a precise and widely accessible rapid detection method is needed for accurate diagnosis and contact tracing. The lack of this technology was exposed through the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 beginning in 2019. This study sets the foundation for the development of a boron doped diamond (BDD)based impedimetric sensor. While specifically developed for use in the detection of SARS-CoV-2, this technology uses principles that could be adapted to detect other viruses in the future. Boron doped polycrystalline diamond electrodes were functionalized with a biotin-streptavidin linker complex and biotinylated anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies. Electrodes were then incubated with the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface protein, and an electrical response was recorded using the changes to the electrode's charge transfer resistance (R ct ), measured through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Detectable changes in the R ct were observed after 5-min incubation periods with S1 subunit concentrations as low as 1 fg/mL. Incubation with Influenza-B Hemagglutinin protein resulted in minimal change to the R ct , indicating specificity of the BDD electrode for the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2. Detection of the S1 subunit in a complex (cell culture) medium was also demonstrated by modifying the EIS protocol to minimize the effects of sample matrix binding. BDD films of varying surface morphologies were investigated, and material characterization was used to give insight into the microstructure-performance relationship of the BDD sensing surface.",

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as both the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of pathogenic enveloped viruses that have a positive, single-stranded RNA genome [2] . Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has superior human-to-human transmission, causing rapid spread among populations. The virus primarily affects the respiratory system, causing flu-like symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure [3] . In addition, COVID-19 is now known to manifest as systemic inflammation, potentially leading to sepsis, severe cardiac injury, heart failure, and multi-organ dysfunction in high-risk patients [4] .",

The RT-PCR test allows for the diagnosis of patients in an effort to contain the pandemic. However, RT-PCR requires expensive instrumentation, takes several hours to perform, and patients often have to wait multiple days to receive results [5] . Rapid antigen tests currently on the market for point-of-care and in-home use can provide results in minutes, however their low sensitivity remains an issue. Current rapid tests require the patient to have a high viral load, therefore the detection of the virus can only be accomplished during a narrow window of time after infection, leading to high false negative rates [6] . Rapid and accurate testing modalities are still lacking, but many research groups worldwide have published novel detection platforms over the last year, which have been documented in a number of review articles [7] .",

These platforms consist of three elements: transduction, biorecognition, and electrochemical measurement [8] . The transducer is an electrochemical cell, typically in a three electrode configuration, though two electrode systems are sometimes used. The working electrode is most commonly what is modified by a biorecognition element, which could be an antibody, protein, oligonucleotide, or other biomolecule. The electrochemical cell transforms the binding of an analyte to the biorecognition element into an electrochemical signal that can be measured using potentiometry, amperometry, impedance, or other measurement technique. The generation of an electrochemical signal upon target analyte binding enables the rapid and specific detection of antigens, often at very low concentrations. A number of electrochemical biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed over the past year [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

BDD's wide potential window and low background current in aqueous and mixed aqueous-organic solutions (ca ~3.0 V to 3.5 V) allow for highly specific and sensitive electrochemical measurements [16] . The presence of functional groups on BDD surfaces also allows for a wide variety of coupling chemistries and covalent attachment of moieties for impedimetric sensing techniques. The covalent attachment of receptor molecules allows for the fabrication of highly stable, perhaps even reusable sensors.",

The samples were once again solvent cleaned using an ultrasonic bath of acetone, then isopropanol prior to converting the surface H groups to hydroxyl (OH) groups. OH group surface termination was accomplished by irradiating the samples with an excimer lamp at 172 nm for 1 h. Surface amination was performed by reacting the OH groups with an amino silane compound.

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins that can be used as a target antigen in biosensors: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [28] . The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a homotrimeric fusion protein located on the viral surface and is comprised of two subunits, S1 and S2 [29] . Since the S protein is responsible for the recognition and binding of the host cell receptor, it has been shown to be the most specific and suitable target antigen [29] . However, the S1 subunit is more specific to SARS-CoV-2, as the S2 subunit is more conserved between HCoVs and consequently plays a role in the cross-reactivity seen in assays that use the whole spike as the target antigen [30] . For this reason, monoclonal Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies were used to target the S1 subunit specifically in our sensor platform. Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of all three BDD samples. Based on the position and intensity of the peak at 500 cm \u2212 1 , it can be estimated that the 3.6 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm films have similar boron concentrations, while the 8.0 \u03bcm film has lower boron doping [31] [32] [33] . This is also evident by the higher peak intensity at 1332 cm \u2212 1 for the 8.0 \u03bcm film, which corresponds to the presence of diamond (sp 3 -bonded carbon) [31] [32] [33] . This was confirmed with SIMS analysis of all three films, where average boron concentrations of 3.25 \u00d7 10 20 cm \u2212 3 , 1.36 \u00d7 10 21 cm \u2212 3 and 1.26 \u00d7 10 21 cm \u2212 3 were measured for the 8.0 \u03bcm, 3.6 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm films, respectively ( Table 1 ). The SIMS depth profiles of each BDD film are shown in Fig. S1 . The average boron concentration values reported in Table 1 are based on the flat portion of the depth profile. The EIS spectrum of each of the samples was also measured using a 3-electrode cell with PBS electrolyte, and the impedance values at 1 kHz are listed in Table 1 . Like the boron concentration, the 3.6 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm films have similar impedance values, while the impedance of the 8.0 \u03bcm film was slightly higher. Higher boron doping concentrations result in increased film conductivity [27, 34, 35] , so the lower impedance values for the 3.6 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm films compared to the 8.0 \u03bcm film were expected.",

            "text": "Both the boron doping concentration and grain size may play a role in the performance of the BDD films as electrochemical sensors. It has been shown that the boron concentration effects the surface loading density of DNA strands on BDD [25] . \u0160 vorc et al. showed that the density of electrografted 4-nitrophenyl groups on BDD increased as the boron doping level increased, which was attributed to an increase in specific conductivity. This may not apply to our surfaces since the functionalization was carried out chemically instead of electrochemically; however, there is some evidence suggesting that higher boron doping leads to increased surface oxygen groups [36] . This could lead to higher antibody loading densities for samples with higher boron doping, since the functionalization chemistry is dependent on the conversion of surface OH groups to NH 2 groups to covalently bind the biotin-streptavidin linker complex. Since the 3.6 \u03bcm film had approximately 4.2 times the boron doping concentration of the 8.0 \u03bcm film, it is expected that functionalization of the former will result in a higher antibody loading density than the latter. In regards to grain size, Rogien et al. demonstrated that larger diamond crystal sizes resulted in higher antibody loading densities [21] . This was attributed to a preference of binding sites for sp 3 -hybridized carbon, which is more prevalent in the diamond crystallites than in the grain boundaries, which are comprised primarily of sp 2 groups. Smaller grains give rise to more grain boundaries, and therefore a higher sp 2 content, and lower antibody attachment. In this case, the 3.6 \u03bcm film had a smaller average grain size than the 8.0 \u03bcm film, which could result in a lower biofunctionalization yield for the former. However, the electrochemical detection data shown below (Fig. 4) clearly shows that the 3.6 \u03bcm film had greater sensitivity for S1 subunit binding than the 8.0 \u03bcm film. This indicates the increased boron doping concentration of the 3.6 \u03bcm film, as described above, plays a significant role in determining the antibody loading density. Comparing the 3.6 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm films, which have similar boron doping concentrations, it is expected that a higher antibody loading density would be achieved for the former, which has a larger grain size. A comparison of the EIS spectra for all three films after functionalization is shown in Fig. S3 . Here, the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) values serve as an indication of relative antibody loading density, where greater R ct values indicate a higher antibody surface coverage. Based on the EIS spectra and R ct values of the functionalized BDD films, the antibody loading density is in the following order: 3.6 \u03bcm film > 8.0 \u03bcm film > 0.7 \u03bcm film.",

The values of the other equivalent circuit elements (solution resistance R soln , constant phase element Q, and Warburg impedance W) were relatively constant at each protein concentration (Table S2 ).

This may be due to a better antibody loading density on the 3.6 \u03bcm film, arising from its higher boron doping concentration compared to the 8.0 \u03bcm film. A higher antibody loading density allows for more S1 subunit binding at each concentration tested, and therefore a stronger signal. The 3.6 \u03bcm film was also tested for specificity by incubating the surface with an Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein. Though \u0394R ct does increase with increasing Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein concentration, the overall change is less than when incubated with the S1 subunit, indicating a subunit concentration for the 3.6 \u03bcm film (green) and the 8.0 \u03bcm film (red). The 3.6 \u03bcm film was also tested for binding of Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein (purple). The plotted data represents n = 2 total sensors \u00b1 1 standard deviation. Lines are best linear fit.

Non-specific binding interactions are to be expected due to electrostatic interactions between biological material and the BDD surface [37] , and should always be taken into account when discussing impedimetric sensors due to the potential to produce false positive results. In this work, non-specific interactions could be somewhat mitigated by reducing the BDD film roughness, as described in later sections. Table 2 summarizes the sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) for the detection of the S1 subunit for each of the films. The sensitivity is derived from the slope of the linear best fit line, and the LOD is determined from this slope (S) and the standard deviation in the \u0394R ct values (S y ) using the following equation [22] :",

This is important for SARS-CoV-2 sensing applications, as there is interest in detecting the virus in solutions such as wastewater, saliva and other biological matrices. A commercially available cell culture medium containing L-glutamine, phenol red, and various salts was used as a representative complex matrix for these experiments. This is the chosen storage media for real human SARS-CoV-2 samples by a local research laboratory. Initial experiments utilized the same approach described above, in which increasing concentrations of the S1 subunit suspended in cell culture media were incubated directly on the functionalized BDD surface, followed by a wash step, then EIS measurement in the electrolyte solution. This process was found to be not suitable for complex matrices, as significant non-specific binding of the cell culture media prevented a discernable response from S1 subunit binding. Therefore, we explored a new detection method to limit the effects of non-specific binding of the sample matrix.",

An increase in the \u0394R ct value due to S1 subunit binding could now be distinguished from binding of the cell culture media components. Fig. 5 shows the \u0394R ct as a function of S1 subunit concentration in cell culture media for the 3.6 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm films, where the concentration of 0 fg/mL corresponds to incubation with the cell culture medium only. In these experiments, a wider concentration range was tested, and it was found that a 30 s incubation time was sufficient to observe S1 binding. The wider concentration range was due to the anticipation that the LOD would increase when testing a more complex sample matrix (LOD values are reported in Table 3 ). Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein was also tested using this method, and less of an increase in \u0394R ct was once again observed.",

(2)). Fig. 5B shows the increase in \u0394R ct as a function of S1 subunit concentration for the 0.7 \u03bcm film using the revised detection method for samples suspended in cell culture media. Compared to the 3.6 \u03bcm film, the overall response to S1 subunit binding was lower, indicating a reduced antibody loading density. This agrees with the findings of Rogien et al., since the grain size of the 0.7 \u03bcm film is lower than that of the 3.6 \u03bcm film [21] . However, the 0.7 \u03bcm film had a relatively flat response when testing with Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein. This is in contrast to the 3.6 \u03bcm film, which showed an increase in \u0394R ct with respect to Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein concentration. The decreased response to Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein for the 0.7 \u03bcm film indicates fewer non-specific interactions compared to the 3.6 \u03bcm film. This may be due to a lower surface roughness, and therefore lower surface area, for the 0.7 \u03bcm film. With a lower surface area, there are fewer sites for proteins or other biomolecules to non-specifically bind to the surface. It is encouraging to see that the increase in \u0394R ct from the Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein is independent of the protein concentration in the 0.7 \u03bcm film because this indicates that it is possible to discern between the response from specific and non-specific binding, even at a high concentration of interferents and lower concentration of S1 subunit. In fact, during these experiments, samples of the S1 subunit were added to the cell after the sensors were exposed to Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein, and the \u0394R ct began to increase again (Fig. S5 ). However, since there is still a substantial increase in the \u0394R ct after incubation with a non-specific species, which significantly overlaps with the signal for the analyte of interest, this must be taken into account in a real-world sensing scenario. In a commercial sensor, a threshold \u0394R ct value could be established, where responses above this value could be considered true positives. For example, in Fig. 5B , the maximum response after incubation with Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein was \u0394R ct = 0.042. With this as the threshold value, S1 subunit concentrations of at least 10 fg/mL in a test sample could result in a true positive.",

Though used extensively in impedimetric sensor work, K 3 Fe(CN) 6 has reported stability issues, such as etching of gold surfaces and reactions with surface bound species [8, 38, 39] . R ct stability issues did not arise in our initial measurements, in which sample incubation and EIS measurement occurred in separate steps, likely because the surface was not continuously exposed to the electrolyte mixture. To avoid R ct stability issues, the use of alternative redox probes, such as hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride (Ru(NH 3 ) 6 Cl 3 ) [8, [38] [39] [40] , ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) [8, 40] and ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) [8] may be a viable solution.",

Proof of concept was established by conducting EIS measurements and observing increases in the \u0394R ct value upon binding of the S1 subunit suspended in PBS. Analogous experiments with Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein showed significant nonspecific binding interactions, though the sensitivity was lower compared to that for the S1 subunit. An enhanced response for S1 binding was measured for the sample with a higher boron doping concentration, suggesting that the material characteristics impact the antibody loading density. A second set of experiments demonstrated the ability of the sensing platform to detect the S1 subunit in a complex medium. Here, small aliquots of S1 subunit suspended in a cell culture medium were added directly to the electrolyte mixture for EIS measurements. Using this method, the response to S1 subunit binding was measured after a 30-second incubation period, though a significant surface stabilization time was required due to possible reactions with the K 3 Fe(CN) 6 electrolyte mixture, an issue that remains to be addressed. Non-specific binding was once again observed when the surface was exposed to Influenza B Hemagglutinin protein, however the use of a BDD film with lower surface roughness appeared to improve specificity, likely due to a decreased surface area. This work demonstrates that rapid detection of the S1 subunit in complex media using EIS is possible, and that sensor performance may be improved through BDD material design. These results prove promising for the future development of tunable impedimetric sensors for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens in complex media.",
