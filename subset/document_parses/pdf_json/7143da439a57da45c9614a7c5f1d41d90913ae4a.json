            "text": "Purpose: This study explored how the Korean Medical Colleges responded to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the medical deans' perspectives on what and how these adaptions influence the present and the future of medical education. Methods: An email survey combining short and open-ended questions was distributed to all 40 Korean school deans in May 2020. Thirty-seven deans out of 40 medical schools in Korea (92.5%) participated. Results: Most lectures moved online but students' assessments were delayed and later held onsite. Clinical rotations continued except for an average of 3-week suspension during the first COVID-19 wave. The deans' remarks on the positive influences far outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on medical education. Although technological adaptations caused initial hardship, the experience gained through the use of various online learning systems led to attitudinal changes on the importance of adopting new technology and a tailored and student centric curriculum in medical education. Conclusion: The deans' perspective changes has shown the possibility of the deans' generation aligning more closely with the current Generation Z medical students. They projected further innovations in teaching and learning methods, especially applying flipped learning and highlighted the need to invest in faculty development so medical educators can be equipped and competent in diverse ICT (information and communications technology) learning platforms. Also, the need for advance preparations in medical education for future similar public health crises were stressed. Unprecedented changes brought by COVID-19 positively impacted Korean medical education in parts and the Korean deans envisioned further innovations using the experiences gained during this crisis.",

For Generation Z, computers and the internet are just part of life and they expect customized experiences which also includes how medical education is delivered [2] . Marshall and Wolanskyj-Spinner [3] state that the above characteristics may lend themselves to positive developments in the current COVID-19 situation.",

Institutional change is known to be difficult and tardy across all fields, and the conservative attitudes of medical educators in Korea were no exception. However, the Korean deans' perspective changes on medical education have been remarkable amidst these enforced and challenging situations.

Changes in the curriculum were also mentioned, such as reducing preclinical scheduled didactic teachings and cadaveric dissections. Some deans highlighted the preparedness for future similar public health crisis included the continuous investment on online systems, development of diverse online learning contents, and secure and stable online student assessments to cope with a possible more prolonged and complete lockdown: \"In the future, there is a high possibility such a situation may reoccur where online exams may need to be made routine.

In fact, medical schools in Korea were unprepared for the move to online education not only technically, but also culturally at the educational and institutional levels. However, this study showed that curricular adaptations to online education settled speedily. Interestingly, amidst these enforced and challenging situations, the Korean deans' perspectives were mostly positive, with promising prospects for the future of medical education. Whilst lectures and most of the practical sessions moved online, clinical clerkships fortunately resumed in Korea with only an average of a 3-week postponement, with the students' safety ensured in part by the full provision of personal protection equipment [17]. This was in stark contrast to many parts of the world, where medical education was heavily affected in the first half of 2020. The Association of American Medical Colleges [18] as well as medical schools in the United Kingdom[19] suspended all direct patient contact, clinical placements, and classes. The survey results showed that student assessment was the area of least change in Korean medical schools. The majority of examinations were delayed to the end of the semester and carried out on-site under strict infection control and prevention precautions, maintaining social distancing spaces between the candidates. We can interpret that this phenomenon was only possible due to the relatively low numbers of infected cases allowing onsite exams by the end of the first semester in mid-June 2020. However, to be prepared for a worsening situation by COVID-19 or any future health crisis, we may look upon the different approaches or lessons that other countries have undergone, such as the online 'open-book' assessment at Imperial College London that drew positive students' feedback [20]. There is a need to further our efforts to develop a reliable and valid online assessment for both written and clinical examinations. In our study, the 37 Korean medical school deans mention of the positive influences far outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on medical education. The positive experiences gained by both faculty and students through the use of various online learning systems led to attitudinal changes on incorporating new technology in medical education and school management. The early teething problems, mainly due to the technical naivety of the faculty, and lack of technical resources were short lived and all stakeholders, including students, faculty, and the institutions adapted rapidly, resulting in a much higher than expected student satisfaction level in regards to online learning. The deans' statement in this study were reflected in another Korean study which showed the anatomy achievement scores of the blended learning group being higher than those of traditional lectures reflecting the Generation Z medical students taking onto online learning like duck to water [21]. Negative comments from the deans concentrated on the difficulties surrounding medical professionalism and ethical education, already dealt by other publications [22], its delivery through an online medium, and gauging its efficiency remained uncertain. Significant number of deans also lamented on the missed opportunity in allowing their students to be involved in such inter-national health crises in favor of safety. Across the globe, there have been reports of student-led volunteer initiatives. The University of Nebraska adapted their curricula to recognize student volunteers [23]. Harvard Medical School's Medical Student Response Team offered clinical support and educated the community [10], and in Switzerland, medical student volunteers joined the COVID-19 testing teams [9]. This study revealed the deans' perspectives on the future of medical education post-COVID-19. Even after the pandemic, they expected the increase use of online education with high expectations on student-driven active learning such as flipped learning or TBL. Also, the deans suggested further investment for faculty development to help medical educators to be equipped for diverse ICT learning platforms and various new learning methods. In spite of ingrained difficulties in institutional change and multigenerational challenges [24], the deans' perspective changes in our study have shown the possibility of the deans' generation aligning more closely with the current Generation Z medical students. Especially, their recognition on the importance of tailored and student centric approach that can help empower learners to participate in accordance to their own time and ability [25]. The Korean deans voiced the need for advance preparations for future similar public health crises. Countries with low COVID-19 infection rates, such as Korea, allowed onsite clinical attachments and examinations to carry on. However, this double-edge sword has resulted in the underdevelopment of virtual/ online clinical learning and assessment modules. If similar public health crises emerge, medical schools that have been less affected this time round, ought to be prepared to replace onsite clinical education into virtual spaces by learning from those who have experienced and succeeded from it. There have been successful examples of digital clinical placements",

However, these publications were mainly single institutional observational studies, and a nationwide research on medical schools' response and adaptation to the current pandemic have been relatively limited. Also, previous publications reflected the important perspectives of teachers and students, but the voice from medical school leaderships has been reported less. Therefore, the authors of this study believe the gap in the literature could be supplemented by a national level survey inviting medical deans as participants. This study aimed to explore: (1) how the Korean medical colleges responded to the COVID-19 pandemic as it unfolded at the national level; (2) the medical deans' perspectives on what and how these adaptions influenced medical education. The Korean Association of Medical Colleges distributed a questionnaire survey to all the 40 Korean school deans via email between May 15th and 30th, 2020. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were offered. Survey questions were developed based on a review of relevant literature and consultations with international research collaborators in the United States, Taiwan, Japan, and Italy, where similar surveys were conducted [13]. The survey consisted of two-parts. For the first part, adaptations in the pre-medical/preclinical/ clinical curriculum due to COVID-19 were asked in short-answer type questions. The second part asked the deans about challenges, innovations, lessons from COVID-19, and perspectives on future medical education as open-ended free responses. Short-answer responses from the first part of the survey underwent basic statistical analysis including medians and frequency (IBM SPSS program ver. 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, USA). For the second part of the survey, a qualitative thematic analysis was conducted for the free text responses.
