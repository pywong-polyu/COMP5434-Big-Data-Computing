Although speculated that such paradoxical findings may be explained by impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in infected lung regions, no studies have determined whether such extreme degrees of perfusion redistribution are physiologically plausible, and increasing attention is directed towards thrombotic microembolism as the underlying cause of hypoxemia. Herein, a mathematical model demonstrates that the large amount of pulmonary venous admixture observed in patients with early COVID-19 can be reasonably explained by a combination of pulmonary embolism, ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the noninjured lung, and normal perfusion of the relatively small fraction of injured lung. Although underlying perfusion heterogeneity exacerbates existing shunt and ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the model, the reported hypoxemia severity in early COVID-19 patients is not replicated without either extensive perfusion defects, severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or hyperperfusion of nonoxygenated regions.",

This gives a ratio of shunt to nonaerated lung of 3, which is large compared with values of 1.25 \u00b1 0.8 reported for ARDS 1, 9 . A possible interpretation of this finding is that a disproportionately large fraction of the pulmonary circulation in COVID-19 patients is being directed through poorly aerated or nonaerated lung 1,3,10 , which has led some to hypothesize an underlying impairment in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) 1, 11 . That is, as HPV normally involves a local feedback mechanism whereby pulmonary arterioles constrict in response to poor regional oxygenation 12 , a failure of this response could potentially lead to a significant mismatch between ventilation and perfusion 13 . Impaired HPV is not the only possible explanation, however. COVID-19 is often associated with coagulopathy 14, 15 that can lead to microemboli, which in turn could redirect perfusion to lung regions having low or zero ventilation:perfusion ratios 16, 17 . Diffusion limitation that might arise when inflammation and edema thicken the blood-gas barrier can also cause hypoxemia.",

Could a ratio of this magnitude be explained by impaired oxygen equilibration? What roles might gravitational gradients and thromboembolic perfusion defects play?

The lung model was partitioned into 12 compartments ( Fig. 1) , representing three different height levels each partitioned into four compartments: injured-perfused, normalperfused, injured-nonperfused, and normal-nonperfused. Each perfused compartment received deoxygenated mixed venous blood and returned end-capillary blood with oxygen content determined by injury severity. Perfusion distribution in the model reflected the relative vascular resistance in each compartment as well as the presence of perfusion defects in the nonperfused compartments (e.g., owing to pulmonary embolism). Baseline resistances were determined by a specified baseline perfusion gradient, defined as half the range of perfusion across all height levels divided by the average. Vascular resistance was then adjusted in injured regions to reflect possible abnormalities arising in COVID-19. Three types of modification were examined: (1) normal HPV function increased resistance exponentially in regions with low end-capillary oxygen tension 18 ; (2) impaired HPV function produced no change in resistance; and (3) reversed HPV-reduced resistance regardless of oxygenation. Measured outcomes included F shu , ratio F shu :F inj , and ratio arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen (P a O 2 :F i O 2 ). In most cases, model conditions were intended to represent patients upon admission, without supplemental oxygen (i.e., F i O 2 = 21%), mechanical ventilation, or positive airway pressure. Conditions representing critical care patients are available as supplementary material, with increased F inj (Supplementary Figs. 5-9), increased F i O 2 ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ), and increased mixed venous oxygen tension (e.g., owing to venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ).",

Pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia both become more severe with increases in either the vasodilation (i.e., reduction in vascular resistance) of injured regions as a result of reversed HPV or the baseline perfusion gradient. Both of these factors determine the overall degree of perfusion heterogeneity in the injured lung, and in the specific case of injury focused in the lower lung, both contribute to enhanced perfusion to the injured region.

Despite a relatively small fraction of either poorly aerated or nonaerated injured lung, our model predicts that calculated shunt fractions in excess of three times the injured fraction can be explained by (1) extensive perfusion defect, (2) perfusion defect combined with ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the noninjured lung, or (3) hyperperfusion of the small injured fraction, with up to threefold increases in regional perfusion to the afflicted regions. Although perfusion defects exacerbate pulmonary venous admixture, without perfusion defect affecting >60% of the noninjured lung, some degree of either injured vasodilation or noninjured ventilation-perfusion mismatch is required to explain ratios of shunt fraction to injured fraction >3. An early stage of COVID-19 characterized by severe hypoxemia but relatively minimal parenchymal involvement 1,3 could be recapitulated in this model with dramatic reductions to vascular resistance in the injured regions. To replicate the reported values for F shu of 50% and F shu :F inj of 3 (implying F inj of 17%), our model without perfusion defect or ventilation-perfusion mismatching requires reductions in injured resistance of 60% to 70%, depending on the baseline perfusion gradient (Fig. 3) . Approximating vascular resistance using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, this change in resistance corresponds to an increase in vascular diameter of 26-35%. Whether this degree of vasodilation from baseline is physiologically plausible seems unlikely, given that maximal vasodilation using inhaled nitric oxide may decrease total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by up to 50% 19, 20 . Although speculative, it may be possible that COVID-19 interferes with the HPV feedback mechanism in such a way that pulmonary arterioles do not constrict, and may even dilate, in injured lung regions in which there is little or no oxygen transport into the blood 10, 11, 13, 21, 22 . Other evidence of vasodilation owing to COVID-19 includes recent discovery of cardiovascular complications reminiscent of vasodilatory shock and Kawasaki disease 23 , which is associated with weakened walls of the coronary artery.",

Columns correspond to three different cases of perfusion defect in the noninjured lung (PD) and venous admixture owing to ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the noninjured lung at 21% F i O 2 (VA).

We may speculate that the degree of vasodilation required to explain hypoxemia may be lower in patients not receiving positive pressure ventilation. It is uncertain to what degree the ratio F shu :F inj may vary in nonventilated patients compared to this reported value, as our modeling assumptions result from circumstantial evidence and small case series. A recent study using injected microbubbles suggests that vasodilation occurs in some mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and is correlated with P a O 2 :F i O 2 , however the sample size is small and the measurement technique is nonspecific regarding the location of vascular enlargement and the possibility of intracardiac shunt 11 . Without vasodilation in the model, impairment of HPV alone cannot reproduce the same extreme values of F shu :F inj > 2. Instead, the F shu :F inj ratio in the impaired HPV model is limited by the magnitude of the baseline perfusion gradient, particularly when the injured region also receives more baseline perfusion (see Fig. 2 ). The value of F shu :F inj = 1.3 reported for ARDS 1,9 is wellmatched in our model with a moderate baseline perfusion gradient of 30%, impairment of HPV, and injury focused in the lower compartment (see Fig. 2 ). This suggests that HPV impairment (e.g., owing to sedatives or anesthetic agents with vasodilating effects) and prevalence of derecruitment in the gravitationally dependent lung (typically dorsal regions in a supine patient) are plausible factors contributing to the observed F shu :F inj ratio of 1.3.",

With mild or moderate pulmonary embolism, ventilation-perfusion mismatching in noninjured regions and/or vasodilation in injured regions remain necessary to explain F shu :F inj \u2265 3. A case report using dual-energy CT demonstrated no obvious indications of pulmonary emboli in the well-aerated lung, but rather vasodilation of pulmonary arteries and hyperperfusion adjacent to infected regions, concluding that a likely explanation for hypoxemia involves \"intrapulmonary shunting towards areas where gas exchange is impaired\" 10 . Another case report found pulmonary embolism as well as vasodilation in the regions of ground glass opacification 21 . Vascular enlargement has been a common radiographical finding 22 . A recent study highlighted the prevalence of perfusion defects affecting large lung fractions in mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19, as well as dilation of peripheral vessels 30 . Thus, there is strong clinical evidence of vascular dysregulation in the lungs, and there may be potential for poorly aerated injured regions to exhibit at least impairment of HPV if not vasodilation.",

            "text": "Compounding the effects of large perfusion defects with abnormal HPV, a given ratio of F shu :F inj may be obtained at a lower level of vasodilation in the injured region (see Fig. 6 ). A recent study of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation reported dead space fractions (i.e., ratio of dead space volume to tidal volume) as high as 45% at the time of intubation 4 . Although this cohort may represent a later stage of COVID-19, these findings support the notion that disease progression is accompanied by perfusion redistribution away from aerated regions. If thrombotic pulmonary emboli occur during the early stages of COVID-19 as well, this could amplify the apparent F shu and hypoxemia. In cases of increased physiologic dead space, ratios of F shu :F inj = 3 may occur with lower, more plausible reductions of resistance in injured regions (30 to 50%), compared with the 60-70% reduction required without considering any physiologic dead space (see Fig. 6 ). The required amount of vasodilation is even less when there is non-negligible venous admixture from the noninjured lung, which can result from maldistributed ventilation and perfusion associated with pulmonary embolism 17, 31 . Thus, it seems plausible that microemboli and ventilation-perfusion mismatching can explain COVID-19 hypoxemia with or without hyperperfusion of the small fraction of injured lung. Responsiveness to increased inspired oxygen may help identify the relative contributions of pulmonary shunt and ventilation-perfusion mismatching (see Fig. 7 ) 32 . Another factor that may contribute to systemic hypoxia is increased oxygen uptake by lung tissues, which may account for up to 20% of total oxygen metabolism in patients with lung injury compared with only 5% at baseline 33 .",

Three mechanisms were considered: (1) alterations to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, (2) thrombosismediated perfusion defects, and (3) ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the noninjured lung. The model demonstrates that vasodilation of injured, unoxygenated regions appears to be a plausible yet unnecessary explanation for the reported severity of hypoxemia in early COVID-19, particularly when accompanied by amplification of venous admixture due to thrombotic pulmonary emboli and/or ventilation-perfusion mismatching throughout the noninjured lung. Hypoxemia in early COVID-19 may be explained by relatively small changes in all three factors simultaneously, or by larger changes in only one or two factors, and this should be further investigated.",
