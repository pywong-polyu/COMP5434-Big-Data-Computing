            "text": "Background In the pandemic time, many low-and middle-income countries are experiencing restricted access to vaccines. An access to imported vaccines or ways to produce them locally becomes the principal source of hope. But developing a strategy for success in obtaining and allocating vaccines is not easy task. The governments in those countries have faced di cult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against concerns over their e cacy and safety. Our aim was to analyze public opinion regarding the governmental strategies to obtain COVID-19 vaccines in three Central Asian countries, focusing particularly on possible ethical issues. Methods We searched opinions expressed either in Russian or in the respective national languages. We provided data of the debate within three countries, drawn from social media postings and other sources. The opinion data was not restricted by source and time. This allowed to collect a wide range of possible opinions that could be expressed regarding COVID-19 vaccine supply and public's participation in vaccine trials. We recognized ethical issues and possible questions concerning different ethical frameworks. We also considered additional information or scienti c data, in the process of reasoning. Results As a result, public views on their respective government policies on COVID-19 vaccine supply ranged from strongly negative to slightly positive. We extracted most important issues from public debates, for our analysis. The rst issue involved trade-offs between quantity, speed, price, freedom, e cacy and safety in the vaccines. The second set of issues arouse in connection with the request to site a randomized trial in one of countries (Uzbekistan). After considering additional evidences, we weighed individual with public risks and bene ts to make speci c judgements concerning every issue. Conclusions We believe that our analysis would be a helpful example of solving ethical issues that can rise concerning COVID-19 vaccine supply round the world. The public view can be highly critical, helping to spot such issues. An ignoring this view can lead to major problems, which in turn, can become a serious obstacle for the vaccine coverage and epidemics' control in the countries and regions.",

Any priority-setting rule for allocating vaccines among LMICs would invite ethical debate, and this has been the case for COVAX's, which tracks population size over other indicators of acute need [4, 5] . But the importance of this ethical choice for LMICs is overshadowed by the serious shortfall of vaccines available to COVAX for distribution. Countries producing vaccines, including those supporting COVAX, have practiced \"vaccine nationalism\", directing available doses to domestic needs for all citizens before any consideration of exporting to foreign nationals who may be in more acute peril.",

            "text": "In such restrictions, each of these LMICs must develop a strategy for obtaining and allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to avoid disaster. Understandably, the governments of LMICs and world pharmaceutical companies were interested in direct contacts to supply their communities with the necessary doses of the vaccine. This could guarantee faster pro t for vaccine producers and less vaccination cost for recipient countries, leading higher overall public health bene ts [6] . Several LMICs have received their rst vaccine shipments not from COVAX and world pharmaceutical companies, but from China and Russia, countries that use the vaccines to expand their in uence, while the US has stood on the sidelines [7] . India could also be considered an important contributor in vaccine distribution due to its massive manufacturing capacity. However, as a response to severe epidemic with raw material shortages, this country stopped its vaccines exports and started importing them [8] . The P zer/BioNTech vaccine, rst to demonstrate 95% e cacy in a large multinational trial [9] and approved in the US and the EU for mass vaccination has been hindered for distribution to limited manufacturing capacity. Although China has withheld claiming high e cacy of its Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccines until the end of phase III trials, Russia had declared its Sputnik V vaccine at 95% e cacy based on preliminary results [10] . The country reported phase I-II trials results last among leading producers; however, registered it rst for emergency use. Both China and Russia have actively offered early and low-cost supply of their vaccines round the world, sometimes proposing that recipient countries furnish a human subject site for randomized controlled vaccine trials. The reason, in addition to economic and political ones, has been the need to garner data about long-term safety. Although these sites have included highly populated countries such as Brazil, they have also included neighboring countries, such as Uzbekistan. The governments in those countries have faced di cult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against concerns over their e cacy and safety.",

An estimated threshold for COVID-19 vaccine e cacy, in case of full coverage, is about 60% at R 0 equal to 2.5-3.5 [25] . The e cacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 3 / 4 and rises to 80% when coverage drops to 3 / 5 of the community. This makes countries more interested in a higher vaccination coverage in the case of lower vaccine e cacy. The most di cult is how to de ne target coverage in the case of variety of vaccines with different e cacy. By this time, the lowest declared e cacy rate (70%), among known candidates, is in Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine [26] . This means that countries need 3 / 4 vaccination coverage in case they use only such vaccine as sole intervention. If consider that other applied vaccines may have higher e cacy, this coverage rate would be enough for a maximum public bene t. The cost of Sputnik V per patient is about half of the cost of P zer/BioNTech vaccine [27] . Chinese vaccines are comparable in cost with those from Western producers. A good point of non-Western vaccines is that they don't require subzero storage, so they are better suited for mass distribution in warmer climates. However, Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine can also be stored in regular fridge temperature.",

In round the world, government o cials demonstrate their adherence to COVID-19 vaccination. This also looks like the way to demonstrate that they share individual risk and bene t with their communities, in times of unclear or insu cient evidence about vaccines. However, most of such examples come from developed countries in which o cials and communities are supposed to be vaccinated with the same vaccines, leading the similar risk and bene t among them. In Central Asia, vaccines' de cit and potentially higher range in their e cacy and safety can lead to unequal distribution of individual risk and bene t, with possibility of an abuse of power. A low transparency can contribute to unjust vaccine access, leading the violation Article 21(2) of UDHR. Our data proves a low public trust to governments, and social media users claim the o cials of three countries to demonstrate their preparedness to get vaccinated with vaccines planned to be used for mass campaigns, that is to share the risk. This view can go even further, especially in times when cases of side effects and deaths after vaccines' use are going up. An important factor becomes whether access to emergency care will be equal for all in case of side effects. Communities cannot expect such justice if they experienced access highly depending on their social status. In case public do not see the response to these issues, this situation can lead a vaccine rejection or hesitancy in Central Asia, where communities historically were highly adherent to vaccination. An applying some prioritization strategies and policies that propose to vaccinate speci c subcommunities such as the elderly, live-saving or social service staff and close contact individuals [28, 29] will probably fail in this course.",

            "text": "From this view, an employment of mandatory vaccination looks inappropriate, this time, in Central Asia. We considered four additional conditions to make this decision [30] . First, a lower proportion of older population and lower than in Europe and US fatality rates make threat for public health less grave, in three countries. Kyrgyzstan has highest case fatality (1.71%) in a smaller population, and this can be due to the policy of registration of all unclear deaths as COVID-19, in the peak of the epidemic. However, estimates of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation consider Central Asia as region with the highest ratio of total COVID-19 deaths to reported deaths [31] . An issue can be that all three countries had relatively low coverage by PCR testing, due to its high cost [32] . This can be a factor both increasing and decreasing the true epidemics burden in the countries. Second, even phase III trials data, there are common both experts and public concerns that vaccine testing has been rushed, and they may not be as safe or effective as they are declared. And this issue relates more to Russian and Chinese vaccines. This is condition decreasing public and individual bene t and increasing individual risk of the vaccination in three countries. Third, a systematic review of observational studies con rmed effectiveness of social distancing and wearing mask in reducing COVID-19 transmission [33] . This means that they still have high potential as alternatives to vaccination, especially in communities where they were not widely applied. Finally, another problematic issue is how proportionate can be coercion in a case of mandatory vaccination. In addition to unequal individual risk distribution, one can expect that coercion will be too strict, leading to signi cant human rights violation and social restrictions.",

The countries can use vaccines with a lower cost, in case they have this or higher e cacy rates. The cost will also include expenses for storage and transportation of vaccines.
