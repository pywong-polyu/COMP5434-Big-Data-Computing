Suboptimal performance issues, high costs and limitations in regards to scale-up production, illustrate the major caveats of traditional vaccine approaches for a time-sensitive response to emergent pathogens with pandemic potential (2, 3) . Despite significant advances in vaccine research and development, human vaccinology was arguably kept in a relative stalemate in the pre-pandemic era with limited innovative vaccine approaches receiving licensure (4) . On the other hand, veterinary science is a fertile ground for the development and commercialization of novel vaccine technologies. Direct evaluation of vaccine efficacy in target species capitalizes on the growing interest in livestock and companion animal health driving the progress and innovation of veterinary vaccines (3, 5) .",

While vaccines are the most effective countermeasure for disease prevention, limitations in vaccine effectiveness against heterologous IBV strains, pose a great threat in disease control. Improvement on current serological assays such as ELISA is pivotal for the development of more potent IBV vaccines. In this regard, Yin et al. developed and validated an ELISA that utilized a peptide comprised by a conserved, across variant IBV strains, epitope of the S2 subunit of the spike protein. The high sensitivity and specificity of this novel diagnostic assay facilitates early identification of anti-IBV antibodies from day 7 post-immunization and detection of antibodies against multiple IBV genotypes, and could prove to be a valuable tool for the generation of effective IBV vaccines.",

Kalaiyarasu et al. recently optimized a recombinant M2-HA2 fusion protein, comprised by conserved regions of the corresponding M2 and Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, across highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus (HP-AIV) strains, as a broadly protective HP-AIV vaccine strategy. However, a relative disadvantage of second-generation vaccine platforms, is that they often require the presence of adjuvants (7) . Thus, an important aspect for the generation of effective vaccines is the enhancement of their immunogenicity by including a potent adjuvant. Lee et al. evaluated a novel adjuvant that was able to protect vaccinated mice from lethal AIV challenge and elicit comparable, to the commercial adjuvant, humoral responses against AIV and Newcastle disease virus in vaccinated chickens.",

A review by Gracia et al. addressed the implications of utilizing commercial inactivated vaccines for disease control as a result of the complex epidemiology of IAV worldwide. Additionally, the authors provide an overview of the innovative IAV vaccine approaches currently explored in swine. First-generation IAV vaccines predominately target anti-HA specific epitopes and show limited efficacy against heterologous strains. Neuraminidase (NA), is an attractive IAV immunogen due to the limitations of HA-targeting constructs. Anti-NA antibodies inhibit the enzymatic activity of NA thus rendering Neuraminidase Inhibition (NI) assays as the golden standard for assessing NA-targeting humoral responses (8, 9) . Skarlupka and Ross reported that raw sera may have non-specific NA inhibitory activities. Innate NA inhibitory properties can skew the NI assay results, if sera is not properly treated, which could prove detrimental especially when assessing novel NA-based vaccine technologies.",

On this account, Kim et al. measured the differential antibody responses induced by different antigenic forms of Salmonella Gallinarum (SG) in vaccinated chickens, with the intention of detecting antigenic epitopes that could be utilized in highly immunogenic SG vaccines. Another ICB infection that poses a significant zoonotic threat is Brucellosis. Huy et al. developed and evaluated the efficacy of a novel vaccine consisting of four recombinant Brucella abortus proteins. This combined subunit vaccine (CSV) enhanced the expression of innate bactericidal factors and conferred comparable protection in mice against disease and bacterial replication, to the commercial vaccine, by inducing a robust Th1 phenotype immune response.",
