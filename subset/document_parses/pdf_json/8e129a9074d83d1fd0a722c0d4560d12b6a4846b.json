In this paper, we propose a method to find temporal factors affecting the human mobility lifestyle. We collected GPS data from 100 smartphone users in Japan. We designed a model that consists of 13 temporal patterns. We then applied a multiple linear regression and found that people tend to keep their mobility habits on Thursday and the days in the second week of a month but tend to lose their habits on Friday. We also explained some reasons behind these findings.",

            "text": "Understanding individual human mobility plays an important role especially when the geographic spread of the infectious virus that causes COVID-19 has taken the world into uncharted territory. Not only that, it is also a critical factor in policy planning [1] , [2] , travel demand forecasting [3] , [4] , location-based recommendation/service advertising [6] , or location-based personal authentication [5] . M. Gonzalez et al. [25] proved that human mobility follows a high degree of regularity. Therefore, several sophisticated models have been proposed to determine the factors influencing the probability that people tend to increase and lose their mobility lifestyle. The factors can be classified into spatial, temporal, and social in which temporal one has been proved to be the most important affecting factor. However, the temporal factors found in existing work are still coarse-grained (i.e., weekend/weekday without clarifying which specific days of the week, or which week of the month, etc.)",

            "text": "S. Zhao et al. [10] observed that 80% successive checkedin POIs (Points-of-Interest) happen in less than 32 kilometers. They explained that people often act around their home or office, so even being independent with the last check-in, the successive check-in can still happen in the same activity area. S. Yali et al. [11] analyzed the two location-based social networks Foursquare and Gowalla. They found that the probabilities for distances within 5 km are greater than 40%, which decrease to17% and 8% within 10 km on the datasets, respectively. Most users checked in within 20 km. T. Thao et al. [13] , [14] leveraged the idea that the locations at close time clocks have a closer correlation in physical distance than the locations at far time clocks since a human needs a period of time to move from a location to another location gradually. The experimental result showed that the extracted distance coherence features along with the longitudes and latitudes could improve the authentication's accuracy. While all the papers [10] , [11] , [14] focused on the fact that closer locations have a higher probability of being visited by users, Y. Hongzhi et al. [12] raised a more challenging problem when people travel to a new city where they have no activity history. They showed that people tend to travel a limited distance when visiting venues and attending events. Furthermore, the activity records in their non-home cities are only 0.47% of the activity records when living in their home cities. To solve the problem, the authors analyzed the two factors including user interest (e.g., kids would pay more attention in playgrounds while young ladies may be more interested in cosmetics stores) and local preference (e.g., people are more likely to visit local sightseeing attractions and attend popular events in the city when they travel to an unfamiliar city). They found that the factors also affect the decision to visit an unfamiliar location.",

They found that weekly patterns (7 days of the week) and weekday/weekend patterns can capture the temporal checkin preferences of a user. However, the results do not clearly indicate which day of the week, weekday, or weekend is the affecting factor but only the general patterns. S. Zhao et al. [23] found that the day of week check-in pattern at different hours: users take more check-ins in the late afternoon and the evening from 04:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. on weekends than the weekdays. Saturday and Sunday take a similar pattern, while the days from Monday to Friday take a similar pattern that is different from the weekends. It may infer that weekday and weekend are two types of effects on the check-in behavior of the user. J. Bao et al. [24] split a week into two parts including weekdays and weekends. For each part, they split a day into hourly time bins. A total of 24 \u00d7 2 time bins are used for the expression of temporal patterns. M. Gonzalez et al. [25] measured the return probability for each individual. They found that the probability that a user returns to the position where the user was first observed after t hours for a two-dimensional random walk should follow 1 t ln 2 (t) . The return probability is characterized by several peaks at 24h, 48h, and 72h, which indicates a strong tendency of humans to return to locations they visited before. M. Xie et al. [8] explored the importance of spatial, temporal, and social factors and found that they can be ranked as follows: temporal effect > content effect > spatial effect. This indicates the temporal factors may provide the most information although of course, combining them is the best solution.",

The authors analyzed the Gowalla dataset and found that a friend or a friend-of-a-friend has visited more than 30% of the new places visited by a user in the past. With the same observation that social friends tend to have similar check-in behavior, several papers [16] - [19] also extracted the similarity score between the users derived from the social friendships. The experiment result showed that it could enhance the accuracy. Besides the links of friend and friend-of-a-friend, H. Bagci et al. [20] showed that local expert is also a factor affecting the place to visit. J. Bao et al. [21] pointed out that users who visit many high-quality locations tend to have high knowledge about the vicinity. In a similar manner, if a particular location is visited by many high-quality users (i.e., experts), it is more probable for that location to be a quality location. L. Kai et al. [22] aimed at the service locations only, such as restaurants, fitness centers, etc. They found that the factors including demographics, preferences, and service levels (e.g., price range, discount or not, advertisements) can increase the probability of mobile users visiting the service locations.",

Almost all of the data (99.7%) should be within three standard deviations from the mean; and 99.7% of the z-scores to be within the range (-3, +3) . Therefore, we scanned all the zscores and could find six samples that have any of 13 variables with z-score greater than 3 or less than -3. The 6 outliers are the 1st, 4th, 8th, 22nd, 30th, and 82nd sample in D P denoted by outlier (\u22123,+3) = {s 1 , s 4 , s 8 , s 22 , s 30 , s 82 }. Our aim is to remove the smallest number of outliers such that the p-value of the residuals can be increased up to 0.05 or more. We, therefore, run an algorithm to perform the Jarque-Bera test after removing each k-combination of the elements in the set outlier (\u22123,+3) . k is chosen in ascending order from 1 to the length n = |outlier (\u22123,+3) | = 6.
