Colonial efforts sought to eradicate Indigenous communities as a matter of government policy (Deloria, 1988; Coulthard, 2014; Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014) . While the current pandemic affects everyone, minority and Indigenous communities in the United States experience its effects disproportionately (Hatcher et al., 2020; Hathaway, 2020; Power et al., 2020; Rodriguez-Lonebear et al., 2020) . To combat these effects, Native nations have asserted their inherent sovereign authority to protect their citizens (Curley, 2020; Gunderson, 2020; Lakhani, 2020; Walker, 2020) . Whether these assertions are made by declaring states of emergency, securing borders, or adopting public health codes, Native nations are demonstrating the importance of having public health and emergency preparedness infrastructures in place to effectively meet community needs during this global public health crisis.",

Hoss (2019a) begins to shift this narrative by providing a framework for tribal public health law that includes four pillars: 1) Native nations are inherently sovereign; 2) federal Indian law impacts intergovernmental relationships among Native nations, states, and the federal government (and, as a result, public health); 3) Native nations exert authority through tribal law; and 4) interventions without tribal consent can further undermine public health and promote structural violence. We situate this brief research report in this framework to understand the public health institutional capacity that exists in Indian Country during this current pandemic. We add to this discussion the importance of incorporating Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the role of the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance for outside researchers, governments, and organizations when Native nations are adopting public health and emergency preparedness policies (RDA International IDSov IG, 2019) .",

Indigenous data governance activates Indigenous data sovereignty by aligning the collection, application, use, and stewardship of Indigenous Peoples' data with their values, cultures, and interests (Walter et al., 2018; Carroll et al., 2019) . The rapid response that occurs during times of emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic does not excuse outsiders from disregarding or neglecting to follow Indigenous data sovereignty practices. During this time, it is even more important to practice good data governance and build partnerships that honor tribal sovereignty. Such practices and partnerships fall within the CARE Principles framework, which affirms Collective Benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics (RDA International IDSov IG, 2019) . The UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, Jos\u00e9 Francisco Cali Tzay (2020), emphasizes engaging representative institutions during this time; however, this warning assumes infrastructure and capacity exists in most communities. As we begin to examine existing public health and emergency infrastructure, we see there are areas for Native nations to grow and develop to meet the demand (Groom et al., 2009) .",

In the 1980s, as control over health care services and facilities began to shift from the federal government to the tribes, the predominant focus on treatment began to change. The Indian Health Service (2015) (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for providing federal health services to federally recognized tribes, began to invest in preventative care and environmental services (Sequist et al., 2011) . This period saw a growing number of tribes governing health services according to their own needs and assuming a larger role in the delivery of health care to their own peoples. This trend was concurrent with increased attention to preventative programs as well as to behavioral and mental health issues (Rainie et al., 2015) .",

The ISDEAA and amendments began a shift in tribal control of IHS health care funding and facilities (Rainie et al., 2015) . A series of amendments to the ISDEAA-P.L. 100-472 in 1988, the Indian Health Care Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102-573), and the Tribal Self-Governance Amendments of 2000 (P.L. 106-260)-enhanced tribal control through the creation of self-governance compacts for health care services that provide money through block grant-like mechanisms for Native nations to administer programs and design services to meet tribal priorities (Dixon, 2001; Rainie et al., 2015) . In essence, the amendments gave tribes the right to decide how to use federal funds. IHS administers the contracting and compacting processes provided under the ISDEAA and Tribal Self-Governance Act. As of 2016, IHS had negotiated 90 self-governance compacts with federally recognized Tribes. 1 In 2017, through P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination contracts, Native nations and Alaska Native corporations administered 19 hospitals, 284 health centers, 79 health stations, and 163 Alaska village clinics. 2 This shift in federal policy has broadened public health and emergency opportunities for Native nations to proactively meet the health needs of their communities rather than constantly having to react to the emergency at hand.",

While tribal control of health care services and facilities has increased, a need remains for investments in tribal public health infrastructure in order to monitor public health, address emerging needs, provide services, and create informed policies (Warne, 2005; Tribal Epidemiology Centers, 2013) . In addition, Native nations see challenges to exercising that authority such as building public health infrastructure; establishing relationships, roles, and responsibilities with state, county, and local health departments; and data and information sharing (Richmond and Ross, 2009; Hernandez and Robinson, 2014) . To do this, nations need access to resources. Oftentimes this means access to federal programs and services that are vastly underfunded. In the United States., health inequities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous mainstream populations have existed for decades (Rhoades et al., 1987; Brenneman et al., 2000; Johnson and Rhoades, 2000) . As a result, we see variation in the effectiveness of tribal public health systems in Indigenous communities in the United States.",

The direct relationship between Native nations and the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is fairly new. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) of 1988 authorizes the United States' President to declare an emergency or major disaster in situations where the responses are beyond the capacity of a state or local government. Since the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-2), \"The Chief Executive [or Governor] of an affected Indian tribal government may submit a request for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists consistent with the requirements.\" Prior to this law, tribal governments had to rely on state governors to request a presidential declaration on their behalf (Sunshine and Hoss, 2017) . However, Native nations were not simply waiting on the United States to intervene when addressing emergency or disaster efforts in their communities. Native nations have passed emergency management plans as early as 1990 in the case of the Navajo Nation (2020). Since 2013, more than 40 Native nations have directly requested presidential declarations to address areas of COVID-related matters, severe storms and flooding, and other natural disasters. 3 Sunshine and Hoss (2017) argue that Native nations might consider using emergency declarations as \"critical\" public health tools to access resources and loosen the bureaucratic red tape that often impedes a nation's ability to respond. By passing emergency tribal laws, Native nations assert another level of governing authority to respond to public health crises.",

The enactment of tribal public health and emergency codes has occurred at a lower rate than the codification of other governmental authorities such as economic development and law and order. In 2014, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) found 520 public health-related codes that fell into 10 different categories: agriculture and food safety; alcohol, tobacco and other drugs; animal management and control; emergency planning and management; environmental health; health data; health services; health systems governance; infectious disease management; injury and violence prevention; public health infrastructure; and health and cultural resource protections. As NCAI notes, many public health provisions adopted by Native nations are often framed around public safety. Bryan et al. (2009) conducted a similar study finding 56 publicly available tribal codes that address public health. Similar to NCAI, the authors categorized the codes into broad themes: \"environmental health and sanitation; public safety and injury prevention; protection from violence and abuse; substance abuse, mental illness, and tobacco; communicable disease control, surveillance, and research; and other.\" These studies begin to provide more evidence of the ways in which Native nations are actively asserting their sovereign rights around public health and emergency management in preparedness to meet these needs. Additionally, in the mainstream United States, the Centers for disease Control and Prevention's Tribal Emergency Preparedness Law (2017) provides an understanding of what is needed during emergencies such as incident command centers, points of contact, and health communication systems.",

We searched and accessed any publicly available codes through the Tribal Law Gateway on the National Indian Law Library and the Tribal Court Clearinghouse databases. To make sure that we exhausted all databases, we conducted a google search using \"tribal public health code\" and \"tribal emergency code\" key terms. The code titles range from Communicable disease, Vaccination, and Quarantine Ordinance, Community Health, Emergency Management and Homeland Security to Environmental and Public Health Ordinance, Health and Safety, Health and Sanitation. Using an iterative process geared toward pandemic public health response and based off previous work by Hoss (2019b) , CDC (2017), NCAI (2014), and Bryan et al.

The ordinance states that once the Business Committee, the Chairperson, or its successor determines that a state of an emergency exists, they have the authority to declare an emergency (San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, 2020).",

Fifteen codes explicitly affirm a nation's authority. Other affirmations might be interpreted by the existence of self-governance compacts. Twenty-three (56.1%) of the Native nations included in this dataset have negotiated selfgovernance compacts with the federal government, which demonstrates a nation backing up its sovereign authority to negotiate a compact by passing its own rules and laws. On the other hand, only five codes mention the distinct culture or belief system that guides the nation and serves as a foundation for sovereignty. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) includes a Tribal Health Philosophy in its Environmental Health and Safety Code.

            "text": "In a time where access to health data is increasingly a challenge, we would expect to see more mentions of health data governance in the more recently passed public health and emergency codes. However, that is not the case. Of the 41 codes adopted, only nine (22%) include data sharing provisions. With respect to reporting authorities, the Yurok Tribe's Public Health Ordinance states, \"The Yurok Public Health Officer is authorized to report to a local health department, State Department of Public Health, and/or the Indian Health Service any information concerning a reportable disease or condition, an unusual cluster, or a suspicious event that they reasonably believe has the potential to be caused by or an indicator or bioterrorism\" (Yurok Tribe's Public Health Ordinance, 2020). Yurok public health officials have the authority to report public health concerns to outside governments; however, the code does not mention power to enter health data agreements. In March 2020, the National Indian Health Board (NIHB) surveyed the ability of tribal leaders, providers, and partners to adequately address the COVID-19 emergency. In addition to federal and state communication, and diagnostics testing, respondents listed one of the anticipated challenges as \"planning for outbreak management\" (National Indian Health Board, 2020). Indigenous Data Sovereignty affirms Native nations rights to outside and nation-specific data, and pandemic and pre-pandemic guidance asserts these nations' need to access data in order to effectively plan for and manage potential outbreaks (Carroll et al., 2019; Rainie et al., 2017; Urban Indian Health Institute, 2020) .",

However, from 2006 to 2009 timeframe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in iowa (Health and Safety code passed in 2007) is the only nation in the dataset to have included provisions for disease outbreaks in its code, which are specific to notification procedures. Snoqualmie Tribe's Emergency Management Department code defines its scope as \"to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from injury and damage to persons or property resulting from emergencies or disasters, whether natural or man-made\" (Tribe Snoqualmie, 2021) . Whereas, as mentioned previously, Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Law, 2007 Communicable disease, Vaccination, and Quarantine Ordinance states the need to prepare for bioterrorism. We can infer from the data that as Native nations are incorporating emergency provisions in their codes, tribal officials are making the effort to address the capacity in which these emergencies might be met. Among the codes adopted or amended in 2020, we see Native nations creating institutions to sustain them during the pandemic particularly in two states where governors were arguably more resistant to act according to CDC recommendations ( Figure 2 ).",
