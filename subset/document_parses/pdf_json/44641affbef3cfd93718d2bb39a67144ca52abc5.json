As the contagion rate and death toll decreased, the so-called \"Phase 2\" started, with progressive reopening of ordinary activities involving social interactions by the second half of May. During the summer, people were free to move through Italy and many asymptomatic subjects likely contributed to spreading the infection and precipitating a more severe second wave that unsurprisingly started from September. In autumn, the Italian Government provided new rules, introducing a three-tier system of progressive restrictions, based on the local coronavirus situation. From March 2020 to the end of February 2021, the number of positive cases in Italy exceeded 3 million, with over 100,000 deaths, in a country of about 60 million people [3] .",

Furthermore, we observed a switch in volumes between \"high-priority\" and \"low-priority\" surgery, with the latter almost reaching pre-pandemic levels. This was probably due to the maintenance and implementation of some strategies identified for the post-peak period, in preparation of a second wave [7] . For instance, the coordination of local health facilities to redistribute outpatient services allowed the number of visits to increase, avoiding overcrowding of the hospital facilities. On the other side, the strict compliance with the priority class of intervention favored some typical pediatric orthopedic surgeries, such as minimally invasive or arthroscopic surgery, growth modulation surgery, and, in general, surgery that requires minimal hospitalization and no use of intensive care.",

Telemedicine has been largely and effectively used during the pandemic [10, 17, 18] . The advent of models such as virtual clinics is completely re-designing the concept of care, offering a viable, efficient approach to treat a variety of pediatric musculoskeletal disorders, but this needs further studies, especially regarding legal, safeguarding, safety and security issues [18] [19] [20] [21] . Another and more worrying explanation could be that, while the overall volumes of trauma patients decreased, the injury pattern changed, as reported in recent studies concerning adult trauma [13, 14] , thus requiring hospitalization more frequently. Lockdown-and quarantine-related measures, such as school closings and social isolation, could have increased domestic violence, child abuse or neglect, and self-harm. Unfortunately, our study was not designed to distinguish the type, causes and severity of trauma requiring surgery; therefore, we cannot provide further evidence in favor of or against this hypothesis. Nonetheless, we emphasize that outreach and injury prevention messaging may be useful in response to the potential adverse effects of lockdown or quarantine, especially in children [13, 22, 23] .",

Nonetheless, elective surgery does not mean \"optional surgery\" [24] . Most of the elective surgery in pediatric orthopedics regards children with congenital malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and genetic and rare diseases. In this population, some interventions such as growth modulation, osteotomies, or soft tissue procedures may achieve the dual purpose of improving patient's quality of life and reducing the need for more invasive operations at the end of growth. Moreover, \"highpriority\" elective surgery was reduced during the \"year of COVID-19\". If the decrease in \"priority B\" interventions (which often concern the treatment of neonatal conditions, such as CDH or CTEV) can be partially explained by the decline in the Italian birth rate [25], the decline in \"priority A\" interventions, especially in operations for bone tumors or infections, during the first quarter, is more concerning. In such cases, the delay of surgery could worsen the prognosis; this \"side effect\" has already been reported in other studies, as a potential consequence of the lockdown measures [26] [27] [28] .",

The method of capturing data by hospital databases, using the ICD-9 codes system, cannot accurately distinguish between conditions that present different degrees of severity.
