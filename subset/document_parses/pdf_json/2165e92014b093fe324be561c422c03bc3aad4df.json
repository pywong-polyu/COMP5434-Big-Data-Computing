Covid-19 infection primarily involves the lung with severity of illness varying from influenza-like illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other organs have also found to be variably affected. Studies evaluating the histopathological changes of Covid-19 are critical in providing a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and guiding treatment. Minimally invasive biopsy techniques (MITS/B) provide an easy and suitable alternative to complete autopsies. In this prospective single center study we present the histopathological examination of 37 patients who died with complications of Covid-19.",

The biopsy samples were then stained with haematoxylin and eosin stain. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using CD61 and CD163 in all lung cores.

Associated bronchopneumonia was seen in 37.5% patients and scattered microthrombi were visualised in 21% patients. Immunostaining with CD61 and CD163 highlighted megakaryocytes, and increased macrophages in all samples. Immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was observed in Type II pneumocytes. Acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization was seen in 46% of the renal biopsies but none of them showed evidence of microvascular thrombosis. 71% of the liver tissue cores showed evidence of Kupfer cell hyperplasia. 27.5% had evidence of submassive hepatic necrosis and 14% had features of acute on chronic liver failure.

Four of the biopsies showing acute hepatic necrosis also showed prominent microvesicular steatosis. In one of the liver biopsies showing features of ACLF, the histological features were like an acute exacerbation of autoimmune inflammation. However, the most common histological finding was Kupffer cell hypertrophy seen in 21 (72.41%) biopsies. In 3 biopsies (10.3%) there were features of non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF), in the form of portal vein thrombosis in 2 biopsies with or without focal sinusoidal microthrombi. Portal inflammation, interface hepatitis, or lobular necroinflammatory activity were not prominent in any of our cases. While significant portal mononuclear cell infiltrates were identified in 13 (44.82%) biopsies, in only 3 biopsies the portal inflammation was dense, while in only 4 of these biopsies the portal inflammation was moderate. Lobular inflammation was identified only in 5 (17.24%) cases ( Figure 6 ). In 4 biopsies (13.79%) there was centrizonal hemorrhagic necrosis, histologically suggestive of heart failure. Macrovesicular steatosis in zone 3 and zone 2 were identified in 4 (13.79%) and diffuse macrovesicular steatosis was noted in one biopsy ( Figure 6 ). Out of the liver biopsies showing macrovesicular steatosis, two of these patients had a history of chronic hypothyroidism, while all of them also got steroids as part of their management regimen during the current hospital course of the COVID-19 related episode.In two of the biopsies from patients with hypothyroidism, we also identified prominent nuclear glycogenization ( Figure 6 ). Liver biopsy cores from 4 of these deceased were within normal histological limits.

In pathological examination of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) patients, DAD(exudative) is known to be the predominant feature till the 6 th day followed by a transition to organising phase till the end of the second week before progressing to fibrotic stages. (11) The median duration of hospital course before death was 7 days in our series, which explains the predominance of DAD features. Associated bronchopneumonia, particularly in association with organizing DAD, was observed in 13 patients, of which obvious bacterial etiology in the form of bacterial colonies was observed in only two cases.

Whether the changes of centrizonal hemorrhagic necrosis (13.7%) and macrovesicular steatosis (17.2%)were related to terminal congestive cardiac failure or patients' metabolic syndrome, or were also contributed by virus-induced pathology could not be fully ascertained at this stage. Two of the cases of NCPF described above showed portal vein and sinusoidal thrombi (Figures 6D, K & L). However, the paucity of thrombosis in the rest of the cases of hepato-biliary system corroborated well with findings of studies done previously, as exemplified in a recent systematic review.(13)Though in our cohort of liver biopsies, hepatic lobular inflammatory cell infiltrate was not prominent, changes of hepatocyte degeneration as ballooning, acidophil bodies, MDBs(Mallory-Denk bodies), and microvesicular steatosis were prominent. Lack of inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver has been described in earlier reports on fatal Covid-19 infections.(18) Our findings disagree with the observation of Sonzogni A et al.(21) that liver is not a primary target of Covid-19 infection and only vascular changes in liver are observed. In this cohort, we identified substantial histological changes of hepatocyte necrosis, degeneration, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, micro, and macrovesicular steatosis, more than the vascular changes.(21) The relative paucity of inflammation in the liver may be related to the treatment regimen or the inherited limitations of sampling by biopsies. Our histological findings match with those described by Lagana SM et al. except the fibrin ring granulomas the authors identified in 3 of their cases out of 40 liver biopsies examined(22). Out of the 8 liver biopsies which showed acute hepatic necrosis in our series, macrovescular steatosis was identified in 3 (37.5%) and microvescular steatosis was noted in another 3 biopsies (37.5%) [Supplementary Table 1]. A report from China on 300 fatal Covid-19 cases, it was found that steatosis and high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were the indicators of clinical aggressivenes.(23) This needs further elucidation. Except for paucity of the bile duct in one of our cases, the bile duct pathologies were not prominent in our cases, supporting the observation of Tian S. et al(4). All rights reserved.

The relative paucity of inflammatory cell infiltrates or fibrin thrombi in organs like liver, kidney, and myocardium may have been related to sampling limitations or therapy-related changes(anticoagulants). It was difficult to ascertain whether the pathological changes were entirely related to the viral pathology or reflected the comorbidities in the deceased patients. However, this study adds to the growing evidence that though pulmonary pathologies are most prominent in COVID-19 infections, extra-pulmonary organs like the liver and kidney are also affected, often remarkably.",
