Facing this unknown, unexpected, and devastating disease, prevention, and control of COVID-19 are a great challenge for the entire world. On December 27, 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were first identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province and the biggest city in China's central region [2] . On January 19, 2020, the spreading of COVID-19 between humans was determined [3] . During this period, community spread and clusters of cases emerged in Wuhan, and confirmed cases were also reported in other Chinese regions, which were due to virus carriers traveling before the most important traditional holiday, the Spring Festival, in China [4] . Since January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 in the Chinese mainland became most pressing with the rapid increase in new confirmed cases. As a crucial step to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the Chinese government took the decisive measure to close outbound traffic from Wuhan city and Hubei province on January 23, 2020. Hubei province was the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Since December 31, 2019, and as of November 30, 2020, more than sixty-two million cases of COVID-19 have been officially reported by the World Health Organization in 216 countries, areas, or territories, and is likely to claim many more [5] .",

            "text": "COVID-19 research has already caught the attention of the majority of scholarly communications communities in 2020. The analysis and modeling of COVID-19 data have been one of the research topics. Computational simulation and modeling of the existed COVID-19 data have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic [6] . The well-known SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) and modified SEIRS models have been widely used to model epidemics including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 [7, 8] . Singhal, Singh, Lall, et al. used a Gaussian mixture model to model and predicted the COVID-19 pandemic in India, the prediction results agree well with a very popular study based on the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [9] . Ayinde, Lukman, Rauf, et al., used statistical models in simple, quadratic, cubic, and quartic forms to model Nigerian COVID-19 cases, and found out that daily cumulative forecast values of the Least Absolute Deviation estimator for May and June 2020 with a 99% confidence level [10] . By considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, Zheng, Du, and Wang, et al. embedded the natural language processing module and the artificial neural network into the improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model to build the hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) model for COVID-19 prediction in China [11] . Gao, Zhang, and Yao, et al. proposed using a Boltzmann function-based model to forecast the cumulative number of COVID-19 death in China with high confidence [12] . In theory, the prediction of the trend of COVID-19 is a special case of pattern recognition, which provides a tool to unravel the hidden rules and principles of an unknown and novel epidemic from the perspective of mathematics. Models can help the governments to make decisive policies to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. But, we should distinguish between what the models can and cannot predict. However, we also should realize that all proposed models are incomplete to describe the realworld system, especially for an epidemic or pandemic period [13] .",

To characterize the transmission properties of an epidemic at the early outbreak stage mathematical models have been widely used [14] . Modeling enables early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control actions in the battle against the COVID-19. A datadriven epidemic prediction model could provide a quantitative framework to explain the reported data, improve the epidemic scale forecast, assess and optimize the impact of interventions and control strategies through data mining from the perspective of statistical learning theory [15] . The generalized-growth model (GGM) is a typical data-driven model, which only uses the publicly reported data without a complex hypothesis and prior knowledge. GGM is one of the useful models to characterize and forecast early outbreak at the ascending phase of the epidemic. GGM is described by the following differential equations,",

It's that more than 90% of the confirmed cases at the early stage were in Wuhan city, the original epicenter of China's COVID-19 outbreak [20] . Wang, et al. employed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the basic reproduction number that is 5.78 (95% CrI 5.71-5.89) by using the number of cumulative confirmed cases from 10 January to 4 February 2020 in mainland China [21] . It is worth noting that February 4 is an important turning point in the COVID-19 in China, and the transmission trend was under control [22] . This is the main reason responsible for the relatively large basic reproduction number when compared with our result. Wan, et al. proposed a COVID-19 transmission dynamic model to estimate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province by using the data including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases, and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020 [23] . The calculated basic reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CrI 3.20-3.64) in reference [23] , which is a description of a prolonged transmission period under the strict containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government.

There is no doubt that the massive migration and gathering of people during the Chinese Lunar New Year accelerated the rapid transmission in the first several weeks of the outbreak.

            "text": "In this paper, the difference of spatial transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the early outbreak stage with prevention and control measures are discussed. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 trend of China at the early time was described from the statistical perspective using a mathematical model. The epidemic modeling given by the GGM model indicates that the early outbreak of COVID-19 exhibits both global polynomial and local exponential growth patterns. The differences between the estimated basic reproduction number also indicate that COVID-19 are sustaining localized outbreaks in some neighboring provinces and the ones with related industry chain and close economic partnership. The consecutive decline of the new confirmed cases indicates that the prevention and control measures taken by the China government have contained the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a short period. ",
