Many education programs had previously adopted objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) to assess communication abilities inperson with standardized patients (SPs). However, comparative student outcome data between virtual and in-person methods as well as guidance on how to conduct communication-based OSCEs in the virtual environment is lacking. The University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (SSPPS) describes its methods of conducting two types of communicationbased OSCEs (patient counseling and gathering a medical history). Student performance data from the two virtual OSCEs in 2020 was compared to results from two 2019 in-person OSCEs using Mann Whitney U Tests. The 2020 cohort scored significantly higher than the 2019 cohort in all variables (i.e., using effective verbal and non-verbal communication, using patient friendly education, organizing the encounter, demonstrating empathy, establishing trust, professionalism) and in overall score. However, the effect size for these findings indicate the differences between performances are generally small and more likely due to changes in grading patterns due to the pandemic.",

Most often, OSCEs in pharmacy education are completed in-person with use of standardized patients (SPs) [4] . However, the COVID-19 pandemic quickly necessitated a shift to virtual delivery of OSCEs.

This included an assessment of ability to collect a medical history from a patient, and was not part of a course. This will be referred to throughout this study as the Cumulative OSCE. An additional assessment, which will be referred to as the Patient-Centered Communication Course 2 (PCC2) Patient Counseling OSCE, assessed students on counseling a patient on two prescription products with unique dosage formulations. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a swift shift of both assessments to the virtual setting via Zoom (Zoom Video Conferencing 2020). Student performance on these two different skills-based communication assessments completed virtually in 2020 were compared to student performance on the same assessments completed in-person one year prior. The University of Florida College of Pharmacy recently described implementation of an OSCE in their PharmD program, however this description did not expound upon virtual methods for delivery [5] . Due to the lack of overall guidance on methods for implementing pharmacy based communication OSCEs in the virtual environment, we will also discuss procedures and recommendations for executing a successful virtual OSCE.",

For this assessment, students were required to counsel a SP on two prescription products with unique dosage forms (e.g., inhalers). Students' communication skills were graded by SPs utilizing a standardized rubric focused on verbal and non-verbal communication skills as well as establishing trust, providing patient friendly education and organization of the encounter. Due to the remote nature of the 2020 assessment, product information handouts were utilized as a visual supplement during the counseling session rather than the demo inhalers used during the 2019 in-person assessment.

Students' communication skills were graded by SPs using a standardized rubric.

Student scores on the cumulative OSCE were statistically significantly higher in the global feedback variable of establishing trust. Students performed similarly between the in-person (2019) and online (2020) OSCE on all other variables. While there were statistically significant differences between 2019 and 2020 scores, with higher scores in the 2020 (virtual) groups, median scores and interquartile ranges were similar across all variables, thus effect size was calculated for significant findings. The PCC2 variable related to establishing trust barely crossed the threshold to be described as a medium size effect. All other comparisons of these effect sizes can be described as small. Anecdotally, course directors mention the possibility of evaluators unconsciously grading more leniently in light of challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, due to limitations with virtual proctoring, there is a risk for decreased exam integrity. As 2019 was also our first year for the cumulative OSCE, it was primarily used to pilot the process and obtain preliminary data, and students were not penalized for poor performance. Brief examination of frequency tables do support this notion as there were more scores at the lower end of the scale in 2019 than in 2020.",

To start, training the evaluators, faculty and SPs should be done using live, online training sessions and include mock run through sessions. Outside programs, such as Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams version Microsoft Teams in Office 365), should be utilized for external communication regarding exam questions and alerting the hosts of technical issues. Mandatory practice assessments that mimicked the exact format of the assessment proved to be critical in the efficiency in which the actual assessments were run. These practice sessions allowed students, faculty and SPs to work through potential issues, technology and logistics in a low-stakes environment. Practice assessments also improved consistency in grading as questions regarding the rubric and student performance were discussed prior to the exam. In a recent article detailing tips for conducting an OSCE in a virtual environment for medical students, Hopwood and colleagues recommend extra training including completing a full-run through of the OSCE the day prior [6] .",

This method is a feasible way to prepare students for communication-based OSCEs, and it has demonstrated ability to improve communicationrelated skills such as enhancing ability to display empathy in a patient encounter [8, 9] . However, results are mixed regarding if the level of empathy demonstrated to a virtual patient is more or less than that expressed to a human SP [10] .

Proctoring or hosting virtual based assessments requires the ability to orient students, provide instructions, place students in appropriate breakout rooms and handle technology related issues. Occasional schedule delays are inevitable in the virtual setting due to technology related issues, and having extra timeslots built in the schedule can provide make-up opportunities. We recommend having a backup room and backup facilitator and/or SP for students who are having technology related issues. We also recommend having at least two proctors for these exams, which allows one to assign student rooms, while the other handles technology related issues.",

We use room and work place scans to ensure there are no notes, rubrics or electronic devices present. We also have students share their screens to ensure they do not have documents on their screen that are prohibited on the assessment. We require students to use gooseneck cameras for online examinations so we can see their computer screen since this area is not seen with typical laptop cameras during a room scan. We have the SP or facilitator record the session, including the initial room scans, so the videos can be reviewed at a later time if there are questions regarding academic integrity. These videos may be released to students after the completion of the assessment for self-reflection and learning. Assessing students on skill rather than knowledge lends itself very well to virtual assessments where there is concern for the maintenance of academic integrity, as inappropriate sharing of assessmentrelated information is irrelevant when students are assessed based on skill demonstration. Similar to strategies described by Lucas and colleagues, we also maximize academic integrity by requesting students to present their identification cards upon entry to the online meeting room, requiring that students have their microphone and video on at all times, and providing different scenarios or cases part way through assessments [14] .",

Communications-based OSCEs delivered in a virtual manner can serve as a bridge for educational programs as they move towards emphasizing telehealth skills, which as recognized as critical in the future of pharmacy. Experiences at SSPPS revealed virtual assessment is not a detriment to the learner, and that trust and empathy can be developed and maintained in the virtual environment. SSPPS is likely to continue using a hybrid of virtual and in person assessments going forward. We implore other programs to explore virtual methods, if able, to conduct skill assessments over eliminating skill assessments with limitations to in-person assessments during the pandemic.",
