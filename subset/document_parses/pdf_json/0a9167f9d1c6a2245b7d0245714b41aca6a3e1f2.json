            "text": "December 2020, Denmark received a notification from the Early Warning and Response System of the European Union (EWRS) about a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.1.7 [1] ) spreading fast throughout the United Kingdom (UK). The notification was a direct response to genomic sequences uploaded to the GISAID [2] database by the Danish COVID-19 Genome Consortium (DCGC). On 18 December 2020, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), advisers to the British Health Authorities, released a public statement, reporting a 71% (95% CI: [67%, 75%]) increased transmissibility for the B.1.1.7 lineage and elevated it to variant-of-concern (VOC) [3] . The B.1.1.7 lineage was first detected in the UK in September 2020 and has since spread across the world [4] , including Denmark where the first identified case was sampled on 14 November 2020 [5] . Several studies have since estimated an increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, ranging from 29 to 130% [6] [7] [8] [9] . This is in line with early estimates of 36%-55% from Denmark [10, 11] . Hypotheses for increased transmissibility include higher viral load, longer infection period, and better receptor binding [1, 12, 13] .",

Most notably is the spike protein amino acid substitution N501Y which enhances binding to the ACE2 receptor and is thought to increase transmissibility [1] . Acquired mutations can be used to construct the phylogenetic relationship between genomes and by coupling with temporal information, transmission timing and dynamics of emerging lineages can be inferred [14] . These approaches have been used by several studies to gain insights into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on a national level [8, 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Hence, on 2 January 2021, B.1.1.7 was predicted to exceed 50% relative abundance nationwide in the middle of February [5, 20] , which formed a key argument in the political decision to further extend the lockdown at the time and intensify contact tracing on all B.1.1.7 cases [21] . In this study, we utilize data from 175,213 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, to substantiate early results by providing an updated estimate of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7. Furthermore, using genome isolates from 1976 case of B.1.1.7 with detailed and comprehensive metadata, we outline the dynamics of B.1.1.7 in Denmark to evaluate the impact of introductions and regional restrictions on the prevalence and spread of B.1.1.7.",

Selection was done by cycle threshold (Ct) values, using cutoffs between 30 and 38 in the study period [24] . Whole genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a modified version of the ARTIC tiled PCR scheme [25] targeting a total 33 overlapping amplicons between 1000 and 1500 bp, and a custom 2-step PCR strategy was used for barcoding the amplicon libraries. Barcoded libraries were normalized and pooled and prepared for sequencing with the SQK-LSK109 ligation kit (Oxford Nanopore), and sequencing was performed on the MinION device using R.9.4.1 flowcells (Oxford Nanopore). A complete protocol can be found at protocols.io [26] . The raw sequencing data was basecalled using Guppy v.3.6.1 (https:// nanop orete ch. com) and demultiplexed using a custom cutadapt v.2.10 [27] wrapper. Generation of consensus sequences were done using the function \"artic minion\" with default settings from the Arctic Network bioinformatics protocol v.1.1.0 [28] , which uses Medaka v.1.0.3 (https:// nanop orete ch. github. io/ medaka/) for consensus calling. The consensus sequences were masked in the beginning (54 bases) and end (67 bases) to avoid primer biases. A consensus sequence with less than 3000 ambiguous bases (approx. 10% of the genome) were considered a \"high-quality genome\" and used in the national SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. If not, the consensus sequence was considered failed and not used. A haplotype was assigned to a consensus sequence, if there existed > 1 consensus sequence with the same set of nucleotide mutations. Nucleotide mutations of designated haplotypes used in this study are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 . ",

PastML was used to reconstruct ancestral states using a four state F81-like model for nucleotide substitution generalized to the number of geographic states [41] . Under the F81-like model, the migration rate from a state i (e.g. geographic region) to a different state j (i \u2260 j) is proportional to the equilibrium frequency of j, termed j. The rescaling factor which is analogous to the mutation rate under a strict molecular clock is optimized in PastML, in addition to the state equilibrium frequencies. In other words, the rescaling factor represents the average number of character changes per year for timescaled trees. This is applied to all tree branches, which represents the average number of character changes per branch unit. Setting the -resolve_polytomies option, geographic group labels are used to resolve polytomies and create subtrees for each unique group. This procedure takes place after ancestral inference has been performed [40] .",

Furthermore, a window with stable restrictions was enforced from January 4th until partial reopening of primary schools from February 8th. A Poisson regression model was fitted on daily counts of B.1.1.7 to estimate increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 relative to all other lineages. We found a growth rate of 0.021 and \u2212 0.062 per day for B.1.1.7 and other lineages respectively, corresponding to an increased transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%, 60%]) for B.1.1.7 assuming a generation time of 5.5 days [12, 43] .

            "text": "Introductions into Denmark and onward viral migration between regions were investigated using a timescaled phylogenetic tree of 1976 Danish B.1.1.7 genomes and 3611 representative international sequences from outside Denmark ( Fig. 2A) . We used pastML [39] to perform an ancestral state reconstruction, to infer if sequences were introduced from outside Denmark or transmitted from another Danish region. We define an introduction lineage as a phylogenetic group of Danish sequences that share the same introduction event, similar to the definition of UK transmission lineages in [16] . We do not infer the timing of introduction events from the phylogeny [9, 16, 44] , but instead use the first occurrence of an introduction lineage as a proxy justified by the intense testing and high sequencing rate (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). An introduction lineage can be further subdivided into transmission clusters from the ancestral state reconstruction, which is based on the regional and temporal sub-distributions of an introduction lineage. The inferred connections between transmission clusters outline the direction of viral migration between regions. The first cases of B.1.1.7 observed in the Capital region of Denmark on 14 November 2020 defines the introduction lineage CA1, which contained the majority of Danish sequences (736 of 1976, 37%) across all Danish regions (Fig. 2B) . The maximum likelihood tree and corresponding time-scaled tree is shown for the CA1 introduction lineage in Fig. 3 . We tried to resolve the origin of CA1, but detailed epidemiological investigations revealed no direct or indirect travel link and the ancestral state could not be resolved with good confidence. The CA1 introduction lineage is associated with the first reported cases of B.1.1.7 in all Danish regions, including the first North Denmark transmission cluster CA1-135. This transmission cluster was part of a large but local outbreak verified by epidemiological investigations and primarily associated with a single local superspreading event (haplotype H77, Additional file 1: Fig. S2B ). CA1-135 dominated the North Denmark cases until it was last observed in week 2 (Fig. 2B) . This contrasts the course of the first transmission clusters in other regions, which showed similar initial growth (CA1-108 in South Denmark and CA1-124 in Zealand) but remained at high prevalence throughout the study period. Interestingly, all transmission clusters appearing up until week 1 in North Denmark were not observed in the remaining study period, which were not true for other regions where a constant level of sustained transmission was present for many larger transmission clusters (Fig. 4A ). In the North region, 7 of 11 municipalities had elevated restrictive measures until 16 November 2020 due to circulation of mink-related lineages [42] . The intensified contact-tracing and genomic surveillance in that period likely kept the reproductive numbers for North Denmark below that of other Danish regions, making it difficult for any cluster to develop from local to sustained transmission. As the transition to sustained transmission likely happened during the modeling period, this could also explain why the model underestimated expansion of B.1.1.7 in the North region after the study period ended (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A ). Case numbers of B.1.1.7 in South Denmark and Capital also increased to higher levels than what was predicted by our model (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A) , likely caused by large superspreading events, evident from the rapid increase of unique local haplotypes in South (H17 and H87) and Capital (H43) regions (Additional file 1: Fig. S2B ). Overall, we identified 103 introductions and 107 viral migration events between regions of B.1.1.7 in the study period (Fig. 4) . The majority of introductions occurred during the first half of January 2021 (Fig. 4B) ; 37 introductions showed no onward transmission, 36 introductions had between 2 and 5 cases of whom 8 exclusively had transmission within the same household, and only 5 caused > 100 cases. To investigate the impact of introductions across time, we considered early cases of the same introduction lineage to be introduction-related, while later cases occur due to sustained transmission in society. To evaluate this, we increment the number of followup days for cases to be assigned as introduction-related (Fig. 4C) . Overall, the relative contribution of introduction-related cases peaked during onset of B.1.1.7 and again in mid-January (Fig. 4C ). Introductions alone (follow-up =0 days in Fig. 4C ) accounted for around 5-10% of all cases with substantial temporal variation. Using up to 14 days follow-up since the first case of an introduction to define introduction-related cases within the same introduction lineage, there were periods where > 50% of cases were due to importation from outside Denmark (Fig. 4C ).",

The majority of transmission was local and occurred within regions, but would to a large extent cease if not fueled by introductions from other regions or outside Denmark (Fig. 4D) . The Capital and South Denmark regions with international borders and substantial international travel-activity also received the most introductions, possibly a combined effect of multiple factors such as leisure travel and commuting for work. A similar conclusion was reached by normalizing according to the population size of each region (Additional file 1: Fig. S4) , except for the Zealand region which relative to its population size received a high amount of importations. Interestingly, the Capital region also had the highest number of outgoing viral migration events to other regions, acting as an important source for sustaining B.1.1.7 in Denmark, particularly in the Zealand region which has a large number of residents commuting to the Capital region on a regular basis.",

In Denmark, genomic surveillance has been key to rapidly predict growth of B.1.1.7, leading to enforced restrictions in effect from 5 January 2021 when B.1.1.7 was still below 2% relative abundance of all SARS-CoV-2 variants [45] . Enforced restrictions practically eliminated all other circulating variants within 2 months (Fig. 1B) and enabled epidemic control to be maintained as society was gradually reopened from 8 February 2021. We estimate an increased transmissibility that is in line with estimates made from previous studies [7] [8] [9] 12 ]. However, it is possible that the rising frequency of B.1.1.7 across Europe during the study period cased a greater number of B.1.1.7 introductions which may have inflated the estimated transmissibility of B.1.1.7. Restrictions aimed specifically towards B.1.1.7 were in place prior to the modeling period, and the relative number of introductions was lower in the period used for modeling compared to before (Fig. 4C) . Therefore, we do not expect this to be of major concern, but further studies would be needed to verify this [46] .",

Similar studies have investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics during the early stages of B.1.1.7 in the UK [19] and USA [8, 9] . In the UK, evidence suggests that B.1.1.7 emerged from one defined geographical area with substantial within-area transmission before spreading across the country [19] . We found the development of B.1.1.7 in Denmark to be similar, as the initial CA1 introduction lineage had sustained itself within the region for several weeks before spreading to all other Danish regions within 4 weeks (Fig. 2B) . Elevation of B.1.1.7 to VOC status occurred on 18 December 2020, few weeks after it was first observed in the Capital region in November 2020. Therefore, CA1 may have developed substantially through undetected transmission within the Capital region. Its high prevalence and transmission could have caused a spill-over effect to other regions, accelerating growth of this lineage in those places. This has been reported in the UK and may explain why estimates of B.1.1.7 transmissibility in the UK dropped from December 2021 onwards, as early estimates were too high [19] .",

These observations and conclusions of the observed dynamics at regional level were reached independently of any detailed demographic data, providing explanatory context to the overall observed epidemiological patterns of prevalence.

From 22 December 2020 onwards, authorities enforced elevated restrictions for travelers from the UK to halt B.1.1.7 expansion [21] . This did not, however, affect the proportion of cases derived from introductions, which increased from December 2020 to mid-January 2021 (Fig. 4C) . Similar measures were enforced for inbound travelers from Italy and Austria in the spring of 2020 to stop SARS-CoV-2 from spreading to Denmark [48] , questioning the efficiency of country-specific restrictions and non-enforced recommendations of self-isolation after travel. However, the extent of this cannot be derived from the data in this study alone and does not necessarily generalize to other countries with different restrictive measures. In addition, we found only limited agreement between reported travel history and that inferred by the ancestral state reconstruction. This highlights the limitations of available genomic data, which is still heavily biased both geographically and temporally [49, 50] , making high-resolution inference of introduction origin from phylogenetic data alone very difficult.",

We identified an increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, in line with findings from other studies. In addition, our study is one of only a few describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of B.1.1.7 at a national level [8, 9, 19] and the only study to our knowledge that comparatively assess the impact of foreign introductions vs interregion viral migration of B.1.1.7. Both types of spread caused onward transmission that constituted a substantial portion of cases, in a period of travel and community restrictions. Maintaining a high level of genomic surveillance in Denmark, despite its currently limited usage for contact tracing, has been pivotal to enable swift response in the face of new VOCs, the origin and timeliness of which are virtually impossible to predict. However, a global coordinated effort of genomic surveillance coupled with epidemiological and contact tracing data is needed to track and mitigate transmission of VOCs [19] . This is perhaps even more important as vaccine rollouts are happening unequally across the globe, posing very different adaptive challenges for SARS-CoV-2, the consequences of which on viral evolution are difficult to predict [57] .",
