Caries (and the dental cavities it produces) create very significant personal, societal and economic burdens across the world, despite dental cavities being largely preventable. This is why so many individuals and groups are collaborating to do something to improve the world landscape of avoidable cavities. Over the past 20 years, a series of international partnerships have been developed in caries research, education and management, which have paved the way for a shift towards collaborative, inter-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder approaches to caries. This paper: 1) discusses the motivation for individuals and organisations to collaborate towards 'service to society'/'making a difference'/'making the world a better place'; 2) explains that collaboration to make an impact is undeniably complicated, but highly desirable; 3) suggests that successful collaborations typically need to be sustainable and longterm; 4) provides some examples from the caries world of the range and depth of collaborations making a difference; and 5) suggests that we now seem to be at multiple 'tipping points' to accelerate the progress of integration, intersectoral and interprofessional collaboration and of aligning caries control with the broader context of oral health and general health globally.",

Intimate working knowledge of the specific area under consideration is needed to plan and achieve beneficial societal or economic impact; therefore, the collaborations and actions must be tailored 'glocally' (using global values and evidence but adapted for local use).

With the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new format of the guidance was required for treating children without aerosol generating procedures.

However, it seems that we might be approaching an acceleration of progress as there appear to be a series of multiple tipping points. Perhaps the most obvious is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated and encouraged change and how it can be contemplated. At the time of writing, there now seems to be an increasing appetite for using evidence and for all forms of prevention, as well as an increasing awareness of health inequality with a desire to do something about it. There is also an increased interest in environmental and green issues around the climate and sustainability (linking to avoiding amalgam or plastic restorations) and an increased awareness of global aspects of health and global thinking. These shifts in public and political views can make long-needed changes now possible, having demonstrated that unusual alliances can be effective and welcome and that government/ private partnerships can be effective if properly managed and have given increased prominence for the World Health Organisation (WHO).",
