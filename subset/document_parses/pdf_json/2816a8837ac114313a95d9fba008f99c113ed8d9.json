And what if one indicator, 'number of vendors with suspected illness', was collected by local health authorities on a routine basis? Well, if this would have happened and this 'non-traditional' indicator was also monitored by a central public health authority, the outcomes for the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak could have been very different.",

Without the systems in place to bridge national and subnational capacities for better preparedness, localised health events will remain undetected until the signal becomes loud enough to be picked up by the existing public health infrastructure. Strengthening early detection is essential for the public health entities responsible for preventing, detecting and responding to infectious disease outbreaks; having robust and timely data are the only way to benefit from the extra weeks or days that may be gained from earlier detection and that are so critical to controlling an infectious disease outbreak. There is a wealth of data routinely collected across a range of indicators and using a variety of monitoring and evaluation tools and programmes. These data are not readily accessible and the mechanisms to understand and effectively analyse and use the data in decision-making for national health security and preparedness is lacking.",

            "text": "With wide participation from 113 WHO Member States, the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) has become a meaningful exercise to attune national interests and promote cross-sectoral coordination to strengthen International Health Regulations (IHR) capacities. IHR monitoring framework includes the State Party annual reporting process and voluntary external evaluation using the JEE tools, after-action reviews and simulation exercises. 3 A key tool within the WHO's IHR monitoring framework, the JEE uniquely convenes national actors across sectors and is externally validated by peer country experts. While it elevates the visibility of health emergency preparedness, it is a large resource-intense multi-sectoral exercise that is logistically difficult to perform annually-the recommended frequency is every 4-5 years. 4 The challenge is that outbreaks do not stop. The JEE indicators have been found to accurately measure essential public health functions, such as disease surveillance and laboratory capacity as well as health threats stemming from communicable disease at the national level, 5 but the first edition JEE, which has been used most extensively, did not consider much on the subnational capacities, cross-border outbreaks or integrate animal health surveillance data (beyond known zoonotic diseases)-even though the preponderance of emerging infections have zoonotic origins. 5 Also, this process convenes national leaders without much representation from subnational levels or the informal and private sectors. 6 These limitations can lead to lapses in national health security knowledge and awareness, which results in a skewed understanding of global health preparedness writ large-this has already been noted in other 'global' preparedness tools such as the Global Health Security Index. 7 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the latest evidence that national preparedness and global health security must be underpinned not only by essential technical capacities but also local multi-sectoral public health intelligence and behavioural health data, which must be accessed and analysed in order for governments to take early action to respond to acute threats and crises. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Local data and National Public Health Institutes The International Association for National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI) includes membership from National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs) in 99 countries. 13 In many contexts NPHIs were first established because of, and in response to, public health challenges typically related to infectious diseases and house the capacities to effective monitoring of national health security and preparedness, including surveillance, evaluating and analysing health information, and epidemiological research. 14 In recent times, the breadth of programmes and activities undertaken by NPHIs globally has expanded as they confront new threats and risks to public health, evolve their vision and mandate, and respond to leadership and political priorities. 14 Thus, NPHIs are increasingly being positioned as the main agency to monitor, evaluate and report on various aspects of national and subnational preparedness, playing a critical role in global health security. [15] [16] [17] The structures of NPHIs vary, with many NPHIs existing within Ministries of Health; yet, many have limited access to non-health emergency related data. Even when a national integrated disease system exists, there is still potentially useful data that stays within disease-specific programmes and information systems. The siloed nature of data and the limitations of data sharing are often mirrored subnationally and amplified at the intersectoral level. For example, organisations that manage humanitarian crises can provide important information on internally displaced persons, as well as refugee movements. 18 19 Very few NPHIs have access to these data. In part due to lack of a mechanism in place to enable the effective use of this data for decision-making. 20 COVID-19 has shown us that this fragmentation is a problem for even the best resourced NPHIs, as insufficient data have hampered many countries responses. 21 22 If NPHIs are to have robust public health intelligence to detect and even predict disease outbreaks they must be positioned to access, analyse and act on health security relevant data from all relevant sources. 23 24 In 2018, a pilot project was developed through the collaboration and input of several NPHIs and partners to strengthen national accountability for preparedness.",

To understand the need and utility for these indicators three NPHIs collaborated to pilot these methods: the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Pakistan National Institute of Health. The specific activities to achieve these aims were: 1. Definition of JEE-gap areas 2. Rapid review for global gap-relevant indicator-based frameworks. 3. Identification of national level indicator-based frameworks. 4. A two-round Delphi process to prioritise indicators for pilot country NPHI monitoring and evaluation plans. Five a priori JEE-gap areas were applied as parameters to conduct all peer-reviewed and grey literature searches and characterise all outputs (table 1). Gap areas were created and identified through iterative consultative meetings with Chatham House and Geneva Institute, IANPHI and partners, and relevant teams from the WHO Health Emergencies Programme. Additionally, each gap area was considered in light of three crosscutting themes: cross-border coordination, subnational preparedness and One Health. A maximum of two gap areas were selected per NPHI: the first gap area 'travel and trade' was selected by the WHO stakeholders in Geneva and the second gap area was selected by the piloting NPHI (ie, 'knowledge and data sharing' for Pakistan and Ethiopia and 'health systems resilience' for Nigeria). This ensured that the project aligned with both national, regional and global preparedness priorities.",

The JEEgap areas presented in this paper reflect expert feedback; these do not represent comprehensive gaps in public health preparedness and there is a need for further research to identify others. We used a rapid review to identify global level frameworks and a convenience sample of informants for national level frameworks; this most likely resulted in missed frameworks and indicators-this was especially noticeable in regards to the lack of granular local data (eg, below health facility). This process can also be time-intensive. NPHIs may use our key words and identified frameworks to reduce time or do stage 1 and stage 2 separately and as needed. National level framework identification was heavily influenced by existing relationships held by the NPHI or Project Team. While all countries had very little involvement from the travel and trade industry, Nigeria identified a higher proportion of indicators for that gap area since it had recently completed the WHO's Strategic Tool for Assessing Risks. 35 Thus, to expand their reach of frameworks within gap areas, countries should leverage existing multi-sectoral assessments as well as consider local datasets identified by district or provincial/regional sources. Finally, the second edition of the JEE was released in 2019 and has expanded in some areas, namely subnational inclusion and zoonotic surveillance. 4 Although, its frequency and much of its indicators remain unchanged and so our process would still be beneficial for regularly monitoring preparedness at a national level.",
