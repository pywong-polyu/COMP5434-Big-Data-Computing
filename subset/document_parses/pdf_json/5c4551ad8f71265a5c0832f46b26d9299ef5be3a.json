This posed multiple challenges, including devising new ways of working and rapid development and delivery of training.

The review will have missed literature published outside of these dates and not included in these databases.",

Building HCWs' competence and confidence is an essential principle of safe redeployment. 4 Induction training must be provided to reacquaint redeployed HCWs with ICU ward multidisciplinary team practice, introduce them to clinical practices to care for COVID-19 patients and adequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE). 5 Time constraints and infection control measures pose unprecedented logistical challenges for training delivery, with traditional training methods such as those imparted in classrooms or at conferences not being possible. The impact of redeployment on HCW well-being has also been identified. 6 7 Redeployed HCWs have expressed concern in relation to their safety, the impact of their work on family members (including infecting them with the virus) and their own training and career progression. 6 8 A range of novel strategies to implement redeployment and share knowledge in the context of the pandemic have been proposed and trialled. 9 Gaining a detailed understanding of what worked and the unmet needs of HCWs will facilitate the development of redeployment plans for this pandemic as well as future ones.",

            "text": "Theme 1: redeployment: implementation strategies Due to the shifting nature of the pandemic, areas of need were moving targets that constantly changed. 22 Redeployment varied depending on the individual institution configuration, geographical and population context and stage of the pandemic. 2 Strategies to redistribute HCWs to meet surge demands varied across countries and health systems. In terms of sources from which to redeploy HCWs, for example, most places had access to volunteers for internal redeployment. Some of the places with the greatest burden of COVID-19 cases recruited from outside of the health system (eg, travelling nurses). 23 Clear decision-making processes were facilitated, for example, by clear definitions of 'urgent' and efficient channelling of information to create a clear and consistent message. 24 25 For the latter, suggestions included limiting the use of email chains, using online platforms such as Dropbox or apps like Induction of Clinbee, and bespoke WhatsApp groups. 2 25-29 In the UK, Regional Emergency Preparedness Response and Resilience (EPRR) teams were reported as key to assisting hospitals in the management of acute surges. Clinicians and managers were advised to define warning triggers to anticipate a surge and establish communication lines with EPRR teams. 2 Healthcare settings also made efforts to enable two-way Open access communication to allow for feedback from redeployed HCWs through webinars, briefing meetings and feedback forms. 25 26 28 30 Transparency and involvement of frontline clinicians as stakeholders were important components and helped to maintain trust among HCWs. 31 Redeployment planning aimed to minimise training needs and maximise the use of redeployed HCWs' previous knowledge by placing HCWs in roles where their existing skills could be more easily transferrable. 3 25 30 32 Panda et al found that health system leaders (ie, chief medical officers, chairs or division chiefs) favoured a decentralised leadership approach, where organisationwide goals were disseminated to frontline leaders for implementation. This facilitated targeted training, as local leaders were better able to identify the training needs of each redeployee. A successful approach to redeployment was allocating redeployed HCWs to designated treatment teams,that is task-based groups made up of multidisciplinary teams with clear leadership and constant communication that aimed to complete a specific necessary step of intensive care when requested by experienced ICU HCWs. 2 25 27 28 31 33-37 Another successful strategy was a tiered staffing model where critical care trained physicians or nurses oversaw non-ICU clinicians. 31 This represented an important shift in ways of working and understanding collaborations between health specialists. 3 There were benefits in some specialists taking over ICU roles, examples of this were otolaryngologists examining epistaxis, peritonsillar abscess and facial trauma 22 ; experienced renal physicians, together with trainee radiologists developing line insertion teams or orthopaedists and physiotherapists assisting with proning. 3 Benefits included the reduction of personnel required for procedures, reduction of aerosolisation of the virus, shorter time dedicated to procedures and minimal or no training required for them to provide assistance.

Redeployed HCWs experienced anxiety and stress, particularly when lacking adequate support or PPE, during night shifts when fewer HCWs were available and due to last minute rota changes. 19 ophthalmologists' anxiety reduced once their redeployment role began. This was attributed to receiving support from HCWs in the redeployed area, the sufficient availability of PPE and adequate training. Some HCWs often felt that the redeployment period had encouraged them to learn and change their ways of thinking in challenging situations. 21 26 Coughlan et al 4242 described solutions for stressors that junior doctors experienced due to working in unfamiliar ICU settings. The interpersonal communication required for intense multidisciplinary teamwork was facilitated by visual aids, anonymised whiteboards and the use of walkietalkies. Worries about potential negligence proceedings resulting from working beyond their usual competencies were mitigated by emergency legislation to protect doctors. ",

These included prone and positioning, maintaining vascular catheters and dialysis circuits, sedation and administering vasoactive medication and continuous positive airway pressure services. 4 28 33 34 37 45-47 Redeployed HCWs were also often asked to liaise with families and required training on communicating bad news. 20 A particular emphasis was made on learning needs related to PPE and infection control, especially during aerosol-generating procedures. 3 30 40 44 47 Regarding the latter, studies reflected on the difficulty of ensuring HCW safety due to permanently changing and sometimes conflicting advice on the use of PPE. 3 31 As a result, teams assigned aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation were preferably staffed with experienced airway experts such as anaesthetists or otorhinolaryngologists to minimise the personnel required and the aerosolisation of the virus during procedures. 22 Theme 4: training formats offered and training evaluations Most courses reported in the literature included blended approaches (theory+practice) and were collaboratively designed by a variety of clinical educators, intensive care experts and frontline HCWs. 1 26 32 34-36 39 45 46 48 49 HCWs found it particularly useful when course content and practical sessions were repeated over time in consecutive sessions, rather than receiving an overwhelming amount of information in one session. 18 This required allocating time to access training on a continuous basis and making sure it was kept up to date. 42 Some of the training development and delivery was carried out by HCWs who were shielding or had recently retired. 46 Elder clinicians or those with other risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection contributed to the pandemic response by leading simulation-based education sessions. Training formats included simulation sessions; online videos; live webinars; webcasts of conference presentations from previous years; competency checklists, podcasts and blogs to discuss recent publications; and infographics presenting main results. 9 21 27 28 30 32 35 37 39 45 Online learning formats allowed HCWs to access material at their own pace and check understanding; however, there was a need for practical follow-up sessions to consolidate learning. 1 18 46 In addition, courses were generally complemented by buddy systems (pairing up redeployed HCWs with more experienced ICU HCWs) or other similar set-ups to provide support for redeployed HCWs during clinical practice. 3 18 32 35 37 Most training programmes were evaluated through surveys or interviews, and one article reported the use of cycles of iteration composed of daily interactive feedback sessions with tutors and candidates to enable rapid improvement. 46 Another article shared the role of bedside learning coordinators, who updated HCWs on any new changes to protocols and checked their understanding of these updates. 26 Innovations in the peer review process and format of presenting results helped to disseminate scientific evidence in a timely way. 9 However, reaching a consistent message for best practice was a significant challenge during the pandemic and affected training development. Guidelines recommended teaching principles rather than strict procedures to allow for adaptability to the local context and as circumstances changed. 2 Theme 5: future redeployment and training delivery As the pandemic evolved, the numbers of patients with COVID-19 fluctuated rapidly and a need to return to 'business as usual' when possible was noted in the literature. 4 24 For this reason, redeployment implementation strategies started to focus on facilitating de-escalating and escalating redeployment when necessary. Examples of practices that allowed for greater flexibility were the stepwise approach to redeployment, or only redeploying discrete teams based on skills (as described in the theme redeployment: implementation strategies and learning). 3 32 43 Regarding training, a need for balance between e-learning and face-to-face learning was mentioned. While e-learning was considered to have significant advantages such as a lower cost and reduced environmental impact, many felt there was still a need for face-toface learning. There were aspects of in-person meetings that enhanced learning and well-being such as social interaction, hands-on teaching and the opportunity to travel and visit venues. 9 Lastly, Camilleri et al 46 pointed out that as COVID-19 cases evolve, training focus will shift to rehabilitation.",

However, searches were restricted from December 2019 to 16 July 2021. The review will have missed literature published outside of these dates and not included in these databases. It is possible that some studies from non-English speaking countries were not identified due to all the search terms being in English.

            "text": "The challenges faced by redeployed HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic overlapped with previous studies assessing experiences of junior HCWs in emergency departments or HCWs redeployed to disaster and war zones. [50] [51] [52] Theyyunni et al 5353 analysed reflections from medical students after their emergency medicine rotation. The most common themes involved novice anxiety around critically ill patients and intubation procedures, miscommunication with other HCWs and challenges stemming from the tension between textbook medicine and complex social situations. Challenges specific to the current pandemic were PPE use and everchanging guidelines, and the paucity of testing at the initial stages. 23 54 PPE use resulted in difficulties with communication, responding to emergencies in a timely manner and increased physical burden. 55 Also, frontline HCWs mentioned that not having testing available increased their anxiety about possibly infecting their families and exacerbated their guilt when being off work due to suspected COVID-19 infections that could not be confirmed. 6 Other challenges included aspects outside of clinical practice that had an impact on redeployed HCWs' well-being, such as access to breakout rooms, safety in lonely streets during stricter lockdowns and family caring responsibilities. 6 56 Overall, effective healthcare leadership was found to consist of identifying and understanding the sources of fear and anxiety among individuals and designing strategies to mitigate their effects. 23 The essential role of training and need for innovative approaches has also been highlighted in the literature from previous virus outbreaks. 57 Multimodal, multidisciplinary and realistic simulation delivered in consecutive sessions were recommended options for successful training. 49 58-60 Doulias et al 6161 summarised changes in surgical training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key aspects of successful training overlapped with those identified for redeployment to ICU. The necessary shift to e-learning was possible due to innovative and collaborative approaches that mitigated the loss of access to other modes of learning during this time. In particular, interactive surgical simulation platforms offered a model of mentoring and continued guidance. Consultants were more available to impart simulation training and engage in discussions with trainees due to the reduced elective surgery services.",

Redeployed HCWs' main needs were good support networks, availability of PPE, training and good communication. \u25ba Factors that affected HCWs' well-being were: accommodation, access to testing and family responsibilities. \u25ba Redeployment strategies could involve giving staff the opportunity to opt out of redeployment or self-isolate without divulging personal information. Staff training needs specific to COVID-19 patient care include: proning and positioning, maintaining vascular caterers and dialysis circuits, sedation and administering vasoactive medication.\u25ba HCWs preferred training with blended approaches (theory +practice). \u25ba If training is based solely on online learning formats, it requires follow-up practical sessions. \u25ba HCWs preferred repeated shorter training sessions rather than receiving all information in one session. \u25ba Training can be developed and delivered by shielding or recently retired HCWs. \u25ba Training formats reported in the literature included: simulation sessions, online videos; live webinars; webcasts of conference presentations from previous years; competency checklists podcasts and blogs to discuss recent publications; and infographics presenting main results. \u25ba Helpful training strategies included: buddy systems that paired redeployed HCWs with experienced ICU HCWs, bedside learning coordinators shared changes in practice and checked understanding with HCWs. \u25ba Iterative evaluation formats are most effective to develop training. Options included surveys, interviews and feedback sessions.",
