It may first occur or increase in frequency during the course of a pregnancy. 3 Universal screening efforts of traumatic injuries in emergency departments for partner violence have been recommended to maximize identification of survivors. 1 As experts of the maxillofacial region, oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) can play a prominent role in ensuring adequate screening and identification of partner violence in pregnant patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 442, "end": 443, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 563, "end": 564, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 770, "end": 771, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 931, "end": 932, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The maxillofacial region is the most common anatomical location associated with trauma resulting from partner violence. 4 In a study of patients experiencing domestic violence, the majority of injuries were reported as nasal fractures.

These patterns of injury were similar in other studies conducted on this population and may serve as indicators. 4 In the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery, relevant studies on this patient population are outdated or lacking.

Once stabilized, an appropriate treatment should be planned based on the extent of the injury. It is published in the literature that the treatment of maxillofacial trauma in pregnant patients presents minimal risk. Facial imaging, such as CBCT, MRI, and conventional radiographs with shielding have negligible effects on the fetus and are proven to be safe. In the context of maxillofacial trauma, the use of general anesthesia also presents the patient and fetus with minimal risk. 5 Ultrasound should be used by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the OB-GYN to assess fetal biometry and placental evaluation. During surgery, the gravid patient should be maintained in the left lateral decubitus position to avoid supine hypotensive syndrome. Depending on gestational age and extent of surgical treatment, fetal monitoring during the procedure may be advised by OB-GYN. Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) should be avoided and fractures should be treated with rigid fixation. Such a modality allows faster rehabilitation and restoration of nutritional intake. If IMF is indicated, parenteral nutrition supplementation is recommended. 5 In survivors who are already exhibiting heightened levels of anxiety with regards to the well-being of their child, it may be required of the OMS to educate and console patients pertaining to the safety of their selected treatment. Depending on gestational age, fetal monitoring should occur for 2-6 hours post-trauma, 2 or longer depending on patient's obstetric complaints and anatomical site of trauma. As experts in the maxillofacial region, OMSs are in an important position to implement universal screening and identification of partner violence in pregnant women. All OMSs must acknowledge and understand the capabilities and limitations of their role in protecting pregnant women from partner violence. As providers, it is necessary to be understanding of such patients; women are bearing their children and are in fear of further repercussions. It is paramount to ensure their safety in the present and the future, for both themselves and their child's well-being.
