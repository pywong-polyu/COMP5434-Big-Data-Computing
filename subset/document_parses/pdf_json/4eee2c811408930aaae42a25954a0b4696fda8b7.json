Numerous immune cells play a key role in immune response regulation, and gene expression analysis in these cells could be a useful method for studying disease states, assessing immunological responses, and detecting biomarkers. Here, we developed a machine learning procedure to find biomarkers that discriminate disease severity in individual immune cells (B cell, CD4 + cell, CD8 + cell, monocyte, and NK cell) using single-cell gene expression profiles of COVID-19. The gene features of each profile were first filtered and ranked using the Boruta feature selection method and mRMR, and the resulting ranked feature lists were then fed into the incremental feature selection method to determine the optimal number of features with decision tree and random forest algorithms. Meanwhile, we extracted the classification rules in each cell type from the optimal decision tree classifiers. The best gene sets discovered in this study were analyzed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, and some important biomarkers like TLR2, ITK, CX3CR1, IL1B, and PRDM1 were validated by recent literature. The findings reveal that the optimal gene sets for each cell type can accurately classify COVID-19 disease severity and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression.",

After the outbreak, the new coronavirus was first named 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classified it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-(SARS-CoV-) related virus and renamed it as SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In early January 2020, researchers had isolated and identified the virus for the first time in the world, completed its whole genome sequencing, and submitted the genome sequence information of SARS-CoV-2 to the WHO. According to its genome sequence information, the virus is a new type of coronavirus, which is evolutionarily similar to the SARS coronavirus that caused \"SARS\" in 2003, and belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus of the coronavirus family [2] . SARS-CoV-2 has a 79% sequence consistency with SARS coronavirus and a 50% sequence consistency with the Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) [3] . Similar to other \u03b2-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus. Its genome is composed of a 30 kb positive-stranded RNA and contains 6 functional open reading frames (ORF), encoding replicase (ORF1a/ORF1b), spike protein (S protein), envelope protein (E protein), membrane protein (M protein), and nucleocapsid protein (N protein) [4] .",

In addition, there are also many reports of impaired taste and smell all over the world [7] . Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may also have no pathogenic symptoms, such as presymptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients. Although most patients only show mild symptoms, the condition of COVID-19 develops rapidly, especially in the absence of adequate medical and nursing care. Several COVID-19 infection-related signatures and rules at different omics levels have been reported by machine learning, which may contributed to exploring the pathology, improving the diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19 and finding new targets for vaccine design [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection will cause a series of physiological and pathological changes in the body, including the stimulation of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. On the one hand, innate immunity and inflammation can produce antiviral effects and further stimulate adaptive immunity, helping the body to resist viral infections; on the other hand, excessive innate immunity and inflammatory response can lead to immune overload, inflammatory factor storms, and microthrombosis, which is considered to be one of the main pathogenic causes of ARDS and multiple organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 [12] . COVID-19 induces the production of a large number of inflammatory factors in patients, and its disease process and severity are closely related to the degree of immune response. The infection of COVID-19 can affect the immune cells and inflammation levels in the body including inflammatory factors, chemokines, growth factors, metabolites, and lipids. For example, Xu et al. [13] collected blood samples from COVID-19 patients and found that compared with healthy volunteers, 20 types of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (CCGFs) were increased in the plasma of patients with mild, severe, and dead COVID-19 patients. Moreover , there were  16 kinds of CCGFs, including HGF, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL7/  cP-3, CCL2/McP-1, CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-6, IL-18, IL-2, M-CSF, IL-1R\u03b1, IL-2R\u03b1/CD25, IFN-\u03b3, CC L3/  MIP-1\u03b1, FGF, and SCF which were abnormally elevated in  patients who died from COVID-19. COVID-19 patients  with different disease severity exhibit significantly altered  plasma proteins which can be used as biomarkers to predict   different clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients, such as  from severe disease to death, from mild disease to severe disease, and from severe or mild disease to recovery. A recent  research conducted proteomic systematic analysis of plasma  protein in patients with COVID-19 death, severe, and mild disease progression and found a large number of unique protein changes in patients with different clinical outcomes, involving a variety of physiological and pathological pathways, such as platelet shedding, complement and coagulation system, and metabolism [14] . To further explore the variation of various immune cells in blood of COVID-19 patients, here we incorporated single-cell profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 14 healthy controls (HC) and 33 single-cell profiles of COVID-19 patients including 3 moderate patients, 5 severe patients, and 25 critical patients and identified the decision rules and genes that clearly distinguish the immune cells in HC and COVID-19 patients of different severity, to figure out the complex immune process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and discover the immune response variation in patients with different severities, by which we hope to provide insight into the potential pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of COVID-19.",

This method uses the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to linearly synthesize new sample data for minority classes, resulting in an equal number of samples for each class. During the tenfold cross-validation procedure, these new data are utilized to train the classification model and improve its performance. For this analysis, we used the SMOTE tool from https://github.com/scikit-learncontrib/imbalanced-learn with default parameters. [9, 11, 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] is a classification or regression algorithm that uses the Bagging concept of ensemble learning by incorporating many trees. In RF, the original data is first resampled using the bootstrap method to generate numerous sample datasets; next, for each sample dataset, a decision tree prediction model is built, and the final results are obtained by voting taken from the predictions of each tree. The model can handle data with a lot of dimensions and has a quick convergence rate and few adjustment parameters. In this study, the random forest function in Scikit-learn [26] is utilized with default parameters. Figure 1 : Computational workflow for this study. First, we applied Boruta and mRMR methods to filter and rank features of expression profiles for different immune cells (B cell, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, monocyte, and NK cell). Then, using the incremental feature selection method, a series of feature subsets were generated, and training samples made up of these feature subsets were used to train decision tree and random forest with 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the evaluation metrics of the model, the optimal number of features under each cell type was determined, and the optimal classifiers and classification rules were established as well. The GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed on these selected gene sets. [9, 22, [27] [28] [29] is built based on the \"IF-THEN\" tree structure. Starting with the root node, DT judges the test of the node and assigns the instance to its child nodes based on the judgment result, where each node corresponds to a test of a feature, and so on, recursively, until the instance is assigned to a leaf node. Furthermore, DT can produce comprehensible classification rules that statistically characterize the pattern of feature expression. The DT was run with default parameters using the Scikit-learn software in this work.",

Therefore, our study is aimed at finding the discriminative genes and rules between various immune cells (B cell, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, monocytes, NK cell) in healthy control, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients to shed new light on the immune response changes during the infection and development of COVID-19. We concentrated on several top features and decision rules because they have a vital influence on the classification. Then, we performed functional enrichment analysis in each cluster to explore the biological function and discussed them further through a wide literature publication to demonstrate our findings are trusted and convincing.",

Therefore, based on the GO and KEGG functions, we concentrated on the related genes. TLR2 belongs to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) family which are the primary receptors for innate immunity and can recognize a variety of microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Moreover, TLRs have specific MAMPs. For example, the ligands of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 are lipid membrane acid of Gram-positive bacteria, lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria, and flagellin of bacterial, respectively [35] . TLRs participate in the activation of mature B lymphocytes. The activation of B cell proliferation and immune globulin secretion by CpG-DNA and lipopolysaccharide of bacterial is known to be mediated by TLR9 and TLR4 [36, 37] . Similarly, the recognition of bacterial lipoproteins by TLR2 has been reported to trigger the activation of B lymphocytes [38, 39] . The latest study found that contrary to the effect of TLR4 in activating T cells, TLR2 is involved in preventing/delaying the maturation of B cells. Simultaneous addition of TLR2 and TLR4 ligands in in vitro experiments revealed the antagonistic effect between these stimuli [40] . Therefore, TLR2 plays an important role in B cell maturation and may be treated as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of COVID-19.",

In mature B cells, the expression value of NR4A1 reaches its peak. Park et al. [43] carried on the detailed explanation of the function of the NR4A1 in B cell. They found that the NUR77-deficient mice have elevated levels of all four class antibodies, which can trigger autoimmune response and exhibited an increase in CD38hi memory B cells and GL7+ germinal center B cells. Also, B cells in NUR77-deficient mice that were stimulated with anti-CD40 and anti-IgM survived better than those B cells in C57BL/6 wild-type mice.

KEGG pathway analysis of discriminative genes in CD4 + T cell leads to an important term, coronavirus disease-COVID-19 (hsa05171), directly supporting the reliability of our classifier that identified features highly related to COVID-19 infection. Hsa05171 pathway refers to that SARS-COV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells, mainly alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells, through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. And after SARS-COV-2 occupies ACE2, serum free angiotensin II (Ang II) levels increase due to decreased ACE2-mediated degradation, which promotes NF-\u03baB pathway activation via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and finally leads to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, COVID-19 infection may induce the alteration of CD4 + T cell effector function and lead to aberrant secretion of cytokines which are discussed further below.",

CX3CR1 encodes a functional protein with 1065 nucleotides and 355 amino acids, which is a specific and high affinity receptor for the chemokine CX3CL1 and can induce phosphorylation of downstream genes and participate in corresponding signal transduction. Expression of CX3CR1 has been recently found to represent a subset of memory T cell [51] . Memory T cell is a long-lived cell differentiated from effector CD8 + T cells, and it can be divided into three types according to the specific expression of phenotypic markers such as KLRG1, CD127, CD27, and CX3CR1. CX3CR1 + memory T cell is an effector memory phenotype and has unique abilities in tumor therapy including withstanding the toxicity of chemotherapy and proliferating when using chemoimmunotherapy [51] . What is more, CX3CR1 + memory T cell plays a major killing role in secondary infection, while CX3CR1memory T cell has almost no cytotoxicity [52] . Therefore, we can infer that the magnitude and duration of T-cell immune response form the changes in expression levels of CX3CR1. 8 BioMed Research International",

TNFAIP3 is associated with the development of multiple inflammatory pathologies. Giordano et al. found that [54] TNFAIP3 selective knockout mice exhibited robust antigen sensitivity and cytotoxicity in CD8 T cells, with an increased generation of IL-2 and IFN\u03b3. Meanwhile, in vivo experiment showed more forceful antitumor activity in TNFAIP3 knockout CD8 T cells.

IFITM3 is a broad-spectrum host limiting factor, highly induced by type I and type II interferon, and shows antiviral activity against a variety of viruses including influenza A virus (IAV), HIV-1, Ebola, SARS coronavirus, and dengue virus. Wellington et al. [56] used CyTOF to measure the expression level of IFITM3 in individual cell types of human adult blood samples. It shows that IFITM3 has a highest expression in CD16 + monocytes which can be inferred that IFITM3. Other studies have shown that after viral infection, IFITM3 is induced by type I interferon and promotes the degradation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by enhancing IRF3 autophagy and migration to autophagosome, thus negatively regulating the RIG-I-like receptor-(RLR-) mediated signaling pathway of type I interferon production [57] .",

NK cells are an important part of the innate immune system and play a crucial role in the early stage of antitumor and antivirus. There are many ways for NK cells to kill target cells, such as directed exocytosis and specific secretion of lysosomes, which are called cytotoxic particles containing perforation protein, granzyme, and Fas ligand [58] . Another way is to secrete INK-\u03b3 to enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells after encountering susceptible target cells or stimulated by IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 released by other cells [58, 59] . PRDM1 is a transcription inhibitor and acts as a key negative regulator of NK function. It synergistically inhibits TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 by directly binding to multiple conserved regulatory regions. Downregulated expression of PRDM1 causes increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, whereas upregulated expression blocks cytokine generation [60] .",

Our results are consistent with a previous systematic proteomic analysis of plasma in different disease processes of patients with death, severe, and mild diseases of COVID-19 that demonstrated that a large number of plasma proteins have changed in COVID-19 patients with different clinical outcomes [13] . Therefore, based on the single-cell expression profiles from blood samples of HC, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients, our newly presented computational approach provides a new perspective for exploring the mechanism of COVID-19 and predicting different clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.",

After that, using incremental feature selection, the optimal number of features was identified, and optimal classifiers and classification rules were constructed. Finally, the selected gene sets were subjected to GO and KEGG functional analyses, and some of the key genes were validated using recent literature. The findings suggest that these gene features are important in differentiating disease severity in distinct immune cells, demonstrating the validity of our computational method. The key gene markers identified in this study can serve as potential targets 9 BioMed Research International in the clinical prognosis and treatment of COVID-19. Our predictive model can be clinically applied into disease stratification of large cohort of COVID-19 patients according to the disease severity, which can contribute to providing appropriate medical support for the predicted severe patients to help improve the patient survival rate. Together, this research provides a new perspective to explore the mechanisms of COVID-19 and the ability to predict disease outcome.",
