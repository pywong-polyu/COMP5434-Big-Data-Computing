There is a long history of research into the automated diagnosis of lung cancer from medical images using computer vision techniques encompassing linear and non-linear filtering [3] , grey-level thresholding analysis [4] , and, more recently, machine learning including deep learning techniques [5] [6] [7] . Despite many lab-based successes of computer vision medical image diagnostic algorithms, the actual regulatory approval and clinical adoption of these computer vision techniques in medical image analysis is very limited [8] . Clinical use of medical image AI is held back by the dissonance of evidence-based radiology [9] with the black-box nature of deep learning systems, along with data quality concerns and legal/ethical issues such as responsibility for errors [10] . As of September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved only 30 radiology related deep learning or machine learning based applications/devices, of which only three utilize the X-ray imaging mode [11] , with the subject of one being wrist fracture diagnosis [12] and the other two being for pneumothorax assessment [13, 14] .",

The overwhelming majority of these papers have been authored in the past decade, as shown in Figure 1 . Driving this huge interest in medical computer vision research is a desire to provide tools to improve the productivity of medical clinicians by providing an automated second reading to assist radiologists with their workloads [8] . This ambitious goal has technically been met by development studies under lab conditions [18] , but persistent challenges including dataset size and diversity, along with bias detection/removal and expertise in oversight and safe use of such systems remain hinderances to clinical adoption [19] .",

Our intention is that that these models can be used by the medical community as a data driven foundation for interpretable multivariate diagnostic scoring of lung cancer and form the basis of useful workflow augmentation tools for radiologists.",

Finally, this inferenced score tuple is fitted to the malignancy data for each patient using a shallow decision tree, with the most accurate decision trees extracted for discussion and further refinement. This process is illustrated in Figure 2 . This more holistic approach emphasizes the importance of multiple pathological biomarkers as lung cancer features, avoiding automation bias by the promotion of interpretability and expert human judgement in the creation of medical computer vision applications. It is hoped that this change of focus may help overcome the hurdles that have held back the adoption medical artificial intelligence algorithms into clinical workflow by enabling radiologists to oversee the advice provided by computer vision models, thereby promoting evidence-based and safe use of the technology [19] .",

This process provides the medical community with two key novel elements. Firstly, we show that automated lung nodule detection from CXR alone is insufficient to indicate lung cancer malignancy. We therefore train our deep learning classifier on additional pathologies associated with lung cancer outside of the well-studied and narrow lung nodule classification task. This more closely matches the partially subjective workflow process of human radiologists [8] than other published studies. Secondly, our process provides an interpretable and logical explanation of model output for lung cancer malignancy stratification rather than the simple 'black box' score and visual, but not necessarily interpretable, saliency mapping that is common to other studies.",

Best results against the very large ChestX-ray14 dataset [22] have been achieved using deep learning combined with trainable attention mechanisms for channels, pathological elements, and scale [23] , achieving an average AUC of 0.826 for 14 thoracic conditions. Other recently published approaches include incorporation of label inter-dependencies via LSTM modules to improve prediction accuracy using statistical label correlations [24] , augmenting deep learning with hand crafted shallow feature extraction [25] to improve classification accuracy over pure deep learning, and consideration of the relationship between pathology and location in the lung geometry as spatial knowledge to improve deep learning classification accuracy [26] . Each of these approaches improved upon the accuracy obtained from a pure deep learning approach by finding and exploiting additional information from the ChestX-ray14 dataset, however, none of these studies considered whether the additional information gleaned is generalizable. For instance, some label interdependencies may be specific to the clinic and radiologist population from which the ChestX-ray14 dataset was sourced and labelled. Likewise, the shallow feature extraction approach from [25] evaluated and tuned feature extraction algorithms to produce the best results against the ChestX-ray14 dataset, without experimenting to assess whether and to what extent this approach was generalizable to an independent dataset.",

This dataset includes 150 samples with a nodule size of 3 cm or less, but only four samples with a nodule size greater than 3 cm. Use of the JSRT datasets in this manner is potentially problematic for two reasons; firstly, a lung nodule is defined as measuring \u22643 cm in diameter [29] with larger nodules or masses under-represented in these studies, even though these may indicate more serious and likely malignant cancers, and secondly, most pulmonary nodules are benign [30] . The CXR imaging mode is much more sensitive to calcified benign nodules (due to associated higher opacity) than non-calcified nodules or ground-glass opacities [31] , which are more likely to be a sign of lung cancer [32] . These factors combined could lead to deep learning systems trained only on CXR nodule detection tending to under-diagnose serious nodules and/or masses over 3 cm in diameter, which is obviously undesirable. It is these concerns that have led us to investigate biomarker features other than visible nodules alone in the detection and malignancy stratification of lung cancer malignancy from CXR.",

CNN-based scoring of the patient's initial CXR [37] concluded that the deep learning classifier was capable of accurate stratification of the risk of long-term mortality from an initial CXR. The study noted that most of these deaths were from causes other than lung cancer and speculated that the developed CNN and risk stratification reflected shared risk factors [39] apparent as biomarkers on CXR.

The second logical dataset must comprise CXRs with malignancy metadata, indicating whether lung cancer is present in the image and, if so, whether the cancer is considered by expert radiologists to be benign or malignant. There are two publicly available CXR datasets meeting these criteria. Firstly, the Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection (LIDC-IDRI) [40] provides malignancy diagnosis metadata for 157 patient studies, of which 96 include PA view CXR images. Secondly, the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) [28] database provides 154 patient studies in the form of PA CXR images with malignancy diagnosis metadata. The JSRT dataset was labelled for lung nodule malignancy and subtlety by a panel of 20 experienced radiologists.

Normally, any such inconsistency between the dataset and labels would be problematic for a computer vision diagnosis, since the image data would not support the label ground truth. Similarly, the JSRT dataset contains some nodules that are very subtle. For these subtle nodules of size 1-10 mm, human expert radiologist sensitivity was measured at only 60.4% [28] . Our proposed classification process should be relatively robust against these problems, since the presence of obvious nodules is only one of several lung cancer biomarkers under consideration.",

Noting that several state-of-the-art studies have employed network attention mechanisms in computer vision applications we additionally tested with a variant of ResNet-50 using a triple attention mechanism, which applies attention weights to channels and spatial dimensions using three separate branches covering channel/width, channel/height and width/height as described in detail by [64] .",

These five output nodes matched our five selected features being Atelectasis, Effusion, Mass, No Finding, and Nodule. This network was then fine-tuned using the training data subset of ChestX-ray14, achieving AUC-ROC results consistent with state-of-the-art for this dataset in consideration that we have restricted classes to PA view only and under-sampled ( Table 2 ). All models converged well as shown in Figure 3 , with the ResNet based networks being fully trained at 25 epochs compared to Densenet-121, requiring around 50 epochs to fully train. Experimentation showed that the Adam optimizer [66] led to faster convergence and more accurate results (by around 5%) over the SGD [67] optimizer, therefore we chose to use the Adam optimizer with standard parameters (\u03b21 = 0.9 and \u03b22 = 0.999), along with a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler with an initial learning rate of 0.001 for Densenet-121 and 0.0004 for the Resnet-based classifiers. These rates were tuned by experimentation to produce the highest holdout test accuracy. The cosine annealing scheduler was selected because during model testing and hyperparameter optimization, it was noticed that the model trained well with a more aggressive learning rate, leading to higher validation accuracy at a lower number of epochs. Upon inspection of the dataset images, we noticed a high degree of variation of brightness and contrast, both within and across the ChestX-ray14 and LIDC-IDRI datasets, as shown is Figure 4a ,b. The JSRT dataset has consistent brightness and contrast since it was automatically equalized at extraction from raw image format, as evident from Figure 4c .",

Therefore, we expected the decision tree for experiment C, as shown in Figure 13c , to provide the clearest insights into the relationship between our selected pathological features and lung cancer malignancy. This model shows that a high score for \"Mass\" combined with a low score for \"No Finding\" with \"Effusion\" leads to malignancy classification nodes. Low scores for \"No Finding\" with Nodule scores greater than 0.01 also lead to malignant classifications. A low score for \"No Finding\", along with a high score for \"Atelectasis\" leads to a benign classification, reflecting the weak relationship between this feature and lung cancer, as found in our literature review. We intend to further refine these models using clinical studies and may filter out this feature in future iterations.",

Our best model using the LIDC-IDRI dataset alone achieved sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 92.9%, using a smaller holdout test set which leads us to favour the lower but more statistically significant combined dataset result. These results are interpretable using human readable decision tree diagrams. The decision tree models provide explanations into lung cancer malignancy that may lead clinicians to consider factors that would otherwise be missed in a high-pressure environment, where, on average, radiologists may be required to interpret an image every 3-4 s in a workday [74] .",
