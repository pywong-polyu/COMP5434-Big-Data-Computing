A key area where this has been the case has been in running elections. In addition to being central to the democratic process, elections are logistically complex and people-intensive to run. They require the mobilization of whole electorates, often many millions of people, on or around polling day. They involve many thousands more in campaigning for office, and in staffing both polling stations and election counts to help ensure everyone entitled to vote could do so, and have their vote tabulated accurately. With such numbers of people involved, the potential for increasing the spread of infections through electoral processes was an obvious public health threat.",

Italy postponed a major national referendum and several subnational elections from late March until late September. At the end of March, Bavaria in Germany switched quickly and almost uniquely to an all-postal ballot for their second-round municipal elections. COVID mitigations could at times appear dramatic. An Israeli election early in the pandemic saw several fully medically supported polling stations with staff in full protective gear to enable COVID-infected isolating electors to vote. Where elections were held, the pandemic also led to changes to campaign activities. Although the US elections went ahead as scheduled with COVID-19 mitigations, the Joe Biden and Donald Trump camps campaigned very differently. Trump continued to hold in-person, mask-optional events. These have subsequently been associated with sizeable transmission effects (Bernheim et al., 2020) . Candidate Biden initially campaigned online, before turning to socially distanced drive-in events for some Democratic rallies.",

In some places, COVID laws routinely underwent little or no scrutiny, with parliamentarians approving some unprecedented peacetime limitations on civil liberties and rights of association. Some institutions saw their activities move to a hybrid format, using now familiar, but then unfamiliar, platforms such as Microsoft Teams. Both houses of the otherwise tradition-bound UK Parliament enabled MPs and peers to join remotely, but with a small number sitting in-person. However, voting was very much in the hands of party managers who controlled party bloc votes in the House of Commons. Something similar happened in the Netherlands, formalizing party control of MPs' votes. Spain's Chamber of Deputies appeared ahead of the game because it had already developed an app pre-pandemic to allow members to vote remotely when sick or on maternity leave. This allowed relatively quick adaptation to pandemic circumstances.",

On the one hand, democracy was not thriving everywhere after years of decline in some countries; on the other hand, the baseline was (mostly) not eroded despite the pandemic restrictions. With regard to the latter, The Democracy Report 2021 raised concerns about restrictions imposed disproportionately on Roma communities in Slovakia and on refugee camps in Greece. The United States is singled out for government-sourced disinformation about the pandemic (Nazifa et al., 2021) . In V-Dem's four-level classification scheme, 26 countries in the volume covering 2020 hold the top status as liberal democracies, while 10 -Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania -are rated in the second category of electoral democracies. Slovakia recorded the most notable gain in V-Dem's liberal democracy score, arising because of the end of the dominance by Smer-SD in Slovak politics, as described in the country chapter. Only Hungary is classified as an electoral autocracy, a quantitative judgement borne out by political judgements in the real world: the country chapter describes how the European People's Party Group of the European Parliament prolonged its suspension of the governing Fidesz MEP because of anti-democratic practices. From a decade-long perspective, V-Dem rates Poland and Hungary as the top two autocratizing countries in the world (Coppedge et al., 2021) . Our chapter on Poland highlights the irregular procedure they adopted to delay the 2020 presidential election, and describes other legal reforms that limit the independence of the judiciary. The chapter on Hungary identifies several democratic blemishes, including an overreaching pandemic-related state of emergency, the further consolidation of the media around government-based companies, and the passage of a constitutional amendment hostile to the rights of LGBTQ+ citizens.",

In Romania, the governing centre-right National Liberal Party expanded its seat share and formed another single-party minority government, but remained the second largest party in Parliament behind the Social Democrats. Elections in Israel yielded stasis in the left-right balance in the Knesset, and Likud as the plurality winner, and a close second by Blue and White. Lower house elections in Slovakia, Lithuania and the United States all resulted in losses by the governing party. Smer's domination of the Slovakia Parliament ended.

In some countries, gender parity in government was (almost) achieved: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. In Finland, France and Sweden, there was even a majority of female ministers. Yet, in other countries gender parity in government remains a chimera.
