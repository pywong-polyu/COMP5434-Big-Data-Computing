Here, we screened 2701 compounds from a commercial library of drugs approved by international regulatory agencies for their ability to inhibit the binding of recombinant, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to recombinant human ACE2. We identified 56 compounds that inhibited binding by <90%, measured the EC50 of binding inhibition, and computationally modeled the docking of the best inhibitors to both Spike and ACE2. These results highlight an effective screening approach to identify compounds capable of disrupting the Spike-ACE2 interaction as well as identifying several potential inhibitors that could serve as templates for future drug discovery efforts.",

Secondly, several of the drugs have peak plasma concentrations that are orders of magnitude lower than the concentration required to inhibit spike-Ace2 binding in the in vitro assay, for example Oxytocin 27 and Doramectin 28 (0.005 vs 4.2 uM and 0.014 vs 12.8 uM, respectively).
