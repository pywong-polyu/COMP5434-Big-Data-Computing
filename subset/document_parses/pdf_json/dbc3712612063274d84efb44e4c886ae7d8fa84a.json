Through a systematic search of the literature on PubMed and Collabovid of studies published January 2020-July 2021, our findings of five studies on children and 16 studies on college students found that both groups reported feeling more anxious, depressed, fatigued, and distressed than prior to the pandemic. Several risk factors such as living in rural areas, low family socioeconomic status, and being a family member or friend to a healthcare worker were strongly associated with worse mental health outcomes. As schools and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health to support students at higher risk of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Mental health issues may also arise from the disease itself, such as grief from loss of lives, opportunities, and employment [7] [8] [9] . Similar Jad A. Elharake and Faris Akbar are joint first authors psychological effects have been found from wars and previous disease outbreaks [10] [11] [12] [13] . Additionally, inequities and disparities in the social determinants of health (e.g., income status, immigrant background, language barrier, parents' educational background, and access to adequate healthcare) may contribute further to the development of psychological distress among children and college students living through the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Of the 16 studies remaining, 15 were cross sectional studies and one was a cohort study [16, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . The total number of participants across the seven studies ranged from 195 to 89,588 college students. The variables most commonly measured in these studies were depression and anxiety, and some studies included other variables such as stress and suicidal thoughts. While a majority of these studies came from China, some were conducted in other countries, including France, India, Jordan, Nigeria, Switzerland, and the United States.

Understanding the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and college students is important for policymakers and university administrators to create timely, effective, and country-specific interventions that will improve children's and college students' mental well-being and prevent more psychological illnesses from developing.

With respect to mental health, solitude and prolonged state of physical isolation have been linked to increases in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation [35, 36] . According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, 138 countries had implemented national school closures due to COVID-19 by May 2020, which impacted more than one billion children and young adults-approximately 80% of the global student population [37] . With these measures in place, one-third of adolescents reported high levels of loneliness and almost half of young adults reported being lonely while quarantining [38] [39] [40] . Global school closures forced K-12 and college students to adapt to online learning, but also separated students from having in-person interactions with teachers, classmates, and friends.",

These mental health consultants also provide information, training, and resources to all families to help prevent and reduce the impact of mental health problems on a child [42, 45, 46] . ECMHC has also been found to have significant positive impacts on prosocial behaviors in the bystander children who were not the focus of the intervention [47] . In a pandemic where there are far more children in need of mental health support than we have capacity to serve individually, it is important to invest in mental health programs that can have positive effects across a larger population. Studies have shown that ECMHC is effective and being used across child care centers, Head Start/Early Head Start centers, home visiting programs, primary care settings, elementary schools (kindergarten through third grade), and community outreach programs [41, 45, 46, 48] . Healthcare providers should also expand their clinical services and offer preventive support and early intervention to be prepared for the rise in mental health issues.",

Our review found that college students who live in rural areas were more susceptible to having greater levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to those who live in urban areas. This is not surprising as rural areas, as opposed to urban areas, often have limited mental health services, lacking access to adequate healthcare, being economically and educationally under-resourced, and usually consisting of elder populations with worse health outcomes-making those living in these communities even more vulnerable to COVID-19 [49] [50] [51] . In the U.S., specifically, rural areas are becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, with more Black/African American, Latinx, and Native American populations-groups who are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and having severe illness due to inequities in social determinants of health-migrating to rural communities [51, 52] . Because urban areas are more densely populated, which raises concerns during an infectious disease outbreak, the public health community and policymakers may be investing more of its COVID-19 resources and informational messaging towards large cities. As a result, rural areas may have been and continue to be neglected. This may be the reason why college students living in small towns and villages are reporting worse mental health outcomes than those living in large cities. Public health officials and education policymakers must consider these factors to provide geographically-and culturally-relevant mental health support for college students living in rural areas.",

            "text": "Furthermore, several studies in our review identified lowsocioeconomic status as a risk factor for greater negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between income status and mental health has been well-documented as there are higher rates of mental illness in groups with lower socioeconomic status [53] [54] [55] . When COVID-19 social distancing measures were imposed, many businesses were forced to shut down-leaving many adults unemployed for several months [56] . As a result, college students who worked several jobs to pay for tuition and/ or housing were also laid off-adding economic pressure during an already overwhelming time. Children and adolescents, on the other hand, whose family income status is low, had to rely on the scarce academic and technological resources that exist in their households as they transitioned to virtual learning. Schools that are closed for a long period of time can have significant health consequences for children living in poverty. This will exacerbate food insecurity as many low-income students rely on school meals. Studies show that food insecurity is associated with low educational performance, while school lunch is associated with high educational attainment [57, 58] . This highlights an important global health concern as children are not only experiencing worse mental health outcomes, but their physical health is also being negatively impacted. Our systematic review also found that being a family member or friend to a healthcare worker and knowing someone who was infected with COVID-19 were strongly associated with worse mental health outcomes, particularly anxiety. Because healthcare workers are on the frontlines in combatting COVID-19 as they treat patients on a frequent basis, children and young adults who are in close contact with these healthcare professionals may be even more worried about contracting the virus, given their level of direct contact. Mental health services should consider the need of family members and friends of health care workers. This effective communication strategy can also be applied to those who reported feeling more anxious because they know someone who was infected with COVID-19. Additionally, although the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread forced adoption of telehealth services to deliver psychiatric and mental health support [59] [60] [61] , healthcare providers should identify ways to cater more healthcare workers, those infected by COVID-19, and the families of these groups through employer benefits and insurance companies. Moreover, this identifies the need for more research to investigate ways to improve preparedness for rapid virtualization of psychiatric counseling and tele-psychiatry.",

First, there is a need for interventional studies, as all of the studies we found were non-interventional, to evaluate direct impacts of mental health treatment or preventive measures on mental illnesses. Second, more studies should be nationally or regionally representative so that their results can be applied to the broader populations. Third, because there are plenty of cross-sectional studies, researchers should consider conducting more longitudinal cohort studies to identify potential changes in mental health outcomes over time. Fourth, researchers must also factor in pre-existing mental disorders among their sample populations to fully and more accurately assess participants' mental health. Lastly, there is a need to investigate more mental health variables, beyond the common ones such as depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD, and instead, also assess child and college student suicide ideation, insomnia, coping, and quality of life.",
