However, the persistent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus, resulted in the appearance of mutations in the original virus. The appearance of more virulent mutations in different regions of the world resulted in an increased number of severe COVID-19 cases. A mathematical model based on the COVID-19 natural history encompassing the mutations was applied to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The model parameters were fitted against the observed data from S\u00e3o Paulo State (Brazil) considering quarantine, relaxation, and mutation. The estimated data from S\u00e3o Paulo State showed that the original SARS-CoV-2 transmission better explained the COVID-19 epidemic during the quarantine. However, the increased number of fatalities beyond that predicted by the relaxation indicated the occurrence of mutations. Hence, the relaxation in association with the transmission of a more virulent SARS-CoV-2 better estimated the COVID-19 epidemic from Mathematics Subject Classification 92B05 \u00b7 37N25 commented on previous versions of the manuscript.

            "text": "In the absence of effective treatment and vaccine, many countries adopted quarantine to control the SARS-CoV-2 with high transmissibility and lethality at the beginning of the epidemic. Italy (Battineni et al. 2020) and Spain (Guirao 2020) adopted rigid quarantine; however, S\u00e3o Paulo State (Brazil) implemented partial quarantine. In Yang et al. (2021a) , a mathematical model based on the COVID-19 natural history encompassing the different fatality rates in young (60 years old or less) and elder (60 years old or more) subpopulations was developed. That model assumed that asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and mild COVID-19 individuals transmit SARS-CoV-2, while severe COVID-19 cases are isolated in hospitals. It is worth stressing that the SEIR-type (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered compartments) models estimate the transmission rate using the severe COVID-19 registered cases as SARS-CoV-2 transmitters (Yang et al. 2020a) . That model was applied to evaluate the impacts on the COVID-19 epidemic by partial quarantine in S\u00e3o Paulo State and rigid quarantine (lockdown) in Spain associated with the protective measures (washing hands with alcohol and gel, use of face mask, and social distancing). Notwithstanding, the relaxation of the isolated population raises the question of better release strategies to avoid the collapse of the health care system. We applied the model presented in Yang et al. (2021a) to forecast the epidemiological scenarios of relaxation (Yang et al. 2020b ) based on the plan elaborated by the S\u00e3o Paulo State authorities (Plano s\u00e3o paulo 2020). They assessed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on the healthcare system's capacity. Unfortunately, that relaxation plane was not implemented due to the quick increase in new cases. Ferguson et al. (2020) adapted an agent-based model describing the influenza epidemic to investigate the impact of the isolation of susceptible individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic, which was referred to as non-pharmaceutical interventions (mitigation and suppression). Briefly, mitigation reduces the basic reproduction number R 0 but not lower than one, while suppression reduces the basic reproduction number lower than one. Hence, S\u00e3o Paulo State is an example of mitigation, while Spain, of suppression (Yang et al. 2021a ). However, the mitigation strategy by a partial quarantine sustains the COVID-19 epidemic. Consequently, like all RNA-based viruses, SARS-CoV-2 suffers mutations as the chain of infections is maintained continuously (WHO 2021) . \"A virus with one or several new mutations (small changes during the replication) is referred to as a variant of the original virus\" (WHO 2021).",

The adapted model does not take into account the different COVID-19 fatalities depending on age but considers relaxation characterized by a series of pulses' release, SARS-CoV-2 mutation resulting in a more virulent variant, and the waning of immunity. However, this model does not take into account the vaccination. We aim to describe the epidemiological scenario of incipient vaccination found in S\u00e3o Paulo State. Siddiqi and Mehra (2020) described three progressive clinical phases of COVID-19: (1) mild (early infection), (2) moderate, subdivided into without and with hypoxia (pulmonary involvement), and (3) severe (systemic hyper inflammation), leading to the cytokine storm. We assess the number of fatalities taking into account the severe COVID-19 evolution distributed into three clinical phases.",

In the first months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the scarcity of the tests (serology and PCR) due to the novelty of the pandemic did not allow to test those individuals with COVID-19 symptoms. Hence, the test to confirm infection by SARS-CoV-2 was performed basically in the hospitalized and dead individuals presenting COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, almost all recorded data in S\u00e3o Paulo State were composed of severe COVID-19 cases. However, the widespread test to catch SARS-CoV-2 infection included those presenting mild COVID-19 and asymptomatic individuals. For this reason, in this section, we estimate the registered COVID-19 deaths instead of the severe cases. The parameters related to the natural history of the original COVID-19 and the estimated transmission parameters are given in Table 2 , which are maintained constant. The parameters' values for the variant COVID-19 are changed based on the original virus's values, given in Table 2 . As we pointed out, the mutations occur as the epidemic evolves, and individuals infected with a pool of less virulent viruses may harbor more virulent viruses by mutation. The variant virus may coexist or even displaces the original virus by competition, and the severe COVID-19 cases increase. Hence, we estimate the fraction of individuals infected with the original virus being transferred to the compartment of individuals harboring variant viruses by mutations. Table 4 shows the date of the i-th transfer and the corresponding value for j i k , with k = E, A, P, M, and the fatality rate \u03b1 v . The fatality rate increased by 14% compared to the mortality induced by the original virus, which increased by 39% only in the last release on February 25, 2021.",

            "text": "In Table 4 , we assumed small j E , and the relations j P = 2 j A and j M = 3 j A . The reason behind these assumptions is the increased mutations occurring along with the progression of the infection. For instance, the exposed individuals are just infected and harboring a negligible amount of virus; hence, j E assumes small value. Suppose that a small amount of virus characterizes asymptomatic status; thus, j A must be lower than j P and j M . Finally, individuals in mild disease conditions spend more time in this stage than pre-symptomatic individuals besides harboring a large amount of virus; hence j M > j P . Notice that the transfer from compartments of individuals infected with the original virus to variant virus compartments increased on November 2, 2020, with an additional increase on February 25, 2021. Figure 5 shows the estimated curves \u0398 o , \u0398 v , and \u0398 and the observed data (a), and the calculated curve \u0398 d and the observed data (b). The 7-day moving average of the daily observed data is also shown in Fig. 5b . The curves \u0398 and \u0398 d are given by Eqs. (9) and (10). The estimated curves \u0398 o , \u0398 v , and \u0398 approach asymptotically 38270, 93000, and 131300. Figure 6 shows the estimated curves \u03a9 o , \u03a9 v , and \u03a9 and the observed data (a), and the calculated curve \u03a9 d and the observed data (b). The 7-day moving average of the daily observed data is also shown in Fig. 6b . The curves \u03a9 and \u03a9 d are given by Eqs. (7) and (8). The estimated curves \u03a9 o , \u03a9 v , and \u03a9 approach asymptotically 735800, 1.408 million, and 1.783 million. Figure 6a shows the recorded COVID-19 data above the estimated severe cases \u03a9, confirming that these observed data carry on the mild and perhaps asymptomatic individuals caught by mass tests. However, Fig. 6b shows roughly a similar trend between the lowervalued estimated daily curve \u03a9 d and the observed data \u03a9 ob . Notice that at mid-May 2021, there is an increasing trend not captured by the estimation, which was also seen smoothly in Fig. 5b . Figure 7a shows the COVID-19 epidemic curves D, D v , and D tot = D+D v corresponding to the estimated curves presented in Figs. 5a and 6a. Figure 7b shows the proportions D/D tot and D v /D tot (b). The ascending phase of the D curve is roughly characterized by the effective reproduction number given by Eq. (33) greater than one (R e f > 1), while the descending phase, by R e f < 1 (see Yang et al. 2021a ). The epidemic peak (62080) with the original virus in the quarantine occurred on July 1, 2020, and the epidemic peak (109800) with the majority of variant virus in the relaxation occurred on May 5, 2021. The more virulent SARS-CoV-2 transmission increased the severe COVID-19 cases by 77%. Figure 7a shows a severe variant epidemic increasing rapidly at the end of 2020, reaching the peak on May 5, 2021. This more intense epidemic in comparison with the original one is due to the relaxation allied with the widespread of the variant SARS-CoV-2 having higher R 0v (9.4% higher than R 0 ). In Fig. 7b , we observe the displacement of the original SARS-CoV-2 by the variant virus, which corresponds to around 80% of infections at the beginning of 2021.",

Among these mutations, some acquired an enhanced ability to infect cells, increasing the risk of death. In fact, S\u00e3o Paulo State still maintained part of the population in isolation, but 68,904 deaths on March 24, 2021, surpassed 57,300 predicted by the epidemic with original SARS-CoV-2 (Yang et al. 2021a ). This higher number of deaths may be a consequence of the appearance of more virulent variants during the prolonged SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, more viruses will be released in the environment when more cells are infected, increasing the transmission. Considering these biological effects, we shortened parameters \u03c3 \u22121 v and \u03b3 \u22121 1v (times to become infectious and to present symptoms) and enlarged \u03b3 \u22121 v , \u03b3 \u22121 2v , and \u03b3 \u22121 3v (times to recover from the infection) in Table 2 . On the other hand, the increased number of severe symptomatic individuals is isolated in hospitals, and mild cases are detected by test and advised to isolate. Contrarily, the decreased numbers of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals (carriers) are not detected and circulate freely. Additionally, the carriers are in close contact with other susceptible individuals, contrarily to individuals manifesting any suspicious symptoms (not necessarily COVID-19). These populational features and social behaviors may vary the transmission rates, increasing or decreasing. These complex biological and populational influences on the COVID-19 epidemic were oversimplified in our model, and letting for the variant virus transmission rates the same values estimated from the original virus, we obtained R 0v = 8.35.",

This transfer can be hypothesized to have two origins in the individuals infected with the pool of less virulent virus: (1) the occurrence of muta- Figures 5b shows a good fitting for the daily recorded data of deaths. From this fitting, we retrieved the daily severe COVID-19 curve shown in Fig. 6b . The observed data situate above the retrieved curve, but the pattern is similar in both curves, indicating that the difference is the infected individuals caught by mass tests. Using the accumulated severe COVID-19 curve \u03a9 retrieved from the estimated curve \u0398 shown in Fig. 6a , we estimated the accumulated deaths using the clinical evolution shown in Fig. 9b . At the end of the first wave of the epidemic, the number of fatalities will stay between 131300 and 142600. Yang et al. (2021a) stated that the importance of a flattened epidemic by quarantine was the avoidance of the overloaded hospitals and the time gained to develop vaccines. In Yang et al. (2020b) , they showed that the relaxation retook the interrupted epidemic, approaching the natural epidemic, which is characterized by the absence of any interventions (quarantine and protective measures). We use the original virus parameters given in Table 2 to evaluate the fraction of recovered individuals at the end of the first natural epidemic (when the first plateau is reached) as a function of the basic reproduction number. Figure 10 shows the fraction R/N at the end of the first wave of the natural epidemic as a function of R 0 . For R 0 = 7.63, we have R/N = 99.38% and S/N = 0.25% .",

We must consider that the time of registering new cases and deaths is delayed by \u0394 1 days, that is, \u0398 1o (t + \u0394 1 ) = \u03b1 1o \u03c2 1o B 1o (t), for instance. All model parameters are described in Yang et al. (2021a) , except the hospitalization parameters' values. Let us present their values, considering three clinical stages in the COVID-19 states: (I) early infection, (II) pulmonary phase, and (III) hyper inflammation phase. Siddiqi and Mehra (2020) observed that complications appeared around 10-12 days after initial symptoms, leading to the cytokine storm. Hence, we let for the period in each one of the three phases \u03c2 \u22121 1o = 3, \u03c2 \u22121 2o = 7 and \u03c2 \u22121 3o = 15 (all in days). We allow increased periods for variant subpopulation, \u03c2 \u22121 1o = 4, \u03c2 \u22121 2o = 9 and \u03c2 \u22121 3o = 20 (all in days). At the beginning of the epidemic, severe COVID-19 cases (D) were confirmed during hospital care; hence, we use h o = 1.0 and h v = 1.0. In Wuhan, China (Surveillances 2020), 81% of infections did not need hospital care, 14% were severe (developing severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath), and 4.7% were critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure). From 19%, we use h 1 = 0.19, which is the proportion of hospitalized individuals. However, we use higher values for variant and original subpopulations, h 1v = 0.25 and h 1o = 0.21. For the ratio hospital:ICUs/intubated, we use approximately 14% and 4.7%, resulting in 3 : 1, and h 2 = 1/4 = 0.25, which is the proportion of ICUs/intubated care. However, we use higher values for variant and original subpopulations, h 2v = 0.5 and h 2o = 0.45. We assume a low mortality rate in viremia (phase 1), letting \u03b1 1o = 0.0005 and \u03b1 1v = 0.0005. For patients with an inflammatory response in-hospital care (phase 2), we let \u03b1 2o = 0.04 and \u03b1 2v = 0.04. Finally, we assume that proportions not surviving in ICUs/intubated with Cytokine storm (phase 3) are \u03b1 3o = 0.55 and \u03b1 3v = 0.55.",
