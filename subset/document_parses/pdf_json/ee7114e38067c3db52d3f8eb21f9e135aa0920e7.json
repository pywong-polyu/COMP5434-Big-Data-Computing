From classic network-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to the more recent concerns of privacy compromises, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are becoming an urgent need to safeguard the modern information technology landscape. The development of these IDS relies on training and evaluation datasets that must evolve with time and represent the contemporary threat landscape. The purpose of this analysis is to explore such recent datasets, describe how they enable research endeavours and the development of novel IDS. Specifically, 7 recent datasets published for IDS research have been reviewed along with selected publications that have employed them. In doing so, the discussion emphasizes the need for the publication of even more modern datasets, especially for emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphone devices, to ensure that modern networks and communication channels are secured. Furthermore, a taxonomy based on the discussed datasets has been developed that can be used to inform the dataset selection process for future research endeavours.",

As more and more people begin using technology in their daily lives and generate the vast amounts of data that we observe today, the threat to users' privacy is perhaps greater than it has ever been before.

Privacy is an active research area and has attracted the interest of many cybersecurity researchers. As with intrusion detection research, there is a pressing need for reliable and valid datasets that can be used to train and evaluate privacy preserving and compromising techniques. One such dataset was published in 2017 by the researchers in [12] . The dataset contains labelled traffic over the Tor network and was developed as part of the researchers' effort to develop a technique to identify Tor traffic and classify it into one of eight categories -browsing, chat, audio-streaming, video-streaming, mail, VOIP, P2P, and File Transfer. Tor is currently one of the most popular tools used by internet users to encrypt and anonymize their traffic to avoid surveillance on the internet. Identifying Tor traffic and being able to classify it into one of several categories as suggested by the researchers represents a severe privacy risk for unsuspecting users. Thus, the researchers in [12] hope to increase the level of privacy that can be achieved on the Tor network by publishing this dataset to facilitate the study of its current vulnerabilities. The dataset generation process is discussed next.",

Therefore, techniques that can identify users on the Tor network may decrease the level of privacy for an average user, yet they are an essential tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity and law enforcement professionals to protect the interests of society at large. [13] uses the Tor-nonTor dataset Another application of the Tor-nonTor dataset, that has been studied by researchers in [14] , is identifying nonTor traffic on a Tor network to shed light on the activities that when carried out on a Tor network can downgrade privacy safeguards and thus put users at risk. Specifically, the study evaluated the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) at identifying nonTor traffic. Based on their experiments, the researchers concluded that an ANN built on features derived through correlationbased feature selection achieved the best results with a detection accuracy of 99.8% for nonTor traffic. The discussed applications emphasize the versatility of the TOR-nonTOR dataset through the fact that it can be used to inform research endeavours both to increase as well as decrease the privacy-level of users on the Tor Network.

According to a 2017 report by Symantec, the ratio of benign to malicious software on mobile devices is 80/20 [16] .

First, the fact that this dataset was generated using real smartphones and not emulators serves to boost researchers' confidence in its validity and reliability. The other contributing factor for this choice is that the dataset is large and comprehensive enough that even though the researchers were interested in investigating only 1 of the 4 categories of malware captured in the dataset, there was enough volume within that one category to still be useful for the intended purpose.

The dataset's \"realistic representation\" [20] of IoT networks as well as its large size of heterogenous and malicious records afford it a level of malleability that was previously unattainable; even more so for newer network architectures such as that of IoT devices. By deriving adversarial samples, the researchers were able to demonstrate that even with the immensely popular FNNs there is a significant drop in performance when evaluated solely on adversarial samples. Specifically, the tested FNN achieved an accuracy of 95.1% on the standard data but an average accuracy of only 24.33% on adversarial samples [20] . Their proposed SNN was able to bridge the gap partially but also performed considerably worse on adversarial samples. This result highlights the need for more sophisticated IDS techniques to be developed and tested on an increasing number of adversarial samples -a finding that would have been impossible without the Bot-IoT dataset.",

The research paper was published in 2019 and the researchers cite the dataset's resemblance to real-world networks as the reason why CICIDS2017 was used for evaluation. The researchers implemented several deep learning-based models, focussing primarily on DDoS attacks and obtained the highest precision of 98.44% through an LSTM model. Their worst performing model was an MLP that achieved precision of 88.47%. These performance metrics are relatively high and represent exceptional intrusion detection performance.

Even older datasets such as the NSL-KDD dataset would be classified under this category, so there are plenty of datasets to choose from in this category. However, given the dynamic nature of the cyber threats landscape, the development of new datasets that accurately encapsulate the nature of attacks on modern networks is still of immense value to the research community.",

It is apparent from the discussion above that the development of new datasets that represent the nature of traffic across newer technologies like smartphones and IoT, as well as the ever-evolving nature of threats on modern networks is imperative to aid research endeavours that can help ensure the highest standard of security and privacy for users across all forms of networked communications. In this survey we conducted an in-depth review of 7 datasets that have been published recently for intrusion detection research by reputable institutions in the research community. Through our discussions we highlighted the rapid rate of development of the information technology industry and the evolution of branching industries such as IoT and smartphone devices to such an extent where traditional IDS datasets are no longer applicable for these specific use-cases. By exploring the solutions developed on the back of the considered modern datasets, we have shed light on the need for the development of even more datasets that are representative of the modern IT environment to ensure that intrusion detection research endeavours are not limited by the lack of appropriate evaluation datasets. Specifically, future efforts should aim to develop even more datasets for underrepresented branching technologies such as IoT, smartphones, wearable sensor devices, etc. for traffic based IDS. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for more datasets to be published to enable research endeavours concerned with privacy-preservation in an increasingly online world.",
