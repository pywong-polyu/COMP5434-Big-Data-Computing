We investigated the possibility to probe the lung with time domain diffuse optics, taking advantage of the increased depth (few cm) reached by photons detected after a long (few ns) propagation time. An initial study on 5 healthy volunteers included time-resolved broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy measurements at 3 cm source-detector distance over the 600-1100 nm range, and long-distance (6-9 cm) measurements at 820 nm performed during a breathing protocol. The interpretation of the in vivo data with a simplified homogeneous model yielded a maximum probing depth of 2.6-3.9 cm, suitable to reach the lung. Also, signal changes related to the inspiration act were observed, especially at high photon propagation times. Yet, intra-and inter-subject variability and inconsistencies, possibly alluring to competing scattering and absorption effects, prevented a simple interpretation. Aspects to be further investigated to gain a deeper insight are discussed.",

Accordingly, they can be visualised noninvasively through the attenuation of x-rays from an external source. In clinical practice, both conventional chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are widely used to detect pulmonary abnormalities. Thanks to its inherent tomographic properties, CT is superior to conventional CXR in visualising the fine structure of the lung. Modern CT scanners are capable of detecting small solid lesions down to a size of 5 mm in width. However, neither CXR nor CT provide any direct information as regards the chemical composition of an abnormal lung density. The same limitation applies to thoracic ultrasound (US) which is increasingly used by the clinicians to evaluate pleural effusions or subpleural consolidations at bedside.",

In patients with left heart failure, lung density may increase substantially due to the accumulation of water in the extravascular space of the lung (pulmonary edema). Also, lung inflammations with fluid accumulation (caused e.g. by COVID-19 or other infections) leads to changes in lung density and composition. Lung density can be equally increased by an abnormal deposition of collagen in the lung interstitium (fibrosis).",

They include diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [7, 8] , endogenous [9] or exogenous fluorescence spectroscopy [10, 11] , optical coherent tomography [12] , and Raman spectroscopy [13] . Much effort is also being devoted to model the photon propagation through the lung by means of simulations [14, 15] anthropomorphic lung phantoms [16, 17] , and ex vivo bovine lung tissues [18] . Conversely, there are not many attempts to probe the lung optically non-invasively transcutaneously. In a first clinical study on 3 full-term babies, an optical technique termed \"Gas in Scattering Media Absorption spectroscopy\" (GASMAS) was used for noninvasive monitoring of water vapor in the lungs [19] . A larger study on 29 newborn infants demonstrated transcutaneous detection of oxygen in the lungs using GASMAS [20] . This approach was further validated also on a piglet animal model [21] . Yet, to the best of our knowledge, so far no non-invasive optical approach has been applied in vivo on the lungs in adults.",

We adopted here the single-wavelength system while choosing the maximum permitting to reach the max count rate for the instrumentation (1 M counts/s).

Here, we adopted the approach proposed in Ref. [28] that derives the mean value of the maximum depth of all possible photon trajectories in a semi-infinite medium (see Material and Methods for details). Figure 3 displays as a function of photon travelling time for the derived for each subject at 820 nm with = 3 cm (data from Fig. 1) , which reasonably represents the mean scattering properties in the superficial chest layers than need to be traversed to reach the lung. For a homogeneous medium, the mean depth is rigorously independent of both and , which affect the number of collected photons but do not alter the depth distribution of photon trajectories for a given . Calculating the maximum photon arrival time yielding >10,000 counts/s for a late gate (shot noise = 1%) we derive \u2248 3.2 \u2212 5.7 ns, which leads to \u2248 2.6 \u2212 3.9 cm for different subjects, as represented by lines in Fig. 3 . ) as a function of photon arrival time derived for the properties of the 5 subjects. The straight lines indicate the maximum yielding a count-rate >10,000 counts/s over a late gate for data in Fig. 2 , and the corresponding value of As a more realistic scenario, we assumed a two-layer medium composed of the lung (bottom layer) and all the overlaying tissues (top layer). Using a Monte Carlo code, we simulated a 10% reduction in the lung absorption. Figure 4 shows the relative contrast between the perturbed and unperturbed states plotted as a function of the photon arrival time for different depths of the lung layer (rows) and for different choices of in the lung (columns), while assuming = 7 cm \u22121 for the upper layer. A relative contrast \u2248 2 \u2212 3% is achieved down to \u2248 3 cm for = 4 ns, and even down to \u2248 4 cm for = 8 ns. Quite surprisingly, the lung scattering does not affect much . Yet this is in agreement with the previous argument that the photon travelling depth is mostly affected by the upper layer. This result relaxes the threat that an extremely high in the lung could completely prevent lung sensing. Indeed, there is not yet a sound knowledge in literature of the lung scattering properties, and we opted to span a wide range. The scattering of the upper layer could be an additional variable, although we observed limited inter-subject variability (see Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).",

Figure 5 reports the evolution of (red, left axis) and (blue, right axis) as obtained using a homogeneous fit over the time of the task for the 5 subjects (columns) and 2 positions on the chest, namely an up-right location (UR, top row) and a down-right location (DR, bottom row). The protocol in use was Prot10 and the folding average over the exercise time was applied. In general, there is a task-related change in the fitted optical properties. Yet, the results are somehow contradictory with large inter-and intra-subject differences. In some cases, (e.g. #5-DR), both and decrease with inhalation as expected from the reduction in lung density, but in other cases the behavior is just the opposite (e.g. #3-UR), or even a parameter increases while the other decreases (e.g. #1-DR). Also intra-subject differences among the two positions are observed (e.g. #1). The task-related alteration is observed also in the not-refolded time evolution (see Supplementary Fig. S1 ), yet again with quite different patterns. According to our own experience in TD-DOS, a homogeneous fit of a large-measurement typically enhances the optical properties of the lower (few cm depth) layer [29] .

Yet, following simulations in Fig. 4 , ( ) should be monotonically increasing with due to the increase in mean probed depth and therefore in lung contribution. The situation depicted in Fig. 7 is more complex. There seem to be two opposite competing factors causing the IN-OUT curve to cross the null contrast at a given\u00afand then to diverge for larger values. Similar results are observed for the Prot5 protocol (see Supplementary Fig. S7 ). All these in vivo results seem to point out that we are possibly reaching the lung, but there are competing factors, making the interpretation of the breathing protocol not straightforward.

Even more intriguing, complex phenomena such as anomalous diffusion due to the air gaps could be invoked [31] . As a very simple, extreme case, we plot in Fig. 8 the Monte Carlo simulation of the contrast ( ) assuming an identical reduction by 20% of and in the lung. A reduction only in absorption (red line) yields a linear increase of vs . A reduction only in scattering (blue line) yields a linear decrease of vs of a comparable amount.

            "text": "A second troubling factor resides in the lung scattering, which could be extremely high, thus preventing its exploration. There is still poor knowledge on the lung optical properties, particularly in vivo. Some ex vivo studies report different values for reaching up to 20 cm \u22121 at 800 nm (calculated using Eq. 2 and tabulated and values) [32] , but this high value could be due to the room temperature adopted in measurements leading to overestimation of with respect to the in vivo environment. At any rate, simulations presented in Fig. 4 indicate that the scattering of the lower (lung) layer is not so critical in determining the sensitivity to lung properties beyond a given photon travelling time over a large range of lung values. A third factor to be considered is the pleura, which is the two-foil membrane enveloping the lung and the chest wall, separated by a lubrication fluid, which permits smooth sliding and expansion of the lung during the inhalation act. From the optical point of view, the pleura could cause a light-guiding effect, creating contamination from more superficial photons even at a large values, thus covering deep photon signals. Also in the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was questioned to cause light-guiding effects in functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy measurements (fNIRS). This issue was long discussed in the initial ages of fNIRS with opposite conclusions, but now the question is definitely settled by strong evidence of cortex-related activation in many studies and agreement with fMRI scans [33] . The pleura thickness -extrapolated from animal data -could be in the 30 \u2212 40 range [34] , so definitely lower than the CBF layer. A forth aspect is the inadequacy of the simple analysis tools used in this study to describe the complex chest structure. The homogeneous fit proposed in Fig. 5 is a clear oversimplification of the actual geometry. Yet, in previous works confirmed with phantom experiments, we demonstrated that spectra obtained for reasonable large values using a homogeneous fit tend to adhere to the lower (few cm deep) layer [29] . The photon pathlength in the upper layer reaches quickly a stable plateau after a given , while the pathlength in the lower layer linearly increases with above the same threshold. Thus, the fit on is mainly affected by the lower layer properties being related to the temporal slope on the tail of the DTOF. Still, this simple argument does not hold true for , and in our case the variation in both and might not be properly captured by this simple model.",

In vivo broadband absorption and reduced scattering spectra in the 600-1100 nm range at = 3 cm analyzed using a homogeneous model permitted to estimate a possible range of optical properties mostly ascribed to the tissues to be traversed to reach the lung. In particular, around 800 nm we obtained = 0.1 \u2212 0.2 cm \u22121 , and = 7 \u2212 9 cm \u22121 . Even at a larger (7 \u2212 9 cm), the measured optical properties at 820 nm fall in a similar range. The same largein vivo measurements showed that a photon travelling time up to \u2248 3.2 \u2212 5.7 ns with at least 10,000 counts/s (shot noise=1%) in a late gate could be reached for different subjects. Also, two-layer Monte Carlo simulations with different choices of lung in a wide range of values (3 \u2212 48 cm \u22121 ) showed a relative contrast \u2248 2 \u2212 3% for a 10% reduction in lung down to a depth of 3 (4) cm for = 4 (8) ns, which is well beyond the average lung depth. The in vivo measurements on a paced breathing protocol showed clear task-related changes in time domain signals. Yet, the analysis of DTOFs using a homogeneous model showed contradictory results, not in agreement with the expected decrease in both and during inhalation. Conversely, the plot of the relative contrast for the photon counts in temporal gates showed a more consistent trend with a general increase in reflectance signal during the inhalation phase, as expected from diffuse optics models. Still, the contrast is not always increasing upon increasing photon arrival times, as foreseen by a two-layered model, and there seems to be competition between opposite factors.",

We plan to deploy the whole dataset in an open data paper for future analysis with more refined models. Technology is advancing at a fast pace in TD-DOS, both in terms of reduction in cost-size and improvement in performances. In particular, the increase in area of new SiPMs detectors [35] as well as the gating capabilities [36] means that larger photon travelling times and consequently penetration depths will be reached in the near future. What we still lack is a clear understanding of the physics and physiology of chest diffuse optics and further studies are needed to add additional insight and in vivo validation.",
