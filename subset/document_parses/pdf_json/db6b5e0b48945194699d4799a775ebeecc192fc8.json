Such divergences put the immunization of the population in the background and create additional hurdles beyond the pandemic, mistrust and scepticism over vaccines. We conduct a mathematical modelling study to analyse the impacts of late vaccination along with slowly increasing coverage, as well as how harmful it would be if part of the population refused to get vaccinated or missed the second dose. We analyse data from confirmed cases, deaths and vaccination in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the period between 10 March 2020 and 27 October 2021. We estimate that if the start of vaccination had been 30 days earlier, combined with efforts to drive vaccination rates up, about 31 657 deaths could have been avoided. In addition, the slow pace of vaccination and the low demand for the second dose could cause a resurgence of cases as early as 2022. Even when reaching the expected vaccination coverage for the first dose, it is still challenging to increase adherence to the second dose and maintain a high vaccination rate to avoid new outbreaks.",

To date, nearly 9% of all cases in the world were identified in Brazil and, considering a 7-day rolling average, the country has had at least a thousand deaths per day for more than 240 days since the onset of the epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month [1] and, even after Brazil declared COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) a national public health emergency on 3 February 2020 [2] , the Brazilian government has managed the epidemic very loosely so far [3] [4] [5] , without a cooperative effort and strategic planning to fight the pandemic. Brazil also faces many economic and socio-cultural challenges that affect mitigation strategies, such as a large disparity in the mortality rate in economically disadvantaged regions [6] , the uneven geographic distribution of intensive care unit (ICU) beds [7, 8] and lack of investment and vulnerability of the health system [9] . Each federal unit is self-governing for decisions regarding efforts to curb the spread of the disease [10] , which leads to inequalities, such as unbalanced social distancing measures and lack of mass testing and viral spread tracking.",

Despite the critical situation in containing the ensuing epidemic and the resurgence of cases (especially with the emergence of new variants), compared to other countries Brazil had delays in starting the vaccination campaign [11] , which began on 17 January 2021. Even with a slight increase in the pace of vaccination in recent months, vaccination efforts remain far below what is required, with only 72.62% of the national population having received at least one dose by 6 November 2021. In turn, the second dose began to be administered on 5th February, and since then only 56.65% of the population has been immunized. To achieve full coverage for people aged 18 and over by the end of 2021, Brazil needed an average of 1.5 million doses of vaccine administered per day [12] . As of 6 November 2021, the average is approximately 946 000 per day (first dose and second dose or single dose). Currently, the population benefits from vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-Astra-Zeneca, Janssen and Sinovac (the latter two approved for emergency use up to the time of writing this paper).",

With an estimated population of approximately 17.3 million inhabitants in 2020, the state of Rio de Janeiro is more populous than countries like Belgium, Portugal and Sweden. The first case reported in the state was that of a traveller returning from Italy and, since then, Rio de Janeiro has been one of the states in which the epidemic has grown the fastest, reaching a rate of contagion (in terms of the basic reproduction number) between 2.2 and 4.9 [13] . The progress of vaccination in the state follows the slow pace of the rest of the country: 12.76 million people had received the first dose (73.77% of the population) and 8.96 million people had received the second dose (51.78% of the population) as of 6 November 2021. On average, approximately only 74 800 vaccines have been administered per day since the start of the vaccination campaign in the state, on 20 January 2021.",

Millions of people are also missing their second dose-especially because of misinformation, assuming that just one dose provides the expected immunity [20, 21] -and also owing to temporary interruptions of vaccination services, a lack of shots, logistical problems or the absence of supplies ( particularly active pharmaceutical ingredient) [22, 23] .

Initially, assume that \u03b2(t) is the transmission rate over time and \u03b3 is the removal rate. The gain in the infective class (I) is at a rate proportional to the product of the contact rates and transmission probability between infectives and susceptibles (S); that is, the rate of new incidences is given by \u03b2(t)S(t)I(t)/N, where N is the population size. In turn, the rate at which infected individuals move into the removed class (R) is given by \u03b3I(t). Of note, we also compute the number of dead individuals, once infected, which are eventually moved into the dead class (D) at a rate of \u03c1I(t), where \u03c1 is the death rate. Assume that both susceptible and infected individuals can be vaccinated (the latter are able to be vaccinated as they may be asymptomatic). Considering that n different vaccines can be administered in a population, individuals vaccinated with a given vaccine i are moved into the corresponding vaccinated class (V i ) at a rate equal to \u03bd i (S(t) + I(t)), where \u03bd i is the vaccination rate associated with vaccine i, for i \u00bc 1, . . ., n. Individuals remain in compartment V i for the period equivalent to the interval between doses (when applicable), which is given by 1/\u03c4 i . After this period, vaccinated individuals are considered immune and therefore moved into the removed class, taking into account the efficacy of the corresponding vaccine, \u03b7 i . If immunity is not acquired with proper vaccination, vaccinated individuals may become susceptible again, whose class is fed back proportionally to ( ",

The accumulation of confirmed cases that are not reported on weekends, in addition to a large-scale underreporting of cases and a reduced testing capacity are some of the main causes of such noise. The authors provide a numerical analysis of how data regularization using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) can help reduce the effect of noise on parameter estimation. The study shows that when successive parameter estimates are performed, gradually adding data to the training set and comparing the corresponding model outcomes to the test set, there is great variability in the results. Such variability becomes evident when very different parameter estimates are obtained using slightly distinct training datasets (sometimes just adding one more datum to the training set). However, when the training set is regularized, the variability of the results has a remarkable reduction. In these circumstances, the regularization of data emerges as an alternative to reduce the noise level, without misrepresenting data behaviour, in order to streamline the task of fitting model responses to the dataset. This is our motivation for using regularized data in this study.",

GPR differs from regular regression models in that distributions are defined over functions, rather than their parameters, not requiring the definition of a parametric model that would be able to fit a set of observable data. The strength of GPs in steering experiments is due to the fact that realizations correspond to random functions, such that priors for unknown regression functions are provided and updated with knowledge of observable data. GPs depend on defining covariance functions (also known as kernels) that are used to define a similarity measure of the inputs [32] . Thus GPRs are able to avoid simple parametric assumptions (because it is a non-parametric approach), while providing uncertainty quantification on the predictions [33] .",

Table 2 shows the attributes related to each vaccine's efficacy and dosage (including the interval between doses) adopted in this study. The simulations are conducted considering three scenarios related to the overall vaccination rate: the base scenario is associated with the average vaccination rate at the time of writing this paper; that is, n \u00bc 0:40% of the population vaccinated per day. This corresponds to approximately 69 200 vaccinated individuals per day, which agrees with the average of daily vaccinations. In the two other hypothetical scenarios, we consider n \u00bc 0:35% and n \u00bc 0:50% of the population vaccinated per day. In this setting, approximately 60 550 and 86 500 individuals are vaccinated per day, on average, respectively. Taking into account the situation of asymptomatic individuals and a poor testing policy, which leads to substantial underreporting of cases, we adopt the same vaccination rate for susceptible and infected individuals [48, 49] . Figure 2b shows the frequencies of vaccination rates considering both shots (single-dose vaccines count as second doses), given the cumulative number of individuals vaccinated per day, which in turn is shown in figure 2c . The target vaccination coverage for the first dose would be reached in approximately 290 days, which means that 80% of the population would have received at least the first dose by November 2021, as supported by the prediction shown in figure 2c . As for the second dose, the prediction indicates that the population would be immunized in the first months of 2022, respecting the interval between doses. ",

Within this context, we also consider scenarios with low \u00f0a \u00bc 20%\u00de and moderate \u00f0a \u00bc 10%\u00de demand for the second dose of vaccines (when applicable), as well as the best scenario in which a \u00bc 0%.",

Simulations show that presumably not-so-challenging measures, such as having anticipated the vaccination campaign roll-out by just ten days, combined with an average vaccination rate approximately 25% faster, could have averted 15 129 deaths (12 029-16 986) in relation to the actual scenario; from a more optimistic, yet still realistic, perspective on the vaccination roll-out, consider a 30-day advance on the date on which the campaign actually started. In this framework, 31 657 deaths (25 801-35 117) could have been prevented, which represents 44.68% of the deaths (40.93-46.41%) that would have occurred since vaccination was started, assuming a vaccination rate equal to n \u00bc 0:40%.

By contrast, starting mass vaccination 30 days before 20 January 2021, when Rio de Janeiro had 457 160 cases (448 776-467 785) and 23 546 deaths (23 114-24 093), could have caused the number of deaths to drop to 20% compared to the worst-case scenario, assuming that n \u00bc 0:40%.",

Of note, the recommended inter-dose interval for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines is 21-28 days [43] .

[55] . Such statistics shed light on the importance of getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Social mobility and NPIs are also important factors when analysing the course of vaccination. The engagement of the Brazilian population in such measures has always been below expectations [56] . A very relevant fact is that only 45.5% of Brazilians say they wear a face mask outside the home [57] . Our findings show that the possibility of an eventual resurgence of cases in 2022 should not be overlooked, even though most of the population has been vaccinated.

In the proposed model, infected individuals, even having been vaccinated, can die. The frequency of deaths is preeminently related to the efficacy of the vaccine. However, note that in our model, vaccine efficacy has no relevant effect on transmission rate, but on the rate at which individuals are moved into the removed compartment. Therefore, the vaccination rate acts in the system of differential equations as a modulator of the rate at which individuals are moved from the infected to the dead compartment, as vaccines prevent severe disease and therefore reduce the mortality rate, but with no significant effect on the transmission rate [60] .",

Such simulations indicate that if the vaccination process were faster, allowing the vaccination of approximately 8650 more people per day (with n \u00bc 0:5%) compared to the amount vaccinated in the base scenario, on average, the number of cases could be reduced by 26.58%, from 1 378 382 (1 226 446-1 472 044) to 1 011 948 (944 239-1 054 368) cases, whereas the death toll would drop from 70 846 (63 037-75 659) to 52 013 (48 532-54 193). On the other hand, when the pace of vaccination is delayed proportionally to n \u00bc 0:35%, the adverse effect is disproportionately greater: the number of confirmed cases would rise to 1 922 585 (1 607 030-2 128 694), a meaningful increase of 39.48%, and deaths could reach 98 812 (82 596-109 401).",

Interface 19: 20220275 6 398 467 (4 754 038-7 462 813), whereas there could have been 328 781 deaths (244 308-383 445). If we look at the opposite scenario, when more effort is put into a rapid vaccination \u00f0n \u00bc 0:50%\u00de that started 30 days before the actual day, the number of cases and deaths would drop to 660 212 (637 960-677 854) and 33 935 (32 791-34 841), respectively. We also sought to directly relate the number of vaccinated and dead individuals, aiming to analyse the likely hardship to the population when the start of vaccination is delayed, compared to the scenario in which vaccination had started earlier. Suppose vaccination had started on 19 February 2021, 30 days beyond the actual date, when 313 deaths (291-324) would have been confirmed, as shown in figure 3c. Based on the benchmark vaccination rate, the simulations show that the deaths would peak approximately in June 2021, at 893 deaths (700-1001). At this time, about 6 028 386 people (6 026 531-6 032 208) could have been vaccinated (with both doses and with the single-dose vaccine), representing approximately 34.84% of the population. However, the worst-case scenario would bring out a far more ruthless possibility: even with approximately 7 081 206 people immunized (7 078 053-7 091 406), deaths would peak in July 2021, reaching 1405 deaths in a single day",
