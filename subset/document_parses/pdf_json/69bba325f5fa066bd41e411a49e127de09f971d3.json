To evaluate the ePlex detection rate in the context of the known C T values when comparing the 2 workflows, the overall agreement stratified by the Fusion C T value was calculated (Table 2) . At low C T values <30, the percentage agreement for each workflow was 97% with the SDD and 100% without the SDD. However, as the C T values increased for samples tested with the SDD, 30 < C T < 33, 33 C T < 35, and C T ! 35 the agreement decreased to 78, 30, and 20% respectively. In contrast, when the same samples were tested using non-SDD processing, only samples with C T values of 33 C T < 35 and C T ! 35 showed a decrease in the percentage agreement of 93 and 60%, respectively. The analytical sensitivity or LoD of the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test using each workflow was determined using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus diluted in a negative NP specimen matrix. The positivity rate at which !95% detection was observed for SARS-CoV-2 using each workflow was a concentration of 1 TCID 50 /mL for replicates tested with the SDD workflow and a concentration of 0.03 TCID 50 /mL for replicates tested without the SDD ( Table 3 ). The verified LoD concentration for detection of SARS-CoV-2 using the non-SDD workflow was determined to be 0.03 TCID 50 /mL, which corresponds to 750 genomic copies per mL, as determined by digital droplet PCR.",

We also compared operational efficiency between these 2 workflows. This simple change led to a clear improvement in LoD, an overall median C T value shift of 1.65 (from 29.75 to 31.4) for those specimens detected, indicating that largely, more positive specimens were detected in the higher C T category. Overall detection also increased from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/ 145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. The mean C T values of those specimens \"not detected\" also shifted later, from 34.4 with SDD to 35.3 non-SDD, indicating that not detected specimens were in the later C T value range. Ct value ranges also show that 90% of the specimens that fell in the 33 to <35.3 C T range were detected, whereas, with the original SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this range. Based on our findings, it is clear that the removal of the SDD from the assay led to a substantially increased overall sensitivity and accuracy. These findings further reinforce that many factors can influence the performance characteristics of a molecular assay, including specimen preprocessing and assay buffers, as well as the established LoD of the assay. The workflow for this change also added efficiency, shaving $80 seconds off the HoT for each specimen. In an 8-hour shift where 96 specimens could be tested (assuming one 24-bay instrument), this represents >2 hours (128 minutes) of saved time in overall assay prep. In addition, the new ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel 2 (RP2) also uses the non-SDD workflow, partially based on the knowledge garnered from this study, making these findings relevant to the new panel design as well. RP2 expands the ePlex's FDA-cleared Respiratory Pathogen Panel to include the SARS-CoV-2 target on a broad multiplex panel allowing for rapid differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 from other circulating respiratory pathogens with similar symptomology. With the same processing workflow as the SARs-CoV-2 test, the RP2 workflow modification will provide similar overall efficiency improvements for laboratories that use a multiplex panel during the respiratory illness season when test volumes can be high.",
