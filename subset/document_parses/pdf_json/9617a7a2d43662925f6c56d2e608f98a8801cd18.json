There is very limited information on COVID-19 in the over-80s, and the rates of hospital-onset infections are unknown. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study from electronic case records of the first 450 patients admitted to our hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 77% of the total inpatient caseload to date. Demographic, clinical and biochemical data were extracted. The primary endpoint was death during the index hospital admission. The characteristics of all patients, those over 80 years of age and those with hospital-onset COVID-19 were examined. Results: The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%. Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p < 0.001). Thirty-one (7%) patients acquired COVID-19 having continuously been in hospital for a median of 20 (14, 36) days. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail than those with community-onset infection, their outcomes were no worse. Conclusions: Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who are more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population.

The percentage of White patients was higher in those who died and was 72% in those over 80 years old, again consistent with the higher proportion of White people in those who are older in the borough [15] . We therefore did not find evidence that the patients admitted or dying with COVID-19 differed from our local population although this study was not powered or designed to look at this specifically. Barnet is a relatively affluent borough compared to others in London, and it is also possible that this may have reduced any component of mortality related to socioeconomic status.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 174, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 396, "end": 399, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies of COVID-19 in the older population are small and have used differing variations for 'elderly' ranging from 60 to 65 years [19, 20] ; even these have included only small numbers of patients that would be classically considered 'elderly' in the UK, usually over 80 years of age. Mortality is linked to increasing age, and in line with non-COVID disease in the elderly, there has been suggestion [21] but little evidence that these patients are more likely to present atypically. Our findings confirm this; patients over 80 were significantly less likely to present with the typical COVID-19 features of cough, breathlessness and fever. They also presented earlier in their disease course suggesting lower physiological reserve. Lymphocyte count was lower in the over-80s, possibly reflecting age-related immune dysfunction or more severe disease. Age is independently linked to mortality [11] and this is reflected in our findings here. Although troponin differed significantly between age groups, consistent with the higher incidence of cardiac disease in the over-80s, it did not differ significantly by outcome in the elderly population. This may suggest that although cardiac dysfunction is present in the older population it is not the cause of death per se, although the smaller numbers here may mean that a statistically significant association may have been missed. CRP was associated with poor outcome in this age group, but neither this nor procalcitonin differed between the age categories, suggesting that bacterial infection may not be a greater driver of disease in older patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 144, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 411, "end": 415, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 904, "end": 908, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is also notable that a high proportion of the patients admitted from local care homes (78%) did not survive to discharge. These patients were among the most frail in the cohort. Local care homes were asked at the start of the outbreak to avoid hospitalising their patients wherever possible, and these are therefore likely to have been the most unwell of all the care home patients who contracted COVID-19, as well as the overall numbers being lower. The data in this study do not allow us to comment on the risk of contracting COVID-19 in care homes. These differences in the presentation and outcomes in older adults are of utmost importance given the significantly higher mortality seen in this population and the emerging picture of how COVID-19 has affected care homes in the UK. Further research should elucidate the mechanisms by which age-related biological variance impacts on the pathogenic response in COVID-19 and will be vital to enable effective therapeutic interventions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous series reporting the incidence of nosocomial COVID-19 estimate a higher proportion of nosocomial infection (44%) than we found in our patients [22] . Data have been of poor quality, however, and information from outside Hubei is lacking. For our analysis we used a stringent definition, including only those patients with continuous inpatient admission for the whole of the 14-day incubation period prior to symptoms, and the true incidence is almost certainly higher. Likewise, a proportion of the community-onset patients may have been misclassified. We felt it important, however, to be as robust as possible when reporting this important issue. These patients had already had prolonged admissions for unrelated reasons and correspondingly were an older and more frail group than the population as a whole. Despite this, CRP was lower and their outcomes were no worse, reflecting the fact that they effectively acquired COVID-19 incidentally while in hospital rather than presenting due to severe infection. The peak incidence of hospital-onset infections mirrored the overall peak of community infections, and the mode of transmission remains unclear; this may include relatives visiting before they were excluded and asymptomatic infected healthcare workers. It may also have included transmission from other patients either directly or via healthcare workers. Urgent further research into this area will be crucial to enabling robust infection control policy in the ongoing management of this and future pandemics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are several limitations to this study.

We also did not formally assess the causality of the deaths that were associated with COVID-19, although our clinical impression is that the majority of the deaths were directly linked. Furthermore, this was an observational study, and therefore, data collection was not standardised. Owing to this, and the fact that we only introduced a clinical care bundle specifying laboratory tests 2 to 3 weeks into the outbreak, there is a proportion of missing data in some of the biochemical variables. This will have affected our ability to detect more subtle signals, although does not diminish the significance of those we have reported.
