            "text": "Synaptic plasticity is vital for brain function and memory formation. One of the key proteins in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory is the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Mammalian Arc forms virus-like capsid structures in a process requiring the N-terminal domain and contains two C-terminal lobes that are structural homologues to retroviral capsids. Drosophila has two isoforms of Arc, dArc1 and dArc2, with low sequence similarity to mammalian Arc, but lacking a large N-terminal domain. Both dArc isoforms are related to the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon capsid, consisting of N-and C-terminal lobes. Structures of dArc1, as well as capsids formed by both dArc isoforms, have been recently determined. We carried out structural characterization of the four individual dArc lobe domains. As opposed to the corresponding mammalian Arc lobe domains, which are monomeric, the dArc lobes were all oligomeric in solution, indicating a strong propensity for homophilic interactions. A truncated N-lobe from dArc2 formed a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal structure, resulting in a novel dimer interaction that could be relevant for capsid assembly or other dArc functions. This domain-swapped structure resembles the dimeric protein C of flavivirus capsids, as well as the structure of histones dimers, domain-swapped transcription factors, and membrane-interacting BAK domains. The strong oligomerization properties of the isolated dArc lobe domains explain the ability of dArc to form capsids in the absence of any large N-terminal domain, in contrast to the mammalian protein.

Mammalian Arc (mArc) has a C-terminal domain (Arc-CT) with close structural homology to the C-terminal domain (CA-CTD) of the retroviral capsid (CA) protein [12] , and mArc-CT consists of two structurally similar lobe domains, N-lobe (NL) and C-lobe (CL) [12, 17] . Viral CA has in addition an N-terminal domain (CA-NTD), and both CA-NTD and CA-CTD are involved in viral capsid assembly. mArc has a large N-terminal domain (Arc-NT) of unknown structure, which is absent in dArc. The Arc-NT is predicted to have homology to the retroviral matrix domain and is required for the formation of large mArc oligomers. Without its N-terminal domain, mArc is monomeric in solution [18] . In mArc, it is likely that the presence of both mArc-NT and mArc-CT are required for high-order oligomerization and capsid formation [19, 20].",

Starting from the smallest distance, one member of each pair was removed until the target number was reached. This removes redundancy and ensures the most even spread of sequences within a set of homologues. For conservation calculations, search starting points were NP_610955.1 (dArc1-NL and full-length dArc1), as well as PDB codes 6sib for dArc2-NL, 6sid for dArc1-CL, and 6sie for dArc2-CL. Sequence conservation/variability was calculated from the alignments using entropy,",

A construct containing both the NL and CL is soluble and fully monomeric for hArc [18] . dArcs lack an Arc-NT, but they are predicted to have an N-terminal helix that might play a role in oligomerization; the N-terminal region forms spikelike structures on the outside of the dArc capsids [21] . The isolated NL and CL domains of both dArc1 and dArc2 could be produced in soluble form. However, our dArc constructs containing both lobes were poorly soluble; this low solubility resembles that of full-length mArc. While we could obtain pure dArc1 containing both lobes, the protein formed a mixture of large oligomeric states upon storage; dArc2 with both lobes was insoluble in our hands. These problems are likely linked to the missing dArc N-terminal tail in our constructs, which recently was shown to be an integral part of the dArc-NL fold [21, 22] , as opposed to mArc. These aspects are discussed more in the sections below, and our experimental work here focuses on the individual dArc lobes in isolation.",

In our 1.90-\u00c5 crystal structure, dArc2-NL is a domain-swapped dimer, in which the second and third helix of the canonical lobe domain join to form an extended helix (Fig 2A-2C ). One layer of the dimer is formed by \u03b12 of each subunit, which pack at a cross angle of 140.7\u02da. The other layer is formed by the remaining helices, and \u03b11 lies in a groove formed between \u03b12 and \u03b13. The subunit interface of the dimer spans 3440 \u00c5 2 of buried surface area. The interface consists exclusively of \u03c0-\u03c0 and van der Waals interactions, and the helices encapsulate a hydrophobic core between the monomers, formed by Phe51, Val55, Pro74, Phe77, Ile80, Trp84, Trp95, Leu99, Leu102, and Phe106 ( Fig 2B) . The solventexposed surface of the dimer is charged and polarized ( Fig 2D) ; the electrostatic surface potential of the side formed by the two coiled \u03b12 helices is highly positive, while the opposite surface formed by \u03b11 and \u03b13 is mainly negative. In the extended crystal lattice (S1 Fig), these opposing charges take part in crystal contacts. Crystal packing does not, however, explain the observed homotetrameric oligomeric state of dArc2-NL in solution (see below).",

            "text": "The dArc2-NL domain-swapped dimer differs from the dimers of retroviral capsid CA-CTD seen with crystallography and NMR [56] and might be functionally relevant for dArc oligomerization and capsid formation. However, the cryo-EM structures of the dArc1 and dArc2 capsids [21] do not show such domain swapping, and the dArc-NL forms penta-and hexameric rings instead ( Fig 3A) . In both capsids, a kink is present between \u03b12 and \u03b13 (at Leu76, Phe77, and Lys78 in dArc2), resulting in a canonical lobe domain fold. As a result, the surface charges of the lobe are re-oriented such that the negatively charged surface of \u03b11 can interact with \u03b12 ( Fig 3A) . Therefore, the turn seems vital to the formation of the capsid hexaand pentamers. An interesting discrepancy between the domain-swapped dimer, the capsid structure, and the recently published crystal structure of the dArc1 CT domain [22] , is the presence of the N-terminal tail preceding the NL (residues 29-44 in dArc2, residues 41-57 in dArc1). In the capsid structures of both dArc isoforms, the tail packs into the exposed hydrophobic core of the lobe (Fig 3B) , and Phe32 and Phe39 are observed in two hydrophobic pockets and Ser40 interacts directly with Lys78 and Ser79, of the \u03b12 kink, via hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the binding site for the N-terminal tail in dArc-NL corresponds to the peptide binding pocket of mammalian Arc-NL [12, 17] . Only a part of the tail (residues 37-45) was included in the dArc2-NL crystallized here, reflecting the fact that our experiments were carried out before structural information for the capsids and the importance of the N-terminal tail was available. In our structure, this fragment could not be resolved, due to flexibility. Therefore, it seems that the full N-terminal fragment, including Phe32, is needed for the packing of the tail into the exposed hydrophobic core of the canonical N-lobe and the formation of the penta-and hexameric forms of dArc-NL found in capsids. The binding surface for the N-terminal segment is buried at the interface of the dArc2-NL domain-swapped dimer (Fig  2A and 2B ). Taken together, the structure of dArc2-NL reveals an intrinsic property of the Arc lobe domain to form alternate dimers via domain swapping, possibly regulated through interactions of the folded dArc2-NL core domain with the N-terminal tail. The biological relevance of domain swapping in dArc-NL remains to be determined.",

Despite low sequence similarity with the Dengue virus 2 C protein (16.2%) and the core protein of the Kunjin subtype West-Nile virus (9.4%), the overall fold is surprisingly similar (Fig 4A and 4B ) [57, 59] . Both the Dengue and West-Nile virus are enveloped RNA viruses, and these proteins are essential for the formation of the viral capsid. Despite different helix topology, the two proteins share fold similarity with dArc2-NL and have highly positive electrostatic surfaces, suggested to have a role in the binding of encapsulated genomic RNA [57, 59] . Interestingly, in the crystal, the West-Nile virus core protein forms tetramers [59] . In the tetrameric form, long helices from each monomer (homologous to \u03b12 in dArc2-NL) form a four-helix bundle subunit interface ( Fig 4A) . This could be similar to the dArc2-NL tetrameric form in solution (see below). Moreover, the arrangement of dArc2-NL in the crystal bears some similarity to the domain-swapped dimer of the HIV CA lobe domain, induced by the deletion of a single residue [60] .",

The foxhead domain exists as both monomers and DNA binding domain-swapped dimers [64] , which share similar fold topology with the dArc2-NL dimer. Moreover, upon replacement of a crucial alanine residue in the hinge region with proline (A39P), the foxhead domain lost all domain swapping ability [71] . The histone protein forms dimers, which combine to form tetramers and finally an octamer, to which DNA binds to form the nucleosome [72] . The histone and dArc2-NL dimer arrangements are different ( Fig  4B) , but the monomer structures are strikingly similar. This observation could be related to either the propensity of certain protein sequences to form domain-swapped structures or a functional similarity. The above observations on dArc2-NL are interesting in light of the histone mimicry by Dengue virus protein C [73] , which interferes with host histones to inhibit nucleosome formation and gene transcription [9] . Whether such a mechanism could be important for Arc function, as mArc accumulates in the nucleus, associates with specific histone-modifying complexes, and is implicated in regulation of chromatin state and transcription [9, 10, 14, 74] , is a subject for future studies.",

BAK and BAX are members of the Bcl2 protein family and are important mediators of apoptosis. In its inactive form, BAK is monomeric and fully soluble, and the core domain has an orthogonal bundle fold. Upon activation, mediated by binding of certain BH3-only proteins into a hydrophobic groove in the core domain, the protein is partially unfolded, which leads to separation of the core and latch domains. The core domain then dimerizes to form amphipathic domain-swapped dimers [66, 75] . These dimers can further oligomerize and partition to the outer mitochondrial membrane where they bind and cause permeabilization, leading to the release of apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c, into the cytosol [67] . Both the inactive and active forms of BAK show similar fold topology to the monomeric and dimeric state of the dArc2-NL, respectively. Additionally, the structure of the BAK intermediate, with the hinge region not fully open, could suggest a similar mechanism for conformational selection in dArc (Fig 4C) . This could give relevant insight into the mechanism of domain swapping of dArc2-NL, in which interactions in the hydrophobic peptide binding groove seem of importance. Specific interactions in the groove might lead to dimerization, upon which the protein surface potential is rearranged to accommodate for nucleic acid or membrane binding.",

In dArc2-NL, the most conserved residues are Ala81, Trp84, and Trp85, which sit on the hydrophobic side of the long \u03b12 helix, corresponding to a conserved hydrophobic core in the domain family. Most interesting is Ser79 of dArc2, given its possible role in domain swapping. In all Arc-CL structures, the corresponding residue is a glycine in a \u03b2-turn, with a positive \u03d5 angle. In the dArc2-NL structure, there is no \u03b2-turn, and the corresponding residue, Ser79, is in the middle of a long regular \u03b1-helix. Overall, the analysis shows lower levels of conservation (higher entropy) of Arc-NL, when mArc is included in the search; this is an indication of higher conservation of Arc-CL than Arc-NL between insects and vertebrates. The result suggests that the function of Arc-NL may not have been fully conserved between mArc and dArc.",

The sequence window around Ser79 in dArc2 is lfkSiav, but whether one looks at homologues of dArc1, dArc2, or mArc, the site corresponding to Ser79 is most often a Gly, Asp, or Asn. These are common residues in a \u03b2 turn [76] , but Ser and Thr are also possible [77] ; this changes the interpretation. In the dArc2-NL crystal structure, one has a domain-swapped dimer and an \u03b1 helix, where related structures have a \u03b2 turn. Looking at the sequence homologues, the proteins have kept residues, which can adopt positive \u03d5 angles and are likely to adopt turns. Looking at the conservation mapped onto the dArc2-NL structure, no clear cues are observed; rather, conserved residues are evenly dispersed along the folded structure (Fig 5C) . In the structures of the dArc1 and dArc2 capsid [21] as well as the crystal structure of dArc1 [22] , the NL has the canonical fold without domain swapping. These features imply that the domain-swapped dArc2-NL structure might be due to crystallization of one domain alone, possibly linked to the deletion of the N-terminal tail segment from the construct, but the result does confirm the general capability of CA domains to dimerize through different modes, including domain swapping [55, 56, 60, 78] .",

While these recent data provide central information on structure-function relationships in dArc, our data complements this work by highlighting unique properties of the individual dArc lobes compared to mArc; all the dArc lobes are oligomeric, while mArc lobes and the mArc-CT are monomeric [17, 18] . This likely reflects the fact that the dArcs lack a domain corresponding to the mArc-NT; this domain is required for higher-order oligomerization and capsid formation by mArc [18, 19] .

            "text": "The structure and oligomeric state of the dArc lobe domains were analyzed in solution by SEC-MALS, SAXS, and CD (Fig 9, Table 2 ). Both dArc1-CL and dArc2-CL are compact and slightly elongated, fitting the crystallographic dimers (Fig 9A and 9B ). dArc1-NL is similar, being the size of a dimer. dArc2-NL is twice the size of dArc1-NL in solution, indicating a tetramer. The details of the latter arrangement are currently unknown, since no symmetric tetrameric assemblies can be deduced from the crystal structure, but the assembly could be similar to the West Nile virus C protein [59] . The tetrameric C protein resembles the dArc2-NL ( Fig  4A) , in that it is a dimer of domain-swapped dimers similar to the dArc2-NL homodimer. SAXS data for dArc2-NL in solution fit the structure of a similar tetrameric assembly (Fig 9C  and 9D ). Hence, it is possible that the observed dArc2-NL tetramers in solution assemble in the same way as those for the C protein, but higher-resolution data would be required to confirm this hypothesis. Arc-NL domains have various oligomeric states. mArc-NL is monomeric in solution [18] , whereas the dArc-NL forms dimers (dArc1) and tetramers (dArc2) (Fig 9E) . While the crystal structure of dArc2-NL shows a dimer, a tetrameric assembly is not present in the crystal. This is remarkable, as the sequences of dArc1-NL and dArc2-NL are very similar (Fig 10A) . The dArc2-NL dimer surface is electrostatically polarized (Fig 2) . By threading the sequence of dArc1 onto the dArc2-NL crystal structure, the variable residues are mainly located on the surface of the long helices (\u03b12 and \u03b12', Fig 2) , suggesting that this region is responsible for dArc2-NL tetramerization. Presumably, a tetramer of dArc2-NL is achieved either by formation of a four-helix interface bundle, similar to the West-Nile virus coat protein (Figs 4A and 9D) or via interaction of the contrasting surface potentials on each side of the dimer. The lack of this electrostatic polarization in dArc1-NL could be linked to oligomerization (Fig 10B) . Furthermore, additional polar interactions are observed at the interface of a dArc1-NL domain-swapped homology model (Fig 10C) , compared to the dArc2-NL interface, which only consists of nonpolar contacts. These different interactions could also be linked to dArc-NL isoform-specific oligomerization. CD spectroscopy showed that all four dArc lobes are \u03b1-helical (Fig 9F) , with some variations in spectral shape and amplitude. dArc2-NL has a higher 222-to-208-nm ratio compared to dArc1-NL. This could be related to differences in dimerization (domain swapping) or tetramer formation. Tetramerization may involve interactions between the long helices of dArc2-NL, and coiled-coil interactions increase the 222-to-208-nm ratio [85] [86] [87] . CD spectra of the dArc C-lobes are similar but differ in intensity, suggesting that dArc1-CL is less folded in solution, despite the very similar crystal structures. As the spectra have similar shapes and peak positions, the difference in amplitude could also reflect inaccurate concentration, for example caused by aggregation of one of the samples during the measurement. However, in line with the CD data, SEC showed (Fig 9G) a higher hydrodynamic radius for the dArc1-CL dimer. Kratky plots also indicate that dArc1-CL is more flexible than dArc2-CL. The CD spectrum of monomeric hArc-CL is similar to dArc-CL but shows less helical structure (Fig 9F) . The monomeric hArc-NL has unique CD features, possibly arising from interactions between aromatic side chains. Taken together, the above data show that each of the dArc lobes has unique properties compared to each other, and to homologues.",

However, the high sequence similarity between dArc1-NL and dArc2-NL (Fig 10A) suggests that the structure of dArc1-NL is similar to dArc2-NL. Furthermore, secondary structure analysis using CD shows similar spectra for both proteins (Fig 9F) , and the structure of the dArc2-NL dimer fits well with the SAXS data for dArc1-NL (Fig 9C and 9D) . However, other dimeric arrangements for dArc1-NL are possible. In this respect, it is interesting to note the loss of a conserved Gly residue in the canonical \u237a2-\u237a3 loop in dArc2-NL, which could be related to the extension of the dArc2-NL helix. Replacement of a Gly residue in such a loop is a common means to induce domain swapping [88, 89] . The recent crystal structure of dArc1-CT containing both lobes showed dArc1-NL in the orthogonal bundle fold, being similar to mArc-NL [22] . No significant interactions were observed between the NL and CL in dArc1-CA, and interlobal interactions are an unlikely cause of the different fold. Neither CD nor SAXS can determine if dArc1-NL has the same domain-swapped structure as dArc2-NL or a non-domain-swapped dimer as seen for dArc-CL.",

They are related to viral capsid (Gag) proteins, but the Gag protein in flavi-and other viruses has only one unit, or lobe. One might expect to see either the NL or CL by itself in some cellular organism. A long, iterated search starting from either Drosophila or Rattus full sequences only gives proteins with both NL and CL, even amongst distantly related proteins from plants. This is not surprising, also given earlier studies linking Arc evolution to the Ty3/gypsy family of retrotransposons, which have a capsid protein containing two lobe domains [83] . Database scores are such that a long weak similarity will score higher than a short hit, and one will see proteins with both lobes. The correct procedure is to do a comprehensive database search starting from the CL, retrieve and align full length sequences, and see if any are missing the NL. This should then be repeated starting from the NL. Unfortunately, this does not give a clear result. Starting from the rat Arc-CL, one can collect a set of 706 sequences with an e-value \ufffd 1.4\u00d710 \u22125 . The set runs from mammals to insects and even the first homologues from plants (Oryza sativa and Nicotiana tabacum). We find 26 sequences with an incomplete NL. More than a third (9) of these are annotated as partial sequences. Of the remaining sequences, none are confirmed to exist, and there is no clear domain boundary in the alignment. Similar results are obtained starting from an NL sequence. This does, however, not prove conclusively that the NL and CL are always found together in eukaryotes, but according to current data, a double-lobed Ty3/gypsy capsid protein is the ancestor of Arc in the animal kingdom.",

When we align larger sets of proteins from mammals, insects, birds, and plants, one always finds the insect sequences forming a close group including both dArc1 and dArc2. Even a cursory look at the alignment (Fig 9A) shows the similarity of dArc1 and dArc2. This leads to a parsimonious interpretation. A protein containing both NL and CL evolved in retrotransposons, leading to the tandem arrangement always seen in Arc. Arc has had much time to evolve between insects and mammals; a duplication has led to the multiple copies seen in insects, and mArc has gained an NT from a currently unknown source. The properties of the individual lobes in dArc and mArc have diverged, despite having the same fold, and mArc-NT has taken over some of the functions intrinsic to the lobes of dArc, such as oligomerization.",

A functional property of the mArc-NL is a peptide binding site, shown to interact with several proteins [12, 17] . Protein ligand binding could be a way of regulating Arc oligomerization [84] , its function in the PSD organization, and/or capsid assembly. Using ITC, we tested if the dArc N-lobes bind the stargazin peptide like the mArc-NL (Fig 11) [12] . The peptide binds to hArc-NL, but not to the two dArc N-lobes, and the peptide binding site is not conserved. In the domain-swapped structure of dArc2-NL, the putative peptide binding site would be buried within the fold.",

The isolated lobes of the C-terminal domain of mammalian Arc do not exhibit the same propensity for oligomerization [18] . Absent in both dArc isoforms is the Arc-NT, which is involved in capsid formation and likely mediates interactions of mammalian Arc with negatively charged membranes [18, 19] . Therefore, oligomerization of the dArc lobes likely represents functional compensation for the lack of the N-terminal domain. On the other hand, it is possible that the Nterminal predicted helix in dArc1 and dArc2, which forms spike structures in the capsid [21], shares functions with the mArc N-terminal domain, such as lipid membrane binding as shown for hArc-NT [18] .",

It shares structural similarity with nucleotide-and membrane-interacting proteins, suggesting a related function. How homotetramerization of this lobe, observed in solution, might affect its function, remains to be studied. Overall, the strikingly different behaviour of the purified lobe domains from dArc and mArc points towards different mechanisms in their molecular function and oligomeric assembly. Our data shed light on the individual lobes as small building blocks of dArc capsids, and they complement seminal recent work on dArc structure within capsids [21] and in isolation, as a dimer [22] .",
