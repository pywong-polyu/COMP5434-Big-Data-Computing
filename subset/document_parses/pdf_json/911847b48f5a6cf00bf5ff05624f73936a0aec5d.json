For one, it's the story of inflamma tion in severe COVID-19. Clinical features and biomarker measurements in patients with COVID-19 have generated buzz around the term cytokine storm and fostered comparisons to canonical syndromes such as haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome. But are these comparisons warranted?",

Thus, dozens of clinical trials are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 targeting the host inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Amidst a maelstrom of inflammatory mediators, why is IL-1 an attractive target in COVID-19? The history of IL-1 inhibition began in sepsis, with clinical trials showing reassuring safety but no substantial efficacy. Repurposed by rheumatologists, IL-1 inhibition has trans formed the care of many autoinflammatory diseases. 5 A subsequent reanalysis of a sepsis trial 6 focused on a subset of patients (many with ARDS) with hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intra vascular coagulation-clinical fea tures reminiscent of haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis and macro phage activation syndrome. The study showed a signifi cant mor tality improvement in patients with macrophage activa tion syndrome-like sepsis treated with the recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. 6 Beyond its infamous systemic effects, IL-1\u03b2 might also have a key role in development of acute lung injury and ARDS. Polymorphisms in the IL-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL1RN) have been associated with progression from community-acquired pneumonia to ARDS and septic shock. 7 Influenza infection of mice caused excessive inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 release in the context of a poor type 1 interferon response, an occurrence mirrored by monocytes from older humans. 8 Recombinant IL-1\u03b2 administered to rabbits led to ARDSrelated processes, including pulmonary leucostasis, endothelial injury, and perivascular oedema. 9 In non-human primates, IL-1\u03b2 promoted the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)associated acute lung injury. 10 In humans, emerging data highlight the vasculopathy of COVID-19. ARDS in patients with COVID-19 is striking in its profound hypoxaemia without proportional defects in ventilation or lung compliance, suggesting a penchant for pathological endothelial activation. 11 The lungs of patients with COVID-19 also show microthromboses and macrothromboses. Outside the lung, recent reports of vasculopathic lesions in the distal fingers and toes, and children presenting with features reminiscent of Kawasaki disease, seem circumstantially related to COVID-19. In this respect, data from trials of anakinra in rheumatoid arthritis showing a decrease in nitrooxidative stress and improved microvascular function (despite lacklustre arthritis efficacy) support a role for IL-1 blockade in preventing endothelial damage. 12 In The Lancet Rheumatology, Giulio Cavalli and colleagues 13 report their experience with a prospective programme of high-dose (5 mg/kg twice daily) intra venous anakinra. The drug was given to 29 adults with COVID-19, moderate-to-severe ARDS managed by non-invasive ventilation, and elevated indices of C-reactive protein, ferritin, or both. The patients were fol lowed up until substantial clinical improve ment or severe com plications. Cavalli and colleagues pro gressed to intravenous dosing of anakinra after observ ing dis appoint ing C-reactive protein responses in seven patients treated with low-dose sub cuta neous anakinra (100 mg twice a day). High-dose anakinra was associ ated with improved 21-day survival compared with a historical cohort (with the same clinical features) receiv ing standard treatment at the same institution in the weeks immediately before (21-day survival 90% vs 56%; p=0\u00b7009). This difference was accompanied by more rapid and complete improvement Shutterstock in C-reactive protein in the patients treated with highdose anakinra. This observation is remarkable in a condition with 30-50% mortality in patients who develop clinical ARDS. 1,2 Ferritin and C-reactive protein values in the cohort studied by Cavalli and colleagues were considerably higher than in those reported previously in hospitalised adults with COVID-19 but correlated better with risk of mortality and, thus, might help identify a subset of patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory treatments.",

The high-dose anakinra group had a greater proportion of individuals with severe ARDS. However, this study had many limitations, including its small size, a retrospective observational design, and inclusion of patients from a single centre; thus, the results should be interpreted as exploratory. Also, the study did not detect a between-group difference in progression to mechanical ventilation, which tempers enthusiasm for the findings. Nevertheless, in view of the biological plausibility of anakinra, the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of the drug, and a growing body of positive experience in autoinflammation and cytokine storm, these data are promising and support prioritising this approach in the planning and enrolment of randomised controlled trials.",
