Natural cubic spline function was adopted in all the element spaces, where spline nodes were selected from 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles of the logarithmic scale of each external factor, and the initial degree of freedom (df ) was 3. According to previous research experience on the exposure risk of environmental factors to bacterial diarrhea, a lag period of 21 days was selected when establishing a cross-basis matrix for various factors in our study, and the corresponding initial df was 3. The mixed elements of the nonlinear model included time, day of the week, and season. The time factor adopting a natural cubic spline function was used to control the long-term trend, and the corresponding initial value of df was set as 7 per year. The quasi-Poisson function was used as the connection function in the model to control the over-dispersion effect. Through the above model, the relative risk of viral diarrhea infection among children on a certain day and the cumulative risk of external factors to viral diarrhea infection under different values could be obtained. Relative risk refers to the ratio of the probability of infection in the exposed group to that in the non-exposed group. In the nonlinear model, the reference values of the four external elements were set as the average values of the corresponding data columns. None of any interventions were conducted during the period.",

Viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old in Jilin Province exhibited obvious seasonality, with a high incidence in winter every year. The number of cases in December accounted for 12.88% of the total cases, which was the highest, followed by 12.81% in November, 12.03% in January, and 11.99% in February.

Children aged from 1 to 2 years old accounted for 38.33%, and children aged from 2 to 5 years old accounted for less than one-fifth. In this study, we analyzed all viral diarrhea cases of children under 5 years old and the subgroups of children of different gender and age groups. Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the daily number of infection cases of each group, daily average temperature, precipitation, air quality index, and composite Baidu search index from 2014 to 2019. The time series of daily infection numbers in each group and four selected external factors are shown in Figure 1c ,d, respectively. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the attributed infection risk of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old and the average temperature. In this study, 6 \u2022 C, the mean daily average temperature in Jilin Province, was set as the reference value. We found a complex relationship between the attributed risk of viral diarrhea among children and the average temperature. The cumulative risk at low temperature (\u221214 \u2022 C, 10 quantile) was 0.78 (0.28, 2.15), while that at high temperature (23 \u2022 C, 90 quantile) was 11.16 (2.52, 49.45). The cumulative risk reaches the minimum at the temperature of \u22123 \u2022 C (30 quantile). We observed the relative risk and cumulative risk for viral diarrhea infection of different lag days under low (\u221214 \u2022 C) and high temperature (23 \u2022 C). Under low temperature, the infection risk of viral diarrhea was 1.02 (0.94, 1.10) on the fifth lag day and decreased to 0.92 (0.85, 1.00) on the 15th lag day. The cumulative risk reached the peak of 1.18 (0.69, 2.00) on the sixth day, began to decline, and decreased to 1.18 (0.69, 2.00) on the 15th day. Under high temperature, the infection risk of viral diarrhea was 1.10 (1.00, 1.21) on the fifth lag day and increased to 1.2 (1.07, 1.34) on the 15th lag day. The cumulative risk increased with the delay time, reaching 13.34 (3.47, 51.3) after 19 days. Furthermore, under the condition of extremely high temperature (26 \u2022 C, 99 quantile), the cumulative risk reached its peak of 14.35 (2.78, 74.14) , and the infection risk reached its peak of 1.21 (1.06, 1.38) on the 15th lag day. Stratified analysis of different subgroups showed that the average temperature had different exposure risks to varying gender and age groups, as shown in Figures S1-S5 in the Supporting Information. The cumulative risk of low temperature for males was 0.67 (0.18, 2.50), while that for females was 0.92 (0.20, 4.26), and the cumulative risk for females at \u221220 \u2022 C reached 1.32 (0.22, 7.92). For different age groups, the cumulative risk at low temperatures was lower for children under 1 year old but higher for children over 1 year old. Similar to the general situation, the low temperature conditions showed consistent relative risks to different populations. The relative risks of infection of different populations on the fifth lag day were generally higher than those on the 15th lag day. The cumulative effect of low temperature in different populations also showed a phenomenon of first increasing and then decreasing with the extension of lag time. The cumulative risks of high temperatures on different populations increased with the extension of lag time, which was consistent with the overall situation. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the attributed infection risks of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old and daily precipitation. In this study, 2 mm, close to the average value of daily precipitation in Jilin Province, was set as the reference value. Compared with the average temperature, the relationship between the infection risk of viral diarrhea among children and daily precipitation was simple. The cumulative relative risk increased steadily with the increase in daily precipitation. The cumulative risk was 1.19 (0.89, 1.60) when the daily precipitation was 6 mm (90 quantile) and 1.99 (0.61, 6.48) when the daily precipitation was 18 mm (99 quantile). We observed the relationship between the infection risk of viral diarrhea and the lag days under conditions of 6 mm and 18 mm precipitation. Under the condition of 6 mm precipitation, the relative risk was 1.01 (0.99, 1.03) on the second and the fifth lag days. The cumulative risk increased with the extension of lag time, reaching 1.14 (0.90, 1.44) on the 15th lag day. Under the condition of 18 mm precipitation, the relative risk reached the peak value of 1.06 (0.97, 1.15) on the fifth lag day and fell to 1.00 (0.91, 1.09) on the 15th lag day. The cumulative risk increased with the extension of lag time, and it climbed to 1.67 (0.65, 4.29) on the 15th lag day. Stratified analysis of different subgroups showed that compared with children under 1 year old, children over 1 year old had a greater relative infection risk of within 1 week when the daily precipitation was 6 and 18 mm, as shown in Figures S1-S5 in the supporting information. Compared with the daily precipitation of 6 mm, the short-term infection risks of all sub-age groups under daily precipitation of 18 mm were higher than those under daily precipitation of 6 mm. For different gender groups, the infection risk was similar to Figure 3 shows the relationship between the attributed infection risks of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old and daily precipitation.

Compared with the daily precipitation of 6 mm, the short-term infection risks of all sub-age groups under daily precipitation of 18 mm were higher than those under daily precipitation of 6 mm. For different gender groups, the infection risk was similar to the overall situation, and the difference in infection risk between male groups and female groups was minimal. the overall situation, and the difference in infection risk between male groups and female groups was minimal. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the attributed infection risk of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old and daily AQI. In this study, AQI of 76, close to the mean value of daily AQI in Jilin Province, was set as the reference value. We found a complicated relationship between the infection risk of viral diarrhea among children and AQI. The cumulative infection risk of viral diarrhea among children was 0.58 (0.35, 0.98) when AQI was high (AQI equals to 117, 90 quantile, the same below) and 0.94 (0.49, 1.80) when AQI was low (AQI equals to 42, 10 quantile, the same below). We observed the relationship between the infection risk of viral diarrhea on different lag days among children under AQI of 42 and 117, respectively. When the AQI was low, the relative infection risk was below 1.0 within 1 week. The relative risk was 0.96 (0.92, 1.00) and the cumulative risk was 0.75 (0.57, 1.00) on the fifth lag day. However, the relative risk rose to greater than 1.0 after 10 lag days. The relative risk reached the maximum of 1.04 (0.99, 1.09) on the 15th lag day, while the cumulative risk reached the minimum of 0.69 (0.46, 1.03) on the 10th lag day and then increased slowly thereafter. When the AQI was high, the relative infection risk was 0.96 (0.93, 0.99) on the fifth lag day, but it changed very little within 3 weeks. The cumulative risk decreased gradually with the extension of the lag time, and it dropped to as low as 0.56 (0.37, 0.83) on the 15th lag day. Furthermore, under the condition of extremely high AQI (216, 99 quantile), the cumulative infection risk was reduced to 0.32 Figure 4 shows the relationship between the attributed infection risk of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old and daily AQI.

AQI is the result of the comprehensive calculation of the concentrations of various air pollution elements such as PM2.5 and SO 2 . Therefore, AQI represents the overall situation of air quality, and it has an important impact on human activities.

Atchison, C. J. [8] found that the risk of rotavirus infection decreases by 4% if the temperature drops by 1 \u2022 C in Western Europe. Celik, C. [9] found that the rate of rotavirus infection in Turkey would increase by 0.523% if the temperature dropped by 1 \u2022 C. Laboratory environmental evidence showed that virus particles were more stable at low temperatures [31] , which could make them last longer on human hands, feces, and other contaminated objects. In addition, as rotavirus can be atomized [32] , the virus can spread through dust suspended in the air. However, the biological reasons underlying the high transmission rate of rotavirus infection at low temperatures remain unclear [33] . People may tend to reduce outdoor activities in cold winters, which increases the frequency of contact. Meanwhile, changes in living habits, such as the decrease in handwashing frequency in cold conditions, may increase the chance of virus transmission through contact. In this study, we found that low temperature could improve the risk of viral diarrhea infection among children within 1 week to approximately 10 days, showing obvious short-term effects. Therefore, in winter, when dealing with viral diarrhea among children, epidemic prevention and control departments and the public should pay special attention to the risk of viral diarrhea outbreak in the short term when the temperature drops.",

            "text": "We found that high temperatures could also promote an infection rate of viral diarrhea among children. We believe this phenomenon results from the fact that the cases of viral diarrhea collected in our work included various kinds of viral infection cases, and summer is usually the season of the high incidence of norovirus. We believe it is related to the climate characteristics of the selected study area in summer. It belongs to the temperate monsoon climate in Jilin Province, and summer is short but hot with heavy rain. Wang, P. [18] found a positive correlation between daily precipitation and diarrhea caused by norovirus, and the correlation was stronger in summer than in other seasons. The risk of hospitalization under the condition of 34.1 mm precipitation was 2.95, which was 1.6 times higher than that in winter. Heavy precipitation can increase the runoff of local rivers. Greer, A. L. [16] found that the increase in river runoff can promote the outbreak of norovirus. Although virus activity decreases with the increase in air temperature, frequent rainfall in summer may make rivers and groundwater sources contact pollutants more easily. High microbial loads are likely found in sewage overflow or damaged drainage systems where pollutants are concentrated, thereby making aquatic products more susceptible to virus pollution and resulting in the outbreak of foodborne virus diarrhea [34] . When untreated polluted water is used for entertainment, children are particularly susceptible to infection, and this association is strongest in summer than in other seasons. We found that the increase in daily precipitation led to a steady increase in the infection risk of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old, while the increase in temperature on the infection risk may be an indirect factor. We also found that high temperature and precipitation had a long-term effect on viral diarrhea infection risk, and the cumulative risk increased steadily with the increase in lag time. Therefore, in the short summer, the epidemic prevention and control departments and the public in Jilin Province need to do a good job in preventing viral diarrhea among children for a long time.",

            "text": "The influence of AQI on the infection risk of viral diarrhea among children was studied in this paper. To our surprise, we found that the promotion of AQI had a negative effect on the infection risk of viral diarrhea within 1 week to approximately 10 days for the overall situation and all the subgroups. Although the cumulative infection risk increased sharply when AQI was extremely low, no statistical significance was found between AQI and viral diarrhea infection data in the corresponding range of AQI (p > 0.05). To date, reports on air pollution factors and the risk of viral diarrhea infection are rare. Ye, Q. [20] once found that the concentrations of pollutants, such as CO, SO 2 , PM10, and NO 2 in the air, are positively correlated with the incidence of rotavirus, and these pollutants significantly increase the relative risk of rotavirus infection in children, while showing obvious dose, lag, and cumulative effects. Numerous studies have shown that air pollution may be the cause of the high incidence of respiratory diseases [35] , but the way in which air pollution affects fecal-transmitted digestive tract diseases through the main transmission routes remains inconclusive. In our work, within 10 lag days, higher AQI inhibited the infection risk of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old compared with the average daily AQI, and the relative risk did not rise to more than 1.0 until 2 weeks later. The relationship between diarrhea and air pollutants includes direct and indirect mechanisms. The former refers to the fact that the virus can cause intestinal infection. Several studies have shown that rotavirus, norovirus, and other pathogens that cause diarrhea can be transmitted through the air to form aerosols [4] , and holes on the surface of the PM10 particles can carry viruses according to the electron microscope photographs [36] . Enterovirus carried by excreta of patients and the external environmental pollutants such as water and soil can spread through inhalable particulate matter, and these particles can contaminate the living environment of children and increase the infection risk of fecal-transmitted digestive tract diseases. The indirect mechanism is that air pollutants can affect the intestinal environment and then harm the immune system, thus increasing the risk of viral infection. For example, exposure to high doses of PM10 can result in the death of intestinal epithelial cells, the increase of intestinal permeability [37] , leading to intestinal inflammation, and the ingested air pollutants significantly influence the gut microbe composition and metabolic processes. Gaseous pollutants such as NO 2 may decrease the specific immunity and may induce an inflammatory response in the digestive tract mucosa and increase the risk of viral infection [38] .",

            "text": "We suspect that the influence of AQI on viral diarrhea infection among children mainly depends on the influence of AQI on children's daily activities. With the continuous development of Chinese society, more people are beginning to realize the harm of air pollution to human health. When AQI is high, the air quality is poor. China has established an air quality early warning system. When meteorological factors such as high concentration of air pollutants and poor diffusion conditions occur, local air quality monitoring departments will issue air pollution warnings. At this time, adults tend to wear masks to protect themselves and prevent airborne diseases such as the novel coronavirus, which broke out in early 2020 [39] , and children are usually arranged by their parents to reduce outdoor activities as much as possible to reduce the probability of transmission of various viruses through pollutants, including inhalable particles carrying the virus, toxic gases that may damage the immune system, and water that may be contaminated by air pollutants. Therefore, the risk of children infected with viral diarrhea is lower within 10 lag days under the condition of high AQI. Although our results may not be completely consistent with the findings of Ye, Q. [20] , we believe that this may be related to the change in living habits of the public when the concentration of air pollutants is high in recent years. Even though viruses related to viral diarrhea can be transmitted through air pollutants such as PM10, in recent years, the local public's emphasis on their health and parents' emphasis on children's health have been increasing with the publicity of public health. When the concentration of air pollutants is high, protective tools such as masks are popularized, and the public tends to reduce the frequency of outdoor activities. Therefore, the infection risk of viral diarrhea will drop for several days under high AQI. In addition, we found that the relative risk began to increase after two lag weeks, which may be caused by the public's efforts to prevent and control airborne diseases beginning to decrease after the end of the air pollution period. Therefore, when air pollution is serious, we believe that the public's own prevention and control measures can inhibit the outbreak of viral diarrhea among children; however, after a period of pollution, the public must pay attention to the re-infection of viral diarrhea.",

Research using the dlnm model has not been reported yet. In our work, based on the existing research, composite network search data were incorporated into the dlnm model to determine the lag effect of network search data on epidemics. We found that only extreme network search conditions had a positive correlation with infection risk of viral diarrhea among children under 5 years old. We believe that the network search data reflect the public's concern about social events. When the search index related to a certain disease increases sharply, it may be the concentrated outbreak period of this kind of disease. Therefore, network search data can be used as the key element of early warning of disease outbreaks. In our work, when the complex BDI of viral diarrhea exceeded 150, the relative risk and cumulative risk increased rapidly, meaning that viral diarrhea may have occurred in corresponding areas at this time. As the outbreak period of viral diarrhea usually lasts for several days or more, the sudden increase in search index can help the disease prevention and control department make high-risk early warnings in time and provide instructions for the catering and other industries to quickly monitor foodborne viruses.",

In addition, to avoid the complexity of our model, we selected the external factors that may have a greater impact on public activities, including daily average temperature, precipitation, AQI, and daily combined BDI, among which the first three were natural environmental factors and the last one was a social factor. Other external factors, such as other natural environmental factors, including meteorological factors and specific air pollutants that may have an impact on public activities, and other sociological factors, including economy, nutritional condition, and population mobility, have not been included in our model.
