            "text": "As youth age, the discrepancies between actual intake and recommendations continue to broaden [2, 4] . One area in which all age groups fail to meet recommendations is the consumption of fruits and vegetables [5] . A recent data brief released by the National Center for Health statistics reported that only 75.3% of children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 19 consumed any fruit (whole or 100% fruit juice) on a given day [5] . While over 90% of children and adolescents consumed vegetables on a given day, nearly half (47.5%) consumed starchy vegetables, while a much lower proportion (16.7%) reported consuming dark green vegetables. Although dietary patterns of children improved between 1999 and 2016, as measured by the American Heart Association 2020 continuous diet score, less than 1% are consuming diets that adhere to recommendations, and over half (56.1%) are consuming poor diets [2] . In addition, certain demographic groups are at higher risk for poor dietary patterns, including youth in households with incomes below 130% of the federal poverty level, parents with lower educational attainment, and/or lower food security [2] . Existing literature examining the relationship between youth food security and diet quality shows youth categorized as food insecure had significantly poorer diets, as assessed by Healthy Eating Index-2015 scores when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics [6] . Because of these subtle but substantial differences, accurately assessing dietary patterns is critical to be able to identify areas of improvement and design effective interventions for these higher risk population subgroups.",

Although preventing childhood obesity as measured by BMI percentile is important, many children with BMIs in the normal range also benefit from improved dietary patterns in childhood, as these can establish lifelong habits [13, 14] . Accurately measuring youth dietary behaviors to evaluate the impact of school-based nutrition interventions is notoriously difficult [15] . One method that is frequently used for collecting dietary intake data in youth are food frequency questionnaires [16] . While these tools can collect useful dietary intake data, they are not without limitations. One of these limitations is challenges with recall, especially with youth who may have more difficulty in accurately estimating the frequency with which they consume foods, particularly over longer time frames [17] . In addition, research suggests there may be social desirability bias, which can result in overreporting consumption of foods considered healthy and underreporting consumption of foods considered unhealthy, and disproportionately impacts those receiving nutrition-related programming in relation to comparison groups [18] .",

When consumed, carotenoids are deposited in the skin; greater consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with higher amounts of detectable skin carotenoids [28] . Because of the success of using Resonance Raman Spectroscopy to measure carotenoids that are deposited in the skin, reflection spectroscopy (RS) has also shown to be valid in several age groups and highly responsive to changes in intake [29] . Specifically, the Veggie Meter \u00ae (Longevity Link Corp., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) uses RS to detect carotenoids in the skin and is a non-invasive, objective indicator of approximately 30 days of fruit and vegetable intake [30] . An individual measurement takes less than 60 s using an LED lightbulb and the device itself is portable and can be set up at the school site with ease. Although a promising approach to measuring carotenoids in the skin, the Veggie Meter \u00ae was relatively new technology at the time of the study. As a result, a standardized protocol for use of the Veggie Meter \u00ae in schools had yet to be established.",

The majority of participants were 9 years of age at the Fall 2018 timepoint, with just over half (51.4%) female (Table 1) . Students were primarily Caucasian and not of Hispanic origin (34.4%) or Latino/Hispanic (22.9%). Household income varied, with several families reporting an income below $40,000 or above $100,000. Parent or caregiver educational attainment ranged from less than 8th grade to post-graduate with the majority having completed some college. Most (82.9%) households reported not having a smoker. Although 35 students were included in the overall sub-analysis, a total of 25 students had nutrition knowledge data for all three time points and were included in the ANOVA in Table 2 . Nutrition knowledge differed significantly over the course of the study (F(2, 48) = 5.51, p = 0.007; Table 2 ), with post-hoc analysis determining there was a significant increase in knowledge between Fall 2018 and Fall 2019 (p = 0.006; Table 2 ). There were no significant differences between other timepoints. No statistically significant difference in BMI percentile was observed over all three timepoints (F(2, 68) = 2.137, p = 0.126; Table 2 ). The VM scores also significantly differed between time points (F(2, 68) = 6.63, p = 0.002; Table 2 ). Post-hoc tests showed significant increases in the VM scores between Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 (p = 0.005; Table 2 ) and between Fall 2018 and Fall 2019 (p < 0.05). No correlation was found between change in BMI percentile and VM score change between Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 (r = 0.157; p = 0.354), or between Spring 2019 and Fall 2019 (r = 0.014; p = 0.930), suggesting that BMI percentile and VM score were not related among these students (Table 3) . Nutrition knowledge was found to be positively correlated to VM score in Fall 2018 (r = 0.269, p = 0.034), but not in Spring 2019 (r = \u22120.018, p = 0.912) or Fall 2019 (r = 0.068, p = 0.514) timepoints, nor when the three scores were averaged (r = 236, p = 0.256; Table 3 ). Table 4 describes refinements to the protocol made due to observations completed during the data collection processes. Observations made by researchers in Fall 2018 that led to changes included the presence of colored ink on the hands of some students as well as the tendency of students to attempt to get closer to the Veggie Meter while waiting for their turn. When assessments were conducted in Spring and Fall 2019, students cleaned hands with hand sanitizing wipes prior to Veggie Meter \u00ae measurements. In addition, a line created on the ground with removable tape was added to discourage students from attempting to crowd around the device while they waited their turn. The dominant hand index finger was used with all participants during the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 timepoints. Subsequent to this timepoint, an international meeting of Veggie Meter \u00ae researchers convened and it was determined that the non-dominant ring finger should be used [42] , and in Fall 2019 the non-dominant ring finger was used instead of the dominant hand index finger.

Further, VM scores increased over the course of the school year (between Fall 2018 and Spring 2019) and were stable over the summer months, as indicated by no significant changes between Spring 2019 and Fall 2019. This suggests that the Veggie Meter \u00ae is sensitive to changes in intake that occur as a result of school-based nutrition education. While dietary intake was only assessed by proxy using the Veggie Meter \u00ae , this was by design, as the Veggie Meter \u00ae has been previously validated against several different criteria [43] , and it was critical to determine if it can be successfully implemented in lowincome schools despite the logistical challenges that accompany working in this setting. Overall, this study supports the growing body of literature that suggests that the Veggie Meter \u00ae is an appropriate tool for measuring change in fruit and vegetable consumption by proxy in the school setting, especially in a low-income school setting [24] [25] [26] .",

An issue that may be encountered in low-income populations is low response rate for lengthy food frequency questionnaires, speculated to be due to the time involved and complexity of the forms, causing insurmountable burden for youth and their parents [47] . An unexpected benefit of the Veggie Meter \u00ae was that researchers noted youth, as well as classroom teachers in some cases, were very enthusiastic and engaged when the Veggie Meter \u00ae was introduced, which may have increased participation. While this observation is anecdotal, a similar phenomenon was noted with wearable activity monitors that displayed user feedback in response to physical activity, which may have resulted in increased activity during the assessment period independent of the intervention [34] .",

As the data collection tools recommended to assess outcome measures related to these indicators are primarily recall survey tools, the addition of skin carotenoid assessment may be of benefit. A recent study of 124 SNAP-Ed State Implementing Agencies (SIA) representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia, in which 95% of SIAs surveyed intended to impact healthy eating behavioral changes in the medium-term, further supports this [49] . As SNAP-Ed is a large nationwide program, with a budget of over $431 million in Fiscal Year 2021 [50], the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of programs funded by SNAP-Ed is essential to ensuring that these funds are directed toward interventions with measurable impact. This study demonstrating the usability of the Veggie Meter \u00ae in a low-income school setting is especially relevant as schools are a key setting targeted by SNAP-Ed.",

This demonstrates alignment of the current implementation with previously published SHCP research, allowing inferences to be made about the ability of the Veggie Meter \u00ae to detect changes in behavior. Changes in knowledge are thought to precede changes in behavior, as posited in the SCT, which provides the basis for many behavioral interventions [51] . However, while nutrition knowledge was found to have increased over the course of the study, an unexpected finding was that the correlation between nutrition knowledge and VM score did not persist over time; this can possibly be attributed to differences in completion of assessments, as only 25 participants had nutrition knowledge data for all three timepoints compared to 35 completing all three Veggie Meter \u00ae assessments. In the context of the SCT, it would be expected that improvements to behavior would be related to changes in knowledge. A pilot study that examined nutrition knowledge and VM score in college students detected a significant and moderate correlation between these at a single timepoint. When BMI was considered in this correlation as well, VM scores explained nearly 27% of the knowledge score variance [52] . The difference between findings in college students compared to the present study could be speculated to be due to the relatively little control children have over the foods available in the setting where they eat. Therefore, their food choices are often dependent on the foods purchased and/or prepared for them whereas college students have more autonomy with food choices.",

As a result, refinement of the data collection protocol was required in order to collect these data more efficiently. At the first data collection time points, students were not asked to clean their hands prior to measurements and the index finger on the dominant hand was used. After the publication of more research using the Veggie Meter \u00ae , the protocol evolved to include hand cleaning and the use of the non-dominant ring finger [42] . Since completion of this study, users of the Veggie Meter \u00ae worked together to create a comprehensive set of recommendations for use in different research settings [53] . Future studies utilizing the Veggie Meter \u00ae in this population should follow these guidelines to ensure consistency with other research. When considering the feasibility of using the Veggie Meter \u00ae in school-based programs, being efficient with classroom time and minimizing how long students are away from learning is a critical consideration. With respect to other assessment methods that have been used to evaluate dietary intake, the Veggie Meter \u00ae can be a minimally disruptive choice; especially if youth are excused from class individually or in small groups as the measurements themselves only take about 60 s each. Previous SHCP research used FFQs with lengthy introductions and instructions therefore making this likely a time saving method, comparatively [31] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations; key among these was the small sample size. Another noteworthy limitation is the interruption in study completion due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the school closures, the final data collection timepoint did not occur. Despite this, available data suggest that the program resulted in increases in nutrition knowledge and consumption of carotenoid-containing fruits and vegetables. In particular, these data support the use of the Veggie Meter \u00ae in future evaluations as an objective measure of change in fruit and vegetable consumption. In addition to a small sample size, data for students who did not complete all three assessments for a particular measure were excluded. This may have biased the results if the missing data are not randomly distributed. While significance was able to be achieved for some outcomes, the lack of statistical power may have impacted other outcomes. Another potential limitation is the changes to the VM administration protocol over the course of the study, with addition of hand cleaning after the first time point and the use of the non-dominant ring finger in the third timepoint. It is speculated that the addition of hand cleaning to the second and third timepoints would have resulted in lower scores than those observed, as hand cleaning removes residues that may artificially elevate VM scores, such as colored ink, or orange-colored powder from snack foods commonly consumed by this population. While recommendations for research protocol recommend the use of the non-dominant ring finger, a study of individuals of different skin pigmentations using different digits has yet to be published. Another limitation to consider is that the device may be cost prohibitive, with a one-time cost of approximately $15,000 per device. While this cost may be insurmountable for small programs, it can be more feasible as part of state level budgets or as part of large public health initiatives. One such example is the San Francisco Department of Public Health, which uses the Veggie Meter \u00ae to assess the Healthy Apple Program [54, 55] . In the specific case of this group, the cost of the device was split across departmental funding and state funding through CFHL, UC.",

            "text": "Overall, while this study was small, findings indicate that the Veggie Meter can be a useful tool for assessing dietary intake of fruits and vegetables in a low-income, schoolbased setting. Further, this study resulted in recommendations for a refined protocol for use of the Veggie Meter. By eliminating the time intensive, burdensome, and potentially biased methods of recall, a picture of fruit and vegetable intake can be elucidated using the objective and non-invasive technique. While more research should be conducted in the future, this study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that the Veggie Meter \u00ae is a valid and useful tool in this field.",
