BIONLP13CG is the model in SciSpacy that covers the most entity types (18 entity types). BC5CDR is another model in SciSpacy that has the best performance on two entity types (chemicals and diseases). We manually annotated more than 1000 sentences for evaluation. Then we calculate the precision, recall and F1 scores on three major biomedical entity types: gene, chemical and disease. We can see that our annotation has worse performance on the gene type but much better performance on the chemical and disease types. In summary, the quality of our annotation surpasses SciSpacy by a large margin (over 10% higher on the F1 score). Moreover, SciSpacy requires human effort for training data annotation and covers only 18 types. Our NER system supports incrementally adding new documents as well as adding new entity types when needed by adding dozens of seeds as the input examples. In Figure 1a , we show some examples of the annotation results in CORD-NER. We can see that our distantly-or weakly supervised methods achieve high quality recognizing the new entity types, requiring only several seed examples as the input. For instance, we recognized \"SARS-CoV-2\" as the \"CORONAVIRUS\" type, \"bat\" and \"pangolins\" as the \"WILDLIFE\" type and \"Van der Waals forces\" as the \"PHYSICAL SCIENCE\" type. This NER annotation can help downstream text mining tasks in discovering the origin and the physical nature of the virus.
