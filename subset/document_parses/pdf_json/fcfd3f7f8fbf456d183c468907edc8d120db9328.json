            "text": "Background: Over the past few decades, the rate of Cesarean Section (CS) delivery has been rising rapidly and the prevalence of CS-associated complications including Abdominal Wall Endometriomas (AWE) increases with each additional operation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, histopathological diagnostic role and surgical management of post-CS AWE through a retrospective case review. Methods: We calculated the incidence of AWE and reviewed all the patients underwent surgical removal of Post-CS AWE during the period of 2012-2018 who were diagnosed, treated and followed up for 2-8 years at our tertiary hospital. Results: Thirty women with AWE were included. The main symptom in 2/3 of cases was cyclic pain and 4 cases (13.3%) had no symptoms. The mean interval between prior CS and appearance of symptoms was 55.2 months and the mean size of the excised mass was 42 mm. Free surgical margin was less than 9 mm in 9 patients (30%) but no recurrence was recorded among all the studied patients. Pre-operative FNAC diagnosis was performed for only 3 patients (10%) which helped in excluding other potential pathologies. The clinical-pathological agreement value for detection of the nature of the abdominal wall mass was 93.4%. Conclusions: Patients with suspected AWE should undergo preoperative cytological biopsy to exclude alternative diagnosis. Wide surgical excision with margin of less than 1 cm could be accepted especially in case of weak abdominal wall. More studies on the post-CS complications; risks, prevention, early detection and proper management should be encouraged.",

            "text": "Endometriosis is a benign inflammatory lesion characterized by presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. When the lesion forms a circumscribed mass or blood-filled cystic lesion, hence designated as an endometrioma [1] . Abdominal wall endometrioma (AWE) is a rare aftermath of gynecologic operations mainly caesarean section (CS), myomectomy and abdominal hysterectomy causing intense pain and discomfort to the patient [2] . Malignant transformation of AWE is extremely rare but still a possibility; transformation to clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma has been reported in several studies exhibiting aggressive prognoses [3] [4] [5] . CS scars are the most common site of abdominal or pelvic wall endometriomas, with an approximately estimated incidence of 0.03%-0.4% [6] . The increasing rate of CSs has raised concerns about the complications of the procedure. This rate has been increasing steadily in Egypt and has reached an alarming level in recent years. The proportion of documented CSs in Egypt in 2014 quadrupled the maximum recommended threshold by the World Health Organization (WHO) [7] . Direct inoculation of the endometrial cells into abdominal wall fascia or subcutaneous tissue during surgery is considered the main cause of scar endometrioses which subsequently stimulated by estrogen and the produced estrogen by the endometriotic lesions has a substantial role in lesions' development and progression [8] . Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) before excision runs the risk of needle track inoculation and implantation of the endometriotic lesion but histopathological examination of the resected mass is a good confirmatory tool [2] . Several treatment options for AWE have been suggested including surgical and non-surgical (pharmacological) treatment, but the definitive and the gold standard treatment is wide surgical excision (WSE) with 5-10 mm free margins to prevent recurrence [9] . Awareness of this entity within the abdominal wall can help the surgeons to make early and accurate diagnosis and deliver prompt surgical intervention [2] .",

Various theories have been mentioned to explain the etiopathogenesis of AWE. One theory (transport theory) explains that direct inoculation and the transport of the endometrial tissue into a surgical scar or its adjacent tissue during surgery is responsible for AWE. Another theory (metaplastic theory) suggests that the primitive pleuropotential mesenchymal cells which have undergone metaplasia and differentiation which lead to the development of AWE [16] .",

A study was done by Ribeiro J\u00fanior et al. to determine the frequency of p53 codon 72 polymorphism in Brazilian patients with endometriosis revealing that the p53 polymorphism can be used as a promising molecular marker for symptomatic endometriosis, and therefore could be a great aid in the diagnosis, guiding prognosis, and treatment of external endometriosis [34] .

Cytological examination of the smears from AWE shows varying cellularity comprising both epithelial and spindle stromal cells, scattered inflammatory cells and variable number of hemosiderin laden macrophages, the presence of any two of the main three components of endometriosis (endometrial glands, stroma cells and hemosiderin laden macrophages) has been agreed for the cytological diagnosis of external endometriosis in both cytology and histopathology, but needle puncture of subtle endometriotic lesions may promote their progression and development. Therefore, the AWE should not be traumatized when possible [37, 38] . It is worth to be mentioned that the cytology features of AWE are related to the cyclical hormonal changes; In proliferative phase, the epithelial endometrial cells form cohesive sheets of small uniform cells with scant cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with bland chromatin and occasional mitosis. In the secretory phase, the size of the cell gradually increases showing cytoplasmic micro vacuolations and the stromal cells show abundant cytoplasm with pre-decidual change, causing diagnostic difficulties. The background looks sanguineous with some inflammatory cells and histiocytes \u00b1 hemosiderin [33] . Epithelial cells in secretory phase may show squamous, tubal or mucinous metaplasia with nuclear atypia, so the reporting cytopathologist should be aware of this for accurate diagnosis and differentiating benign and malignant abdominal wall masses [39] . Only three cases in our study were advised for preoperative FNAC due to suspicious tumors and all the three cases were suggestive for endometrioma, the history of CS in all the studied cases made the clinical suspicion for AWE not very difficult that made the Kappa value indicating almost perfect agreement between the clinic-radiological features and the pathology final result. No recurrence or malignant transformation was recorded in our study. The unexpected malignant transformation of benign lesions was recorded in several lesions including the AWE, where Song et al. found three malignant cases out of 38 AWEs (7.9%) [22, 40, 41] .",

We did not find complete data about using the non-surgical modalities for the studied cases or other AWE medically treated patients at our hospital, so we cannot support this recommendation. However it is a feasible option for women close to menopause, but it is not an effective AWE primary treatment for most of cases [24] . Aromatase inhibitors can be adopted as a non surgical therapy when dealing with large abdominal wall endometriomas since wide local excision could result in losing a considerable of the abdominal wall or can be used as a second-line therapy for patients who are refractory to the standard treatments [42] . Also ultrasound guided percutaneous cryoablation technique seems to be promising, but the surgical excision stills the mainstay of treatment [43] . Wide surgical excision (WSE) with at least a 1 cm margin with patch grafting of the defect is considered a treatment of choice for AWE according to several studies [44] . In this study even the patients who had a surgical margin less than 1 cm (30% of the total cases) did not experience any recurrence. When the aponeurosis is involved, mass excision might need to be followed by closure of the wall using a mesh to lessen tissue tension [43] . In our study two cases had a closure with mesh; one of them revealed incisional hernia and the other had a weak abdominal wall. These two patients underwent parietal repair with a polypropylene mesh placed in a retromuscular position (15-20 cm) . However, no available prospective studies on the subject of surgical behaviors associated with increasing AWE risk, minimizing contact of swabs used for cleaning the endometrial cavity within the scar site, removing them quickly from the operation area and avoiding use of the same suture material that was used for closure of the uterus in order to use it to suture the scar site thoroughly saline washing the scar site before closing it may assist to prevent the growth of endometriotic tissue from the scar tissue [45] . Limitation of the study: The overall number of scar endometriosis cases is low due to exclusion of other cases which had surgeries other than caesarian section. Wicherek et al. studied the obstetrical history of eighty one women presenting with AWE after CS and concluded that CS operations performed before spontaneous onset of the labor was associated with an increase of subsequent endometriosis risk [46] . They supposed that the high immune tolerance before the labor onset permitted endometrial cell implantation. We were unable (in this study) to collect the data concerning CS indications.",
