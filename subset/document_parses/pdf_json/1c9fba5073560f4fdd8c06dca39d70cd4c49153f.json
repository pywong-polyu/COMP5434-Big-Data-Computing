To contain the spread of infection, several governments were forced to institute home quarantine and lockdown measures [7] . Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the social confinement and isolation measures implemented to slow its spread, exacerbated the problem of domestic violence, which increased during this period [8, 9] . Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to attain greater knowledge and training of nursing students to deal with GBV cases, and, above all, to achieve its prevention. More specifically, our aims were to describe their satisfaction with this training program, analyze their beliefs about gender violence, to understand the skills that need to be improved, and the posterior effects of a training program in GBV attention through simulated nursing video consultations in Mexican undergraduate nursing students.",

All the students were informed that GBV was the main theme of the clinical case proposed. It should be noted that they had been previously trained in the care of GBV victims before the simulated scenario and during the academic year. \u2022 Briefing: To contextualize each simulated nursing video consultation, a brief information session was given to all the students before it took place. \u2022 Simulated scenario: The clinical case was based on a potential GBV victim confined at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this situation was simulated to be as realistic as possible. During the simulated scenario, it was necessary to provide the victim with emotional support and to manage her anxiety, as she suffered from an anxiety disorder. All of these nursing interventions are relevant for the early detection and/or adequate management of these victims [34] .

This questionnaire consists of 33 items and has a five-point response scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = totally agree). Its creators obtained a satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's value = 0.920) [37] . On the other hand, the qualitative data, which were collected from an in-depth discussion of relevant topics, was facilitated using a guide consisting of three open-ended questions, which allowed conducting scripted interviews for data collection. These questions were as follows: What myths or beliefs about GBV victim attention have you detected during your performance? What skills do you consider you should improve to provide adequate care for these victims? What have you learnt after the GBV-based simulation session? These questions were obtained both from the categories of the theoretical foundation of debriefing in simulation, and from the theme of gender-based violence [31, 35] . These interviews were conducted via the telephone to all the students who agreed to participate voluntarily in the research study 2 days after the last simulated nursing video consultation. All the students were interviewed for 15 min on average by a research team member. The interviewer did not participate in any of the simulated nursing video consultations, thereby avoiding potential bias.

A content analysis of the transcribed interviews was carried out, assisted by the MAXQDA 18 software (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany). The researchers carried out the data coding, identifying categories and subcategories that emerged from the analysis process, deleting data that provided redundant information, and reviewing data again to find new emergent subcategories [28] . The categories identified at the beginning corresponded with the three open-ended questions asked. Subsequently, new subcategories emerged to describe the students' perceptions.

In this sense, the increased use of telemedicine, specifically the emergent use of video consultations [47] , has been prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, challenging all healthcare systems worldwide.

In addition, our students perceived technical skills and communication with family development as disadvantages of this training program. In contrast to previous studies in clinical simulation [20, 21] , the results obtained indicated that this simulation methodology was not adequate to develop clinical skills. However, this issue has also been indicated in real clinical situations, as healthcare professionals complain about the impossibility of performing clinical procedures, techniques, or physical examinations through video consultations [51, 52] .

Among the men, we found some testimonies of denial of learning which answered to the normalization of the problem, with the risk this implies for conducting an adequate intervention in gender violence. In addition, as an improvement, the students highlighted the increase in knowledge and training, together with an increase in awareness, with what this implies for the prevention and the toppling of prejudices. Let us remember that the corresponding protocols available to respond to gender violence indicate the need for training on GBV to adequately help these victims [14, 24] and after the results obtained, we consider that this type of training (clinical simulation) can be a great strategy to improve early detection of violence against women, care, and referral.",

Thus, there is a need for the program implemented with this technology to be continuously tested and renewed. In this sense, more research on humanization of healthcare using video consultations is needed. Another limitation was not being able to extrapolate the results to other populations, as well as the reactivity of the qualitative studies themselves. Regarding possible participation bias, the availability of video calling in virtual learning environments, as well as the context of confinement, could increase the risk for this bias. However, theoretical triangulation and triangulation of researchers were carried out during our research, avoiding these possible biases. Finally, the results obtained in our study should be treated cautiously since we address the perceptions of a specific sample. Thus, more research on this topic is recommended to further compare the perceptions on GVB.",

Specially for the men, a framework appeared, related to the denial of the previous ideas about gender-based violence, which urges us to intervene and provide more education about this serious health problem.
