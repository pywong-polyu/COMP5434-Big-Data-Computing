Unfortunately, the Web is plagued by link rot and content drift (reference rot) which causes important Web resources to disappear. Web archive collections help reduce the costly effects of reference rot by saving Web resources that chronicle important stories and events before they disappear. These collections often begin with URLs called seeds, hand-selected by experts or scraped from social media posts. The quality of social media content varies widely, therefore, we propose 1 a framework for assigning multidimensional quality scores to social media seeds for Web archive collections about stories and events. We leveraged contributions from social media research for attributing quality to social media content and users based on credibility, reputation, and influence. We combined these with additional contributions from the Web archive research that emphasizes the importance of considering geographical and temporal constraints when selecting seeds. Next, we developed the Quality Proxies (QP) framework which assigns seeds extracted from social media a quality score across 10 major dimensions:",

Most importantly, scores assigned by Quality Proxies are explainable, providing the opportunity to critique them. Our results showed that Quality Proxies resulted in the selection of quality seeds with increased precision (by \u223c0.13) when novelty is and is not prioritized. These contributions provide an explainable score applicable to rank and select quality seeds for Web archive collections and other domains that select seeds from social media.",

It is important to preserve webpages chronicling important events such as the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic because according to SalahEldeen and Nelson, 11% of Web resources shared on social media are lost after the first year of publication [37] , so we run the risk of losing a portion of our collective digital heritage if they are not preserved. The Internet Archive (IA) was founded in 1996, and since then, it has been archiving the Web by collecting and saving public webpages. This is based on a simple idea: an archived copy of a webpage may be viewed in place of a lost original copy, but this is only possible if the original webpage was saved. Archive-It is a service created by the Internet Archive where individuals and institutions create Web archive collections (e.g., Fig. 1 , right) that preserve webpages and their URLs, about a particular topic (e.g., 2020 Coronavirus). These collections begin with the selection of an initial list of URLs called seed URLs or seeds which are crawled as part of the preservation process called Web archiving. Following the occurrence of major news events, various organizations collect and save webpages about the events before they are lost due to reference rot [6, 21, 40] . For example, archivists at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) saved seed URLs [24] during the 2014 Western African Ebola Virus Outbreak. The NLM Ebola virus Web archive collection includes websites of organizations, journalists, healthcare workers, and scientists, related to the 2014 Ebola virus discourse. Similarly, archivists at Michigan State University saved webpages [22] chronicling the Flint Water Crisis story. Unfortunately, we do not have enough curators to collect seeds amidst an abundance of local and global events, primarily because it is time-consuming to collect seeds manually, and collecting quality seeds requires domain expertise about the topic, which imposes an additional burden for curators. Consequently, organizations and researchers scrape social media posts for seeds (e.g., Fig. 1 , left) to cope with the shortage of curators with domain expertise [32, 39] . While social media offers a cheap method of crowd-sourcing domain expertise, the quality of social media content varies widely. Selecting quality seed URLs from social media is challenging and has not been extensively studied in the Web archiving community, who acknowledges the importance of selecting good seeds but often pay more attention to the mechanisms of building collections. The challenge of selecting quality seeds is embodied in the idea that it is difficult to define \"quality,\" which could be subjective and is approximated with various metrics that are sensitive to relevance, popularity, or reputation.",

            "text": "Our contributions are as follows. First, Quality Proxies provide a flexible means of encoding multiple definitions of quality instead of a single definition of quality based on relevance or popularity. By providing a multi-dimensional framework, a curator can use the Quality Proxies to score and select not just popular (post popularity -{ , , \u210e}) or relevant ( ) seeds but seeds from reputable sources ( ), local news organizations ( ), popular residents of a local community ({ , }), hard-to-find seeds ({ , }), etc. This is because Quality Proxies independently behave like alphabets that can be combined in different ways to provide various policies for scoring seeds. Second, the QP framework is robust to enable the assignment of quality scores even when a subset of the metrics is absent. Third, we instantiated each QP with metrics that approximate them. Fourth, the QP framework and quality score do not function as black boxes and thus produce explainable scores. Consequently, the QP instantiations can be critiqued, extended, or replaced if the requirements of the user demands such. Fifth, we compared seeds from Twitter Micro-collections that were scored/selected with QPs against seeds collected by human experts and scraped from Google (also scored/selected with QPs). Micro-collections (e.g., threaded conversations from single/multiple users) are social media posts that contain URLs that are gathered by humans (as opposed to search engines) as a demonstration of domain expertise and editorial activity [29] . Our evaluation results showed that QPs resulted in the selection of quality seeds with increased precision (by \u223c0.13) when novelty is and is not prioritized. Our code and evaluation dataset (generated between 2014 and 2020), are publicly available [27] . The dataset is comprised of 1,552 seeds from reference collections (Google and manual selection by experts) and 2,027 seeds from 4,209 tweets.",

These mostly focus on the content (e.g., text) of the social media posts and not the URLs (seeds) found in the posts, which is the focus of the QP framework. However, we posit that the quality of a seed URL can be approximated by the quality of the social media post that embeds it, and thus the following research is relevant to the QPs. Castillo et al. [11] adopted Merriam Webster's definition of credibility (\"offering reasonable grounds for being believed\") and automatically assessed the credibility of a given set of tweets and classified them as or not credible based on features extracted from the tweet content, \u210e , and . Similarly, to help extract credible tweets from a flood of tweets triggered by a major news event such as a natural disaster, Gupta and Kumaraguru [19] identified content (frequency of unique characters, swear words etc.) and user-based features (e.g., number of followers) to train a supervised machine learning and relevance feedback system. Their analysis of tweets posted about 14 high impact events in 2011 showed that on average 30% tweets contained situational information about the event, 14% were spam, and 17% contained situational awareness information that was credible.",

Shu et al. [38] approached fake news detection by studying the pattern of how news spreads on social media from news publishers to social media posts that (re)tweet content or conversation threads between accounts. Their experiments showed that the multi-level propagation network approach for fake news detection out-performed state-of-the-art fake news detection methods by at least 1.7% with an average F1>0.84. Similarly, Bal et al. [5] proposed an attention-based deep learning model that first identified tweets about the cause or cures of cancer and subsequently labeled those that spread misinformation.",

In summary, SEs use as one method to approximate quality. This is reasonable since one can argue that popularity is the reward for quality. Ciampaglia et al. [14] argue that measures such as the citation rates of scientific papers, number of downloads of a song, or the number of social media followers are often used in the absence of measurable notions of quality. Additionally, the goal of algorithms that favor popular items \"is to identify high-quality items such as reliable news, credible information sources, and important discoveries -in short, high-quality content should rank at the top. \" However, popularity does not always mean quality since popularity could be exploited by fake reviews, social bots, and astroturf campaigns [16, 34] . In SEs, the use of popularity in ranking algorithms was alleged to reduce the novelty, a problem that could however be mitigated by diverse user queries [17] . Consequently, we argue that popularity is not sufficient as a QP and explore additional non-popularity based QPs (e.g., proximity and reputation, Section 4).

First, reputation-broad attributes reputation to the domain of a seed for having a record of publishing content about a topic (e.g., health topic), while reputation-narrow attributes reputation to the domain of a seed for having a record of publishing content focused specifically on a story (e.g., Coronavirus).

Seeds from wellknown domains are more likely to be replied to ( ), shared ( \u210e), or liked ( ) as a result of the large audience they enjoy. Sampling Table 2 , Table 3 shifts the reward system by prioritizing authors ( ) and domains ( ) geographical distant from New York. This resulted in the surfacing of authors and domains outside the United States with an international perspective. The top five authors are residents of two different countries (e.g., @ick_forPH -Philippines and @OfficialKRU -Kenya) while the organization of the Table 6 : Hurricane Harvey: top five seeds extracted by combining relevance and the scarcity QP, used to increase the diversity of news sources (e.g., texasmonthly.com, eonline.com, and espn.com) by extracting seeds from domains with the smallest representation (Hits) in the collection. Given the concerns of the spread of (mis/dis)information surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, curators could potentially impose stringent rules that restrict the sources of seeds to reputable sources. This reputable sources only selection criteria aligns with the goal of the reputation-broad QP ( ). Table 4 outlines the top five seeds when seeds are scored by their respective reputation scores. For a single seed (e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ articles/PMC1592694/) in Table 4 , the score (e.g., 0.81) was approximated by counting the number of times the seed domain (e.g., nih.gov) was cited (e.g., 46 times) in a reputation gold standard of 57 representative Wikipedia documents (one vote per document) about Disease outbreaks. Accordingly, the most dominant seeds were from world-renowned health institutions such as the World Health Organization (who.int) which was referenced 47 times, National Institute of Health (nih.gov) referenced 46 times, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov) referenced 42 times out of 57 representative Wikipedia documents about public disease outbreaks. Table 5 illustrates how the QP helps surface local news organizations, such as mlive.com, which was critical to the coverage of the Flint Water Crisis, by giving credit to seed domains from organizations near a geographical reference (e.g., Flint, Michigan). Table 6 illustrates how the QP can help increase the diversity of sources by surfacing seeds from non-conventional news media outlets such as Taylor Swift Makes \"Very Sizable Donation\" to Houston Food Bank After Hurricane Harveyeonline.com and J.J.

The final process of assessing the precision of seeds when novelty is not prioritized involved reporting the average overlap and average precision for QP combinations used to score and select top K (10 \u2264 \u2264 100) seeds. This was achieved by reporting the top 10 (out of 2,049 QP combinations) overlap scores between Twitter and reference seeds and reporting Precision at K (P@K) for the associated QP combination used to score the seeds. Selecting the top 10 overlap enables us learn the precision of seeds when overlap is at its best, albeit at the expense of novelty since the higher the overlap between Twitter and reference seeds, the lower the novelty.

The steps for assessing the precision of seeds when novelty is prioritized are the same as the previous section (when novelty is not prioritized) except for Step 5.

Web archive collections reduce this problem by preserving Web resources, and they begin with seed URLs hand-selected by experts or scraped from social media posts. While social media is a valuable source of seed URLs, the quality of social media content varies widely. In this paper, we presented the Quality Proxies framework (and instantiations) for assigning quality scores to seed URLs extracted from social media posts. A QP assigns a quality trait to a seed within a single dimension. Seeds can be assigned a quality score by selecting different combinations of Quality Proxies which map to different notions of quality across multiple dimensions such as , , geographical proximity, etc. The QP framework is flexible (enables multiple definitions of quality), robust (operates with subsets), explainable, and extensible. Our results showed that Quality Proxies resulted in the selection of quality seeds with increased precision (by \u223c0.13) when novelty is and is not prioritized.

Across all topics, for Google and Twitter seeds, the Minimum, Median, and Maximum (MMM) average overlap were 0.04, 0.32, and 1.0, respectively, when Quality Proxies were used to score seeds. Without the utilization of QP scores, the MMM average overlap were smaller, 0.04, 0.14, and 0.27, respectively. These results (e.g., Fig. 3 , right) suggest that the utilization of QP scores to rank and select seeds, helped surface seeds from a common set of domains between Twitter and Google unlike when QPs were not used. Additionally, they illustrate that different combinations of QP can result in high (e.g., ,, and , , ) or low ( , , ) overlap/precision as expressed by Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 , unsurprisingly, the QP combination , , resulted in a low P@20 because the QP was flipped, meaning relevance was penalized. Our results ( Table 9 ) also suggest that non-novelty mostly favors seeds from broadly-reputable (e.g., , ) sources that are easy-to-find (e.g., , ).Across all topics, for Twitter seeds, with Google seeds as the reference, the MMM average Precision at K (P@K) were 0.0, 0.53, and 0.99, respectively, when QP scores were used. Without the utilization of QP scores, the MMM were smaller; 0.06, 0.45, and 0.65, respectively. These results (e.g., Fig. 3, left) showed that the utilization of Quality Proxies to score, rank, and select seeds, improved the precision of seeds by 0.08 (0.53 vs 0.45).9.1.2 P@K of Twitter (and overlap with Expert) QP seeds. . Across all topics, for Expert and Twitter seeds, the MMM average overlap were 0.09, 0.67, and 1.0, respectively, when Quality Proxies were used to score and select seeds. Without the utilization of QPs, they were smaller, 0.03, 0.13, and 0.19, respectively.

Across all topics, for Twitter seeds, with Expert seeds as the reference, the MMM average precision were 0.0, 0.72, and 0.95, respectively. Further investigation of the seeds that generated 0.0 precision showed that 5/10 were actually relevant based on human judgment. This means our relevance threshold of 0.20 was set too high, and thus resulted in the production of false positive labels. The MMM of the average precision of seeds not scored with QPs were smaller (0.06/0.55/0.71) by 0.17 (0.72 vs 0.55) suggesting again (as previously seen when Google was reference) that the utilization of QP scores improved the precision of seeds.",
