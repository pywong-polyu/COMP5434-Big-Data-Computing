All content was adapted to give larger digital visibility to the brand, making the best use of the social isolation imposed to must worldwide citizens. Once the videos were published, after a period that allowed the organic and paid dissemination of the content, an analysis of the insights of the social networks was made. This data collection and subsequent analysis was helpful not only to understand the engagement of each content but also to have a global perspective of the feedback received and how the videos were perceived by the users.",

The screen division was used to show messages of strength and resistance, as shown in Fig. 3 , comparing activities that were usually done outside to the way they are now necessarily practiced at home. Subtitles were added to the video, dictating what was being said by the voice over to provide an accessibility layer to the content. The text has phrases of encouragement and allusion to physical and mental health, as well as references to freedom despite the conditions that we were living, different from what we consider normal. This aspect is also explained by the date of publication of the video, more precisely, \"O Dia da Liberdade\" (The Day of Freedom in Portugal) celebrated April 25th. Thus, the first sentence alludes not only to the times in which we currently live, but also to the times lived in the past: \"Freedom is only felt when it is taken away from us\".

From the insights of social networks, these levels were exposed, being more noticeable what type of content stood out and in what way. It should be noted that YouTube was excluded from the analysis, since its data turned out to be an outpoint compared to the others, due to the poor reach and promotion made to the platform. Data from YouTube and Facebook stories (shared automatically via Instagram) were also excluded once they had too low engagement numbers. Regarding the Protein Campaign, there were logistical problems within the launch of the product so, although the video content has been finalized, the segment has not yet been launched on social media, so it is not part of the analysis that follows. Thus, starting with the analysis of the \"Eu Escolho\" segment on Instagram, the results are similar both in the stories and in the feed. Among the three \"Eu Escolho\" videos, the \"Non-Dairy Beverages\" obtained the greatest number of likes, comments, and impressions (Fig. 9) .",

The fact that the music and the hashtag #falameunome were Brazilian enhanced the engagement of the video, counting with almost 4000 views, adding to 154 likes, 7 comments and 2 shares.
