With this aim, the objective of our study was to analyze the effect of socioeconomic inequalities, both at the individual and area of residence levels, on the probability of COVID-19 confirmed infection, and its variations across three pandemic waves. We conducted a retrospective cohort study and included data from all individuals tested for COVID-19 during the three waves of the pandemic, from March to December 2020 (357,989 individuals) in Arag\u00f3n (Spain). We studied the effect of inequalities on the risk of having a COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis after being tested using multilevel analyses with two levels of aggregation: individuals and basic healthcare area of residence (deprivation level and type of zone). Inequalities in the risk of COVID-19 confirmed infection were observed at both the individual and area level. There was a predominance of low-paid employees living in deprived areas. Workers with low salaries, unemployed and people on minimum integration income or who no longer receive the unemployment allowance, had a higher probability of COVID-19 infection than workers with salaries \u2265 \u20ac18,000 per year. Inequalities were greater in women and in the second wave. The deprivation level of areas of residence influenced the risk of COVID-19 infection, especially in the second wave. It is necessary to develop individual and area coordinated measures by areas in the control, diagnosis and treatment of the epidemic, in order to avoid an increase in the already existing inequalities.",

In relation to the type of job, low-paid workers have a higher probability of being designated as key workers, with the consequent increased risk of exposure [14] .

Other levels of aggregation, such as area of residence, are key to understand the existence of inequalities. In Spain, COVID-19 studies conducted in the area of residence [17, 18] showed that COVID-19 incidence was higher in the most deprived urban areas. In this sense, it has been described that living in disadvantaged environments is related with the existence of chronic stressors that, after a time, damage the health of its inhabitants [14] . Living in a deprived area is also associated with poorer access to health care, even in universal healthcare systems [19] , dependence on public transport or living in small places shared with other people, where the adoption of appropriate quarantine measures is not possible [20] .",

COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on this population, with more than 110,000 confirmed cases at the moment of writing this article [21] . Moreover, Arag\u00f3n has shown certain differences in the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to the rest of the Autonomous Communities in Spain. The main difference is that, unlike the rest of Spanish Autonomous Communities, with three waves, Aragon has registered four waves at the time of writing this article, with varying social and healthcare impacts, and changes in the profile of affected individuals [21] . This is explained by the fact that the second wave in Aragon started earlier than in the rest of the country, being related to the arrival of seasonal fruit pickers to certain farming areas, as well as to the presence of urban neighborhoods where the population of the most disadvantaged social class and related to these seasonal workers is concentrated. The analysis of these variations is crucial to understand the evolution of COVID-19 spread and the effect of the measures adopted.",

The clinical information included was obtained from the morbidity adjusted groups (GMA) [24] . This source of information considers all medical diagnoses available in primary healthcare and hospital discharge records (CMBD). We considered GMA information from January 2020 in order to know the health status prior to the COVID-19 diagnosis of the cohort individuals.

Different profiles of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis have been observed among the total who were tested in the three waves analyzed, with the most striking changes between wave 1 and waves 2 and 3. In wave 1, the highest frequency of confirmed cases was observed in low-income pensioners, with a high prevalence of chronic morbidities and living in BHA with low deprivation index. On the contrary, in waves 2 and 3 there was a predominance of employees with low salaries and people living in deprived BHA. This profile was similar for both sexes. Regarding multilevel analyses, there were inequalities in the risk of COVID-19 infection according to individual socioeconomic status. Taking workers with salaries \u2265\u20ac18,000 per year as reference, workers with lower salaries, the unemployed and people with minimum integration income or who no longer receive the unemployment allowance, had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. These inequalities were greater in women and in wave 2. The deprivation level of BHA of residence influenced the risk of COVID-19 infection, especially in wave 2. ",

As stated by Mar\u00ed et al. [18] , the first Spanish wave was based on hospitalized cases. This is the reason why it affected mainly the elderly and people with chronic conditions. This fact would also explain the differences in wave 1 versus wave 2 and 3 in terms of inequalities, as testing accessibility improved during the pandemic, revealing inequalities that had been hidden at the beginning [28] . Finally, the low risk of COVID-19 infection observed in people with chronic morbidities, through the waves and for both sexes, could also be related to a higher probability of testing in the profile of these patients.",

            "text": "In terms of inequalities at the individual level, employees with low salaries presented the highest risk of COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis, especially in wave 2. The second wave in Arag\u00f3n started with a series of outbreaks among seasonal workers. Seasonal agricultural workers in Spain are mainly migrants, with temporary, low-paid jobs with very poor health and hygienic conditions. These characteristics make them a particularly vulnerable group and, although special COVID protocols were implemented, they were clearly insufficient [29] . Likewise, employment status has been considered especially problematic in the COVID-19 pandemic, due to its relationship with class inequalities in income, employment conditions and safety [30] . The lockdown and the general recommendation of \"working from home\" has exacerbated the differences between those people who can do telematic work and those who cannot [31] . This is related to the fact that those low-paid workers are less likely to be in jobs where it is possible to work from home [32] , with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Finally, those individuals belonging to lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to have unstable working conditions and income. In Spain, the effect of COVID-19 on employment rates has been huge. According to the Economically Active Population Survey [33] , the number of workers in Spain decreased by more than 622,000 people during 2020. This financial uncertainty has been linked to worse mental health conditions and high stress levels, with a high likelihood of health risk behaviors [34] . Therefore, as some authors have pointed out [35] , poverty not only increases exposure to the virus, but it also reduces immunity, which can be translated into a higher risk of COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "The main strength of this study lies in the fact that we analyzed all the individuals tested for COVID-19 in a population of 1.3 million people, including data from administrative health data sources and electronic health records. In addition, we used a combination of two different variables (information used to calculate pharmacy copayment levels and the type of user of the Arag\u00f3n health service) to categorize the socioeconomic level of the individuals. This provides a better approximation to the real socioeconomic position of the individual. Also, multilevel regression models allowed us to explore the impact of inequities on COVID-19 infection at different levels. Nonetheless, some aspects must be taken into consideration. First, two of the models presented (those corresponding to women for the overall period analyzed and for men at wave 3) were \"singular\". Despite of this fact, we presented them in order to maintain comparability across models and waves, but their results must be interpreted cautiously. Second, the values of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values obtained were low, but similar to those of other health studies. We have computed other measures, such as median odds ratio, which is considered an epidemiologically more suitable option for obtaining measures of variance in logistic regression, since it does not depend statistically on the prevalence of the outcome and allows the variance to be expressed at the area level on the well-known OR scale. Therefore, it permits comparison of the magnitude of area level variations with the impact of specific factors [36] . The median odds ratio quantifies the variation between clusters (the secondlevel variation) by comparing two people from two different clusters randomly chosen. In our study, the median odds ratio quantifies differences (i.e., variance \u03c3 2 ) between deprivation quartile and zone of residence by comparing two individuals with the same covariates but from two different, randomly chosen deprivation quartiles or zones of residence. It is well known that individuals within a specific context may be more similar to each other than to individuals from a different context. Therefore, the interpretation of variance in multilevel analysis is pertinent to obtain information about a possible general effect of the context on individual outcomes [37] .",

This requires the implementation of coordinated measures in the control, diagnosis and treatment of the epidemic, in order to avoid increasing inequalities, as well as the identification of vulnerable groups that will require more economic assistance to recover from the pandemic. In this sense, at the individual level, ensuring safe employment conditions and financial protection during pandemic is crucial [38, 39] . Additionally, regarding measures at the area of residence, disease control efforts should be more intensive in those areas where the most vulnerable population lives [17] and adequate accessibility to diagnosis and treatment should be guaranteed. It will be necessary to monitor the measures implemented in order to know their impact on health inequalities in the short and medium term. Finally, we must not overlook the fact that a post-COVID scenario will probably lead to a new global economic crisis, especially if austerity measures are implemented again [14, 40] . It is crucial, therefore, to learn from mistakes of the past and promote a change of scenario, where increasing social services for the whole population becomes a reality. ",
