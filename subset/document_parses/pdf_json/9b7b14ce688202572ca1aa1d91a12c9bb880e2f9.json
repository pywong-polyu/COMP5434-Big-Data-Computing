We offer a new method to probe one aspect of that environment, headphone use. Headphones not only provide better control of sound presentation but can also \"shield\" the listener from background noise. Here we present a rapid (< 3 minute) headphone screening test based on Huggins Pitch (HP), a perceptual phenomenon that can only be detected when stimuli are presented dichotically. We validate this test using a cohort of \"Trusted\" online participants who completed the test using both headphones and loudspeakers. The same participants were also used to test an existing headphone test (AP test; Woods et al., 2017, Attention Perception Psychophysics). We demonstrate that compared to the AP test, the HP test has a higher selectivity for headphone users, rendering it as a compelling alternative to existing methods. Overall, the new HP test correctly detects 80% of headphone users and has a false positive rate of 20%.",

            "text": "For auditory experiments specifically, a major challenge involves the loss of control over the audio delivery equipment and the acoustic listening environment. However, certain information can be gleaned through specially designed screening tests. Here we focus on procedures for determining whether participants are wearing headphones (including in-ear and over-the-ear versions) or listening via loudspeakers. In many auditory experiments the use of headphones is preferred because they offer better control of sound presentation and provide some attenuation of other sounds in their environment. Woods et al. (2017) developed a now widely used test to determine whether listeners were indeed using headphones, based on dichotic presentation, under the premise that participants listening over headphones, but not those listening over loudspeakers, will be able to correctly detect an acoustic target in an intensity-discrimination task (Figure 1a ). In each trial the listener is presented with three consecutive 200-Hz sinusoidal tones and must determine which was perceptually the softest. Two of the tones are presented diotically: 1) the \"standard\" and 2) the \"target\" which is presented at -6 dB relative to the standard. The third tone (a \"foil\") has the same amplitude as the standard but is presented dichotically, such that the left and right signals have opposite polarity (antiphase, 180\u00b0). Woods and colleagues reasoned that over headphones, the standard and foil should have the same loudness, making the target clearly distinguishable as softer. In contrast, over loudspeakers the left and right signals may interact destructively before reaching the listener's ears, resulting in a weaker acoustic signal at both ears, and thus a lower loudness for the foil than at least the standard, and possibly also the target, causing participants to respond incorrectly. Woods et al. (2017) validated their test both in the lab and online. The test contained 6 trials and the threshold for passing the headphone screen was set at 5/6 correct responses. Using this threshold, in the lab 100% of participants wearing headphones passed the test, while only 18% passed when using loudspeakers. In a large number of subjects recruited online (via Amazon Mechanical Turk), only 65% passed the test, suggesting that a third of the online listeners may have actually used loudspeakers, despite instructions to use headphones. The ability to detect those cases makes this test a valuable resource.",

Secondly, the antiphase foil stimulus causes inter-aural interactions that give rise to a particular binaural percept that is not present for the other two tones, and which may be more salient over headphones. To solve the loudness discrimination task, participants must thus ignore the binaural percept and focus on the loudness dimension. This introduces an element of confusion, which might reduce performance among true headphone users. Critically, the test is not strictly one of headphone use because it is passable when listening over a single channel, e.g. if the participant is using a single earbud. Here we present and validate a different method for headphone screening that addresses these problems.",

The Huggins Pitch (HP) stimulus (Akeroyd et al., 2001; Chait et al., 2006; Cramer & Huggins, 1958; Figure 1b) is an illusory pitch phenomenon generated by presenting a white noise stimulus to one ear, and the same white noise-but with a phase shift of 180\u00b0 over a narrow frequency band-to the other ear. This results in the perception of a faint tonal object (corresponding in pitch to the center frequency of the phase-shifted band), embedded in noise. Importantly, the input to either ear alone lacks any spectral or temporal cues to pitch. The percept is only present when the two signals are dichotically combined over headphones, implicating a central mechanism that receives the inputs from the two ears, computes their invariance and differences, and translates these into a tonal object.",

First, we determined reliability of the results through bootstrapped resampling over subjects. For each of 1,000,000 resamplings we randomly selected 100 subjects with replacement from the pool of 100 subjects (balanced) and obtained a distribution of differences in the AUC for HP versus AP tests. We then determined the proportion of resamples for which the difference exceeded zero (separately for each direction of difference, i.e. HP minus AP, then AP minus HP), and accepted the result as significant if this was greater than 97.5% in either direction (two tailed; p < 0.05). The other method we used to assess statistical significance of differences of interest was with respect to a null distribution obtained through relabelling and permutation testing. For each of 1,000,000 permutations we randomly relabelled the two headphone condition scores for each of the 100 subjects as HP or AP, and similarly for the two loudspeaker scores. We then calculated the AUC at each threshold for these permuted values. This generated a null distribution of AUC differences that would be expected by chance. We then determined the proportion of scores in these null distributions that exceeded the observed difference in either direction and accepted the result as significant if this was less than 2.5% in either direction (two tailed; p < 0.05). Identical procedures were used to test for differences between the \"Both\" approach and each of the HP and AP methods. Figure 3 presents a distribution of performance across participants and test conditions. The x axis shows performance (ranging from a perfect score of 6/6 to 0/6). Chance performance (dashed black line) is at 2. The performance on the AP test with headphones (dark blue line) generally mirrored that reported in Woods et al. (2017) , except that the pass rate in the headphones condition (70%) is substantially lower than in their controlled lab setting data (100%). This is likely due to the fact that the \"Trusted\" participants in the present experiment completed the test online, thereby introducing variability associated with specific computer/auditory equipment. Performance on the AP test with loudspeakers (light blue line) was also similar to that expected based on the results of Woods et al. (2017) .

We repeated the same process for AP scores. We then compared the modelled and observed distributions and selected the value of propH that minimised the sum of squared errors across both HP and AP scores.

In experiment 3, we examined the use of a different test based on beat stimuli (BT), that can potentially be combined with the HP test to provide better selectivity for headphone user. Monaural beats are perceived when two tones of similar but nonidentical frequencies (e.g. 1800 Hz and 1830 Hz) are presented simultaneously. The listener perceives fluctuations or beats produced by amplitude modulation whose rate is equal to the difference of the two frequencies (Oster, 1973) . A related binaural phenomenon occurs when the tones are presented to each ear separately. This \"binauaral beat\" is perceived due to central interference between the two frequencies. However, due to the phase locking limits on binaural processing, binaural beats are only perceived for frequencies lower than 1000-1500 Hz (Licklider et al., 1950; Perrott & Nelson, 1969; Rutschmann & Rubinstein, 1965) . In addition, binaural beats are only salient for relatively small frequency differences (< 10 Hz).

In the other pair (\"target\"; Figure 6b ), the tones are presented dichotically, one to each ear. Because the frequencies are above the phase locking limit, and because the frequency difference is higher than the typical limit of binaural beats, the stimulus should not lead to a binaural beat percept and will therefore be heard as \"smooth\" over headphones. However, over loudspeakers the left and right signals interact before reaching the listener's ears to create a monaural beat percept, making the target indistinguishable from the standards. This test is similar to the AP test in that it relies on channel interference over loudspeakers and therefore suffers from analogous constraints, including being affected by the specific positions of the loudspeakers relative to the listener. Furthermore, similarly to AP, it is possible to pass the BT test when listening over a single channel (e.g. when listening through a single ear bud), so that it cannot be used as a headphone screening test on its own. Nonetheless, we reasoned that the robust percept evoked by the beat stimuli may make the BT test, when used in combination with the HP test, a more sensitive test of headphone use than that demonstrated in Experiment 1 (HP+AP).",

Importantly, the test is designed to distinguish between participants who are using stereo headphones (i.e. where the left and right channels are independently delivered to the left and right ear, respectively) from those listening without headphones (where typically the left and right channels will interact in some way before reaching the listeners' ears). Though the screen is not designed to be sensitive to other aspects of the listener's environment per se, headphone users may nonetheless fail the test if the quality of the equipment is very low or if their environment is particularly noisy.",

We have made our implementation openly available and ready for use via JavaScript and Gorilla (gorilla.sc).

Lower thresholds will result in a similar d' but will pass a larger proportion of loudspeaker users.",

Failing the test over headphones could be attributable to poor quality equipment (e.g. crosstalk between left and right channels), background noise, or hearing impairment. Conversely, those subjects who pass with loudspeakers might be optimally spatially positioned (e.g. equally between the two loudspeakers for HP). In situations where it is important to reach a high level of certainty that the participant is using headphones (e.g., where stimuli involve a dichotic presentation or a spatial manipulation) the HP test can be combined with the BT test (experiment 3). This will yield a false positive rate of ~7% .",

The black solid line illustrates the performance observed in the \"Unknown\" group in the HP (left) and AP (right) tests. The red/blue lines and stacked bars illustrate the result of modelling to determine the likely proportion of subjects in the \"Unknown\" group who actually used headphones. The stacked bars indicate the product of the proportion of participants in the \"Trusted\" group at each performance level with the relevant coefficient from the best fitting model (0.6 for headphones and 0.4 for loudspeakers, fixed across HP and AP). The distribution of observed performance in the \"Unknown\" group matched the modelled data well for both HP and AP tests. This indicates that only roughly 60% of participants in the \"Unknown\"",

When presented over loudspeakers this is expected to result in destructive acoustic interference, and thus reduced loudness, causing the foil to be mistaken for the target and the listener to fail the test. Over headphones there is no such interference, and thus no reduction of loudness and the listener should correctly detect the target, passing the test. However,the test is susceptible to certain loudspeaker configurations and the presence of binaural interactionOur results reveal that the HP test has a better diagnostic ability than the AP test to classify between headphones and loudspeakers. We also show that the classification performance can be",
