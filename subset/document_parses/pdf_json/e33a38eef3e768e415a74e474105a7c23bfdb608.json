Although previous research reported how analysis was conducted, the findings were typically focused on individual analysis or based on a small number of professionals in specific geographic regions. We conducted an online international survey of 279 UX practitioners on their practices and challenges while collaborating during data analysis. We found that UX practitioners were often under time pressure to conduct analysis and adopted three modes of collaboration: independently analyze different portions of the data and then collaborate, collaboratively analyze the session with little or no independent analysis, and independently analyze the same set of data and then collaborate. Moreover, most encountered challenges related to lack of resources, disagreements with colleagues regarding usability problems, and difficulty merging analysis from multiple practitioners. We discuss design implications to better support collaborative data analysis.",

Despite being effective and useful, analyzing usability test sessions can be tedious, challenging, and time-consuming [12, 25, 29, 81] . When analyzing usability test sessions, user experience (UX) practitioners often need to attend to multiple behavioral signals in both the visual and audio channels of the recordings and conduct several tasks (e.g., look at user's actions, listen to user's verbalizations, and write their own annotations) simultaneously [12] . Furthermore, UX practitioners working in industry often face time pressure to deliver their analysis results [25, 29, 64] . Consequently, it is not uncommon that UX practitioners might miss important usability problems or misinterpret them [26, 38] .",

By bringing different perspectives from multiple practitioners together, collaboration could help overcome the \"evaluator effect\" [38]-a common phenomenon where different UX practitioners may uncover or interpret usability problems and their severity levels differently. Unfortunately, fewer than 30% of UX practitioners have a chance to collaborate with others to analyze the same usability test session due to practical constraints, such as limited resources [29] . Even if they do collaborate, they often have to put together an ad-hoc set of tools to support their analysis of test sessions and collaboration [25, 64] .",

            "text": "To better understand how UX practitioners work in practice, researchers conducted various studies in the past decades [25, 30, 64, 81, 93] . While informative, these studies were typically based on small data samples (e.g., interview with eleven UX practitioners [30] ) or focused on the usage of specific methods, such as thinkaloud protocols [25, 64] . For the few studies that did focus on general practices of UX practitioners (e.g., [29] ), they offered limited insights into collaboration practices and purposes around data analysis among UX practitioners. Furthermore, almost all previous studies were conducted a decade ago except Fan et al. 's study [25] , which was focused on think-aloud protocol usage instead of general practices. In the most recent decade, new technology breakthroughs, such as deep learning and virtual reality (VR), have spurred a variety of AI-enabled products (e.g., smart speakers) and VR applications. These emerging products enable new interaction methods and provide novel user experiences, which might require UX practitioners to adapt their analysis and collaboration practices. Indeed, new UX analytical platforms (e.g., UserTesting.com [105] and FullStory [32] ) and data-informed design and analytical tools (e.g., MixPanel [70] ), have also emerged in the meantime. As a result, there is a lack of understanding of how UX practitioners collaborate when analyzing usability test sessions in today's social and technological contexts. In addition, it is important to gain an understanding of the practices used during independent analysis as it lays the foundation for collaboration [30] . We take a first step to address this gap by exploring the following research questions (RQs):",

To improve system usability, UX practitioners must identify and address usability problems that users may encounter. Examples of usability evaluations include observations, cognitive walkthroughs, interviews, focus groups, heuristic evaluations, and usability testing [79] . The most frequently employed method for detecting such problems is through usability testing [25] . This is due to strong evidence that usability testing is effective in a wide variety of usage scenarios [81] . While usability testing has been shown to be effective and useful across various methods and domains, conducting sound usability testing is challenging. In addition to the challenges practitioners face during data collection [22, 81] , they need to use a variety of tools to record the session for later analysis. All participants in an exploratory study on usability testing reported they video-record the session and take notes during the session [30] . Similarly, in other surveys of UX practitioners, 100% [29] and 89% [25] of the participants take observations notes, 73% [29] and 77% [25] of the participants video-record the session, and 70% [25] conduct posttask interviews.",

On the other hand, the User Action Framework (UAF) [2] and the Structured Usability Problems EXtraction (SUPEX) framework [15] describe formal standards for analysis. What's more, templates [14, 54] and guidelines [11] have been developed for organizing problem descriptions, prioritizing the problems (also known as the severity rating [58] ), and deriving potential interventions. However, in practice, the analysis is often unstructured, incomplete with no identification of causes or solutions [81] , and is informal and lack rigor [30] .

In contrast, online tools (e.g. UserTesting [105] and FullStory [32] ) allow for more flexible collaboration, where multiple UX practitioners can gain access to the same session recordings. However, such tools provide limited data analysis capabilities, which are comprised of session playback, note-taking, and tagging, and practitioners still need to communicate through an external platform to discuss their analysis results. Consequently, UX practitioners often have to put together a generic set of tools on an ad hoc basis that are not designed specifically for their needs [25, 64] , such as screen recorders, eye-trackers, prototyping tools, web analytics tools, spreadsheets, text editors, and presentation tools [29] , to collaboratively capture and analyze various sources of data.",

The majority of survey questions were fixed response items, such as single choice, multiple-choice (i.e. select-all-that-apply), and Likert-scale ratings, which were required. To supplement the fixed responses and gain a deeper understanding, there were eight optional free text questions that sought explanations for why practitioners chose certain responses. These questions also asked about what are the greatest challenges practitioners encounter, how they handle disagreements with colleagues, and how their collaboration could be better supported. For the free response questions, the average length of the answers was three sentences. They were first coded independently by two authors before meeting to discuss and group them into themes. The questions in sections (2) and (3) regarding collaboration practices and challenges were not shown to respondents who answered \"1 person (just myself)\" for the size of UX team since those questions were not applicable to their work experiences.",

Among the 24 respondents who chose \"Other\", over half of them (59%) reported that the frequency varies depending on the schedule of the projects and that some projects may need multiple rounds of testing. shows that 41% of the respondents only had 1-3 days to analyze data collected from usability testing sessions and 29% of them had 4-6 days. Since the majority (70%) of the respondents needed to complete their analysis within one week of the usability testing session, there is significant time pressure on most UX practitioners. Indeed, a similar proportion (66%) of respondents \"somewhat agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that they found it timeconsuming to conduct data analysis (Md=4, IQR 2 =1). Figure  3 shows that the majority (90%) of the respondents reviewed written notes from sessions (either their own or their team members' observational notes), 66% of them reviewed video recordings, and 58% of them reviewed audio recordings. 11% of the respondents reported other resources including automated transcripts, qualitative data from interviews, testing software (e.g., UserTesting [104] , User-Zoom [106] ), heatmaps and polls, and periodic industry reports. This is in line with the findings of a 2020 international survey showing that 89% of respondents reviewed observation notes and 77% reviewed session recordings (both audio and video) [25] . However, an earlier interview study from 2010 found that the majority of respondents relied mainly on their notes and memory for analysis instead of doing a full analysis of recordings [30] . This suggests that more UX practitioners use recordings more often nowadays than before, which could be due to recent advancements in technology and remote usability testing. However, written notes remain the most used method, highlighting the importance in the quality of the original notes from sessions. Specifically, as shown in Figure 5 , Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics [77] were the most popular among the respondents with the majority (82%) of them using it when detecting and describing problems. Over half (56%) of them used Norman's 6 design principles [82] . Furthermore, respondents also reported using other UX evaluation guidelines and standards, including the International Usability and UX Qualification Board [107] , the MeCUE questionnaire for UX assessment [68] , the Gestalt Principles of Design [51] , heuristics for mobile computing [6] , and the ISO 9241-110 Standard for Ergonomics of Human-System Interaction [43] .",

Since assigning severity classifications was suggested by prior work [30] , our findings showed the different factors that respondents considered while doing so (see Figure 6 ). Specifically, the majority (87%) of them considered \"the impact of the issue\", followed by \"the frequency of the issue\" (66%), \"the persistence of the issue\" (43%), and \"the time needed to fix the issue\" (42%). Moreover, a small percentage of respondents (5%) reported also considering the potential cost to fix the issue, the scope of the issue, and whether it had any relation to previously uncovered problems. Figure 7 , were to identify more usability problems (74%), generate more redesign suggestions (62%), and improve reliability of results (47%). This finding suggests that respondents were aware that collaboration could increase the completeness and reliability of their analysis, which would be beneficial to address the \"evaluator effect\" [38] . In this survey, improving reliability of results was only the thirdfrequently chosen option which is in contrast to prior findings of this being the top driver for collaboration [29] . One explanation for this could stem from the format of the question. In the prior survey, it was a single-choice question where 47% of respondents selected improving reliability of results. In this survey, it was selected by over half (57%) of the respondents. This result suggests that most of respondents did pay attention to the reliability of their analysis. However, it was less frequently considered as compared to more result-oriented purposes such as increasing the quantity of usability problems and redesign suggestions. Additionally, respondents provided free-form responses in terms of their purposes for collaboration, and the top responses were to \"save money\", \"consolidate paper work\", and \"ensure everyone's voices are heard.\" The awareness of the importance of collaboration was demonstrated by respondents who mentioned that different perspectives are critical to identifying as many issues and potential solutions as possible.",

This phenomenon was echoed in the free-form responses as many respondents mentioned that even though they worked on a team with other UX practitioners, only one person was responsible for analyzing all usability testing sessions for a single product in the company. Another vital factor to successful collaboration is having effective communication between colleagues [48, 98] . Thus, we asked respondents what type of communication they use most often to discuss work-related content with their colleagues. Almost threequarters (73%) of the respondents chose synchronous methods such as meetings or phone calls, whereas 27% use asynchronous methods such as emails. Indeed, their choice of communication method is in line with their preference as the majority (68%) selected \"somewhat agree\" or \"strongly agree\" to the prompt \"I prefer to talk to my colleague directly rather than type through chat\" (Md=4, IQR=2). In their explanations, respondents mentioned that \"there is always a need for synchronous communication in between asynchronous discussions\" and that \"it's hard to put together a presentation or align on findings without real-time discussions. \" 4.2.2 Platforms that Support Collaboration. The respondents used a total of 31 different platforms for collaboration while conducting data analysis of user sessions, which were grouped into various categories (see Figure 9 ). The majority (78%) of respondents used online document management platforms which included Google Workspace (e.g., Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms) [33] and Microsoft SharePoint [66] . The next popular category was online user research and testing tools, which was used by 39% of the respondents. Examples include UserTesting [105] , UserZoom [106] , Useberry [103] . These platforms provide functionalities like note-taking and marking events on the video progress bar on top of basic usability test support such as screen recording, survey administration, and results exporting. Respondents often used combinations of these top two categories. For example, one respondent described that they used Google Slides and Sheets to collaborate during data analysis since it was fast and real-time, but still found it easier to share a link to the UserTesting study when reviewing videos and participant data.",

Some respondents provided additional strategies in the free responses, which includes approaching management or a supervisor with both sets of findings and asking them to make the decision. One respondent stated that they rarely disagreed on a usability problem, but rather the priority of a problem. When this was the case, they \"refer[red] to the main goal of the study and then reflect[ed] on what the client would find most helpful and actionable.\" Another response was creating an anonymous board to list down the issues and then voting on it at the next group meeting. In the case where a designer was part of the discussion, one respondent mentioned they would let the designer of the test product make the final call. Interestingly, one respondent wrote \"have manager make decision to go with my advice over the others\", which suggests that they would try to convince their manager to listen to their advice first. If they are under time pressure and still can't reach an agreement on a certain issue, respondents mentioned two strategies in particular: (1) asking the leader to make the final decision, and (2) presenting their results with an explanation that covers both interpretations since \"most likely one person isn't wrong, it is simply that the interpretations are based on different viewpoints. \" The responses for the greatest challenges that UX practitioners have encountered when collaborating on data analysis were analyzed and grouped into the following themes:",

However, its advantages and disadvantages are not well-understood as there is a gap in the literature on conducting analysis in groups [29] . Law and Hvannberg studied the process of consolidating usability problems individually vs. collaboratively in a within-subjects design and revealed a tendency towards collaborative settings [56] . However, a follow-up between-subjects study found no significant differences between practitioners in the two settings, suggesting that the consolidation process does not benefit from positive group decision effects [40] . It is worth noting that participants from both studies were novice practitioners (i.e. students with limited or no background knowledge in UX), so their results might not be generalizable to practitioners with more experience. Indeed, our results ( Table 2 ) also suggest that years of UX experience may affect their collaboration practices. As a result, the benefits of group analysis remain unclear for UX practitioners who have a variety of experience. In order to preserve the reliability of the results, it is critical to investigate best-practice guidelines and procedures for group analysis.",

However, it remains an open question of what are the advantages and disadvantages of the three collaboration modes in terms of improving completeness and reliability of usability testing results. Although the third mode was recommended by prior work [29] , such mode has higher time costs compared to the other two modes. The other modes are at odds with recommended practices where evaluation performance should be based on thoroughness, validity, and reliability [30, 37] with the aim of minimizing the \"evaluator effect\" [38] . However, in reality, the time and resources of a particular company should also be taken into account. As previously mentioned, the lack of time and resources is a key challenge that respondents faced, which was echoed by previous surveys of UX practitioners in industry [12, 25, 29, 81] . Thus, one possible advantage for group analysis could be to save time as more people may lead to faster identification of usability problems and having in-situ discussions could avoid the need of a second meeting to merge the results from different practitioners. Due to the trade-offs between time and reliability, one important question is to help UX practitioners determine when they have conducted sufficient analysis (e.g. at what point can they stop). For example, Nielsen and Landauer presented a model showing the proportion of usability problems in an interface found using various numbers of practitioners [78] . The proportion increased as the number of practitioners increased, thus the use of at least three practitioners was recommended [78] . However, this model was based on independent analysis of the same data from multiple practitioners. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate methods to extend this model for analysis conducted in groups. Future research should explore ways of collaboration that achieve a balance between validity and efficiency in UX data analysis, which is a key challenge that UX practitioners face [25] .",

The variety in the types of tools provides evidence that respondents have to switch between different platforms. This may cause overhead in trying to review data, conduct analysis, and then communicate and merge these findings with colleagues. During this process, there could be many difficulties such as storing and keeping track of separate recordings and analysis documents. These data storage and access issues were mentioned as a key challenge by respondents. Respondents also had mixed feelings about the use of many tools.

One of the main improvements that respondents suggested was \"having one spot to consolidate the findings with coworkers. \" Building a platform that allows UX practitioners to review usability test sessions, conduct data analysis, and communicate with their team would also mitigate the overhead of needing to use multiple tools. Numerous commercial tools have been developed to support UX practitioners with conducting usability test and reviewing test session data, including UserZoom [106] and FullStory [32] . While these tools allow multiple team members to access the same recordings, their data analysis capabilities are mostly limited to session playback, note-taking, and mouse point clouds. Thus, it is important to design tools to meet the unique analysis needs that generic tools (e.g., Google Sheets [33] ) do not support well, such as adding heuristics, which was a common practice among 76% of the respondents and have been shown to be effective in enabling practitioners to uncover more usability problems [55] . In addition, such tools should consider to visualize subtle behavioral patterns that might indicate UX problems [24, 27] , such as the sentiment of users' words and their abnormal tones. What's more, such tools should also integrate collaboration features (e.g. dimension coverage of data [88, 115] , radar views [35] , synchronized annotation timeline [90] ) to support UX practitioners to discuss and consolidate their individual analyses while still having access to both the raw session recordings and their analysis notes in one integrated environment. For example, collaborative data analysis can benefit from displaying data dimension coverage of history [88, 89] or highlights of previously investigated data in a graph visualization [115] . In addition, radar views provide awareness of where one is working relative to their remote collaborators in a virtually shared workspace [35] . A synchronized annotation timeline supports collaborative video annotations by distributing work and sharing results simultaneously [90] . Collaborative writing tools such as Google Docs [33] have implemented variations of these features, such as showing edit history and collaborators' cursor locations to increase workspace awareness. However, more research is warranted to explore how to integrate these features into future tools that support analysis of usability testing data like video recordings and meet the unique needs of UX practitioners.",

An explanation for the observed preference could be because voice/video calls are considered as richer according to Media Richness Theory since it contains auditory (and possibly visual) signals that facilitate faster connections [17] . In contrast, text-based media are considered less personal but more efficient when used during task-oriented conversations [111] . Another point to consider is that voice/video calls can only support synchronous collaboration whereas instant messaging supports both synchronous and asynchronous (where one can reply at a later time) [63] . Future designers should consider these trade-offs when developing an integrated system for collaboration and data analysis as different forms of communication have been shown to affect patterns of interaction between collaborators and effectiveness of work outcome [63, 83] .",

Higher awareness of the time-consuming nature of analysis and the importance of reliability could potentially lead to more thorough and robust analysis results. This is supported by prior studies showing that novice practitioners, who had not received training on user interface design principles, performed considerably worse than UX specialists and much worse than double specialists, i.e. those having expertise in user interface design and the domain of the software system [76] . In relation to collaboration, survey respondents mentioned the lack of confidence in their colleagues' capabilities to analyze data as a key challenge.

There has been an emergence of start-up companies, which frequently guide their software development using agile practices [86] . These companies are typically limited in human resources, leading to difficulties in hiring experienced UX practitioners and inadequate usability testing practices [52] . One survey found that the top hindrance to UX practices in start-up companies was the short turnaround time for analysis [94] , which is a challenge echoed by our survey results. Furthermore, 32% of UX practitioners in start-up companies also experienced \"communication and collaboration gaps between UX and other professionals\" [94] . Thus, how to make UX practices more lightweight to match agile practices and timeboxed sprints without compromising validity remains a key challenge [25, 41, 94] .",

Furthermore, traditional questionnaires like the System Usability Scale (SUS) [59] were insufficient for VR headsets, which require additional considerations like motion sickness [1] . Thus, researchers have developed custom scales for measuring the UX of VR headsets [114] . In term of analysis resources, our survey showed that the majority of the respondents still used Nielsen's usability heuristics [77] and Norman's design principles [82] . However, they also modified them to cater to their specific products. The need to update heuristics for new technology is evident in recent studies that utilized custom usability principles to evaluate smartwatches [13] . Recently, researchers also proposed a set of adapted heuristics for conversational agents [53] and for VR products [75] , based on testing and feedback by experts. Future work should develop sets of reusable heuristics that apply to new categories of products.",

However, these methods were primarily based on textual interaction logs, which are only available for specific types of interfaces. Depending on click and scroll maps limits their applicability to products without network connectivity such as coffee makers. In contrast, we found that respondents mainly used written notes, audio, and video recordings when conducting data analysis. Similar to how UX practitioners analyzed users' behaviors in recordings, researchers developed an AI that could infer when the participant encountered a problem during a think-aloud test session by analyzing the subtle speech patterns in their verbalizations [23] . While promising, such method needs improvements in accuracy and explainability to enhance users' trust [60] . Thus, to better help UX practitioners without disrupting their current workflow, AI systems might be designed to play an assistive role in analyzing the data and resources that UX practitioners are currently using including session recordings, written notes, and transcripts.",

Recent research has suggested that users exhibit subtle speech patterns such as abnormal pitch and speech rate when encountering usability problems [24] . Two-thirds of our respondents reviewed video recordings, which echoes the findings of prior work showing that UX practitioners use multi-modal information from both the acoustic and visual channels [12] . When they attend to many signals simultaneously, they may not notice these subtle speech patterns. Thus, there is an opportunity for AI to assist practitioners in detecting and highlighting subtle speech patterns. In fact, recently, researchers began to design AI-assisted UX analysis tools, such as VisTA [26] and CoUX [97] , to help UX practitioners with analyzing usability test sessions by presenting automatically-extracted problem-indicators to them. Although VisTA demonstrated the promise of human-AI collaboration for UX evaluation, it was designed to assist individual practitioners. As a collaborative tool, CoUX was evaluated with pairs of UX practitioners, but the AI assistance was limited to video analysis [97] . Thus, future work should investigate ways to integrate AI to support the human-human collaboration process for UX evaluation. For example, one particular challenge experienced by over two-thirds of the respondents was merging analysis from multiple evaluators. The AI system could possibly act as a tie-breaker which is a strategy employed by almost one-quarter of the respondents. Another possible role for the AI system is to learn from conversations between practitioners and recognize disagreements to make appropriate suggestions. Thus, more research is warranted to determine whether and to what extent should AI be involved in the analysis process, since many human collaborators face challenges in understanding AI's capabilities or envisioning what it might be [113] .",

For example, analytical platforms like UserTesting [105] and PlaybookUX [87] offer sentiment analysis which detects whether the participant is expressing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Furthermore, UserTesting also provides \"smart tags\" where predefined situations such as confusion, dislike, or suggestion are automatically labelled [105] . There are also data-informed analytical tools like MixPanel [70] which provides correlation analysis on retention data, and UXTesting [108] which automatically detects participants' emotions. Since these features are relatively new, their effectiveness is yet to be validated. Moreover, the UX community may benefit from integrating more subtle behavioral patterns (e.g., verbalization and speech indicators of UX problems [24, 27] ) into existing tools.",

Thus, the findings are expected to provide a reasonably informative perspective of practices and challenges in collaboration during the data analysis phase among UX practitioners around the world. However, the number of responses from different continents was mismatched. While the majority of the data came from North America, Asia, and Europe, relatively fewer responses were from Latin America, Africa, and Oceania. Thus, one should be cautious about generalizing the findings to UX practitioners. Indeed, our research calls for more work to investigate UX practices and challenges in under-represented regions of our survey, such as countries in Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. Furthermore, studying and comparing the practices and challenges of UX practitioners in different countries could inform the UX community about the impact of culture on UX data analysis and collaboration, which will further help the community design customized collaborative UX data analysis strategies and tools.",

As articles have shown how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed product users [73] , future work can also explore its impacts on UX practitioners. Furthermore, we focused on collaboration between UX practitioners within the same company and found correlations of analysis behaviors based on the in-house UX team size. However, cross-company collaboration is also a common practice for companies who cannot afford to hire expertise and maintain testing facilities [21] or have products that are sold in different countries or languages [72] . Prior research suggested that cross-company collaboration happened in the form of outsourcing participant recruitment [72] , small subtasks such as transcription [8] , or complete evaluations to usability testing services [21, 71] . These collaboration modes included tasks that were not directly related to data analysis, which was the focus of our research, but may lead to other challenges such as language barriers, sub-quality reports, and deviations from expected practices [21, 71, 72] . Thus, future work should further explore the state of cross-company collaborations in recent years with a focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected these practices.",

Furthermore, there is research on how UX is related to eudaimonia, in which users gain meaning from need fulfillment [65] and how perceived beauty and aesthetics impact UX [102, 109] . Based on these aspects, future work should investigate how UX practitioners collect and analyze data for evaluating the overall product quality.

To better understand the rich reasons behind the phenomena that our study revealed, more qualitative research, such as in-depth interviews with UX practitioners from different industrial sections in different continents, should be conducted. In particular, it is worth investigating different standards and principles that UX practitioners use for problem identification and merging and their considerations for choosing one over the other. Furthermore, as disagreements tend to occur during collaboration, it is valuable to gain a deeper understanding of their strategies for managing disagreements, in particular regarding whether there is a problem and what the severity level should be. Last but not least, as our study revealed that they would have a discussion with other practitioners to resolve disagreements, it would be interesting to explore the content of their conversations when discussing disagreements to better understand the nature of the disagreements and how they manage to gain a consensus.",

Based on the responses of 279 participants who had varying UX experience and worked in different geographic locations, we found that UX practitioners collaborate to primarily identify more usability problems and generate redesign suggestions, and to improve reliability of results to a lesser extent. We identified three modes of collaboration: independently analyze different portions of the data with little or no overlap and then collaborate (i.e., divide and conquer), collaboratively analyze the session with little or no independent analysis (i.e., group analysis), and independently analyze the same set of data and then collaborate. Although the third mode was recommended by the literature, it was least adopted among our respondents because it was perceived to be more time-consuming than the other two. Moreover, most of the respondents encountered challenges related to lack of time as 70% needed to complete analysis within 1 week, impacting their choice of collaboration modes. These findings highlight an opportunity to address the trade-offs between efficiency and validity of analysis results. What's more, respondents also experienced disagreements with colleagues regarding usability problems and difficulty in merging analysis from multiple practitioners. Our survey findings could potentially inform UX practitioners about how their colleagues perceive collaboration during data analysis. In addition, our findings reveal opportunities for developing better methods and tools to facilitate collaboration during analysis, for example, developing an integrated platform to support both analysis and collaboration in one place, establishing group analysis procedures, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, and integrating team members with various skill levels.",
