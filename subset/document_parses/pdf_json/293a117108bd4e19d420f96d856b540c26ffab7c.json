As instructors, we found it straightforward and worthwhile to discuss and support students' own plans, feasibility estimates, and findings. Supporting openinquiries was thus found to be easier than to attempting over video call to guarantee that students were correctly taking all the pre-defined steps and reaching the end-goals of more structured or \"cookbook\" style inquiries. Trouble-shooting coding problems over video call was actually found to be much easier when not having to crowd three or more people around a single laptop screen and code snippets could be written on our own keyboards and shared over the video call's chat interface. Further, with the experiments built up in students' residences, the video calling saved them considerable time and problems incurred by breaking down, transporting, and again setting up equipment in the university building to demonstrate the setup to their peers and instructor. On the other hand, some types of instructor support were definitely less efficient via video call (e.g. helping to trouble-shoot a problem with electrical wiring or conveying ideas through a quick sketch). Students quickly learned the golden rule that any professional experimental scientist knows: if part of a setup is working, don't touch it! Finally, a fourth factor contributing to resiliency that relates to AUC's curriculum structure is the offering of the Maker Lab as a stand-alone course over an extended four month timeframe. Since students' projects often required acquisition of new sensors or supplies, it was lucky that a single open-inquiry project was stretched out over 5.5 weeks to leave sufficient time for initial delivery of materials. Several projects also required taking measurements over many hours or days (which the Arduinos were set up to perform autonomously), meaning that iterative improvements on experimental methods required significant time. Finally, it is hypothesized that students benefit from having time to sleep on or allow ideas to ferment, especially in the process of conducting empirical research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Factors contributing to pandemic-resiliency"}, {"text": "While here in the Netherlands the pandemic control measures are now being refined and scaled back, there is still uncertainty about whether autumn semester courses can get back to normal, and if so, whether all students will be able to participate on campus.

Of the 14 projects chosen by students this spring, half could have been served by a well-stocked initial set of tools, leaving lots of room for student choice and creativity.

Besides adapting materials for different programs and levels, we are looking into possibilities for enabling more peer interactions and for including teaching assistants (TA's) in the teaching team.
