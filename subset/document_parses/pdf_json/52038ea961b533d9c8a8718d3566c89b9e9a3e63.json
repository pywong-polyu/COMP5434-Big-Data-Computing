            "text": "The aim of this study was to compare the elimination of Bordetella pertussis clinical isolates, representing different genotypes in relation to alleles encoding virulence factors (MLST-multi-locus antigen sequence typing), MLVA type (multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis) and PFGE group (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) from the lungs of naive mice or mice were immunised with the commercial whole-cell pertussis vaccine, the acellular pertussis vaccine and the experimental whole-cell pertussis vaccine. Molecular data indicate that the resurgence of pertussis in populations with high vaccine coverage is associated with genomic adaptation of B. pertussis, to vaccine selection pressure. Pertactin-negative B. pertussis isolates were suspected to contribute to the reduced vaccine effectiveness. It was shown that one of the isolates used is PRN deficient. The mice were intranasally challenged with bacterial suspension containing approximately 5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU/ml B. pertussis. The immunogenicity of the tested vaccines against PT (pertussis toxin), PRN (pertactin), FHA (filamentous haemagglutinin) and FIM (fimbriae types 2 and 3) was examined. The commercial whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines induced an immunity effective at eliminating the genetically different B. pertussis isolates from the lungs. However, the elimination of the PRN-deficient isolate from the lungs of mice vaccinated with commercial vaccines was delayed as compared to the PRN ( +) isolate, suggesting phenotypic differences with the circulating isolates and vaccine strains. The most effective vaccine was the experimental vaccine with the composition identical to that of the strains used for infection.",

            "text": "Pertussis (whooping cough), caused by Bordetella pertussis, is an endemic infectious disease in all countries [1] . Globally, it is estimated that in 2014, there were 24.1 million pertussis cases and 160,700 deaths from pertussis in children under 5 years of age, with periodic epidemics occurring every 2-5 years [2] . Two types of pertussis vaccines are available: whole-cell vaccines based on killed B. pertussis organisms and acellular pertussis vaccines which include up to 5 highly purified pertussis antigens [always pertussis toxin (PT), and a different combination of pertactin (PRN), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM2 and FIM3, respectively). Due to the concerns of potential neurological side effects of the whole-cell vaccine, a less reactogenic acellular vaccine was produced in the 1980s and subsequently replaced the whole-cell pertussis vaccine in developed countries. Despite that the pertussis immunoprevention has been available for over 60 years, whooping cough is still recognised as a major public health problem. At present, the incidence of pertussis is much lower than in the pre-vaccination era, but a steady increase has been observed in countries with high vaccination coverage since the mid-1990s. In Poland, within 10 years after the introduction of pertussis vaccination in 1960, the incidence of whooping cough decreased in all age groups [3] . In the years 1982-1992, an almost 100% decrease in the average incidence of pertussis in relation to the period 1950-1960 was achieved [4] . The increase in pertussis incidence recorded in 1997 was a surprise because the pertussis vaccination programme with the national DTwP [diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whole-cell) vaccine] has been used consistently and the average vaccination level did not change and exceeded 95% [4] . Currently, Poland is the only EU country still using the same locally produced DTwP vaccine in children up to 2 years old [5] . Children have been continuously immunised with three primary doses and one booster dose at 2, 3-4, 5-6, and 16-18 months of age [6] . It is estimated that more than half of Polish parents choose acellular pertussis vaccines for primary vaccination today [6] . A booster dose of DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (acellular) vaccine]) for 6-year-old children was introduced in 2004 [5, 6] . In 2016, the number of pertussis cases in Poland was the highest in the last 20 years; according to the Department of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases of NIPH-NIH, in 2016, there were 6856 pertussis cases (incidence 17.84), despite the fact that about 97.2% of children received primary pertussis vaccination [7]-that is why the dTap [diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (acellular) vaccine, reduced diphtheria and pertussis antigens content] was introduced in 2016 and is given as obligatory to adolescents at the age of 14. At present, it is recommended for the booster vaccination to be given at 19 years of age, to pregnant women and to adults every 10 years. In recent years, many developed countries have reported a resurgence of pertussis despite the high vaccine coverage [8] [9] [10] . Several factors have been suggested to explain this phenomenon; the switch from wP to aP vaccines is associated with waning vaccineinduced immunity and pathogen adaptation to vaccination due to the appearance of genetically and antigenically different clinical strains from those in the vaccines' composition [1, 11, 12] .",

Isolates currently circulating in developed countries carry novel, non-vaccine-type alleles coding virulence factors, such as pertussis toxin S1 subunit (ptxA) and pertactin (prn). It has been shown that variation in these antigens affects vaccine efficacy in a mouse model [13] [14] [15] [16] . Current isolates worldwide mainly are of the ptxP3 type [14, 17] . Another mechanism of B. pertussis adaptation is related to increased production of pertussis toxin (Ptx) (about 1.6 times) by isolates carrying ptxP3 allele [14] . It was shown that isolates currently circulating in developed countries express Fim3 + and are part of PFGE group IV [18] . In countries (among others France, Italy, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, Norway, England) that have been using acellular vaccines for years, Prn-deficient isolates predominate [17] [18] [19] .",

The active sites were blocked with a 5% skim milk solution (AppliChem, Germany). Secondary reference standard mouse relative potency and immunogenicity (Sanofi Pasteur, France) was used to generate the antibody standard curve. Twofold standard dilutions in the range of 1/800-1/204800 for plates coated with FHA, PRN and FIM antigens and dilutions in the range of 1/1600-1/204800 for plates coated with PT antigen were used. The positive test control (mouse positive control serum; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) and the negative test control (serum from the control mice) were used to control the correctness of the test. Sera taken from mice were not pooled and each serum was tested separately. The plate was incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. After washing, secondary antibody (Goat antimouse IgG (whole molecule) peroxidase conjugate; Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added to each well. The following conjugate dilutions were used: 1/6000 dilution for PT and FIM antigens, 1/1000 dilution for PRN antigen and 1/2000 dilution for FHA antigen.

Characterising the antibody response to this pathogen is essential towards identifying potential correlates of protection. Evaluating pertussis vaccine-induced protection poses a problem as correlates of protection against pertussis have not been defined. A correlates of protection can be defined as an (immune) marker that statistically correlates with vaccine efficacy but is not necessarily mechanistically responsible for protection. For pertussis, a correlates of protection would ideally correlate with the inability of the bacterium to colonise the airways and would hence correlate with protection from transmission of this pathogen [26] . A number of sero-epidemiological studies [27] have shown convincingly that antibodies to B. pertussis antigens can be detected in the population irrespective of the local immunisation schedule, indicating that the circulation of B. pertussis in populations is maintained regardless of current vaccination programmes.",

In the present study, it was shown that only the acellular vaccine induced the production of anti-PT IgG antibodies. Pertussis toxin is secreted after infection and probably the killed bacteria do not have it-that is why the wP vaccines do not activate antibodies against it.

The pertussis isolates was performed in 5-week-old Balb/c control mice or in mice vaccinated with the commercial aP vaccine, commercial wP vaccine and experimental wP vaccine. Bacterial lung colonisation was measured at the indicated time points after challenge, and the results are expressed as the mean CFU per ml of lung (log10 transformed). The bacterial loads in the lungs were measured and are presented as means and standard deviations of CFU. ANOVA followed by Sheffe ' s multiple comparison test was used to analyse the statistical significance between groups. Only significant differences between control group and immunised groups are indicated * (p < 0.05). A * No statistical differences was observed between colonisation different types of B.pertussis isolates in control group and immunised groups. B * 7 days after challenge bacterial lung colonisation in mice vaccinated wp-exp after intranasal challenge with PRN \u2212 isolate, PRN + isolate or mixture of both was significantly lower compared to unvaccinated mice. C * 14 days after challenge the level of colonisation with PRN \u2212 isolate, PRN + isolate or mixture of both in mice vaccinated wP-exp and wP vaccines was significantly lower compared to unvaccinated mice. B.pertussis PRN + isolate and mixture of both isolates were eliminated at a statistically significant level compared to the control in lungs mice vaccinated with aP vaccine also. D * 21 days after challenge, statistically significant lung clearance was observed in vaccinated animals compared to the control mice importance of anti-FHA antibody responses in reducing the risk of whooping cough is ambiguous [34] . In our study, none of the tested vaccines induced a significantly higher level of anti-FHA IgG compared to the others, despite there were differences in the elimination of bacteria from the lungs. This may be consistent with the assumption that FHA is the least important antigen providing protection against illness in children [35] . This observation was also confirmed by in vivo studies in which it was observed that anti-FHA antibodies alone did not protect mice against intracerebral administration of B. pertussis strain [36, 37] and that they played the smallest role in protection against nasal infection [32] . In the presence of anti-PRN, anti-PT and anti-FIM antibodies, the presence of anti-FHA antibodies did not contribute to increased protection [38] . Passive administration of high titre anti-PT and anti-PRN sera provided effective protection against B. pertussis infection in experimental animals, and the level of protection was higher than when only high titre of anti-FHA sera was passively administered [346. The lack of widespread occurrence of non-FHA-producing strains in the era of acellular vaccines suggests that this is not critical for pathogenicity of the B. pertussis virulence factor. Previous studies by another team suggest that FHA should not be included in a new formulation of vaccines [32] .",

            "text": "In vitro, antibodies to FIM2 and FIM3 inhibited bacterial attachment to cells [39] and in a tracheal organ culture model, mutant strains lacking FIM had reduced adherence compared with a wild-type strain [40] . In mice, antibodies against FIM2/3 increased protection and reduced colonisation after intranasal challenge [41] . FIM antibodies may also booster the immunity to pertussis by promoting opsonophagocytosis [39] . These study observed that level of anti-FIM IgG antibodies 30 days after vaccination for all three vaccines tested was statistically comparable. As measured after 60 and 120 days, anti-FIM IgG values for the commercial wP vaccine were significantly higher than for the other two vaccines. The differences in immunogenicity of the two tested whole-cell vaccines from FIM antigen may be due to differences in the strains used for their production. FIM 2 and FIM 3 production is not stable; the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends, therefore, that both Fim2-and Fim3-producing strains should be used for the preparation of whole-cell vaccines [42] which may be associated with the expression of fimbriae, depending on the growing conditions of the strains. However, strains that express predominantly FIM2 can also express FIM3 during infection [43] . Given the involvement of the fimbriae in protection, fimbrial production must be sufficiently stable in the live B. pertussis vaccine strains to induce immune responses to these antigens. The stability of the Fim2 and Fim3 production deserves particular attention since phase variation from one serotype to another has been described [44] . The largest decrease in anti-FIM IgG levels was observed between 60 and 120 days for aP vaccine. In another study, it was showed that in mice immunised with pertussis vaccines, the level of antibodies against PT, FHA and PRN antigens increases very slowly, but then decreases rapidly and is undetectable after 6-9 months from vaccination [45] .",

            "text": "Especially relevant are the results of two independent field trials, which revealed a correlation between pertactin antibodies and clinical protection [32, 46] . The results of our study showed that whole-cell vaccines induced significantly higher levels of anti-PRN IgG as compared to the acellular vaccine. The hypothesis may be drawn that PRN plays an important role in bacterial invasion, and anti-PRN antibodies are crucial in the first line of defence because differences in the rate of elimination of the PRN (\u2212) strain were observed compared to the PRN ( +) strain after immunisation with the commercial vaccines tested. This may be correlated with the production of protective anti-PRN antibodies. Mice that possess anti-PRN antibodies are highly resistant to nasal infection with a virulent B. pertussis strain [47] . A study on the efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccine carried out in Germany showed that with high anti-pertactin antibody values, other antibody titers were not important in preventing disease [48] . There have been reports suggesting that mainly anti-PT and anti-PRN antibodies are necessary to provide protection [34, 49] . In trials in Erlangen and in Sweden, it was found that antibody to PRN and FIM were most important and antibody to FHA did not contribute to efficacy. They also both noted a curious finding, if you had high values to PT and FIM, you were less well protected than if you had a low value to PT [35] . More recent studies by Weiss et al. suggest that this could be a blocking effect of excessive PT on PRN and FIM [50] . In other studies conducted by King et al. [45] has proven that presence of high concentrations of multiple antigens may minimise the effect of variation in pertactin. Some data suggested that PT is a critical vaccine component, but too much may be detrimental [32] . Since PRN is an outer membrane protein, contrary to PT that is secreted proteins, it could be more sensitive to herd immunity [19] . Improvement of the acellular pertussis vaccines may be worthwhile.",

In addition to the quantity, the quality and functionality of antibodies should also be evaluated in future [53] . One of the functions of antibodies is to facilitate the uptake of bacteria via Fc-\u03b3-receptormediated opsonophagocytosis by, for example, neutrophils which play an important role in clearing B. pertussis during infection and, thus, in preventing colonisation [52] . During an infection with B. pertussis, neutrophils infiltrate the lung where they are important for the clearance of this respiratory pathogen [52] . Some authors propose antibody-mediated opsonophagocytosis of B. pertussis as a possible correlates of protection against pertussis [26, 53] . Anti-pertactin antibodies were found to be crucial for B. pertussis phagocytosis [54] . The study conducted by Hellwig et al. [54] provides a rational basis for the observed correlation between protection against pertussis and antibodies to PRN and shows that such antibodies are crucial for phagocytosis of B. pertussis by immune cells. After depletion of antibodies to PRN, the ability of the serum to induce phagocytosis was nearly absent. It remains unknown whether specific antibodies generated upon infection and vaccination are similar in functionality. Interestingly, FHA-and PT-specific antibodies did not show an increased avidity in the recovered pertussis patients suggesting that perhaps high antibody avidity for these antigens is not necessarily important for opsonophagocytosis of B. pertussis [54] .",

Using the murine intranasal challenge model, it was shown that immunisation of mice prior to infection with PRN-deficient isolates with wP and aP vaccines lead to an early clearance of bacteria from the respiratory tract of mice as compared to the non-vaccinated animals, but the antigen-specific whole-cell vaccine (wPexp) was characterised by the best efficacy and the rate of elimination of B. pertussis strains. In the analysis carried out in the study, different strain elimination rates were observed, depending on the type of vaccine used for immunisation. Our studies have shown that immunisation with aP vaccine provides protection, but clearance of B. pertussis from the lungs is slower in comparison to mice immunised with the wP vaccine. It has been shown that the elimination of bacteria from the lungs of mice immunised with aP vaccine begins between 7 and 14 days after infection, and in the case of mice immunised with wP vaccine, this elimination occurs approximately 7 days earlier. This is confirmed by the studies performed in the mouse model [57] and baboon model [58] that shown that only whole-cell vaccines reduce the colonisation with B. pertussis. This fact most probably confirms that vaccines with whole-cell and acellular pertussis component induce different effector mechanisms of the immune response [58] [59] [60] .",

            "text": "Isolates with vaccine-type pertactin were found in lower frequencies in vaccinated children compared to non-vaccinated children, suggesting that variation in pertactin affects vaccine efficacy [61] . Our study did not show that the PRN (-) strain had a better ability to adapt in the nonvaccinated mice. The rate of multiplication of each strain used for infection, together and separately, in the lungs of control mice was very similar. The elimination rate of the strain mixture was comparable to that of each strain administered to mice separately. The results reported by another research team also showed that the lack of pertactin production did not affect the increased virulence of B. pertussis [62] . B. pertussis strains not producing pertactin are increasingly isolated from people with pertussis disease symptoms [18, 63, 64] . There are reports proving that PRN (\u2212) strains do not cause stronger clinical symptoms in infants less than 6 months old, from whom they were isolated [17, 19] . However, there are also reports demonstrating that PRN (\u2212) isolates show greater virulence in populations immunised with aP vaccines [65] . This observation has also been suggested recently by US researchers [40] . PRN-producing strains more often infected younger patients, and in the course of the disease, the acute phase was more common. Patients who received at least one dose of acellular pertussis vaccine were twice as likely to be infected with PRN (\u2212) strain compared to unvaccinated ones. It is suggested that the loss of PRN antigen production in these strains may bring a selective advantage by reducing the severity of clinical symptoms, which prolonged the diagnosis and extends the transmission time of bacteria to other susceptible persons [66, 67] . King et al. [45] and Bottero et al. [68] presented evidence to suggest that polymorphism of ptxA or prn can affect vaccine efficacy for clinical isolates. In contrast, Boursaux-Eude et al. showed that commercial vaccines in France were effective against circulating B. pertussis isolates, regardless of ptxA and prn alleles [69] . Our data suggest that the current commercial vaccines used in this study would be effective against circulating strains without regard to prn alleles. However, if antigen mismatch shortens the duration of immunity, strains with antigens that do not match those in the vaccine may play an important role in increasing pertussis cases, especially in adolescent and adult populations whose immunity to pertussis has waned [69] .",

B. pertussis produces many virulence factors, and clinical isolates may differ in other properties. That is the reason it will be important to perform not only genomic studies but also proteomic studies on the isolates to analyse at which level are located the differences between them. Overall, it seems most probable that no single correlate of protection exists and that antibodies to many antigens in differing amounts, probably in conjunction with cell-mediated immunity, confer protection against symptomatic reinfection of B.pertussis [71] .",
