For more than 30 years, the rights of young people to have a voice and be listened to have been established in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 1 In many respects, we have only recently begun to understand the importance, relevance, and power of their voices to change the discourse and trajectory of public opinion and policy. The response to the climate crisis, accelerated by the passion and influence of children and youth, is perhaps the most recent and profound example.",

How do we maximise diversity and equity in the voices we capture? How do we ensure children and young people have access to information they require to make certain their voices are informed? How do we actively collaborate with children to guarantee their voices are heard by policymakers? What are the ethical standards that must be maintained when engaging children in systems evaluation, research and policy generation? How do we safeguard their privacy and protect them from any potential repercussions and harm? What is the role of child health professionals and paediatric journals in securing and disseminating the voices of children? How should children and young people be compensated for the time and expertise required to be engaged in global dialogue, discourse, and systems and policy development? How do we integrate the voices of children and young people into the context of all we do to advance child health and well-being? What formal structures are required in the academic and public health sectors to engage the genuine voices of children?",

The collection will contain a mixture of original research, including research carried out by young people, editorials, commentaries and critical reviews of the published literature on young voices.",

Publishing manuscripts as open access ensures vital health information is available to all in all professional and community sectors. Enabling young people to describe their experiences in relation to health and well-being is essential and requires the support and involvement of mentors to cultivate their capacity to do so. BMJPO has established a Young Voices section-we encourage you to nurture the voices of young people by helping them publish in this venue. 2 3 No profession bears witness to the impact of local, national, and global systems and policies on child health and well-being more than health professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic is just one among many global issues that negatively impact children. In some respects, we are engaged in a rehearsal for the next assault on children and childhood-including the climate crisis and globalisation. The time is now to learn how to involve children and youth in all aspects of current and future responses to the global health challenges they face.",
